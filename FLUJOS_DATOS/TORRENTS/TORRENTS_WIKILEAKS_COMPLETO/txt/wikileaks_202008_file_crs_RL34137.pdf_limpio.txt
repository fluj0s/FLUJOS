resources science and industry division august 21 2007 abstract this report assesses the position of national oil companies and how their evolving strength may aﬀect the availability of supply in the oil market and hence oil security the report also examines the eﬀects of national oil company expansion on the major private international oil companies as well as how these companies might diﬀer in motivation and results policy options to deal with the rise of national oil companies by the countries without them are also

is likely to be taken to mean the major private international oil companies largely based in europe or america however while some of those companies are indeed among the largest in the world by many important measures majority of the largest oil companies are stateowned national oil companies by conventional definitions national oil companies hold the majority of petroleum reserves and produce the majority of the worlds supply of crude oil since national oi l companies generally hold exclusive rights to exploration and development of petroleum resources within the home country they also can decide on the degree to which they require participation by private companies in those activities the national oil companies typically do not operate strictly on the basis of market principles because of their close ties to the national government in many cases their objectives might include wealth redistribution jobs creation general economic development economic and energy security and vertical integration although these objectives might be desirable from the point of view of the nations government they are unlikely to be equivalent to the maximization of shareholder value the stated objective of the private international oil companies differing objectives might be considered to be important only if they lead to different characteristics and outcomes which is the case for the national oil companies many of these companies have been found to be inefficient with relatively low investment rates they tend to exploit oil reserves for shortterm gain possibly damaging oil fields reducing the longer term production potential some also have limited access to international capital markets because of poor business practices and lack of transparency in their business deals high oil prices since late 2003 have masked the effect of some of these characteristics in the flow of oil revenues however if the price of oil moderates the potential supply constraint related to the inefficient operations of the national oil companies may be destabilizing factor in the world oil market wide variety of policy directions can be taken to mitigate the potential challenge posed by the dominance of national oil companies demand management policy can reduce the us dependence on imports the us government can use its political influence to try to encourage nations not to use national oil companies to forw ard the aims of the government but to follow commercial practices to maximize revenue flows an expanded supply of oil could be encouraged as condition for trade and aid agreements in some cases finally promoting international trade and recognized commercial practices could be encouraged

largest us oil companies abandoned their multibillion dollar investments in the heavy oil deposits of the orinoco basin in venezuela this action follow ed the breakdown of negotiations between the companies and the government of president hugo chavez and petroleos venezuela pdv the venezuelan national oil company four other international oil companies including total sa from france statoil from norway bp from great britain and chevron from the united states accepted agreements that raised the pdv share in their orinoco projects from approximately 40 to controlling interest of about 78 1 conocophillips especially was adversely affected by the decision conocophillips recorded 11 billion barrels of proved reserves from its venezuelan ventures this amounted to approximately 10 of the companys total reserve holdings and its production from venezuela amounted to 4 of its total crude oil production although conocophillips continues to negotiate compensation for its holdings the company took 45 billion dollar writeoff against secondquarter 2007 earnings the company was seen as less likely to be able to meet its reserve replacement targets and the price of its shares fell on the stock market 2 on the venezuelan side pdv expanded its reserve and production position and its strength in the international oil market3 venezuela traditionally has large share of crude oil imports into the united states this oil flow is now more directly under the control of the venezuelan government which may or may not allow the flow of crude oil to follow economic market forces this report assesses the position of national oil companies and how their evolving strength may affect the availability of supply in the oil market and hence oil security the report also examines the effects of national oil company expansion on the major private international oil companies as well as how these companies might differ in motivation and results policy options to deal with the rise of

companies can be accomplished using number of different criteria in the oil industry based as it is on current production to generate current earnings and on reserve positions to ensure the future viability of the enterprise several standards need to be applied to assess the evolving nature of the companies in the industry additionally investment in the form of exploration and development expenditures serves as link between the present and the future ensuring an ongoing continuity for the company so that reserves are not unduly depleted by current activities consumers also have an interest in the structure and size of firms and their activities if the current production level as well as the proved reserve position of the companies or industry is declining if current production

exxonmobil is ranked fourteenth bp seventeenth chevron nineteenth conocophillips twentythird and shell is ranked twenty fifth in 2006 these five firms hold only 38 of world liquid reserves and their major holdings are in the united states and canada in contrast the top ten firms listed in table 2 hold 806 of the total world liquid reserves the top ten companies in 2006 in table 2 have an average reserve to production ratio of 78 years with inoc the iraqi national oil company the highest at 173 years and lukoil privately held russian company the lowest at 24 years 6 the five large international oil companies have reserve to production ratios of 11 years these values suggest that the ten largest reserve holding companies largely state owned will be major forces in the world oil market about seven times as long as the five major international oil companies in market where reserve position is likely to translate into production and pricing power the state oil companies are in dominant position and the international oil companies are likely to continue to play lesser role it is also not likely that the reserve positions of the companies will change in favor of the internat ional oil companies in the future as nations establish their own national oil companies territ ories open for exploration and development by private companies may diminish as suggested by the example of venezuela cited in the opening section of this report even in countries where there are partnerships between the private oil companies and national oil companies if there is any revision of ownership shares it is likely to be in favor of the national oil companies two factors affect this observation oilproducing nations seem to be displaying an ever more nationalistic attitude toward their natural resource endowments and the national oil companies are viewed as custodians of that resource if there is opposition to us foreign policy objectives or if there is more general negative reaction to the spread of global markets and private industry nationalization of oil resources and transference to the national oil company is likely one of the most direct ways to make political statement given the tight balance between global supply and demand this statement can be made with little or cost in lost revenues table 3 shows the ten leading producing companies in the world companys ability to produce crude oil depends on access to oil deposits but it also depends on access to modern technology the private international oil companies generally have access to stateoftheart technologies which are less easily available to some other fi rms gaining access to the best technology for exploration development and production is one of the key motivations oil producing nations have for entering productionsharing agreements with the private international oil companies 6 the reserve to production ratio is measure of how long current levels of production can be maintained from existing reserves httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34137g22g145g142g561g20g152g149g142g561g152g143g561g16g138g157g146g152g151

have the goal of maximizing shareholder value the management of the company may accomplish that goal through organizing production so that profit is made in the current time frame as well as in the future they also might make investment decisions to take advantage of opportunities to raise the companys rate of return they also have the motivation to achieve productive efficiency to hold down costs to enhance the profitability of any given revenue level this activity is thought to benefit consumers by assuring that physical shortages are avoided and that the good is available at the lowest price consistent with demand and supply factors in the oil industry maximization of shareholder value is taken to mean that the value of oil resources should be maximized through mana ging production exploration and development activities to assure functioning market to ensure the longterm viability of the company reserve replacement is necessary for the company to grow it must have the ability to expand production and sales to meet demand growth in newly developing economies as well as in developed areas technical efficiency in all parts of the supply chain leads to cost minimization as well as improvements in product performance and environmental integrity national oil companies do not necessarily follow the shareholder value maximization model alone since these companies are totally or majority owned by their national governments maximizing the value of the company might have to compete with other governmentally mandated objectives although all national oil companies respond to

stributing the oil wealth of the nation to the society in general this redistribution can be accomplished through fuel subsidies employment policies and social welfare programs amon g other programs fuel subsidies are common reducing the price of gasoline in venezuela to 011 per gallon 021 per gallon in iran and 064 per gallon in saudi arabia7 in contrast gasoline had an average price of 577 in norway one of the higher observed price levels in the world while subsidized fuel prices reduce energy prices to the general population enhance industrial and transportation resources and protect the domestic economy from the damaging effects of volatile world petroleum prices the downside is that they are very expensive in terms of lost potential revenues for the national oil company the artificially low price encourages demand growth corruption inefficient use of fuels and even arbitragebased smuggling schemes the expanded use of fuels domestically leads to reduced exports and tightens supply in world markets leading to higher prices in the oilimporting 7 these values represent the average gasoline prices over th period 2002 to 2004 and compare to an average price of 210 in

viewed as jobs programs for the domestic economy table 4 shows that private oil companies have varying levels of employment for each one million barrels of oil equivalent produced but the degree of variation is higher for the national oil companies the data shows saudi aramco with the lowest ratio of employees to oil produced the low ratio may be the result of efficiency within the organization the large quantities of oil produced or it may reflect the small population and overall wealth of saudi arabia that minimizes the need for jobs program the two chinese national oil companies cnooc and petrochina are near the lowest and also the highest in terms of number of employees per barrel of oil equivalent produced this outcome is likely the result of different operational requirements or

as tool to achieve foreign policy goals leading to direct alliances as well as national oil company to national oil company ties that can pave the way to political re lationships oil is strategic commodity in the world economy and its production and use can foster strategic relationships for example saudi aramcos decision to raise oil output in the wake of the iraqi invasion of kuwait and chinas oil based relationships with iran venezuela russia and others can be viewed as partly politically motivated perhaps the most recent and assertive example of national oil companies being tied to the geopolitical aims of their government is pdvsa and president chavez and his bolivarian revolution 10 some believe that chavez sees the united states and its promotion of democracy and global markets as threat to his revolution to counter what chavez sees as us expansionism he is using the promise of economic aid joint energy projects and favorable oil pricing to gain influence in latin america the caribbean and other areas pdvsa plays an important role in these policies recently the chavez government has completed deals with ecquador bolivia argentina nicaragua and others 11 iran has used the possibility of oil cutoffs to the west as threat and possible deterrent in the controversy over its pursuit of nuclear weapons russia has interrupted natural gas deliveries to europe as

among the objectives of the national oil companies security on the demand side means not allowing one consumer to become critical to the national oil company for example pdvsa has recently tried to

roots in upstream operations some are striving to achieve vertical integration 12 on an economic level vertical integration allows the national oil company to capture the value added from producing and selling petroleum products pdvsa s acquisition of citgo in the united states provided refining as well as retail marketing outlets for venezuelan oil in addition demand security was enhanced through gaining position in the large us gasoline market in other cases national oil companies might be able to gain access to markets otherwise not available to them the national oil companies may also be able to achieve greater degree of diversification and mitigation of risk through vertical integration oil prices have tended to be volatile profits may accrue to different parts of the supply

geological factors enter into the process on the input side and may not be controllable by management in the normal sense however comparative econometric productivity studies within the oil industry

themselves but for the world oil market as whole if the most inefficient firms nd to be in control of the majority of the worlds exploitable oil reserves and the market demand is projected to expand by approximately 30 by 2030 it would seem more likely that the expansion could be accomplished by more efficient firms14 however those firms the international oil companies hold shrinking fraction of the worlds reserve base g11g151g159g142g156g157g150g142g151g157g561 because of the demands of the government and national treasuries national oil companies may have shorter time horizon for operational decisions than the international oil companies the national oil companies may have an undue focus on earning current revenues and maximizing current production this could result in mismana gement of existing fields which allows smaller recovery percentage than theoretically possible and neglect of exploration and development in the longer term damage to the world oil market could be enhanced by the dominant position the national oil companies have in terms of potential reserve access for consumers the national oil companies focus on current production may work to keep the world price of oil relatively lower in the near term however if the national oil companies ignore investment in exploration and development it could mean higher oil prices in the future some estimates of the needs for oil industry investment total 16 trillion over 30 years 15 if the national oil companies do not undertake investment on this scale and if they and their governments exclude the international oil companies from developing reserves in their countries the world oil market could be supplyconstrained in the future and prices might be higher than if higher investment took place

limited access international oil companies have to potential oil deposits or the preferred access to potential reserves that national oil companies are likely to enjoy however even with the leading companies being privately held some critics of the industry contend that these companies are not investing enough especially in light of their record profit levels since 2004 the private international oil companies ability to make the investments needed to meet projected demand for oil is limited by number of factors the international oil companies may not have access to what they consider to be favorable prospects beyond the restricted access to potential reserve areas around the world it may be that large companies have expertise in developing and operating large fields type of oil deposit

unlikely to yield huge discoveries in the future the highestranked international oil company is conocophillips at number 30 having replaced 96 of produced reserves while exxonmobil replaced only 43 bp

production levels in the future only part of the problem may be due to the limitations of the industry however it is likely from geological viewpoint that the largest oil reserve pools have already

infrastructure to meet the needs of projected demand the oil sector is expected to account for 3 trillion of the total 17 to accomplish this level of investment it is likely that the industry will need to draw on many sources of financial capital since 2004 the international oil companies have had recordsetting profit performances this financial strength allows them substantial latitude in accessing financial resources because their own cash reserves have risen internal financing has become viable option because of their strong balance sheet and income statements it is likely that they can access world capital markets for financing on relatively favorable terms18 national oil companies are in weaker position with respect to the capital markets their relative inefficiency in turning oil into revenues as discussed in this report makes them less likely to receive favorable terms from international capital markets their obligations to the national treasury to finance domestic welfare programs along with the below market price sale of their products at home make it less likely that they will have access to enough retained internal earnings to finance optimal levels of exploration and development of oil resources to the extent that such companies experience shortage of financial capital it could result in higher prices and the potential for physical shortages in the future if national oil companies do gain widespread access to the world financial markets this might not only spur upstream capital investment but might also provide benefits to the companies and their interface with the global market compliance with international accounting standards more business transparency as well as certain basic standards of corporate responsibility might result from

an energy security i ssue the growing strength of the national oil companies implies at least in relative nse the diminished importance of the private international oil companies this dynamic could transform the reaction of the market to demand and supply signals since major thread of current policy toward oil is let the market take care of it change in the way the market works might call for significant adjustments in the policies of oilconsuming nations some of the policy options presented below have been extensively debated in the past as features of broadly based energy strategies while others are controversial and would likely be difficult to implement others such as the creation of us national oil company are extremely unlikely to be considered while the world oil market continues to function as viable market g6g142g150g138g151g141g556g4g138g156g142g141g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 the success of many economic policy measures designed to alter market outcomes requires consideration of likely actions by both those who demand the product as well as those who supply it as result if oilimporting countries believe that the growing importance of national oil companies are potential threat to their ability to gain access to desired supplies not only should importers seek to change the behavior of national oil companies but they might also change their own energy strategies the key elements in such demandside policy are well known they include diversifying the supply base so that potential political problems are less likely to result in economic damage through reduced oil supply in addition conservation that reduces demand or at least reduces the growth in demand perhaps through taxes on imported oil or petroleum products for example might serve to reduce the potential influence that oilbased actions have on the domestic economy g21g158g153g153g149g162g556g4g138g156g142g141g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 oil importing nations might also use their political influence to try to encourage the national oil companies and their governments to alter their behaviors the companies might be encouraged to improve their efficiency and respond to market signals more like privately owned firms if the national oil companies find need to access international capital markets more regularly this result might be achieved as natural result of exposure to the requirements of lenders on more political level governments might try to encourage the governments of national oil companies to reduce their intervention in the operational decisions of the companies this might be difficult to achieve in countries like venezuela under the chavez government but progress likely can be made in more democratic environments the clearest example might be statoil and norway which operates largely on market principles 19 this section of the report is based on policy directions explored at the conference the changing role of national oil companies in

important goal of us energy strategy is to enhance the development of oil and natural gas resources around the world to expand market supply there are many ways that goal can be achieved many of the appropriate policy measures are those that the us government has used in other contexts trade agreements both bilateral and multilateral can facilitate us economic goals by allowing foreign nations preferential access to the lucrative us market in return for progress in areas of interest to the united states in this case expanded oil supply even though oil production can make nation relatively rich in many cases virtually all sectors of the economy remain poor except for oil such nations might still require some form of foreign assistance to attain their development goals in some cases poor nation just beginning to develop an oil industry might need more traditional forms of aid in all cases whether through foreign aid requirements or through access to trading opportunities and international financial markets national oil companies and their governments could be encouraged to use standard business and accounting practices and employ transparent decisionmaking processes

establishing us national oil company such company depending on how its mission might be defined could act as both an offset to other national oil companies or act in cooperation with other nations national oil companies when such opportunities might arise potential benefits to this approach might be more direct linkage between oil issues and the interests of the us government for example while an oilproducing na tions government might be willing to try to coerce private oil companies they might be less wi lling to do so to company directly tied to the us government us national oil company might also respond more directly to energy policy directions established by the government some might believe that the profit motive prevents the international oil companies from providing us consumers with lowcost petroleum products these concerns might be allayed if us national oil company were established however number of factors argues against the establishment of such company in times of governmental conflicts host governments might be more willing to expropriate or oust us national oil company than private international oil company such an action might make larger political statement and also not disrupt the actual working of the host nations oil sector as much deals between national oil companies are not always successful examples of outcomes that failed to meet expectations include china and iran and china and saudi arabia perhaps the most persuasive reason for not creating us national oil company is that the private international oil companies are very effective in terms of efficiency and productivity in finding and developing new oil resources their performance is especially impressive in light of growing difficulties in gaining access to areas of the world where potential discoveries may be made if the us government established national oil company it would send signal that might 20 this alternative was analyzed by amy myers jaffe the changing

result unlikely to enhance us energy security g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 as the world oil market changes its structure to include the growing importance of national oil companies recognition of the likely consequences of this trend is an important first step in helping to secure oil supply if the national oil companies hold the title to ever greater portions of actual and potential oil reserves production and exploration and development activities and if they are relatively less capable of utilizing those resources oil supplies are likely to be relatively constrained in the future given projections of demand growth of about 50 by 2030 constrained supply might imply sharply rising oil prices venezuela provides an early example of how the political influence of government can affect the supply of oil disturb existing market partne rships both with companies and with the united states and forward the interests of us competitors the private international oil companies are unlikely to be able to counter national oil compan ies to preserve their own profitseeking interests as well as those of the us market which requires adequate physical supply at moderate prices various policy directions are available to counter the effects of national oil companies but the recognition that potential problem exists as well as longterm commitment to any chosen policy direction will likely be needed to minimize the threat to us oil market stability and energy security
