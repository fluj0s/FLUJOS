is moving to replace current television technology with new technically superior format generally referred to as digital television dtv as part of this trans ition congress has acted to move television broadcasters out of radio spectrum currently used for the old analog technology the vacated radio frequencies are now scheduled for release in accordance with provisions of the deficit reduction ac t of 2005 pl 109171 which sets february 2009 date for the release of the spectrum auctions for commercial uses of the spectrum are scheduled to begin on january 24 2008 about 10 billion of the auction proceeds has been designated for specific purposes by the act on july 31 2007 the federal communications commission fcc announced the rules for the auction of airwaves now us ed for analog tv broadcasting 700 mhz because the decisions the fcc makes in tting up an auction of spectrum licenses can shape the bidding process and the eventual outcome of the auction the fcc typically finds itself under pressure to set requirements that favor specific interests or policy goals the preparations for the upcoming au ction have been par ticularly fraught with controversy the propagation characteristics of the spectrum are such that it is considered ideal for wireless broadband for this and other reasons control of this spectrum is sought not only by the incumbent wireless companies wishing to expand their capacity but also by companies eager to apply nextgeneration technologies for new business models the auction rules in troduce two innovative business models for spectrum management and assignment that re present departures from past policy one model requires shared network to accomm odate both public safe ty and commercial users in partnership the other innovativ model designates spectrum licenses for network that could be managed to accept any suitable wireless device the decisions the fcc has made for this auction nd by extension for spectrum policy have framed new debate bout access to the airwaves the nature of competition in the wireless industry and wirele ss access to the internet httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22218crs2 1 radio frequency spectrum is measured by the frequency of cycles per second or hertz hz standard abbreviations for measuring frequencies include khz kilohertz or thousands of hertz mhz megahertz for example the 700 mhz band includes radio frequencies from 698806 mhz and refers to those channels that are desi gnated for technologies that transmit signals at speeds within or near 700 million cycles per second 2 congressional budget office cost estimate s 1932 deficit reduction act of 2005 january 27 2006 p 22 at httpwww cbogovshowdoccfmindex7028sequence0deficit reduction act broadcasters are currently transmitting analog tv signals using radio frequency channels that will be vacated as they switch to digital broadcast technology the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 title iii requires broadcasters to end analog broadcasting by february 17 2009 freeing the spectrum usually referred to as the 700 mhz band1 for other uses some of the channels have been assigned for public safety communications licenses for few channels have been auctioned and the remaining licenses are slated for auction later than january 2008 the congressional budget office cbo has assigned value of about 125 billion for the auction2 many industry estimates are significantly higher funds from the auction will in itially be deposited in fund created for that purpose the digital television transition nd public safety fund the national telecommunications and information administration ntia is responsible for managing the fund and for di sbursements which to tal approximately 10 billion the deficit reducti on act allocates 7363 billion of auction proceeds toward closing the budget deficit to be paid to the us treasury on september 30 2009 nine programs authorized by the act to receive au ction funds are program that would expend up to 1500 million on coupons for households towa rd the purchase of tv set top boxes that can convert digital broadcast signals fo r display on analog sets grant program of up to 1000 million for public safety agencies to deploy systems on 700 mhz spectrum they will receive as part of the transition payments of up to 30 million toward the cost of temporary digital transmission equipment for broadcasters serving the metropolitan new york area payments of up to 10 milli on to help lowpower television stations convert fullpower broadcast signals from di gital to analog program funded up to 65 million to reimburse lowpower television stations in rural areas for upgrading equipment up to 106 million to implement unified na tional alert system and 50 million for tsunami warning and coastal vulnerability program contributions totaling more than 435 million for national 911 improvement program and up to 30 million in support of the essential air service program for some of these programs the ntia is authorized to borrow money from the treasury to be repaid from auction proceeds spectrum license allocation and auction one of the first steps the fcc takes in prep aring for an auction is to develop band plan that allocates the spectrum for sp ecific purposes for example highspeed transmission which benefits from bandwidth of at least 10 mhz per license and to decide the number of licenses and the geographic coverage for each license for examplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22218crs3 3 the different area descriptions used by the fcc in allocating licenses are discussed in crs report rl31764 spectrum management auctions 4 fcc wt docket 9686 the full decision was released august 10 2007 the auction notice was released october 5 2007

the auction the size of the bandwidth has an imp act on the type of service it can be used for and the geographic coverage of licenses can be used to encourage for example small companies seeking local license or large companies seeking to expand their national coverage by acquiring regiona l or national license the fcc also establishes criteria for participation in the auction for example re quiring documentation of financial resources it also draws up service rules which are statement of the regulators expectations for how the license will be used service rules usually include timetable for putting the license to use that is the rules impose deadlines for the licenseholder to build out network so that specified number of peopl or areas are served the fcc makes its proposed plans known through series of tices which are made available for public comment before announcing its decision about the auction in final report and order the rules for the auction of licenses in the 700 mhz band are in second report and order adopted july 31 20074 key points are summarized below5 the 700 mhz auction the process of preparing rules for the 700 mhz band auction attracted more debate than usual fo r number of reasons one reason for interest in the spectrum is that the airwaves used for tv have good propagation qualities able to travel far and to penetrate building walls eas ily the proposals for service rules that will provide the framework for licensee business m odels have dominated the controversy over the preparations for the auction of the 700 mhz airwaves some observers have called this the 100year auction because the deci sions about its service rules could have significant impact on spectrum management and the wireless industry for decades to come service rules public safety6 public safety groups have been assigned 24 mhz of spectrum in the 700 mhz band that w ill become fully available once broadcasters have vacated the band the licenses for this spectrum were assigned for public safety use by congressional mandate in 19977 and are not slated for auction provisions in the auction rules however provide for new interoperable communi cations network for public safety users to be shared with commercial users national license for 10 mhz designated as upper block d will be au ctioned under service rules that will require working with public safety licensee to build and manage shared network the public safety licensee will be assigned single national license for part of the 24mhz assigned for public safety use the two licensees will be required to work together under network sharing agreement that they will negotiate subject to fcc approval httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22218crs4 8 fcc filings wt docket 9686 by frontline wireless lcc

that overall costs will be less than if the network were purely for public safety because of gr eater economies of scale service rules open access several companies associated with silicon valley and internet ventures petitioned the fcc to set aside block of spectrum as national license that would be used for ope n access which was defined as open devices open applications open serv ices and open networks8 the fcc has ruled that it will auction licenses for 22 mhz of spectrum with service rules requiring the first two criteria open devices and open applications there will be 12 regional licenses that will require winning bidders to allow their customers to choose their own handsets and download programs of their choice subject to reasona ble conditions needed to protect the network from harm if these licenses are not sold subject to minimum price the licenses will be put on the block second time wit hout the open platform requirement proponents of wholesaling argue that only an open network that anyone can use not just subscribers of one wireless co mpany can provide consumer choice if successful an open network w ould allow customers to choos their own wireless devices without committing to service plan from single provider such model challenges the business plans of the large wireless companies the incumbents that rely on contracts for specific wireless device to tie their customers to them not only do service contracts between consumers and wireless companies limit the customers choice of wireless devices but also carriers are increasingly blocking access to certain services this contractdriven business mode l is often referred to as walled garden wholesale network could provide more market opportun ities for new wireless devices especially wireless devices that could provide unrestricted access to the internet wireless incumbents in particular have challenged the concepts of open access and wholesaling they and others claim that the unproven nature of wholesale business model makes it risky and that therefore the au ctionable licenses woul d be devalued they argue that imposing requirements that would create wholesale network introduces an extra level of regulatory oversight covering such areas as handset compatibility applications standards market acce ss regulation and in terconnection rules9 band plan licenses and buildout requirements the band plan for the auction reflects several changes to the plan or iginally proposed by the fcc the changes make it possible to create licenses for 62 mhz of spectrum at 700 mhz instead of 60 mhz in the lower 700 mhz band the fcc has allocated 12 mhz for local areahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22218crs5 10 fcc auction of 700 mhz band licenses sc heduled for january 24 2008 october

for auction there will also be 176 licenses offe red for broader economic areas or eas also using 12 mhz of the lower 700 mhz band some commentators believe that the conditions placed on the licenses in the u pper 700 mhz band will divert bidding activity to the lower part of the band possibly driving up the prices of these li censes in this case some of the smaller companies may be outbid in their efforts to obtain cma licenses all of the commercial licenses have what the fcc describes as stringent performance requirements in pa rticular for what are referred to as buildout rules winning bidders in the upcoming auctions will have short time to provide service based on geographical or population meters or risk forfeiting licenses for example the cma and ea licensees in the lower 700 mhz band must cover at least 35 of the geographic area within four years and 70 of the area by the end of ten years the term of the license the regional licenseholders in the upper 700 mhz band must have built network that will reach 40 of the population in their license area within four years and 75 by the end of the license term failure to meet these interim guidelines will result in reduction of the license term from ten to eight years accelerating the buildout schedule licensees that fail to meet the final deadline will forfeit that part of the license that has not met buildout requirements the fcc will reclaim the spectrum and make it available to others auction rules rules for the auction cover min imum opening bids reserve prices and other procedures10 one decision is to use blind bidding recent auctions have had open bidding where all partic ipants knew not only the amounts of competing bids but also the names of their competitors with anonymity bidders will not be able to cooperate to exclude third party which allegedly occu rred during the aws1 auction11 the fcc has also said that it will permit package bidding also known as combinatorial bidding in package aucti on bidders may make single bid for group of licenses instead of competing for each license individually package bidding is believed to favor new entrants and larger companies by allowing them to acquire licenses for the coverage that meets their business needs in manner that is more efficient and less risky in attempting to acquire for example national coverage by winning many auction licenses bidder risks winning some of th licenses but not enough of the licenses to support its business plan successful pack age bid eliminates number of licenses from the general bidding process reducing the supply of licenses open for bids from small players that are seeking only one or two licenseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22218crs6 12 pl 10366 title iii sub title c chapter 1 13 47 usc 309 j

management and special funds by linda k moore 21 see united states code annotated title 47 sections as footnote d west group 2001 and the 2007 cumulative annual pocket part the origin of spectrum auctions the omnibus budget reconciliation ac t of 1993 pl 10366 amended the communications act of 1934 with number of important provisions affecting the availability of spectrum licenses the licensing improvement section12 of the act laid out the general requirements for the fcc to tablish competitive bidding methodology and consider in the process objectives such as the development and rapi d deployment of new technologies13 the law prohibited the fcc from ma king spectrum allocations decisions based solely or predominately on th expectation of federal revenues14 the emerging telecommunications technologies section15 directed the ntia to identify not less than 200 mhz of auctionable radio fre quencies used by the federa l government that could be transferred to the commercial sector16 the fcc was directed to allocate and assign these released frequencies over period of at least 10 years and to reserve significant portion of the frequencies for allocation after the tenyear time span17 similar to the requirements for competitive bidding the fcc was instructed to ensure the availability of frequencies for new technolog ies and services and also th availability of frequencies to stimulate the developmen t of wireless technologies18 the fcc was further required to address the feasibility of reallocating portions of the spectrum from current commercial and other nonfe deral uses to provide for more efficient use of spectrum and for innovation and marketplace deve lopments that may affect the relative efficiencies of different spectrum allocations19 the advanced wireless services aws1 auction that was concluded in september 2006 is one result of spectrum reassignment as required in this section20 subsequent modifications of the communications act have not substantively changed the abovenoted provisions regarding spectrum allocation21 it appears that in 1993 congress foresaw that inclusive policies for access to airwaves would have to take into acc ount developments in technology and cultural changes that were at the time glimpsed but not fully imagined
