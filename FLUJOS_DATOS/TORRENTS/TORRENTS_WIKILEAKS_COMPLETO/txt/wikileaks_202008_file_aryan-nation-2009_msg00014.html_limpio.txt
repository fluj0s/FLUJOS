ted pike from ted pike newsletterhatelawsexposedorg date mon 7 sep 2009 212444 0700 canadian victory inspires us hate law resistance by rev ted pike for the past 14 years he was the terror of anyone charged with hate crime in canada athanasios hadjis was national hate crimes hearings officer who always delivered guilty verdict he was feared by those accused of speech even likely to incite hatred or contempt against jews blacks muslims or other protected minorities chairman hadjis and the canadian human rights tribunal chrt had never delivered an innocent verdict until last wednesday after presiding over the case of accused internet holocaust questioner marc lemire this legendary hate law torquemada made an astonishing ruling he proclaimed that his oftused federal internet law section 131 was unenforceable according to the canadian constitution canadian law makes federal hate criminal of anyone who publicly questions the extent and methods of the holocaust such free thinker can be heavily fined and even imprisoned yet hadjis mocked hate law dictum letting an inveterate holocaust questioner off the hook his decree effectively asserted that its not hate crime to doubt that six million jews were killed in the holocaust primarily with gas chambers the canadian branches of the antidefamation league of bnai brith canadian jewish congress and bnai brith canada loudly decry hadjis rebellion it was they who finally persuaded parliament in 1971after decade of lobbyingto enact their hate law the canadian human right act and its infamous section 319 to preserve the hate law the canadian government may contest hadjis decision even to canadas supreme court yet breach has occurred in the seemingly impenetrable wall of the canadian hate law gestapo hadjis set precedent that could widen section 319 chief tool for harassment of christians and conservatives for nearly 40 years could even be destroyed the power of public outrage popular opinion is growing power strengthened in canada by the pervasiveness of the internet for the past six years our website wwwtruthtellersorg has blanketed canada and all other hate law nations in the western industrialized world with truth about hate law abuses and hate laws mastermind adlbnai brith canadians are now bombarded by voices from in and outside canada informing them how hate laws will deprive them of even more freedom but they do have the right to at least criticize the federal and provincial hate laws that silence their beliefs editorials blogs complaints to legislative bodies are supported by mps and political candidates advocating repeal of hate laws an upheaval of canadian protest now swells against the hard marxist crust of canadas political landscape it is rising with volcanic potential to overthrow everything adlbnai brith has done to take away canadian freedom over the past decades why has hadjis reversed after 14 years of obedience to canadian jewish supremacism governments and rulers may seem impervious to change and _expression_ of the public will but if that will exerts itself long and angrily enough some officials will weigh the disadvantages of serving the zionist lobby and eventually cast their lot with the citizens hadjis knows large sector of the canadian populace its intellectuals and its press is on his side people power is now flexing its muscle in canada showing its mighty ability to effect change for the better tear down hate bills barbed wire thus we see an amazing anomaly canada after nearly 40 years of hate law folly and injustice is at last showing signs of wanting to exit the hate law nightmare at the same time evidently having learned nothing from the adlinduced canadian catastrophe american liberalism is now prepared to try canadas failed hate law experiment in the us both houses of congress recently passed adls hate crimes prevention act and are sending it to conference and expected signing by obama as early as this month pres obama is strongly dissatisfied with the national defense authorization bill to which the hate bill was attached in the senate despite obamas threats to veto such porkladen legislation top democrats in the senate and house are publicly defying him saying they will include defense contracts such as an extra 2 billion for f35 fighter planes they are confident they can back him down but the president is not going to back down in his first veto threat to congress patriots should recognize the opportunity that this conflict creates to do what seemed impossible six weeks ago defeat the hate bill we should learn from our canadian neighbors that dogged longterm resistance eventually shakes the upper branches of government the hate bill could be signed into law within only few weeks christiansconservatives must
