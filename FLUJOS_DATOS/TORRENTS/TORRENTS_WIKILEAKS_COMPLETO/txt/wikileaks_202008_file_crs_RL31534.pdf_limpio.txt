infrastructure industries which regularly use industrial control syst ems industrial control systems may be vulnerable to infiltration by different routes including wireless transmission direct access to control system computers exploitation of dialup modems used for maintenance or through the internet this report will specifically discuss the potential for access to industrial contro l systems through the internet the vulnerability of us critical infrast ructure to cyberatt ack and catastrophic failure was brought to light in 1997 in the report of the presidents commission on critical infrastructure protection1 among other concerns the computer systems used to remotely control process equipm ent were highlighted as specific points of vulnerability these system s were updated during the y2k crisis but their cyber security generally has not been high priority the events of september 11 2001 have heightened the public awareness of the nations vulnerability to terrorist attack and national research c ouncil report has identified t he potential for attack on control systems as requiring urgent attention2 critical infrastructure is defined in the usa patriot act as those systems and assets whether physical or virtual so vital to the united states that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have debilitating impact on security national economic security na tional public health or safety or any combination of those matters3 several industry sectors considered to be critical infrastructures use industrial control sy stems in their daily activities these industries could be significantly affected by cyberattack targeting industrial control systems such as supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems distributed control systems and othe

operational deci sions or modify programs that control critical industry equipment or the data reported to control centers4 current industrial control system vulnerability the most commonly discussed industrial control systems include supervisory control and data acquisiti on scada systems and dist ributed control systems dcs5 scada systems are often used for remote monitoring over large geographic area and to transmit commands to remote assets such as valves and switches for example they can be f ound in water utilities and oil pipelines where they monitor flow rates and pressures ba sed on the data that these systems provide computer programs or operators at cen tral control center balance the flow of material generally scada systems pr ocess little data internally instead performing analysis in more central cation but are the primary conduits for raw data to and commands from control center they may be vulnerable to implantation of faulty data and to remo access through dialup modems used for maintenance distributed control systems are proce ss control systems commonly deployed in single manufacturing or production complex characterized by network of computers dcs generally provide pro cessed information to or series of commands from central location for exam ple at chemical plant dcs might simultaneously monitor the temperature of series of reactors and control the rate at which reactants are mixed together while performing real time process optimization and reporting the progress of the reaction an attack targeting dcs might cause extensive damage at single facility but might not affect more than the single site these process control systems can be in terconnected within single industry as well this might be the case in an infrast ructure which both transports and processes material as an example the oil and gas infrastructures contai n both processing and refining sites as well as holding facilities and distribution systems refining and processing sites may utilize dcs in discrete locations the distribution and holding facilities might be ma naged by scada system which collected data from and issued commands to different geog raphic sites from single location6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31534crs3 7 separation of control system networks from other computer networks still occurs in some businesses for an example

infrastructure protection challenges in securing control systems gao04140t and alan s brown scada vs the hackers mechanical engineering december 2002industrial control system technologie s are often employed in critical infrastructure industries to allow single control center to ma nage multiple sites industrial control systems were originally implemented as isolated separate networks7 they were viewed as secure systems which protected remote locations from being physically broken into and mistr eated for example the establishment of remote control systems in dams reportedly protected against unlawful release of the dammed water as handoperable valves and switches were accessible8 the networking of industr ial control systems on greater scale has led to increased synergy and efficiency and due to market needs eg deregulated markets real time information from these systems is increasingly important for commercial purposes conse quently industrial control systems are becoming linked to corporate computer systems potentially making them vulnerable to cyberattack through the internet original control sy stems were designed to be free standing networks without internet access therefor it has been necessary to add network access capabilities to these legacy systems to integrate them into the corporate structure this has created in the wors t cases labyrinth of connections which is perhaps not rigorously constructed for cybersecurity or well documented many organizations including the gene ral accounting office researchers at several department of ener gy national laboratories and private security and consulting companies have identified systemic and specific security vulnerabilities in select process control systems9 among these vulnera bilities are poor cyber security practices such as weak passw ords lack of robust protocols and communication in clear text while some vulnerabilities arise from the manner by which the process control system is operated others are belie ved to be integral to the control system configuration itself some industrial control systems including legacy systems are proprietary and contain nonstandard archit ectures and command syntax this can be considered both an advantage and disadvantage pr oprietary systems with esoteric command structures are often nonintuitive and coul d be difficult to operate by an untrained individual incorrect commands could cause results and may increase the probability that the intruder would be noticed and removed from the system additionally different compan ies may have different comma nd sets even if they are both members of the same industry as their proprietary systems may have significantly different structures thus if hacker or terrorist successfully attacks one company that experience may not be valuable for use at the next companyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31534crs4 10 the department of energy and the department of defense have performed vulnerability assessments through

september 1 2003others assert that many new control system s as well as upgrades to legacy systems are being assembled from co mmercial offtheshelf equipment and software providing commonalities across di fferent industry sectors they point to the needs of system maintenance and new component integration as leading to similar control system architectures both within and between critical infrastructure sectors by adopting such equipment and software vulnerabilities that are identified impact all sectors the degree of integration between c ontrol system networks and publicly accessible networks is difficult to judge from the open literature this makes assessment of the vulnerability of critical infrastructure i ndustries from internet based attack difficult to know with certainty10 faced with an unclear risk it may be difficult from an industry perspective to justify the additional costs of upgrading privatelyheld industrial control syst ems to higher security standards11 current off theshelf industrial control systems have been designed for operational speed and functionality rather than for secure ope ration and therefore may not have high degree of operational security12 addition of security re quirements may degrade the performance of these component s below operating standards events have shown that utility control system networks may be vulnerable to cyberbased incidents computers at an inactive nuclear power plant in ohio were infected by the slammer worm in ja nuary 2003 the infection disabled some computer functionality including monitoring systems for portions of the power plant13 also it has been reported that othe r control system computers have been compromised by other viruses14 given the uncertain vulnerability level and the potential systemic weaknesses involved in current offtheshelf technol ogy there appears to be little market incentive to directly increase industrial c ontrol systems security therefore the security

while it may provide initial barriers to intrusion it would not reduce any inherent vulnerabilities in the control system network15 security analysts also contend that industrial control systems are less obscure now than when they were initially developed foreign utility companies increasingly use current commercial offtheshelf indus trial control systems increasing the international availability of systems and their documentation due to the similarity between these systems and systems installed domestically potential terrorists need not break into an american utility to test their plans16 instead preliminary testing might be performed outside of the unite d states on equipment held in other countries some security analysts believe that the industrial control system vulnerability should be addressed before potentially catastrophic events occur and that techniques for reducing the vulnerability are already know n they contend that the majority of attacks on industrial control systems will co through corporate networks via the internet while standardized informa tion technology protec tion methods have not yet been developed specifically for industria l control systems these analysts contend that if general network benc hmark standards were unifor mly applied across corporate networks corporate networks vulnerability to intrusion could be reduced by 80 8817 this would indirectly reduce the i ndustrial control syst ems vulnerability to intrusion as routes through the corporat network would longer be available these benchmark standards include disabling unneeded server functionality patching known security flaws and updating prog rams to the most recent version other security analysts claim that in addition to general network security specific protection for industrial control sy stems must also be established such protection might be ddressed by successfully isolating the control system network from the corporate computer network or by implementing stronger security measures at known junctions of the two networks ch an effort might significantly increase the difficulty of infiltrating the control system network from the internet18 in contrast control systems may have vulnerabilities unrelated to those associated with corporate networks nd may require more specific protectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31534crs6 19 joe weiss kema consulting

of an attack on th industrial control systems of critical infrastructure could vary widely it is commonly assumed that successful cyber attack would cause few if any casualties but might result in

telephone service wh ile technicians rese t and repaired the switching network an attack on chemical or liquid natural gas facilitys control systems might lead to more widespread physical damage lower probability events include catastr ophic infrastructure failure where the failure of one part of the infrastructure l eads to the failure of other parts causing widespread effect such failure might occur due to the synergistic effect of infrastructure industries on each other simple example might be an attack on electrical utilities where electricity distribution was disrupted sewage treatment plants and waterworks could also fail as perhaps the turbines and other electrical apparatuses in these facilitie s shut down on august 5 2002 the faulty closure of an emergency valve at one of

been contributing to congestion of the internet might have exacerbated the problems f aced by utilities leading up to the blackout event47 the scenario which causes the highest degree of concern among experts is the combined use of cyberattack on critical infrastructure in conjunction with physical attack48 this use of cyberterrorism coul d result in an amplification of the physical attacks effects

cybersecurity standards for the electricity industry as we ll as guidelines for securing remote access to critical electric infrastructure78 another approach is to develop volunt ary bestpractices for process control system security several organizations are taking part in such initiatives for example the instrument society of am erica has formed committee isasp99 to develop series of reports on bestprac tices and procedural improvements which would enhance control system security79 similar efforts are underway in other technical societies including the institute of electrical and electronics engineers and the international electrotechnical co mmission where working groups on process control systems and their security are established some industry groups have focused on veloping nearterm

outreach efforts to improve understanding of security issues relating to cybersecurity and process control systems81 policy options the vulnerability of industr ial control systems may be reduced through range of federal actions these include the deve lopment of standards either voluntary or mandatory for cybersecurity of control sy stems identifying and addressing critical infrastructure interdependencies developing encryption methods for control systems identifying and establishing technologies to address existing vulnerabilities funding longterm research into secure scada syst ems providing for fr ee exchange of risk information between the federal governme nt private industry and other critical infrastructure sectors and assessing federal activities in this area developing standards the federal government c ould mandate and enforce uniform security standard for cybersecurity of industrial control systems or support the development of industry developed and based standards b ecause of the national importance of critical infrastructure systems uniform standard might be developed with the input of advocates industries and the federa l government which would include the functionality necessary to protect industrial control systems while providing for more secure operation voluntary standards based approach has been developed for server operating systems with some success and similar mechanism might be used to develop standards for commercia l offtheshelf control systems82 alternately processes and specifications currently being developed th rough industryled programs might be generalized across critical infrastructure industries and established as voluntary standard critics of this approach cite the many different uses of industrial control systems in different i ndustry sectors as making such standard unwieldy some experts ve expressed concerns that mandated standard would be less effective than voluntary standar d as solutions to new problems could not be implemented immediately but would wait for changes to the standard and that such standard may not be uniformly appli cable across industry sectors others have stated that there is need for federal requirements to assure that appropriate attention is focused on process control system securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31534crs17 83 see for example alan s brown scada vs the

security research test bed modeling or critical infrastructure vulnerability assessment to further clarify the current vulnerability securing control system communications another option would involve supportin g encryption research to protect industrial control system da ta transfer encrypting the information transmitted between remote units and their controlle rs would inhibit inclusion of false information to and from industrial control systems current encryption technology may not be compatible due to the time required to process the encrypted data and the level of technology built into control system components industrial control systems have stringent timing requirements and tend to be built out of less computationally robust components which complicate the use of current encryption technologies83 while prototype encryption method fo r industrial control systems has been developed it is still in the validation process84 and is only recently being evaluated for implementation in industry85 further research into encryption techniques for these processes could provide efficient marketdriven tec hnology for securing industrial control systems information so experts highlight that securing data transfer does not assure the security of the control system itself they assert that other routes of attack exist that do not rely on the security of the control system communications thus securing those communications while lowering system vulnerability may not be addressing the most likely threathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31534crs18 86 federal register volume

further research and development into methods for retrofitting existing scada systems with more secure components or communications may be another method to reduce system vulnerability this approach has been taken by researchers in both industry and federal governme nt laboratories while pot entially addressing short term needs to reduce vulnerability retrofit solutions are not likely to solve inherent shortfalls in scada security especially with respect to the inclusion of cots equipment potentially vulnerable to cyber attack critics of retrofit solutions cite high costs and potential compatibility concerns as barriers to easy implementation of such solutions increasing research and development funding long term approach to limiting the vulnerability of scada systems is to provide further targeted investment into veloping nextgeneration secure control systems development of secure sc ada architecture may provide incentives to replace components in secure manner during the normal replacement cycle incrementally reducing the present vulnera bility while some argue such product research and development is responsib ility of private i ndustry others may assert that control system security is of na tional import requiring enhanced federal investment several national laboratories have developed complementary testbed facilities to investigate potential vulnerabilities nd solutions to scada systems such testbed facilities could be used to evaluate and validate the security of commercial scada systems act as proving ground for new technologies or be dedicated to the development of federal efforts in secure process control systems increasing information sharing the new foia exemptions created in the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 may provide higher volume freer exchange of information between the federal government and indus try as industry may beco more forthcoming about potential vulnerabilities the critical energy infrastructure information category

perfor ming risk and vulnerability assessments with the concentration of previously existing agencies into the directorate of informati on analysis and infrastructure protection previous duplication of effort may be removed but critics have suggested that difficulties in integrating these agencies may lead to reduction in effectiveness some policymakers have expressed concern that the priorities
