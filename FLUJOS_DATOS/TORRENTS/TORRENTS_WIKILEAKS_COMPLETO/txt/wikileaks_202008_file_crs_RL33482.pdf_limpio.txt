not consumed and represents resources that can be used to increase replace or improve the nations capital stock the us net national saving rate reached postwar peak of 124 in 1965 and has then trended downward since to low of 19 in 2006 many analysts claim that saving is too low among the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd countries th united states has the third lowest saving rate survey evidence suggests that people know why they should save but many dont save especially lowerincome individuals and families several reasons have been offered to explain the declining personal saving rate and the relatively high proportion of individuals and families that do not save economic reasons start from the premise that individuals and families are rational and make optimal decisions about consumption and saving throughout the life course low saving rates are then explained by economic disincentives induced by government policy or by life cycle changes in the propensity to save behavioral reasons start from the premise that individuals and families do not always make optimal decisions regarding consumption and saving the government offers tax incentives to individuals and families to save the empirical evidence on the relationship of tax incentives to the saving rate mostly comes from examinations of traditional individual retirement accounts iras and 401k plans the reported results are mixed but generally indicate small effects be that as it may the tax incentives tend to benefit higherincome individuals and families to much greater extent than lowerincome individuals and families the primary reasons are 1 higherincome individuals are much more likely to save and 2 higherincome individuals face higher marginal tax rates and benefit more from sheltering income from taxation furthermore the tax revenue loss for these incentives lower public saving by reducing the budget surplus or increasing the budget deficit for fy2007 these tax incentives are estimated to cost the us treasury 1338 billion in forgone tax revenuesalmost 85 of the estimated fy2007 budget deficit the bush administration and the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform have advocated expanding tax incentives as the primary policy to encourage personal saving research has shown that personal saving has been fairly unresponsive to tax incentives however and such incentives may substantially decrease public saving that is increase the budget deficit the longterm net effect on national saving and economic growth is likely negative this report

in the bank the increases in wealth that saving represents can be spent in the near future for emergencies or childrens educational expenses in the distant future for retirement or passed down to heirs1 from national perspective however saving is income that is not spent on consumption goods or services that is it is the portion of national output that is not consumed and represents resources that can be used to increase replace or improve the nations capital stock2 many analysts claim that saving is too low for example recent research has shown that about quarter of the us population live in households whose assets are below 25 of the poverty threshold3 if housing wealth is not included the proportion increases to over 40 of the us population furthermore retirement specialists ar gue that many people nearing retirement have not accumulated enough assets to maintain their present living standards after retirement4 at the national level analysts caution against low savings rate they argue that high capital investment is good thing but if it is not financed by national saving it has to be financed by borrowing abroad5 persistent borrowing from abroad builds up international liabilities and implies increasing shares of national income will be sent overseas as interest and dividends it is difficult to say that the us national saving rate is too low since there is universally accepted definition of what constitutes low saving rate but it is noteworthy that among the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd countries the united states has the third lowest saving rate6 the postworld war ii trend in the us saving rate saving as percentage of gross domestic product is shown in figure 1 7 the net national saving rate the heavy solid line reached post war peak of 124 in 1965 and has trended downward since then to low of 19 in 2006 1 the term saving refers to the flow of resources not consumed and represents additions to wealth savings is synonym for wealth 2 see crs report rl30873 saving in the united states how has it changed and why is it important by brian w cashell and gail makinen 3 see asena caner and edward n wolff asset

economic analysis there are three components to national saving the first is personal saving or the saving by individuals and households the light solid line in the figure this is what people typically think of as saving the second component is business saving which consists of corporate retained earnings the dashed line the final component is public saving which is federal state and local government surpluses the dotted line public saving can be and often is negative if the government sector is running deficit the decline in the national saving rate since 1965 has two main sources first the public saving rate fell from 14 in 1965 to 42 in 1983 most of this decline in the public saving rate was due to increasing federal budget deficits after 1982 the steady fall in the personal saving rate accounts for much of the decline in the national saving rate the fall in the personal saving rate has been attributed to combination of factors including the increase in transfer income which is rarely saved an increase in household wealth and an increase in the proportion of the population 65 years or older who tend to spend rather than accumulate savings 8 each of these could increase consumption relative to income thus lowering saving in response to the perceived low saving rate the government offers many saving incentives through the tax system in addition many employers offer some inducements to encourage their employees to save for retirement this report examines why individuals and households save or dont save and the effectiveness of the various incentives and inducements in increasing personal and national saving 8 see david w wilcox household spending and saving measurement trends and analysis federal reserve bulletin vol 77 1 jan 1991 pp 117

reasons or motives leading individuals to save that is to forgo consumption9 precaution motive to build up reserve against unforeseen contingencies foresight motive to provide for an anticipated future relation between the income and the needs of the individual or his family different from that which exists in the present calculation motive to enjoy interest and appreciation improvement motive to enjoy gradually increasing expenditures independence motive to enjoy sense of independence and the power to do things enterprise motive to secure masse manœuvre to carry out speculative or business projects pride bequest motive to bequeath fortune and avarice motive to satisfy pure miserliness others have added down payment motive as ninth reason for saving 10 recent survey evidence generally confirms that many of these motives are the main reasons why americans save see table 1 the table reports the response of primeaged heads of households grouped by age and income11 t able 1

be made about these results first saving for retirement is generally the most important reason for saving in nearly every age and income group the foresight or retirement motive is stronger for older age groupsthe age groups closer to retirement furthermore families in the upper half of the income distribution are more likely to cite saving for retirement as their primary reason for saving than those in the lower half of the income distribution second saving for the inevitable rainy day the precaution motive appears to be the primary reason for saving among younger families in the lower half of the income distribution for the other groups it is the second most frequently cited reason for saving for the older two age groups those with lower income are more likely to save for precautionary reasons than those with more income third within each age group those in the lower half of the income distribution are more likely than those in the upper half to cite saving for future purchases of goods and services such as homes home repairs and durable goods as the most important reason to save possible explanation for this disparity by income is lowerincome families may be credit constrained and have to save for purchases rather than using credit card lastly among the youngest families about one in five report that education is the most important reason for saving the improvement motive for the young families there is not much difference between the two income groups older families especially those in the oldest age group are less likely to report this as an important reason for saving since their children are generally grown and finished with their formal education the results reported in table 1 suggest that people know why they should save but provides little information on whether or not they do save figure 2 shows the percentage of families in each age and income group who report not saving there is relatively little variation across age groupsabout 20 of the families do not save there are large disparities however by income about 10 of the families in the upper half of the income distribution report not saving in contrast about third of the families in the lower half of the income distribution do not save several reasons have been offered for the declining personal saving rate and the relatively high proportion of individuals and families that do not save the economic reasons start from the premise that individuals and families are rational and make optimal decisions about consumption and saving throughout the life course low saving rates are then explained by economic disincentives induced by government policy or by life cycle changes in the propensity to save behavioral reasons start from the premise that individuals and families do not

aggregate level some analysts point out that the rising proportion of the elderly in the us population may explain the declining saving rate since the elderly should dissave that is spend their savings rather than save the aggregate saving rate should fall research has shown however that saving rates do not vary that much across age groups and the change in the age distribution in the 1980s was too small to explain the decline in the aggregate saving rate12 although the change in the age distribution of th us population toward higher proportion of elderly may not explain the fall in the saving rate there is evidence that the elderly now are saving less than past cohorts of elderly research shows that there has been an increase in annuitization of wealth especially social security and defined benefit pension wealth which could be due to lessened bequest and precautionary motives 13 consequently consumption by the elderly is higher and saving is lower more elde rly who are saving less may have had some effect on the personal saving rate but this does not explain low saving rates for younger individuals 12 see alan j auerbach and laurence j kotlikoff demographics fiscal policy

future with the shift from defined benefit pension plans to defined contribution pension plans especially 401k plans which do not have to be annuitized at retirement some have argued that social welfare programs social insurance and public assistance have contributed to the decline in saving social insurance programs such as unemployment insurance and social security both for disability and old age may have reduced the need for precautionary saving 14 but there have been large scale changes in these programs since 1980 that could explain the trend in personal saving furthermore recent research shows that the precautionary saving motive does not give rise to much wealth in the economy and probably to relatively little saving15 related argument suggests that assetbased meanstested public assistance programs such as temporary assistance to needy families supplemental security income and food stamps discourage saving by families with low expected lifetime earnings proponents of this argument point out that the asset test acts as an implicit 100 tax rate on savings in the event of an earnings downturn or medical expense large enough to cause the household to seek welfare support16 this would prevent these families from saving for precautionary reasons and for retirement since most public assistance programs include both regular and retirement savings accounts as assets subject to the asset limit this may help explain why lowerincome families have little savings but does not explain the decline in the personal saving rate since the mid 1980s because the meanstesting rules of these programs have not substantially changed over the past 25 years in addition many lowincome families do not save because after everyday living expenses are covered there is little or money left over for saving two financial explanations offered to explain declining saving rates are 1 capital gains in housing and equities and 2 the development of financial markets the increase in wealth from unrealized capital gains in housing and equities since 1990 allows individuals and families to maintain target level of wealth and even increase the target level without active saving the developments and expansion in credit cards and home equity loans mean families do not have to save as much for future durable good and home purchases retirement saving has to last throughout the retirement years recent evidence suggests that individuals tend to underestimate how long they will live survey results show that majority of americans underestimate the life expectancy for someone their own age and gender 17 similarly british men and women underestimate how long they are likely to live by about five years18 consequently even if people are saving for retirement they may be undersaving because they are saving for shorter retirement period than what they will actually experience this could help explain low levels of savings but cannot explain the downward trend in personal saving rates unless there has been change in americans underestimate of their life expectancy 14 see lawrence summers and chris carrol why is u s national saving so low brookings institution

in recent years behavioral models have been developed to explain low savings and low saving rates especially for retirement the traditional economic model of saving the lifecycle model assumes that individuals make rational farsighted decisions the theory implies that saving rates increase with age and savings accumulate until retirement when individuals begin to spend down their savings the bulk of the empirical evidence however tends to not support the lifecycle model 19 unlike the traditional economic model for saving behavioral models stress that individuals can and do make choices that are unfavorable to themselves these models emphasize the role of inertia the lack of selfcontrol and the limits of human intellectual capabilities retirement savings accounts for example 401k plans and iras require workers to be proactive and decide to participate how much to save and how to invest the retirement account assets but through inertia workers may never make or at least postpone making these critical decisions research shows that changing the default options in 401k plans so the workers have to decide not to participate can substantially increase participation rates in these plans and increase retirement saving 20 workers through inertia also tend to accept the default contribution rate and the investment allocation chosen by the plan administrator therefore the defaults need to be carefully chosen to allow for an adequate return while protecting the workers investment saving takes will power individuals have to forgo current consumption in order to save for future consumption and they may not have the selfcontrol to forgo consumption21 often individuals develop selfregulatory mechanisms or rules to control spending such as mental accounting systems in mental accounting system the individual treats money in different accounts as not being fungible and has different propensity to spend money from the different accounts but equally as often individuals manipulate or bend their own rules of selfcontrol22 to make the complex decisions determining the optimal consumption path over lifetime requires not only complete information on the economic environment but also almost unlimited computing power individuals however rarely have complete information and may not be able to adequately process the information they do have to deal with human information processing limitations individuals often use simple rules of thumb to make these complex decisions and generally accept alternatives that are good enough rather than optimal 23 consequently individuals may make seemingly shortsighted decisions and save too little many people nearing retirement age do not plan ahead and have not thought about retirement and financing their

either frontloaded or backloaded25 in frontloaded plans the contributions are tax deferred so the tax benefits primarily accrue at the time money is contributed to the account the earnings grow taxfree until the funds are withdrawn or distributed at that time both the contributions and earnings are taxed traditional deductible iras and 401k plans are examples of frontloaded savings accounts in backloaded plans aftertax dollars are contributed to the account and neither the contributions nor the earnings are taxed for qualified withdrawals the roth ira is the best known example of backloaded savings account both types of plans will yield higher aftertax distribution than regular taxable savings accounts thus providing an incentive to save in these accounts as long as the tax rate is the same at the time of withdrawal as when the funds were contributed both frontloaded and backloaded savings accounts will yield the same aftertax distribution at retirement individuals who save for their childrens education on the one hand often begin saving early in their working career when their earnings are relatively low and tend to be in the lower tax brackets they then withdraw the funds during their peak earning years when their children attend college consequently they may be in higher tax bracket when the monies are distributed from the savings account back loaded plan may confer greater benefits than frontloaded plan in this case on the other hand individuals saving for retirement often are in hi gher tax brackets during their working years than at retirement for these individuals frontloaded plan may confer greater benefits in either case the saving decisions are often made several years before anticipated withdrawals and it is difficult to know what tax bracket one will be in so far in advance these tax incentives however can affect both personal and public saving the tax revenue loss for these incentives will lower public saving by reducing the budget surplus or increasing the budget deficit 26 the reduction in public saving may more than offset any increase in personal 24 annamaria lusardi information expectations and savings for retirement

savings plans are reflected in the federal budget at different times for frontloaded plans the tax expenditures are incurred immediately and the revenues from taxing distributions occur in the future but there are immediate tax expenditures for backloaded savings plans because only aftertax income is contributed to the account the costs to the government are reflected in the budget only when the monies are distributed from the account over the longterm frontloaded plan may be less costly to the government than backloaded plan but within the typical 5 or 10year budget window the backloaded plan will look less expensive the tax expenditures of these tax incentives are not trivial table 2 reports the estimated tax expenditures for the exclusion of contributions and earnings for employer pension plans such as 401k plans iras and keogh plans in addition to the savers credit which is discussed below the joint committee on taxation estimates that the fy2007 retirement income related tax

incentives have increased personal saving from theoretical perspective the effect of tax reduction on personal saving is ambiguous because of offsetting income and substitution effects the increased rate of return may cause individuals to substitute future consumption for current consumption and save more substitution effect but at the same time the higher rate of return allows individuals to save less and still obtain their target amount of savings an income effect the overall consequences for personal savings depends on the relative magnitude of these two effects in the case of iras personal savings may be unaffected because most of the tax benefits are provided to individuals contributing the maximum amount which eliminates any substitution effect casual observation suggests that the income effect dominates since the personal saving rate has fallen since the introduction of iras and 401k plans the empirical evidence on the relationship of tax incentives to the saving rate mostly comes from examinations of traditional iras and 401k plans the reported results are mixed but generally indicate small effects 27 furthermore roth iras eliminate the immediate reward to retirement saving because the contributions are not tax deductible and may thus reduce saving 27 for more complete discussion of the savings literature see jane g gravelle the economic effects of

higherincome individuals and families to much greater extent than lowerincome individuals and families the primary reasons are 1 higherincome individuals are much more likely to save and 2 higherincome individuals face higher marginal tax rates and benefit more from sheltering income from taxation furthermore with regards to educational savings plans the penalties for using the educational savings for noneducational purposes may discourage lowerincome families from having these accounts children from lowerincome families are less likely to attend college than other children thus increasing the likelihood of being penalized for having an education savings account these penalties partly explain why parents participating in coverdell education savings accounts and 529 plans have substantia lly higher income on average than other parents 28 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 provided lowand moderateincome individuals nonrefundable tax credit for contributions to qualified retirement plan the savers credit29 the maximum amount of the tax credit is 2000 the savings effects of this tax credit have not been fully evaluated yet but early evidence suggests that many taxpayers are unable to receive the full benefit because the credit is nonrefundable30 in addition the savers credit appears to be substantially less effective in boosting saving among lowincome individuals than simple matching contribution possibly because of the complexity of the savers credit and the tax system in general 31 continued savings and pp 193197

initial or supplemental contribution can be placed in an individuals savings account an example is the 1 agency contribution placed in federal employees thrift savings plan tsp account32 this contribution is placed in the account whether or not the employee chooses to make contributions to his or her account this can encourage individuals to save by overcoming the inertia to open an account and it allows individuals to observe the benefits of saving for example interest compounding without risking their own money once the benefits of saving are experienced individuals may be more willing to commit their own funds to the savings account second matching contributions can be made to an individuals account this is common practice in many 401k pension plans including the federal thrift saving plan in the case of 401k pensions part or all of an employees contribution is matched by the employer the more the employee contributes the more the employer contributes up to limit the employer is essentially supplementing the employees salary but only if the employee saves empirical evidence suggests that small matching contributions about 10 cents for every dollar saved will increase employees contributions but increasing matching contributions past this point may have effect on an employees contributions or actually reduce his or her contributions 33 if an employee has set target for saving for example then increasing the employers contribution means that the employee can save less and still meet his or her saving target limited evidence suggests that matching contributions could sign ificantly increase contributions by lowand moderateincome families34 third taxfavored savings initially could be used only for specific purpose such as retirement in the case of 401k plans and individuals faced penalty for nonqualified uses of the savings the penalty helps commit individuals to hold the funds for the desired purpose such as retirement rather than use them for current consumption but individuals may be reluctant to give up the freedom to use the funds for other equally important purposes as individuals try to balance saving for retirement and saving for precautionary reasons over time however laws and regulations were changed to allow employees to borrow from their 401k plan or to make penaltyfree withdrawals for emergency purposes in addition to retirement after age 59½ qualified that is penaltyfree distributions can be made from iras for educational expenses firsttime home purchase and medical expenses there is some empirical evidence that pre retirement access to 401k funds increases participation in and contributions to 401k pension plans 35 but allowing preretirement access to 401k assets could also lead some to have smaller

borrowed funds are never repaid or if withdrawn funds are never replaced fourth some firms have experimented with changing the default options for pension plans where participation is voluntary for example employees are covered by firms 401k plan only if they actively sign up and enroll in the plan however through inertia many employees do not participate the default option therefore combines with worker inertia to yield low saving rates and little retirement savings changing the default to automatic enrollment means the employee has to actively opt out of the pension plan 36 recent evaluations of some firms that have changed to automatic enrollment shows that participation is significantly increased though this simple change but through inertia substantial fraction of the new participants accept the firms default contribution level and investment options for their pension assets37

expanding taxfree saving opportunities the administration proposed creating lifetime savings accounts lsas and retirement savings accounts rsas the annual nondeductible contribution limits would be 2000 for lsas and 5000 for rsas regardless of age or income the rsa contribution however cannot be greater than earnings the lsa and rsa would be similar to roth iras in that investment earn ings accumulate taxfree funds from the lsa could be withdrawn penaltyfree at any time for any purpose while rsa distributions would not be taxed or penalized if made after age 58 death or disability the annual contribution limit would be indexed to inflation the recent presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform proposed the creation of save for family accounts sfas to replace existing education and medical savings accounts and save for retirement accounts sras to replace traditional and roth iras this proposal would allow every taxpayer to contribute up to 10000 every year to an sfa and an sra on an aftertax basis 38 the earnings would accumulate taxfree in the same way as in the current roth ira tax free withdrawals would be allowed at any time from the sfa for qualified educational and medical costs or to purchase primary reside nce in addition taxpayers would be able to withdraw up to 1000 taxfree each year for any purpose nonqualified distributions in excess of the 1000 limit would be subject to income taxes and 10 penalty tax similar to the penalty paid on nonqualified distributions from the current roth ira taxfree withdrawals from sras would be allowed after age 58

g343g345g561the need to save for future tax liabilities cons equently shifting from frontloaded to backloaded savings approaches may reduce personal savings in addition the longterm revenue loss from these proposals could be substantial thus leading to large reduction in public saving39 the result of these savings proposals could be large reduction in national saving and reduction in economic growth the administration also proposed the establishment of individual development accounts idas for lowerincome individuals and families eligible individuals and families could set up idas with qualified entities who would then matc h the first 500 contributed in taxable year40 contributions would not be tax deductible and inve stment earnings would be subject to tax but the matching contributions and associated inve stment earnings would be taxfree qualified withdrawals could be made from idas for higher education firsttime home purchase business startup or qualified rollovers withdrawals for ot her purposes could result in forfeiture of some or all of the matching contributions and earnings idas could increase personal saving by stimulating new saving by lowand moderateincome taxpayers the matching contributions would reduce public saving but increase personal savings by the same amount the overall effect on national saving would therefore likely be positive recent proposal offered by analysts at the brookings institution moves away from reliance on tax incentives to encourage retirement saving 41 the proposal has several elements designed to remove behavioral barriers to saving the two major elements are 1 automatic enrollment in 401k plans or in an ira if the employer does not sponsor pension plan and 2 30 government matching contribution the governme nt contribution would replace the current tax deduction for retirement saving contributions other elements include allowing participants to borrow from their retirement account and removing

themselves to overcome these barriers the government offers variety of saving incentives most of the government incentives to save come through the tax system for fy2007 these tax incentives are

marginal tax rates and thus benefit more from sheltering income from taxation the tax incentives however appear to be relatively ineffective in inducing new savingmany of the families benefitting from the tax incentives likely shifted funds from other saving accounts into the taxpreferred accounts consequently public saving is lower because of the forgone tax revenues due to the tax incentives while personal saving may be only slightly increased at best in designing prosaving policies it is important to consider the aggregate effects of the policies on all components of national savings both public and private the bush administration and the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform have advocated expanding tax incentives as the primary policy to encourage saving personal saving has been shown to be fairly unresponsive to tax incentives however and they may substantially decrease public saving that is increase the budget deficit the longterm net effect on national saving is likely negative other proposals offered by retirement experts are designed to 1 overcome behavioral barriers to saving and 2 redistribute the benefits of government saving incentives more broadly across the population these proposals could increase personal saving but could also decrease public saving
