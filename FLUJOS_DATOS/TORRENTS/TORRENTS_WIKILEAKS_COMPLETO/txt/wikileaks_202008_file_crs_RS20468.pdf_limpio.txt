agreement on how to handle cubans who are excludable under the i na but they did agree to continue discussing the matter6 the united states and cuba agreed to review the implementation of thisagreement and engage in further discussions it became apparent that the 20000 minimum vel per year could not be met through the ina preference system or the refugee provi sions because of the eligibility criteria in addition to those cubans who may qualify to immigrate through the ina preference system and who may qualify as refugees the united states decided to use other authority in the

migrate receives visa cuban migration ag reement may 1995 on may 2 1995 the clinton administration announced further agreement with cuba that resolved the dilemma of the approximately 33000 cubans

cubans detained at guantanamo to come to the united states through the humanitarian parole provisions of the i na cuba agreed to credit these admissions toward the minimum 20000 lprs per year fro m cuba with 5000 charged annually over three years secondly rather than placing c ubans intercepted at s ea in safe haven camps the united states began repatriating them to cuba both parties promised to act in matter consistent with international obligations and to ensure that action is taken against those repatriated us official s would inform repa triated cubans about procedures to legally immigrate at the us interests section in havana those charged with alien smuggling however do face prison terms in cuba interdicted cubans are given an opportun ity to express fear of persecution if
