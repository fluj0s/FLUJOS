natos successful air campaign in kosovo reflected the use of precise intelligence for targeting precision munitions the campaigns goal was to destroy key serbian targets with minimal casualties to allied forces or civilians at the same time the campaign clearly taxed intelligence capabili ties it demonstrated that there are limited numbers of manned reconnaissance aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs as well as an inability to provide realtime intelligence data to combat aircraft on routine basis since future dod warfighting strategy is based on hightech factors such as the combination of information dominance and precision weaponry some observers believe that kosovo operations should serve as warning that difficult decisions and reallocations may be required if planned technical advantages can be realized in future military operations this report describes the role of intelligence in kosovo operations the importance of intelligence to current and planned military operational capabilities and the challenges facing the us intelligence community in being prepared to support such operations special attention is given to the role of congress in providing intelligence resources for evolving military missions this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30366kosovo implications for military intelligence summary north atlantic treaty organization nato aerial operations conducted in apriljune 1999 against serbian forces and installations operation allied force demonstrated that an air campaign largely based on precision weapons can accomplish major military and political objectives even in the absence of ground campaign eventual serbian withdrawal from kosovo was achieved with almost casualties among friendly forces the prerequisite to success in natos air campaign was highly accurate allied particularly us intelligence and precision weapons the combined use of precise intelligence and munitions to strike troop positions and stationary targets has been described as major component of an ongoing technological revolution that is integral to defense planning in the postcold war world far different than the plans for second strike nuclear capabilities and extended deterrence that characterized earlier us planning the emphasis on precise targeting that limits friendly and non combatant casualties greatly increases the need to collect analyze and disseminate intelligence in something approaching realtime despite successful military outcome however the kosovo campaign demonstrates that neither the defense department nor the intelligence community is yet fully prepared to provide the extensive intelligence support required in the military operations envisioned for the next century collection assets were stretched thin resources had to be borrowed from other theaters intelligence could not in many cases be transmitted immediately to attacking aircraft several instances of erroneous bombing including the attack on the chinese embassy in belgrade have been blamed on faulty intelligence it is widely agreed that limitations in us reconnaissance capabilitiesespecially manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles uavsmust now be addressed acquisition of airborne reconnaissance platforms as well as satellites has been complicated by budgetary limitations and according to some observers by administrative shortcomings congress has expressed concern about inadequate progress on uav programs in particular and some argue that the failure of the executive branch to present comprehensive reconnaissance plans for the entire defense department has forced congress to make necessary tradeoffs numerous detailed provisions in fy2000 defense and intelligence legislation deal with reconnaissance assets the conference report on the fy2000 defense appropriations act pl 10679 indicates that reconnaissance questions will be matter of significant concern in consideration of future defense budgets kosovo also demonstrated that other nato countries are in large measure unprepared for the use of precise intelligence to support precision weaponry even though such capabilities might cost less than the large ground force structures currently being maintained this will present difficult challenges should the alliance become involved in further combined operations but the us has only limited ability to achieve the redirection of nato defense planninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30366contents background 1 the importance of intelligence 1 persisting problems 4 congressional

was the erroneous assumption in the early months of 1999 that serbian president milosevic would capitulate after the initial two or three days of bombing the process of negotiations and the expectations of serbian behavior is however so interlinked with policy decisions that it is excluded from discussion in this report see julie kim kosovo review and analysis of policy options 1998june 1999 crs report rl30265 july 21 1999kosovo implications for military intelligence background operation allied force the air strikes launched by the north atlantic treaty organization nato against serbian targets during the period march 24th through june 9th 1999 was decisive factor in gaining serbian president slobodan milosevics agreement to withdraw his troops and security forces from kosovo john keegan wellrespected military historian concluded for the first time in military history air forces won war1 during the campaign some 37000 sorties ie one aircraft flight were made and some 23999 munitions were launched in addition to serbian forces in kosovo primary targets included serbias integrated air defenses command control and communications systems fighter aircraft and ammunition and oil production facilities although somewhat higher figures were released during the course of the campaign recent estimates indicate that there were 93 successful strikes on tanks 153 on armored personnel carriers 339 on military vehicles and 389 on artillery and mortars the bombing campaign did not halt the initial dispersal of kosovar albanians nor did it prevent considerable number of atrocities but in its final stages it resulted in belgrade paying heavy cost to maintain its position in kosovo and undoubtedly in conjunction with russian pressure led to serbias agreement to withdraw its forces the importance of intelligence2 the air campaign was dependent upon highly accurate and uptodate information on the nature and location of serbian targets as secretary of defense cohen testified to the senate armed services committee on july 20 1999 the operation highlighted the importance of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and the fact that the assets that provide these essential elements of success are in short supply it demonstrated the immense potential of precision attack munitions to make possible military operations with

manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs were used by nato commanders to direct attacks by allied aircraft operating over kosovo and serbia to facilitate attacks on stationary installations in both kosovo and serbia proper video images were fused with digital terrain elevation data provided from national satellites this data was used to target cruise missiles launched by submarines in the adriatic and by b1 bombers operating from bases in the united states in the early phase of the campaign more than ninety percent of bombs and missiles used were precisionguided in later stages more dumb bombs were used as result of natos control of the air improved weather conditions and decreased stocks of precision weapons4 even unguided weapons were however aimed within precisely defined areas to strike oil refineries ammunition storage sites and troop staging areas the effective use of intelligence in kosovo in large measure resulted from lessons learned in the persian gulf war of 1991 desert storm had seen national intelligence systems successfully supporting tactical operations and the emerging importance of precision guided weapons the air campaign revealed many shortcomings however in facilitating the rapid use of large quantities of information one air force historian described the major shortcoming as the difficulty of melding the us air force planning operations and intelligence functions into smoothly functioning team as potentially grave organizational flaw5 in the aftermath of desert storm the department of defense dod with strong congressional encouragement set about to remedy serious organizational flaws enhance reconnaissance capabilities and resolve intelligencerelated limitations communications links were established to allow information from satellites and other nationallevel collection resources to be used to support combat operations interoperability among surveillance and communications systems of the four services and various agencies was significantly improved virtually all observers have concluded that as result of these innovations intelligence support in kosovo operations was far more timely and effective than it had been in the persian gulf conflict there were reports that massive paper printouts had to be ferried around by helicopter because of inadequate communications as notoriously occurred during desert

limitations in weapon accuracy along with political pressure for fast results that led to the resort to widespread area bombing and subsequently nuclear attacks cold war nuclear planning also tended

daytoday operations will be optimized with accurate timely and secure information6 joint vision 2010 prepared by the joint chiefs of staff provided future conceptual framework of warfare the basis of which is found in the improved command control and intelligence which can be assured by information superiority7 it argued that in the coming century commanders will be able to attack targets successively with fewer platforms and less ordnance while achieving objectives more rapidly and with reduced risk individual warfighters will be empowered as never before with an array of detection targeting and communications equipment that will greatly magnify the power of small units 8 far removed from the concepts of massive retaliation and extended nuclear warfare that once characterized american defense policy current and future planning is dependent upon technological innovations to achieve dominant battlefield awareness information superiority precision engagement and dominant maneuver major goal is to employ evolving technologies to accomplish military objectives while minimizing noncombatant casualties and destruction of property9 so designed us forces are to be able to undertake successfully full spectrum of operations from counternarcotics to major regional conflicts with force structure considerably smaller and less costly than that maintained at the height of the

vehicles july 6 1999 reprinted in inside the air force july 16 1999 p 29 persisting problems ongoing defense planning presumes the availability of dominant battlefield awareness but as yet overall implementation plan has been established for achieving it the kosovo experience while successful in its outcome revealed important limitations in intelligence capabilitie s and demonstrated that information dominance in an operational sense has not been realized currently deployed technological capabilities could not ensure that information available to all parts of the intelligence community was consistent ly provided to military commanders in precise enough form for realtime targeting purposes in some cases delays of several hours precluded reactive strikes although information can be relayed to groundbased headquarters in many cases it cannot be linked directly to strike aircraft the need to relay it from the ground stations can preclude immediate response to ongoing enemy activity in some cases an inability to relay perishable intelligence made it impossible to prevent attacks on defenseless civilians10 kosovo operations made it evident that current reconnaissance assets were stretched very thinly11 manned reconnaissance aircraft capabilities center on u2s the highaltitude aircraft originally designed for overflights of the soviet union in the 1950s for imagery rivet joint boeing 707s configured as sigint collector s other radar and telemetry collection platforms and jstars aircraft with groundsearch radars u2s provided over 1300 hours of collection time collecting according to one air force source over 80 of the total imagery for operation allied force12 there are however only some thirtyfive u2s in the air force inventory and similar number of qualified pilots kosovo operations placed major constraints on the total force as did the need to detail pilots and support personnel from other regions13 in the aftermath of kosovo secretary of defense cohen acknowledged that we are at critical juncture in airborne reconnaissance14 in kosovo as in desert storm us and allied uavs performed admirably in collecting imagery without risking the

p 1 17 one other approach that has been attempted is the acquisition of reconnaissance pods ie sensor packages that can be attached to various types of aircraft thus permitting them to serve as reconnaissance platforms as needed key advantage is that they can preclude the need for dedicated reconnaissance aircraft naval units operating in the adriatic in support of kosovo operations included f14 aircraft with tactical airborne reconnaissance pods tarps the marine corps deployed three fa18d aircraft modified with advanced tactical airborne reconnaissance systems atars including electrooptical camera and infrared devices for night operations the planes will have data links that can relay digital imagery in real time to ground stations 18 the director of the national reconnaissance office nro has pointed out that in operation allied force newly designed joint targeting workstations were used to correlate satellite information with data derived from airborne platforms and feed targeting data directly to strike aircraft he noted however that the nro had had to field prototypes on rushcongress and the executive branch15 despite an estimated 2 billion in investment and several reorganizations only one uav system capable of extended operations the air forces global hawk is currently being acquired and one of two global hawk test vehicles crashed in march 1999 the air force expects to make final acquisition decision for global hawk in early fy2001 with recently reported goal of acquiring fleet of the uavs16 dod is attempting to come up with sensor configuration for global hawk that will meet most of the existing requirements without unduly adding to expense or delaying production schedules some view global hawks as replacements for the aging u2s and suggest accordingly that there is need to upgrade existing u2s or develop new manned platforms others argue that manned reconnaissance platforms will continue to have certain inherent advantages over uavs supporters argue that they can carry more diverse variety of sensors and point to the advantages of allowing pilot to maneuver based on his own observations17 the heavy demands currently placed on u2s throughout the world and the limited numbers of available uavs suggest that manned reconnaissance vehicles will have an important role for the foreseeable futures furthermore deployed shorter range uavs proved vulnerable to serbian attacks four of the eight air force predator uavs were lost as were four navy pioneer uavs and six or seven army hunter uavs these losses resulted in part from the fact that uavs flew at lower altitudes than manned aircraft although uavs are considered expendable the lost platforms will need to be replaced with comparable or more capable models reconnaissance satellites also provided valuable information during the kosovo campaign originally designed to acquire information on soviet missile and submarine sites for national

embarrassing intelligence failure the intended target was the yugoslav federal directorate of supply and procurement but that installation was confused by intelligence analysts with another building located block away that structure in turn was actually the chinese embassy even though us government maps indicated the embassy at former site some miles away the problem derived according to testimony before the house intelligence committee on july 22nd from an analysts mislocation of the yugoslav supply directorate and the absence of subsequent evaluation to discover the error us officials who did know the accurate location of the chinese embassy which was never target and thus not on any target list were not participants in the targeting review george tenet dci statement on the belgrade chinese embassy bombing house permanent select committee on intelligence open hearing 22 july 1999 20 dci statement p 5many observers conclude that intelligence resources devoted to providing better imagery and other data to tactical commanders have not kept pace with the increasing emphasis that is being placed on the use of precision weapons airborne reconnaissance platforms in particular have not been acquired in sufficient numbers to support the wide variety of postcold war missions that may be likely there is perception that given shrinking defense budgets since the late 1980s the services and dod have emphasized major weapons systems and somewhat deemphasized the systems that collect the data that is essential for their use certain kosovo operations also called into question the adequacy of intelligence data bases for precision attacks on stationary targets as well as procedures for designating targets on may 7th the chinese embassy in belgrade was mistakenly bombed as result of faulty database and inadequate coordination the resulting contretemps with beijing has led to realizati on that intelligence databases as currently maintained are inadequate19 the intelligence community has only recently begun to lay the foundation for maintaining global databases with for instance efforts to acquire civilian imagery and by launching new space mission to create more detailed topographical database for most of the earth dci tenet has acknowledged the problems surrounding this effort data base maintenance is one of the basic elements of our intelligence effort but it is also one that has suffered in recent years as our workforce has been spread thin some have suggested that this failure is the consequence of resource shortfalls more fundamental problem is not the absolute level of resources but the application of resources at our disposal we have diverted resources and attention away from basic intelligence and data base maintenance to support current

operations in kosovo limitations in intelligence capabilities during operation allied force resulted in budgetary adjustments that have been reflected in report language submitted by intelligence armed services and appropriations committees given the disparate nature of the programs as well as the fact that many are discussed in classified annexes to intelligence and defense authorization bills it is difficult to identify all the changes however the house appropriations committee expressed concern about deficiencies that have been well known for some time these include but are not limited to electronic warfare aircraft and specialized jamming equipmen t tactical intelligence collection and dissemination assets ranging from collection assets such as the u2 rivet joint awacs and jstars aircraft and tactical uavs interoperable secure communications and command and control to include new data links and data fusion capability the committee has consistently supported additions over dod budget requests for such programs over the years nevertheless continued shortages in these and many other categories clearly posed operational constraints during operation allied force this not only impeded the regional commands charged with prosecuting the air campaigns but also other regional commanders who were confronted with the physical diversion of assets from their areas of responsibility and other unexpected resource shortfalls21 as result the committee gave special consideration to intelligence and reconnaissance systems and provided 270 million above the

the u2s electrooptical reconnaissance system this illustrative and incomplete list of committee actions reflects the diversity of intelligence and intelligencerelated programs that congress authorizes and for which it appropriates funds some observers argue that the executive branch does not provide wellcoordinated package of reconnaissance programs that includes intelligence intelligencerelated and other systems and as result congressional committees find it necessary to make an excessive number of judgments cuts add ons and tradeoffs among wide variety of different proposals these adjustments they further maintain are necessarily taken in piecemeal ways the perceived need for congressional micromanagement allows inadequate opportunity to assess the implications of funding changes to individual reconnaissance efforts on other programs inasmuch as some reconnaissance programs are not under the jurisdiction of either intelligence committee tradeoffs between national and tactical systems eg between satellite collection and highaltitude uavs can be especially difficult to make given the disparate programs through which they are acquired the conference report hrept 106371 accompanying the fy2000 defense appropriations act pl 10679 that was submitted in early october 1999 underlined congressional concerns with acquisition and maintena nce of reconnaissance programs in the light of operations in kosovo the conferees provided an additional 15 million for global hawks but expressed concern about future funding of the program pointedly noting that using other intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance assets as bank from which to draw funds for the global hawk program would likely not serve the best interests of the department of defense23 the

stated its belief that inadequate planning for analysis and related functions cannot best be solved solely by hiring hundreds of additional imagery analysts although there will probably be need to

commercial imagery27 future trends beyond dealing with numbers of intelligence collection platforms some observers argue there needs to be different approach to providing the intelligence support in the types of military operations likely to occur in the next century there is an assumption that given the postcold war international environment the detailed knowledge of the battlespace now technically achievable can in effect substitute for the larger force structures and their organization and operational styles that long characterized american defense policy28 intelligence becomes an integral part of this approach but only if an extensive if not global data base is established and if intelligence producers can become more closely integrated into military operations in ways that have not yet been achieved29 undoubtedly essential is the creation of much more integrated intelligence grid that can be directly accessed by warfighters at national operational and tactical levels information from the grid will be fed directly into weapons systems used at all levels of warfighting direct constant access to intellige nce may however require even greater changes to existing organizational practices beyond those that have already been accomplished some observers argue for further consolidation of intelligence agencies suggesting that the distinctions between national

entities in each of the services are likely to be altered significantly major concern during kosovo operations was the difficulties in coordinating us and allied air forces it is clear that the united states has invested far more heavily than our allies in tactical reconnai ssance capabilities as well as in precision munitions observers have concluded that only the british and to some extent the french air forces could work closely in combined air operations with us forces given the us commitment to information warfare the gap in capabilities and tactics may increase significantly secretary cohen stated that we could not have carried out this operation alone great deal of this operation however rested on american capabilities the united states conducted virtually twothirds of all the support sorties that were flown and half of all combat missions and because we were the only country with precisionguided munitions that can operate in all weather heavy cloud cover in the initial stages of this campaign made it almost an exclusively american operation moreover id point out that not all of our allies possess the kind of communications gear thats required to maintain total security as result there were times when our pilots had to communicate over insecure lines and that allowed the serbs to perhaps intercept and make use of this source of information to compromise the effectiveness of the air campaign itself and put our pilots lives unnecessarily at risk31 european nato members continue to deploy sizable forces but they are structured to counter ground attack on alliance members observers suggest that the threat of ground attack on western europe is at best remote for decades to come more likely is european involvement in peacekeeping or peacemaking operations in various parts of the world including but not limited to the fringes of europe observersand some key nato officialsbelieve that for the same level of defense expenditures nato countries could create force structures much more useful for the probable postcold war environment further they argue that the innovative technologies now adopted by the united states could be acquired by the european nato states while they are not inexpensive they are far less expensive than maintaining large standing forces32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30366crs12 with ongoing and planned changes in us forces that emphasize information dominance and precision weapons it will be increasingly difficult to manage combined operations european nato forces with exceptions may be limited to support roles while us troops are directly engaged in combat operations observers believe that such an imbalance may be unsettling to the american people as well as limiting overall military capabilities there are not insuperable gaps between us and european intelligence collection capabilities indeed european forces are already making regular use of uavs and manned reconnaissance aircraft and there are plans under consideration for european reconnaissance satellite capability overall collection capabilities however remain significantly more limited than those of us forces and there are considerable problems of connectivity and interoperability with us systems it is not clear however that european members of nato are as yet prepared to make the necessary investments and adjustments to ensure that they have adequate intelligence and communications systems that are interoperable with us systems many allies have not as yet demonstrated serious intent to implement natos recently adopted defense capabilities initiative that is centered around more mobile and sustainable forces adapted to postcold war missions it is in the us interest to promote greater interoperabili ty with european nato forces but most observers conclude that european acquisition of better reconnaissance capabilities and precision munitions will take an extended period at best and is only partially subject to us influence conclusion the bombing campaign in kosovo and serbiaresulting in serbian withdrawal and almost allied casualties was testimony to the intelligence capabilities acquired by us forces in recent years combined with precision munitions at the same time the campaign suggests that these capabilities are limited in quantity and that should significant hostilities occur in two separate regions intelligence resources could be inadequate furthermore much remains to be done if the available technology is to be deeply embedded in defense capabilities of the united states and its nato allies given the expectations of the public resulting from the kosovo and persian gulf experiences that postcold war hostilities can be successfully concluded with minimal allied losses and limited collateral damage many observers expect that there will be an increasing emphasis on investments in intelligence technologies as well as on the reorganizatio n of intelligence capabilities to apply them to tactical level warfighting congress has not however received comprehensive plan for achieving these desired capabilities
