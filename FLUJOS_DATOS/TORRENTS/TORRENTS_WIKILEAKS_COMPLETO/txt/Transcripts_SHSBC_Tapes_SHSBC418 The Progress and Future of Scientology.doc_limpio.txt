the progress and future of scientology lecture given on 16 march 1965 thank you thank you whats the date audience 16 march sixteen march sixteen march ad 15 saint hill special briefing course well didnt bring my notes guess ive got to get another gag than that onenobody laughs at it anymore this has been mad mad sprint this is mad sprint back in 1950 people used to yammer at and yammer at of course i knew how to administer and administration in general they used to yammer at why dont you do something about the organization yap yap yap yap you know arc break arc break well why dont you just drop everything youre doing and go in there and push desk very important you push desk and all of thisall of this added up to big bunch of nonsense in the first place i got caught absolutely flatfooted in 1950 completely flatfooted wrote book published on march the 9th anniversary of it has just gone by dianetics the modern science of mental health i was even contracting at the time to go on and do some stories and novels and so forth and i had for number of years paid for all research and so forth out of my own money or my productsthe products of writing and there i was minding own business and the book hit nobody ever expected this book to be bestseller and it went instantly and immediately to the top of the bestseller list and it just stayed there and stayed there and stayed there and stayed there had lousy publisher he was caught flatfooted too he was an excommie hes still alive over in new york he tries occasionally to put out timid paw in my direction and when i dont instantly answer up he arc breaks like crazy finally hco sec ny was able to get in touch with him the other day and its all good roads and good weather now but it actually blew him off of his post it blew him out of his own publishing firm because nobody expected it and his publishing firm was rigged to publish books and make little money and all of sudden it found itself with too much money to deal with and there were just these thousands and tens of thousands of dollars rolling in the front door of that place and they had one of the biggest book publishers in the country and yet they still couldnt turn out enough books everybody was short of books short of books short of books short of books and it was just too much confusion whatever the political allegiances and other things of the people concerned and so forth it was just too much nobody was braced for this at all next thing i knew right after the book was published and so forth bunch of chaps came down to see and told theyd fixed up foundation for and all was going to be well and they would run all this that was in essence what it was that moment i took my finger off my number and i said all right its all right with and oddly enough at those very first meetings some actions were proposed by which we just now are getting the completed cycle of action on and for lack of whichand for lack of which everything has been appetite over tin cup but i had one vote amongst eight or nine orive forgotten how many it was and it was just by dint of personality i tried to hold the thing together you never heard so much squirreling and messup and so forth in your life and i didnt have any management controlnothing as matter of fact at that timeyou may find it hard to credit perhapsbut i was totally anonymous as far as anything but the author of the book was concerned i had number of us senators interested in this as matter of fact i had the senate dining room one dayi had lots of friends down there in those days still would have if i went down and stuck my nose in every time i do why they all say hey ron where the hell have you been you know whats the matter you mad at something like that id say oh ive been busy and i had the senate dining room down there one noon i remember along about this period and you could have heard toothpick fall from one end of it to the other i was simply telling people abouta group of scientists had foundyou see your effort to leave it anonymous and that sort of thing is well borne occasionally why you dont want to use the word or something like this or youre being timid and yet i was telling them somebody had found the dynamic principle of existence and i was telling people what it was and so forth and that place was jammed from one corner to the other with senators and so forth the next thing you know the table outside of the perimeter of the table i was sitting at with three or four old senators and the table outside that went silent and the table outside that went silent and the table outside that went silent and the next thing you know there waswasnt anything happening in that dining room the waiters were standing there see darnedest thing you ever wanted to see you know and i said gee i said ive got bear by the tail here you know that was actually before anything much had occurred they had never heard of this book or anything but i said well i just write the stuff up you know and actually that was my attitude until about july of 1950 oh i justjust wrote it and i wasnt making any commotion i wasnt promoting my writing name actually writer seldom promotes his own writing name anyhow namesnames of course to are very very indifferent things after all im very well known under about six pen names you see so names dont mean much its the guy that was important but this name this name this one name started to move up and hit in the face dont you see ive worn it very pleasantly and so forth since it isnt that l ron hubbard is pen name it happens to be my own name but this name this name was strictly exclamation points you see around the place and i was trying not to wear that hat and finally the fellow who was serving as general manager at that timei was having to do fantastic things i was putting the place together with my bare handseverybody else was running around being important im working stiff myself i wouldnt quite know what it is to be sedentarytype desk flyer you know just flying desk as an executive you see sitting theresitting there at zero mph going madly down the carpet you know and i wouldnt quite know what that was and i was all over the place and i think i was delivering eight hours of lecture day or something of that sort i was teaching about three or four courses i was buying all the furniture putting everything together id had to go out and find the building myself because id found out the reason they couldnt find building is they went around and told everybody with poor mouth well were just charity organization we cant pay very much i kept saying gee but man were expanding weve got to get out of here you know oh ive been trying everywhere and so i said to parker you come along with i said im certain that there are buildings in this city and that was what he was telling people were just charity organization and we cant pay very much we dont have very much money money my god the doors were falling in with money and i just cut him off and just scolded him right in froright in front of the building owner of the building we were standing in you know what do you mean telling people lies like that youve got to conquer that habhabit of yours parker telling people lies like that turned around to the fellow and said weve got plenty of money i said give the keys to the place how much did you say it was oh yes well give the keys to the place because were moving in this afternoon and the fellow says well the lease and so on well i said thats your lookout i took the keys out of his hand and we were intointo our original headquarters and there were three mainline railroad trains which went one on each corner of the building in triangle and thats why youthats why you see to this day the dianetic symbol in our shield you can just imagine it you can just imagine well anyway i remember i had been sweating it out working away tearing around giving the lectures and also ran the hgc to the degree that any time an auditor had any difficulty with ease he brought the case into my office and i banged him down on the couch and got the case started handed him back to the auditor and roll em i used to crack cases pangetypangetypangetypangetypang you see and then run off and give another lecture and so forth and gave night course and the original the original has course mockup which you have now is the original elizabeth mockup pe came much later and that was simply that for certain fee number of people could take rather long elementary indefinite course but they were definitely definitely taught exact data and they were taught exact data out of book onedianetics the modern science of mental health they were just taught this book it wasnt somebody lecturing about how nice life wasthey were just told this data you see and engrams and locks and that sort of thing were described to them and so forth and those people all moved over hundred percent onto the original hca course well it was fantastic id give this abouti think it ran about three nights week and so forth its what youd see now as an equivalent of the has course see it was an academy course it wasnt pe these students were given full student responsibility dont you see they werent given very much auditing but they were given some and so on now the first real blow along this sort of thing came when i got ahold of the elizabeth auditors and i called them together in staff meeting i used to have lots of staff meetings and it was query on my part what do you want to call yourselves all right with to call yourselves anything what do you want to call yourselves and they said well soandso and theyd get lot of suggestions they didnt discuss it there they were going to have meeting so that they could decide on this you see and they had to get the angeles auditors little bit later this was not decided for some time by the way and they got the angeles auditors to have staff meeting to decide what they were going to call themselves dont you see and they came back with hubbard dianetic auditor and i said hubbard dianetic auditor all right hubbard dianetic auditor okay i could see myself walking into something here you see its all right with you boys want to call yourselves that all right and angeles flickerflacked back and forth on the telegraphs and so forth and theyhubbard dianetic auditor that was passed i didnt have anything to do with it oddly enough many years later we tried to drop this name and it was very peculiar but all of sudden we had completely empty school and nobody wanted the other certificate and there were students of any kind and eventually when the certificate was reoffered again in scientology i think it was hubbard scientology auditor and so forth we instantly had full academy so these boys had good instinct on this and they knew what they were doing but they didnt want to be known as anything else now the point is that i at that time was trying towell i after all had body to run andthis is back in 1950and i had body to run and it was bad show because i wasnt getting any sleep and i wasnt getting very much to eat and that sort of thing and i had very amusing story goes in connection with this because just before the 9th of march i had beenrun into chap by the name of palmer over at the explorers club who had just had to drop an expedition and it was an expedition to the dodecanese some islands which are just south of greece to dig up ship which lies in thirty fathoms of water down there which is full of statuary from greece and its roman ship of roman times and there might be something in there by some boy like praxiteles or something like that dont you see so he had run into at the club and oh hiya ron i havent got much time to talk to you do you want an expedition i said do i want an expedition whats the matter with you and he said well you know thatthat thing ive been talking about of going over to the dodecanese and so forth well thats all off the ecuadorian governmentthe ecuadorian government has got an exploration that they want to conduct down there and as matter of fact ive got to go right now andoh by the way heres all the pack of materials and all the appointments and the visas and everything that goes along with this and so forth and its all yours ron well oddly enough interestingly enough it was really an even swap because right at the middle of the beginning of world war ii why the ecuadorian government had in connection with the explorers club up there had gotten in touch with fellow by the name of james robert gresham and jimmy gresham couldnt think of anybody to take to ecuador but the ecuadorian government offered him fifty thousand square miles of ecuador if he could go in and find out who was in that territory and we were going to go down there but i unfortunately had commission in the navy and there was war on anyway this all sounds very involved but here the thing came back to again palmer walks into the explorers club hes all excited hes going down to ecuador see theyre still looking for somebody to go in and get his head lost so theres thetheres the packet he says theres the packet it was just before the publication of the first book i said this is pretty interesting go on down there and do some deepsea diving only thirty fathoms of waterwhat do you know nice warm dodecanese and so on so i started writing around to people and connected them as the heir apparent to this expedition and started to whip it up and there was money available and there was everything else those lines are still hanging there not quite connected but actually if you could imagine it i was thinking still in the middle of 1950 of occasionally nibbling around about this expedition you know it sounded awful good and the deeper we got into 1950 the better it looked and one day the general manager after big board meeting and so forth got in touch with and he says ron he says youve got to front up here youve got to front up to these people he says theyre depending on you and so forth well i wasnt doing anything thats not fronting up i was just working like mad and wasnt paying much attention to theto the figurehead on something i was still telling people this sort of thing and he said you must do that and ibah well there goes yourany liberty or freedom of motion you have dont you see on something like this and i shook my head and in the interimbetween the times seeing theyre just about two hours apart these times arei found out that joe winter was using the fact of my aggattributing the development of the subject to nebulous group of nonexistent scientists to squirrel the whole cockeyed lot and we had some kind of wild cross goingmind you this was working subject this was not an unworking subject at all and we hadwe had cases snapping out of it and we had people coming in and going out shouting three cheers and that sort of thingit was just good straight dianetics and it wasnt very soon there im starting to getstarting to get difficulties with cases starting to run into cases which were being audited in some peculiar way i was getting somebody there who was telling people that auditing is an art there is nothing scientific about it you can imagine somebody telling that you can imagine somebody telling students that wideopen invitation to walk around and do gestalt therapy while they eat candy or something and not do anything for anybody well that was the state that mental health was in at the time of the emergence of dianetics nobody had anything done for them it was everybody had some kind of weird opinion i remember they had something running called psychodrama in those days and it sure is but these subjects were all pretense subjects dont you see you listen to them they read awful good in the books but i have the last textbook that was published by psychology which was uninfluenced by dianetics and i took it off the line with own little pink hand down at the american book bindery because it came off the lineit was the basic textbook of psychology for this university of chicago and it rolled off the line and the last copy of that binding went off the line as the first copy of dianetics came on so i just turned around to the girl who was in charge and i said do you mind and picked up the copy right off the binder rollers i said do you mind if i take this book go ahead she was after all making her fortune off of so perfectly all right and i have that book to this day actually it was insufficiently dried so its cover is warped but so is its contents and i picked up that booki picked up that book for evidence for evidence because i knew that the book following just behind it was never going to afterwards have straight picture of what psychology was i knew that and its got mans iq cannot be changed hes an unchanging animal heswe dont know anything about what the psyche is and therefore we cant give you proper definition for psyche you see its got all that stuff in it dont you see well i didnt want thisi didnt want dianetics being influenced to that degree and it occurred to then and there that there was some truth in what the general manager of the elizabeth foundation was saying to and i was still bit queasy about this though it seemed to like you know saying all right positively and completely owning up to the truth of it is i wrote it all i did it all its been in the works since 1938 dont you see thatthat was brave statement so he backed up against the wall about two hours after the first meeting and he says well he says have you decided he says because this is probably going to be very crucial point and i said yes ive decided all right you can tell them i did it all and so i talked from that viewpoint thereon which is of course the truthful viewpoint and it was very reluctant that i took over thesethis type of hat and responsibility because i knew that all hell was going to break loose and boy did it there was some gal who had left forever for instance down in savannah georgia the year before and somewhere toward the beginning of thatof the year just previously hearing things were in the wind she had turned up and i couldnt get rid of her i hadnt anything to do with her i wasnt anything you see navynaval officers being naval officers accumulate baggage my life was not prepared to be wideopen book i had been writer all my life i have livedi had lived in greenwich village and so forth as matter of fact my life was sufficiently incredible that i seldom wrote stories about it because they were too unbelievable and i used to actually have to lie about my life because i was accustomed to boys of my own age or young people or writers of my own age and so forth sitting there you know and just calling bloody liar id tell them the truth you see well it didnt payit didnt pay so what you did is water it all down dont you see the truth of the matter was prettypretty exclamatory sort of point existence my adventures did not take place in my own textbooksin my own that is to say my own fiction stories they took place in the raw and this sort of thing is very easy to catch up with if youre preparing for the seminary and so forth why dont live the life of the pirate if youre going to go before committee of evidence make sure you have clean nose for number of years or at least since the last amnesty well nobody issued any amnesties this girlthis girl she was hammering and pounding around the place and so forth and there were psychologists all over the place the commies decided they were going to take us out of the running and atat that time the definition of psychotic person was one who thought the communists were after him they had carefully planted this in the mores of the society which is very interesting definition i dont know we may do the same thing someday its very successful when we want to get somebody why we just spread it around you see the definition of psychotic is somebody who thinks the scientologists are after him you know and then we promptly go after him im afraid we wouldnt do anything that bold we dont have to but when things were really blowing upit was quite interesting that when i approached the justice department concerning the state of our organizations and so forth and gave them list of two hundred and some names and asked them to please tell which of these people were known as subversive agents they counteredj edgar hoovers boy therecountered and he said he said ill give you back the names who are not communists and therefore i myself wont be hung with the fact of having given any state information to anybody people like to weave the idea that im in bad here or there or people think badly of and that sort of thing and that is notdefinitely not the ease see if i were in washington in 1955 if i cared to work at it i probably could have wangled legislation protecting scientology its quite the reverse picture dont you see these guys i go in to see them evenwell today id go in washington see the guys thatoh yes gosh how are you you know gee you know and the letters i receive on my business lines and that sort of thing oh thank you thank you for writing us dont you see very courteous and so on the atmosphere which has been built up in some peoples minds you see is theres something not quite nice or theres something not quite right about being scientologist oh thats just an operation thats nonsense right at the top right at the top i hear nothing but the snap of the right index finger touching the cap brim wherever i go its very interesting the situation is very good where we are but in those days it was equally good and the fbi was very nice about this and out of two hundred and some names they turned back thirty my press relations man during that period of time was not just communist he was actually wanted by the fbi and they actually put their hands on him and put him away very short time afterwards revenge was taken against these people that we were never told about actually the fbi rounded the worst of them up some of them fled to mexico some of them did this but these were people who were really kicking our heads in they were robbing officesoh its very incredible there were couple of murders this is wild and lurid time im talking about well of course everybody says well you couldnt you know the everybody says heoh well they mustve had something very wrong and so forth yes there was something very wrong the most forward philosophy of the world thats making the most progress is communism and it met itsit met its match and it recognized that it had met its match democracy as philosophy had gone completely flat and stale there wasnt any religious backwash you see against any expansion they didnt have any opponent anywhere on the line and they were under orders at that particular time to infiltrate all social and domestic groups dont you see to do this that and the other thing and subvert things they had everything running their own way it was all fine all of sudden somebody stands up and he says theres another philosophy in the world and they went to work on that fast now you think all right after this length of time its very hard to believe it but i was the guy whoswas hearing the bullets go snap past his ear murder sudden death reads likereads likewell i dont know james bond in the tamer pages i rescued woman who had been electric shocked half to death and was so drugged she couldnt even open up her eyes they had tried to get her to swear out warrant to get committed an airplane was ticking over at an airportthis is incredible stuffan airplane was ticking over at an airport to pick up and fly to st louis put in spinbin where i would never be heard of again interesting the two boys who were sent to pick up and so forth unfortunately had not been as well trained in the science of combat as myself thats right they speak once in while of pistolwhipping well there is where the pistolwhipping occurred i wasnt pistolwhipped i said this is just too confounded thick i dont know who my friends are i dont know who my enemies are i dont know anything about anything all i know is i want to get the book im writing on finished so i just withdrew from the whole scene i know ive left you with definite impression that there were lot of things going on that you have not been informed of but i can assure you that there were lot of things going on that i was never fully informed of all i know is that i had taken over my hat rightly and the second i stood in to the run wearing own hat hard and heavy that is to say i am all hell broke loose and i was trying to hold the fort its taken the better part of fifteen years to where foothold could be put in to point where that hat can be worn in this society because its hat of course that speaks about freedom and it speaks about the betterment of man and it speaks about this sort of thing that you dont have to be slave it assaults the very foundations you see of your economic systems it assaults the very guts of the foundation we live in this is another philosophy entirely different philosophy philosophy that you cant bepeople cant be lied to theywe can see through the magic spells dont you see the black magic spells being woven this is civilization where some entheta kid sitting in government chair telling everybody how bad it all is over there and so forth can all of sudden get thirty million people killed as one fellow named hitler did this is an interesting civilization and thats because people dont know who they are or what they are where theyre going or what theyre doing all right you start laying the truth on the line and its liable to blow off bit of confusion all you got to do is put in stable datum and the confusion starts to blow off in the early days of dianetics and this is the early beginnings of scientology of course as it was the same exact moment well this didnt violate that rule bit and you hear lot about things going on this way and things going on that way and what happened there and wasnt it all terrible and so forth we got through just because of one thing as i finally in july of that year in spite of the turbulence and everything listened to peoples pleas along this line and i wore my hat of being and nobody has ever been able to throw off of that line since and theres been lot of triesa lot of tries and its very very very turbulent but being able to stand up and say youre yourself and you did it and yes im the fellow who wrote the book yes im the fellow who dreamed it up yes im the fellow who leads this group and dont qualify any way shape or form dont go putting yourdont go backing up and saying well as matter of fact i am gods anointed child on earth and god you see god appeared to in dream and all of his lightning bolts you see are going to hit if you dont accept this fact this is perfectly all right to be somebodys deputy if he exists but how about dreaming one up how about dreaming up source to be deputy of perfectly all right to be deputy i myself found out to mygreatly to my relief many many years before dianetics and so onthat i was very good subordinate i found out i was excellent and i took great deal of pride in this because most of my life up to that time i had been solely and entirely in command and i began to wonder if there was something wrong with if i was the kind of fellow who only had to be in command was i the kind of fellow that couldnt be anyplace else but in charge you see because i had these chaps around you know fellows who couldnt be anything else and one day i was appointed to very subordinate post and i had several officers in echelon immediately above i wasnt even really in charge of section dont you see i was just subordinate with capital s and you know after aafter quite while on that post and so forth i suddenly looked at it and wondered why i was so pleased with myself i was just grinning at myselfid look at myself in the mirror and find myself grinning you know and it was just because i was perfectly well qualified to be subordinate and everybody was happy with as subordinate and they knew that things got done my commanding officer in that particular instance would wave his hand in my direction and say hubbard soandso and soandso you know and hubbard would go do soandso fix it up just like he said you know embellishments took all the privileges of subordinates you know privilegeprivileges of subordinate is to goof you know to goof on occasion you dont have anything to do why dont do anything you know i remember the co of this particular instance used to leave at ten oclock in the morning we were lying in dock and there was particular reason under the sun moon and stars to be around the ship and i think i had about sixty ensigns and he used to come in in the morning id be there about eight oclock and straighten everything out and he used to come in about nine oclock something like that and then hed hit the beachnautical termhed hit the beach you see with his cap and his raincoat on and so forth and go home and read hisread his pipe or something and so when he walked in hed give whole string of orders ratatat tatatat tatatat tat as matter of fact he was dead wrong it was the lousiest sort of subordinatizing see whereby the top man is skipping his secondincommand because you are effective and efficient and the secondincommand is not effective and efficient and this is being made plain to the secondincommand by the top man you know i mean one of these unbearable situations you know so the old man would walk in hed give whole string of orders and id go around and give all the ensigns their hotwater bottles to rush from here to there or whatever it was turn out the men running in the divisions having an inspection and that sort of thing the old man hit the beach i think about ten oclock and ten fifteen id look around see everybody was working so forth put two or three of my chiefs alert on the situation pat everybody on the back get on my white capwhite topped cap and my raincoat pick up my briefcase hit the beach one dayeverything was running like apple pie order you see the men knew if they got in trouble why theyd be in trouble so nobody ever got in trouble and so forth and probably there were dozens of them beneath in these hundreds and hundreds of men and so forth that also probably hit the beach at ten thirty dont you see and one day at ten fifteen i was clattering down the steps ready to go ashore it was in big administration building what we were doing was putting ship in commission and all of sudden whythat mans name by the way was roger edison perry captain usn see old line and perry you know that is the perry and he was ahe was descendent along these lines and he was really he was really all navy but actually prince of guy and my god hes forgotten something and there i am almost to the bottom of the steps dressed for shore and there he is coming back to get his briefcase or something of the sort so he says well hubbardum he said are you going over to the ship uh i said sir he said are you hittingare youyou got conference over with theumbuilding constructor or something i said sir and so well what are you doing he says dressed up and so forth and i said im going ashore captain and he said well this is uhthis is just rare occasion christ he didnt want to offend meive been running his whole ship for him he says thisthisthis is just rare occasion he said youre justyou have some errand of your own i said sir captain i do this every day and he squirmed and he said well he said well all right he said but you shouldnt make it so obvious very funny anywayanyway the business of becoming subordinate or being able to occupy subordinate role was something that i was very happy to be able to do but to occupy topdog role which is all the way up you know theres government or god or something of the sort or any mystic vision back of you and not even galactic empire status dont you seecouldnt even reassume one of your old identities on the whole track and saying well we once owned this you know we once owned this empire and so forth and just to be able to stand up in the howling winds of space you know that sort of thing and confront everything simultaneously and stand there regardless of the dead cats the alarm clocks the bricks and everything else which are coming your way that took some doing and thats all you look at when you look at this early history and so forth it is simply stable datum going into very very aberrated world the truth of the matter is although events of the world are moving ahead at very giddy pace and although there appear to be lot of risky things going on in the world the world is really better place because we are in it you see things have changed weve changed the whole face of psychology for instance we changed thethere are people around who know that we exist now at time of course could anybody have done this all by himself it would take once in while early staffs and that sort of thing tooktook real beating im well aware of one incident where they held off thei think eighteen or twenty philadelphia policemen and so forth who had come to arrest as witness in bankruptcy nobody could ever get anything on i never did anything but they can arrest and put in jail the witness in bankruptcy suit which is federal dont you see and the staff at that time in philadelphia and so forth when they first saw these cops starting to load up and load into the place and couple of federal marshals and that sort of thing simply held them off barehanded insisted that they should show their cards and should do this and should do that and these guys started to get cross with them and the next thing you know there was battle royal man and gave an opportunity to catch my breath and i finallyi dont know what would have happened and by the time the federal marshals came up to where i was they were shaking so badly and they were so upset and demoralized you know theyd had an awful time getting through that outer perimeter that i took the gun out of one of thems hand and put it in his holster because i said youre nervous they were completely demoralized they took downtown and i had to stand around for while and get finger printed and so forth and they didnt dare do anything because i hadnt done anything and then they found out thered been dreadful mistake you never saw federal judges and marshals and that sort of thing quite as embarrassed because theyd been told an awful lot of lies from the wichita foundation which of course was squirrel outfit which had continued on bad old days the bad old days well i was out of there in time at all i mean i had people this way and this way in other words people were standing up for here there and everyplace dont you see and anybody trying to do anything to was wading in through death but from where i looked it looked awful lonesome occasionally it takes some doing it takes some doing and we operated very well and have ever since in sort of ragged sort of way as fairly compact group and its only been that that its been possible to go ahead and make the progress weve made in society well you may not think were making too much progress in this society and so forthwell to get back to what i was going to tell you in the first place is we never started all weve been doing is standing still waiting for the flatirons and dead cats to sort of clear out of the air because just putting in stable datum of dianetics just putting in stable datum of this particular character blew off enough confusion in this society so that itd make it possible after while for us to move for long time it was impossible to hold position very fixedly or straight very very impossible and theres where you see the early foundations moving this is just standard phenomena they moved from here to there to the other place dont you see we used to have an axiom that it took about two years for the flatirons to catch up with us you see and after about two years why there wasnt anything more you could do in that locale and sure enough that was about the time lag it wasit was tough but we were in actual fact as an organizationi was standing there as beingbut as an organization and so forth we couldnt stand up to everything that came our way dont you see now i may have given you the impression that weve made progress and so forth my whole idea throughout this entire time was to go on and do my researches finish it up and deliver deliver the goods in spite of every interruption and so forth to eventually come out the other end with ease progress for every ease that came under anybodys nose that it could be done easily and so forth and i devoted my time exclusively to research and i paid attention at all to the brickbats and the dead cats let them fly see well maybe that was rough on people but actually the group has constantly more or less been asking to stand up like the general manager did so that he could save his board dont you see back in 1950 the group has been asking to stand up and actually direct an advance line into the society and instead of that i have been sitting back fixing up the general situation of technology and so forth so that it could be delivered ive somehow or other kept the organizations running and functioning in spite of all these other things that ive not concentrated on that at all ive puttaken lots of time and lots of energylots of time lots of energyin pushing around communication lines and writing things for organizations working for and working in organizations but the bulk of my time was spent on research now you have to have something to hold up there you have to have accomplishment and you have to be able to deliver now we could deliver to some limited degree in the early daysin the early days the reason we didnt delivernow now getplease get this very straight and thats why i was telling you about early enturbulencesthe reason we didnt deliver is because there wasnt any way to enforce the way to do it do you understand you could give somebody some directions but he did them wrong and that kept the whole of scientologydianetics rather that days that kept the whole of them enturbulated now howd it keep them enturbulated thats because by unstraight technology improperly administered their cases did not make an advance do you follow thered been enough very bad auditing here there and so forth to upset people here there and so on and there wasnt any way you could discipline the administration of the technology now you have to have two things in order to discipline the administration of technology three things actually first you have to have the technology you cant be pushing hidden standards off on somebody he doesnt know what the technology is and youre raising hell with him for not using it you see you cant do that so you have to have the technologyand you have to be able to make that technology known in other words your instructional materials and that sort of thing and the publication of the technology has to be very good and the third step is you have to be able to police its use in other words make sure that its that technology thats being applied now there is the one two three of an organization whether it is in administration whether it is in technology or in any other way we put stable datum into the world lt was of course completely impossible to have finished off all the technology and so forth by 1949 published it in an orderly fashion in 19well you could do this maybe if you were talking about new design for kiddiecars you see but not for gods sakes something that required the entire experience of group and it required its entire contact and so forth with society you couldnt just say well here it is in all orderly fashion now go ahead and do it i mean thats the ideal the unthinking ideal but we live in very real world and i upset some of you when i talk to you about getting arrested and fighting and all this sort of thing but the truth of the matter is is we arent just an idea see you have to differentiate between nice philosophy lying in book disturbing nothing on shelfnot even reading itselfand bringing individuals live human beings up to point of recognition of their own beingness now that is live action thats totally live as an action now we dont look at it because its much easier to face concept or an idea than it is to face living breathing entity and from 1950 forward we were living breathing entity from about july when i took over to the degree of saying all right ill stand up to it all right we will push it through up to that time we could be very nice excitement that people would leave alone or not leave alone or something like that and we didnt have to be very serious about it but lot of people were being serious about it dont you see matter how it was stated lot of people were being serious about it and we then were live breathing thing and we werent just an idea and if you get an idea if you think that 1950 was just somebody who well he just wrote book and people took exception to the ideas or there was some trouble about the ideas or this guy was not well braced to take over such standard horribly prominent point in the spotlight of existence and that was all that happened you have an entirely wrong concept of the situation we were live breathing things amongst you see and the point is we were not at any time along the line anything else we werent philosophy going through the society we were beings and when we first started up the line it was the enturbulation of the trillions which began to blow and it was pretty much just asking people to confront their banks it was pretty muchpretty tough and nobody was in really steady state while being better than the man on the street alongside of him nobody was in any very steady stable state and when people processed each other there wasnt any way to really get the straight information for this and therefore they didntwerent able as you are able today to run out your overts and ptps and feel lot better bang you see oh they didnt have this technology we had to fight our way up in very aberrated state we had more ways to knock out the whole track than we did to knock out or even know about our little overt in the last hour didnt even know about it we didnt havewe didnt have weapons at that particular time we had lot of technology we had more than man ever dreamed of but that wasnt very damn much and we had started at that time to make hole you might say in the conglomerate and collective aberration of mankind remember it was livingness that was making that hole we were live beings it wasnt the principles making the hole you see it was we applying them and pulling ourselves up somehow or another off the rug or lower rough having to stand in therenot really the good tools yet dont you see and not the communication and administration lines necessary to enforce those tools we had the squirrel processes that were run the guys that were halfspun by them and so forth its fantastic back chapter but remember youre looking at living being now its good way to say well its all rons fault that it didnt all go smoothly thats right youre perfectly absolutely right i should have been an ot who came to earth and got ahold of somebody named moses and said hey moses heres some rules now you go back off and front for there is anything wrong with that story can you imagine somebody doing that if he was capable of all that power heyhey moses heres your ten commandments moses dont let your people sell bad pig to each otheronly sell it to strangers this guy this didnt happen it just required more raw nerve to stand up by yourself itd have been best if id come in here from arcturus you see as an ot and simply said men that isnt the way it happened that isnt the way it happened it was up out of the ditch and by the bootstraps and i should not go around saying well of course im just very ordinary and very common and so forth im probably very extraordinary who knows i recall pieces of my own backtrack that certainly look extraordinary reason to invalidate myself along the line but the truth of it is we were living beings and we moved up into the teeth of every aberration in the society almost simultaneous at one fell swoop and the confusion that blew off was so fantastic that asits taken fifteen years just to stabilize our position organizationally where we could stand still and resist the brickbats which came our way now that is an evolutionary step which is vital to the growth of any organization and we are through it very rough we won at any time we could have gone appetite over tin cup we could have finished we have been within an ace of it time and time and time again philadelphialook at the frailty of it crazy fool wants to seize all of dianetics can you imagine some dumb fool trying to seize all of dianetics well look it over what was dianetics you say well dianetics was book or copyright oh dianetics was bunch of living beings he wanted to seize all this oh he couldnt seize all that it was not possible to hold so he goes and tells the federal marshals and so forth that theres bankruptcy suit in which this man is vital witness and hes about to leave the united states so youd better arrest him so that he can testify in court crazy things dont you see the mans dead hes very dead nobody could survive the overts which he pullednot just that overt but the many overts hes very dead i dont think that it was accidental because his first love was money and suzie was talking to inland revenue that were trying to get her to pay someor internal revenue was trying to get her to pay some wild taxes of some kind or another hundred and twentyfive thousand dollars worth of owed taxes on the old foundation and she just looked him straight into the eye and says well we dont owe you this and as matter of fact and gave this mans name and said he was the fellow who made the money off of it and if hes claiming this as taxes youre never going to get it off him hes clever she just put the finger right straight on him shes very sweet girl and internal revenue said the hundred and twentyfive thousand dollars he was claiming off his taxes for his expenses in trying to wreck dianetics they declared that his activity in dianetics was hobby all the money he lost trying to run this squirrel foundation that dianetics was hobby with him and therefore he had to pay all the taxes he paid he had to the tide of that sort of thing you see one day hes perfectly able to present suits and so forth and get you arrested and the next thing you know all you have to do is tell the government well it actuallythats the man that owes you the money and they go over and collect it off of him now thats symptom of the turning tide thats the only reason ive mentioned these two things at one moment its just the breath of whisper seehalf the cops in philadelphia are down and picking you up and fighting with the foundation and ohhhh you see all kinds of things like this few years roll by and you say thats the man and they go over say were going to arrest you unless you pay up see the tide turns the tide turns its been gradually turning just to that degree thats more dramatic thing the people that in 1950 were having such ball wiping their feet on us and that sort of thing well actually you could sort of cry to see some of those people today not that it was us particularly it was just theyit wasthey look in the same shape as somebody who had tackled ten thousandvolt power line but it was collective power line that theysee it wasnt just one power line they look pretty bad one of them is living as beachcomber i hear rumors of this character now and then so forth i havent got the slightest bit of rancor as far as these people are concerned as matter of fact i feel little bit bad about it occasionally and so forth but they just made headon collision going to stop us in our tracks dont you see hahaha they got holes in the back of their heads now theyre laughing out of dont you see the society at large in other words hasfirst the people who attacked us any of the people connected with those early days those people are gone theyre either dead or theyre in terrible condition as the institutions which attacked us are weaker you see this tide has turned we can now hold our position we have for some time now been holding our location in space organizationally we are able now to instruct in the right way to do something and it gets applied and we do that it gets result were able to hold our own comm lines were able to bring it up to point where today i can calmly release bulletin and say theres new set of comm lines and they are soandso and soandso and i know they will go in and were sufficiently this way in that that we can say in uncertain terms that our organizational form takes this shape and its mostlywhat shape do we want it to take rather than what shape have we got to take were dictating our form now this is big change this is big change so 1950 i said it will go as far as it works and it wont go any further than it works and were going to hold the fort here and were justthis is holding operation and i well knew thatinstinctivelythat the brickbats were going to come over hot thick fast and furious you see the stable datum going into an aberrated society and the confusion is going to blow off i just did my work from that point on working it out with the experience with people and things holding the fort getting gradually the lines in getting gradually greater security getting gradually little more forward motion and all the time working on research it will go as far as it works and actually it wont go another inch further so when people have said to why dont you get in there and administer and people have said to why dont you bang and hammer and pound away atat despatches and why dont you do this sort of thing for fifteen years i have known it would go as far as it worked and it wouldnt go another inch further than that thats all and an organization will be as rich as they make it work and things will be as smooth as it is working and the individual will be as good as it has worked on him and he will be surrounded by those who as good as he has been able to make it work on them and thats all youve said it all so it goes as far as it works so at this particular time i am in the rather interesting and fantastic position of being able to calmly put in the organizational structure and to work hammer and tongs which i am working right nowsomething on the order of maybe as much as eighteen hours dayon putting in the administrative form and set up which doesnt alter what we have got in actual fact but simply makes it firm takes all the lessons we have learned over the last fifteen years puts them in effect smoothes it all out found the final form of the organization thatll work like bang and itll probably be that way five thousand years from now and there it is be able to put those lines in and write those things up with enough security backed up thoroughly enough backed up with enough enthusiasm and so forth those lines will go in and thats the way itll be and so forth all the lessons all the things weve learned can take effect because actually we got to position where we were holding ourselves from expanding itll go as far as it worked had gotten up to point where it was working faster than it was administered to handle we have suddenly done breakthrough here this is very peculiar breakthrough very odd but were making clears and these are shock to people because theyve been expecting them for fifteen years never realized of course the best reason why you wouldnt make clear was if the data wasnt straight see if your organizational form and the discipline of it all and the brickbatsif that wasnt good enough and the brickbats coming your way were so terrific and the yippleyap in the society against the individual staff member was so great you couldnt expect him to sit there and do any kind of job even though he had the information in his hand he would be so distracted he would hardly be able to duplicate the bulletin dont you see well you wouldnt have expected that to happen well something funny has happened its class iv and level iv is supposed to be the clear level and clears are emerging at i and ii very funny and i wont mention any names one of your instructors ishas just got through writing an alarmed note on the subject of clear and im going to put it in the auditor crisis on saint hill course what do you do with this person see we cant process this person on the rest of the processes between where she is and level iv and to vi in fact i dont think the person will now run on r6ew ive got to break out the actual bank pattern and so forth and start posting it in the cabinets in there so she can run from the top down i dont think she can find dramatization on bet clear you see clearing too early weve got more problems you see well life is prettypretty difficult its pretty difficult to make living these days because you see they clear too fast well thats different look than were having awful trouble with this person ron drag him into my office in elizabeth throw him down on the couch and find the engram necessary to resolve the case by some means or another and not even an emeter turn him back over to the staff auditor and have him go run the engram and finish it up yeah that looks little bit different and the guy gradually dozens and dozens or even hundreds of engrams later you see making progress up toward clear in the meantime the society is caving him in the suppressive persons on the other side of him are telling him he didnt make any gains dont you see all these various wild things occurring living enturbulence not an enturbulence of data now we move over into the other line as ron what do i do now hey this person is supposed to go up through grade ii and grade iii and grade iv and she cant possibly get her auditing checksheet because she is clear and it wont run on anything how do we fit this in crisis at saint hill well what is that that is actually more cleared environment we arent getting lambasted every day in the press dont you see were not getting this were not getting that the environment is getting clear so person possibly could breathe and get audited without whole bunch of ptps in the next five seconds you see it looks better it looks better its very symptomatic that i come in today and i lecture to youthe last time i lectured to you before that you were all black in the face and last time you were and i come in today and you look great deal brighter and you look great deal brighter than that well thats because channel of order has been introduced into this particular course which of course has its rough edges as they always do but its smoothing out and i think by this time has smoothed out in other words itswere in position in this course now where an instructor can take responsibility for certain strata of the students of the course the individual responsibility for those students in other words he can stand up now in the entheta of the environment and that sort of thing and wear his hat things are becoming more orderly dont you see up to that time he had to sort of stand on the fringe of all of this commotion well lets put him in there and let him take it on the chin itll smooth out and i noticed just looking at you today that youve smoothed out remarkably so the action of administration is simply smoothing out the enturbulence of the environment and thats all there is to it we introduce stable datum into the environment it blows all over the place it blows up practically youll very often introduce somebody to scientology and you see tremendous amount of confusion ensue hes going through the same thing he collides with the people of his immediate environment they havent gone anyplace he has so he is to some degree getting his block knocked off in his environment dont you see hes going through as an individual the same horrible curve that any of the restthat we went through as group and this individual very well could possibly get himself into lot of trouble and that sort of thing well ill point something out to you if he keeps at itif he keeps at it why it wont take him fifteen years as it would larger group to get up to point of where he can hold his position and his case gain dont you see in the first place hes served by far better technology hes served upon communication lines that can be administered theres terrific relationship you see between the environment and the individual and the speed with which process works and youve got to be able to get process working on somebody that will be sufficiently effective this is what ithese people who go out here and say well im going to audit r6 on the public you know theyve missed the whole point all theyre going to do is unstabilize the guy they dont dare unstabilize man in his environment this much the environments going to knock his block off if they unstabilize him to that degree this guys got to learn to walk hisin his environment you dont tell him to fly and then knock him down and laugh thats horrible thing this guys got to go out there and hes got to have something that he can understand and grasp and communicate to his environment and so forth because hes going to get plenty of randomity anyhow and this result has to happen fast enough to take care of these things you see before the environment knocks his block off its race between the auditor and the environmentthis mans environment see and its always that kind of race and thats true of us as group dont you see there is race between us and our environment we were living beings you processed living being and his relationship is between himself and his environment you therefore have to be able to deliver technology to him that he can somehow or other stand up with and you dont dare unsettle him and throw him back into his environment youve got to bring him up on line where he can hold those gains stably and that theyre real gains to him and so forth and he can go back into the environment furthermore youve got to provide him with certain amount of administrative protection and today youve just been given weapons of administrative protection for your pc and youve been given method of forcing pc to take action and not keep on messing up in his environment and knocking himself downhill this is all germane to the situation now we are more powerful we are more powerful than we have ever been before and things are more stable and processes can go in and administrative systems can be evolved and presented hats can be checked out on and we can have rather simple administrative system we dont have to have very complex one as long as the thing is well followed as long as its channels are delineated as long as our mutual understanding of the existing situation and the lessons which we have learned up all these years and so forth continue to be applied were perfectly fine were in position of much greater ability in the society scientology is up the world around its going up up up it doesnt look like it sometimes in an organization thats fighting for its life and so forth until you look at the curve and look where the state of the organization was few years ago or even last year why you dont get the kind of picture it is now youve got to bring up an organization on gradient the same way some of you will be putting organizations in or handling the putting of organizations into place in this society because therell be hundreds of organizations tomorrow where theres only one today the ratio is going to go up at great rate of speed by pulling the blocks im pulling every point and barrier and so forth off the line that keeps us from expanding right now they at one time were protective barriers we mustnt do too much of forward fly up the line because we would have gone too fast and we would have wrecked ourselves beyond that so we had lines that were blocked lines that were blocked lines that were blocked my whole job right now is entirely devoted to administrative actions im just putting the administration into effect putting it into effect now the whole action is spot the place where the jam was spot the place which restricted expansion and pull the pins on it and then spot another place which restricted expansion and look back and pick up the policies that handle that sort of thing you see put in the communication line pull the block out and you cant go at this very long as an auditing process on an organization which is already restricted in its ability to expand without some fantastic things occurring now the trick is to do this without settlunsettling the existing organization so you begin to see in these bulletins now do not disturb any line which is actually in and operating at this particular time leave all those lines in regardless of what they do to your org board and so forth the lines which are working for you will still work dont you see also put in this other set of lines which parallels that set of lines dont you see well now what im working for is an acceleratingan accelerating curve and this will occur and youll see it in relatively short time weve gotten to the point where thewhere the society itself can be bowled over so we might as well just start knocking the aberration out at very high rate of speed were past the critical point of case gain now it really doesnt matter how fast the case gains we have made our point of stability we are there weve got our feet down we can hold our position we dont have to back up because somebody whispers in our direction we can hold our communication lines in we have just gone through two governments trying to knock our blocks off and we have emerged at the other end thumbing our nose at them in very impudent fashion the united states government is so scared to bring that thing to trial its pathetic i had the british government ask them the other day about it right and they dont know anything about it i imagine after while theyll get mad and bring some wild suit and try to finish this thing up or try to do something and so forth but itsits sort of like boxer whos gone down on one knee 15 or 20 times already in this fight dont you see and he isnt very enthusiastic about lifting his head so if he does anything at all he sort of punches at the referee because he hasnt got any direction left because the attacks which were getting are directionless doesnt look like that maybe to the poor guy down in melbourne why i should imagine melbourne feels pretty cocky its lived through it i notice melbourne is coming up theyfor while they were nattering at saint hill and nattering at people and so on as you could imagine they had their heads knocked off down there well they must have been very strong or they wouldnt have stood up to that it actually doesnt matter much what the press does say about us now you could have screaming headlines come out in every newspaper in the world scientology is good and everybodyd say hohum they have worn that out we have heard that all before dont you see weve lived through these things now what weve got to face up to now is the fact that our expansion will be an accelerating expansion what weve got to do now during this year is finish up getting our communication lines in and square things up there is some really marvelous things in the works fortunately the whole basic administration technology and so forth is laying out before the eye these things are quite wonderful some of them im fascinated with them theythey justmost fabulous operating keyboard you ever wanted to play on is an organization in this particular universe it isnt play on it eitherits if you want to strengthen up an organization stabilize an organization and that sort of thing just find the expansional blocks and pull them and find thethe things that you know that block expansion find those expansionblocking barriers see try and find those things pull it find those things pull it open up your communication lines put in your barriers and so forth on the edges of the communication line not in the middle of it so that you channel your action and so forth just keep doing this strengthening up the edgesletting the lines flow harder strengthening up the edgesletting the lines flow harder going at the formula of how to put life into group from thein other words we are very much causative in this how do we put life into our organizations how do we get them rolling again how do we get them to stand up straighter and that sort of thing well this year they will go through several flickers and flackels and theyll go up and down andand so forth and they will restabilize but i can assure you if they will go very stably it wont cost us any organizations to reorganize these things i already put it to test i changed the whole org board suddenly to more workable org board last summer i just told them all to put it in and put it on the org board but not do anything with it or move anybodys chairs or anything but just put that up it was immediately followed uniformly over the world by an increase in income decrease in upset so reorganization can actually mean smoother run for everybody all right now were just about to put in the rest of that org board and were about to put it in with smash and bash and bang rather quickly but with the same orders dont change any lines youve got even though the line is wrong that youre actually using and so forth why put the persons name on the organization board the way the line is working and also put this org board in too and then gradually theyll see where these lines actually snap and lot of duplicate functionsthere are lot of duplicate functions right now in the organization being carried on in two different placesand these duplicate functions one after the other are just being deleted so that youve got single functions for each one of them you see in other words youre actually reducing the amount of traffic in an organization the traffic in an organization is being reduced now even though the potentiality is why i guess weve raised the traffic potentiality of an organization two or three hundred times i had just in the last day or twostuff will really be flying on those communication lines but theres barriers for it to hit dont you see theres people to catch it you see and theres things that people can do about it if the lines are wrong now the only thing were asking staff member to do organizationally and so forth is just discipline the communication line thats the only way he can get in trouble is the fellow who fails to discipline the communication line he doesnt wear his hat with regarding the discipline of how the communication is supposed to be done and how the thing is supposed to be routed or he enforces the discipline so savagely and so forth that he arc breaks somebody on the other end of the line see hes got to measure delicately between these two things thats all weve got to do because the technology and so forth has got to have lines to flow on there is vast rush at this particular moment oddly enough of getting the final technology out there is vast rush about getting public book out there is vast rush about this sort of thing because if we dont get the organizational line inwere doing promotion things are going up its all right dont you see but unless weve got those lines in the same things will happen to us well enturbulate well have another peak where were hitting the society with great deal of new material dont you see and were hitting the society with this material and the society is reacting back against us well we dont want the society reacting back against us without our lines in good shape itd be folly dont you see so the thing to do is to set the lines up get them very smooth fix it up so that these things are all in form and in moment of stress and with an expansional action and increased traffic that there are lines for that traffic to flow on then follow it right up behind that with the actual release out into the public of additional technology the release of it into the organizations frankly everybody in these organizations is pretty well trained on the exact technology its tremendous joke dont you see the newest and latest now the newest and latest is about to be released into the organizations the newest and latest is about to be released into the public its quite interesting the newest and the latest is subject called beginning scientology thats the newest and the latest i am being laggardly in giving you your level processes and your auditing checksheets for these levels because theyre just little bit different than you think they are theyre little simpler than you think they are the processes are little bit simpler to do and i got that materialits all actually sitting on my desk i havent had time to write up thisthe bulletin that delivers it to you ratatatat because youll recognize all the processes nowto do them youll say howhow could it be that easy im sure will be your first reaction to it notnot howhow do we learn all this terribly complicated and then youll all of sudden cognite that yes these are the processes that always have worked dont you see but your firstthe first book of beginning scientology is of course what book its book called beginning scientology and it composites the identical track of scientology and it has the elementsthe successful elements with none of the distractions and the lead on inof everything we have done thats all and you havent got to worry about the rest of it but we can cover years of that area in practically the breath blink of an eye of the workable technology which exists today the philosophy and so forth that went along with it and the other developmental thingsis very interesting that the philadelphia lectures of 1953 is it or something like that or 52 oh 52those confounded things contain most of the technology for level vii theyre practically textbook on level vii so theres lot of that technology but its not come out even dont you see i mean it hasnt been released in exact chronological sequence theres beensome of the earlier technology was more advanced dont you see well all we have to do is take up what was released more or less at that time as it went forward right on up to pt which fits the levels and then take the stuff that wascame out of sequence and add it on top of that and weve got the whole subject now theres nothing much to this there have been some tremendous discoveries and so forth during the last twelve months as you may or may not be aware ofclay tabletheres things of this particular character that are sweepingly important the point is the first book thatll be released into the public is already written called beginning scientology and it has small section out at the beginning of book called excalibur i wrote in 1938 and then it has the pertinent sections of the original thesis and then it has the pertinent early sections of dianetics the modern science of mental health all written its just pasteup job and all the distractive materials taken out of it and then its toldthe person is told throughout this book does not include the instructional drillsthe instructional drills or the practical drills and so forth and doesnt particularly include all of the processes youll have to get those from an auditor from your local academy see and this isnt all there is to it it goes on for several levels after this you see it describes the conditions to be attained but it tells the person exactly what to expect in attaining them see and we dont make it fifteenminute wonder dont you see get the idea we say after youve gone through few levels man youll be clear and we keep putting down footnotes of course with this material is not all of the material in other words we can keep leading the people up along the line and your next book up along the line is similar materials and so forth it isnt just cutup old books though it goes offit goes further into more composited line but we have to have that first entrance book because that was our first entrance into the society and if we leave that as gap student thereafter would ever be able to understand that he knew what the earlier beginnings were and he would have an unknown on his backtrack which would make him uncertain so we must have thatwe must have that there fronting up the line well this is the first entrance point to the society so obviously it contains the elements which make it the first entrance point to the society the dynamic principle of existence is survive thats all there are four dynamics you knowyou know this stuff and the processes that went along with it that were very successful had to do with very light pt processes that had to do with communication and so forth doesnt matter if some of the processes were developed far later but fitted that particular level and that were much more effective we just get the guy so he can talk to the people around him and we teach him about locks and wed show him something about engrams very interesting an oldtime dianeticist the other day recovered his sight because somebody timed on an emeter two engrams guy recovered his sight because he just got the date of two engrams didnt improve at once and then began to improve very nicely just heard about it heres the upshot of this is this whole technology was workable but how could technology on lines that were scrambled and as upset somebody would have to write somebody who knew somebody in the elizabeth foundation who had rumor that the latest technique wasand even though bulletin was released at that particular time the chances of it being received followed or applicable were very remote well bring it up to the point the guy is spotting spots in space and spotting spots in the room or something like this and he isnt doing it right and the d of p walks in and says if you keep doing that wrong youre going to be talking to committee of evidence thats little bit different isnt it little different view and you say thats rough one to live in thats smooth one to live in the society is smooth society in which you can have some law and order were moving ahead into this were moving into position of extreme maximum thrust you might say and well be there very very soon im not just shooting the breeze because the information that is pouring in here now and the data which is crisscrossing and so forth isshows that everything im putting out to them is being perfectly well received and going into effect very rapidly the bad old daysthe bad old days are actually repeated by every human being who faces up to the society and tries to stand up as himselfand tries to stand up as part of scientology organization for the first time hes hit with confusion but fortunately due to the work weve done and the research weve done the period is over very soon if we do our job well but everybody goes through that same cycle you get new person oh its fine its wonderful its delirious its great its great its great you see him the next day hes falling flat on his facesomebodys invalidated the living pants off of him dont you see uh bingbang this way up and down and so forth recognize what youre looking at the guy has put ahes putting new dataits new stable data into his environment the confusions blowing off theres newnew stable data gone into him and the confusion is going off its repeat track it cant be otherwise because the road is up and out and man was way below level of confusion he was too far down to even know he was confused thank you very much
