specific threat of hvac systems in the united states being targeted recipients are advised that terrorists may consider exploiting commercial air handling systems for dispersing chemical biological or other air contaminants most if not all commercial and public service buildings in the united statesincluding office buildings shopping centers transit systems and airportshave hvac systems hvac systems typically have one or more airintake systems that move air through the ventilation ducting circuit it is possible to introduce chemical or biological agents directly into external airintakes or internal aircirculation systems unless the building has carbon filters or the equivalent volatile chemical agents would not be stopped and would enter the building untenanted biological agents would require hepa type filters to stop the aerosol from entering the building via the vent placement of device within the outlet for single room would produce more concentrated hazard in subset of the building other scenarios involve the use of helicopters equipped with agricultural spraying equipment to discharge large chemical or biological contaminant clouds near external or roofmounted air intakes or ventilators crosswinds downdrafts from helicopter rotors and updrafts from hvac cooling fans however would detract from the effectiveness of helicopterborne attack another approach may be to locally introduce natural gas and other unidentified poisonous gases directly into the hvac equipment by plumbing or di rect spill typical contaminants might also include toxic gas such as hydrogen cyanide gas or chlorine gas or aerosolized toxins or bacteria such as ricin or anthrax contaminants introduced in sustained manner or in sufficient concentration could pose risk of fire or explosion or create an inhalation or asphyxiation hazard depending on the size of the building and proximity to introduction point terrorists have considered producing radi ological dispersal device rdd by burning or exploding source or sources containing radioactive material if large quantities of easily dispersed radioactive material were released or exploded near an hvac intake or circulation system it is possible that targeted individuals could suffer some adverse health effects it is more likely however that damage would result from the explosion rather than from any radiological disbursement none of these scenarios is likely to produce harmful if not catastrophic casualties however the potential exists for causing harm to exposed persons also considerable hvac system damage is possible further the economic consequences associated with rendering building unusable during lengthy decontamination period are potentially enormous as evidenced in the 2001 anthrax attacks that involved small areas of several buildings unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only suggested protective measures facilities m anagers should have current em ergency plan that addresses chem ical biological and radiological cbr attacks know their bu ilding hvac system vulnerabilities and conduct periodic walkthrough inspections of the system s for evidence of irregularities or tam pering individuals developing em ergency plans and procedures should recognize that there are fundam ental differences am ong various cbr agents in general chem ical agents will typically have rapid onset of sym ptoms while the response to biological or radiological agents can be delayed potential indicators of threats include suspicious packages or containers or unusual powders or liquids droplets m ists or clouds found near airintake in airventilation ductwork and hvac system s the variety of hvac system s in use precludes an exhaustive listing of protective m easures to take in the event of terrorist attack involving hvac system s for specific guidance facilities managers should consult their system s specialist the following protective m easures do however provide f acilities m anagers general guidance f or immediate steps to take to lim it any dispersal of toxins and m itigate potential im pact outside release in the event that toxic substance has been released outside the building keep individuals inside the building and reduce the indooroutdoor air exchange to prevent contam inated air from passing through the hvac system immediately shut off the air handling system close all windows and doors and turn off fans and com bustion heaters once the outdoor hazard has dissipated open all doors and windows and turn on all fans to ventilate the building inside release if toxic substance has been released inside building im mediately place the air handling system on full or 100 outside air if advised of an inbuilding release of hydrogen cyanide gas chlorine gases or other toxic industrial chem icals activate the water sprinklers to help wash the contam inant from the air stream this would probably help f or particulate aerosols like anthrax but will probably not work f or vapors such as hydrogen cyanide gas or chlorine gas evacuate the building in accordance with the building s emergency evacuation plan evacuation routes m ay be hazardous because they m ay take people through contam inated areas it is necessary to evaluate the scenario prior to evacuating the building to prevent additional injuries form occurring page 3 of 4 unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only facilities m anagers should note that unless m ilitary and com mercial detectors for toxic chem icals and biological pathogens are connected to autom ated shutoffshutdown equipm ent they are not as effective as inline m onitors within an air handling system because their response time is too slow facilities m anagers should assess their building vulnerabilities to hvac attack and consider installing design and equipm ent m odifications to m ake external airintakes less accessible such options could include securing ventilation intake system s with perim eter fencing or relocating airintakes to an inaccessible level installing false or decoy airintakes and camouflaging actual airintakes law enforcem ent officers should take note of materials describing hvac system s in the possession of individuals with legitim ate need f or the m aterials especially when accom panied by instructions and diagram s for im provised chem ical or biological devices recipients should im mediately report suspicious or crim inal activities potentially related to terrorism to their local law enforcem ent representatives information on suspicious activities potentia lly related to terrorism should be forw arded immediately to both the local fbi jttf and th dhs hsoc as indicated on the first page for comments or questions related to the content
