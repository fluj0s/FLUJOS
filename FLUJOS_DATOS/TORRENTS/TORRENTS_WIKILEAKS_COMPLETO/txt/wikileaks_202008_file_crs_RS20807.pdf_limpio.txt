1996 welfare reform law joe richardson and vee burke domestic social policy division summary the 1996 personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act pl 104193 changed the face of federalstate family welfare programs and most other federally supported aid for the poor some 3 years debate followed president clintons call to end welfare as we know it early 19931994 proposals retained the existing aid to families with dependent children afdc program but placed time limits on welfare receipt not conditioned on work in 1995 the debate shifted when the house approved hr 4 the personal responsibility act and created temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grants to replace afdc this measure timelimited welfare receipt added to work requirements and expanded welfare reform to include myriad changes in other programs like food stamps the senate adopted the house structure with notable changes affecting the grants funding structure and other matters the work opportunity act but housesenate compromise on hr 4 was twice vetoed at the end of 1995 in 1996 the vetoed hr 4 was again picked up and with significant changes adopted by congress as part of an fy1997 budget reconciliation law and signed by the president on august 22 1996 the 1996 welfare reform law supplanted the main existing welfare program for families aid to families with dependent children afdc and its worktraining component jobs and greatly changed most other federally supported aid to the poor it was enacted after debate stretching over 3 years and two presidential vetoes under afdc states received unlimited federal matching money for afdc benefits and capped federal match for jobs programs for afdc recipients if families met stateset needs standards states had to cover singleparent poor families and many two parent families with an incapacitatedunemployed parent and there were time limits on aid jobs programs had participation requirements but did not mandate work and mothers with young children were mostly exempt the move to reform this system was prompted by soaring afdc rolls and higher costs extant federal waivers for more than half the states to undertake their own welfare reforms frustration with the long afdc tenure and youth of many recipient parents concerns over the extent of unwed parenthood among recipients reaction to afdcs unrestricted entitlement nature and disillusion with the most recent attempt at reform the 1988 family support acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20807crs2 early proposals as candidate president clinton proposed to end welfare as we know it stressing time limits on welfare receipt not tied to work and greater support for work efforts by recipients making work pay this challenge was taken up in the republican leadership bills of 19931994 they split afdc into transition work preparation and work programs imposed time limits on welfare receipt 2 years for transition help extended work requirements to mothers of very young children and ended aid for minor parents not living at home recipients additional children and most noncitizens they also capped federal welfare funding and allowed states to convert their federal welfare dollars to block grants and to end aid to families after 5 years including 3 years of supported work separately some republicans introduced measure to ban aid to nevermarried mothers under 21 the clinton administration bill 1994 phased in 2year limit on afdc benefits for nonworking adults without younger children then required work programs for those without jobs after 2 years with supplementary welfare payments if necessary it also ended afdc for minor parents not living at home increased money for worktraining efforts and child care and encou raged broader coverage of twoparent families congressional democrats response was divided some objected to arbitrary time limits while other endorsed limits and advanced timelimitthenwork proposals similar to the presidents while time limits and some other themes in later welfa re reform initiatives were evident reform was not taken up actively in the 103rd congress other than enactment of an expansion of the earned income tax credit to add to the benefits of work for lower income families the contract with america and hr 4 the welfare portion of the house republicans contract with america agenda was introduced as the personal responsibility act hr 4 in january 1995 it required recipients to work after 2 years of afdc and placed an absolute 5year limit on benefits including up to 3 years in work program it also barred afdc to minor unwed mothers and new babies in afdc families federal money for afdc and child care programs was capped but states could convert afdc funds into block grant finally food stamp aid was block granted and most aliens were denied major federal assistance however the version of hr 4 reported by the three committees involved and passed by the house basically along party lines on march 24 1995 was significantly different to great extent it reflected desire to shrink the federal role generally unlimited entitlements through block grants in several arenas and many changes occurred after extensive discussi ons with governors in general policy sense the march 24th bill formed the template for all later reform bills adopted in congress the march 24th personal responsibility act replaced federally matched afdcjobs individual entitlements with state entitlements to temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grants based on past federal matching spending for the programs the measure ended it also repealed afdcrelated child care programs merging them into the separate child care block grant federal rules for tanf grants included requirement to engage in work activities after 2 years transition benefits and ban on any benefits after 5 years mandate on states to increase participation in work programs and bar to aid for unmarried minor mothers and enrollees new children in related areas the househttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20807crs3 preserved food stamps but capped spending reduced benefits added work rule for able bodied adults without dependents and allowed more state control and stateoption block grants added to child support enforcement efforts and barred most aid to the majority of aliens the senate in mid1995 the welfare reform debate entered new phase during june the three senate committees with welfare reform roles reported their contributions to reform legislation and the president endorsed major senate democrati c leadership alternative the work first act however with serious disputes over the reported measures eg distribution of block grant funds floor consideration was delayed while the republican leader developed revised package and further discussions were held with governors and other interested parties by large majority the senate approved its version of hr 4 the work opportunity act on september 19 1995 in doing so it accepted significant bipartisan and other amendments to the leaders bill but voted down the democratic alternative which time limited adults benefits mandate d more worktraining and added money for work programs but did not block grant federal support the senate adopted much of the basic house structure tanf block grants ending individual entitlements 2 and 5year time limits increased work program participation major revisions to food stamps and child support enforcement and eligibility bars for most nonciti zens but it also differed it changed the funding structure for the grants eg by adding state maintenance of effort spending requirement and money for highunemployment contingencies and states with low pretanf welfare spending it also set aside block grant funds for child care allowed aid for unwed minor mothers living under adult supervision and recipients additional children and added charitable choice provisions to permit increased participation by faithbased organizations in the provision of welfarerelated services housesenate agreement and presidential vetoes while negotiations on hr 4 differences continued preliminary housesenate agreement was added to the 1995 balanced budget act hr 2491 budget reconciliation measure in late november 1995 excepting some small but controversial items eg limits on aid for additional children it contained the gist of the final accord on hr 4 president clinton vetoed it on december 6 1995 objecting to medicaid reform provisions in the larger measure then on december 2122 1995 congress approved the final housesenate hr 4 agreement the personal responsibility and work opportunity act the president also vetoed this freestanding hr 4 accord on january 9 1996 citing insufficient child care and work support provisi ons reports at the time also warned of an increase in poor children from the bill 1 million by some accounts the vetoed hr 4 included tanf block grants based on past federal matching spending with compromise state maintenanceofeffort requirement state adjustments or special funding were provided for popula tion growth low pretanf state welfare spending and highunemployment contin gencies senate grants to reduce outofwedlock births rainy day loan fund and performance bonuses support for child care viewed by some as integral to reform was increased above levels in the house and senate bills with mandatory child care block grant money the accord incorporated time limits with compromise hardship exemptions mandate to increase work program participation permission to aid unwed minor mothers subject to adult supervision and other requirements and state option to limit benefits for additional children finally thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20807crs4 vetoed bill included compromises on extensive revisions to food stamps and child support enforcement bar against providing major federally supported benefitsservices to most noncitizens and charitable choice language senate the final steps to enactment the provisions of the vetoed hr 4 resolved the bulk of the issues surrounding welfare reform for the majority in congress eg time limits work rules however as 1996 began there were still outstanding areas of concern linking welfare reform to major medicaid revisions bars against assistance to noncitizens limited block grants for food stamps and the new food stamp work rule for ablebodied adults without dependents and the amount of support for child care and contingencies and the administration continued to press for an alternative rejecting block grants bars against noncitizens and linkage to medicaid changes but including time limited conditional entitlements to aid near the close of may 1996 house and senate republicans introduced measures essentially incorporating the vetoed hr 4 and responding to the national governors association call for more money for child care and contingencies by the end of june this approach was incorporated in hr 3734 the fy1997 budget reconciliation bill which also included medicaid reforms with medicaid amendments dropped slightly different versions of hr 3734 were adopted by the house and senate on july 18 and 23 1996 the housesenate conference agreement on what was now the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act was filed july 30 1996 it settled the last issues notably dropping food stamp block grants and loosening the new food stamp work rule but retaining the ban on aid to noncitizens the agreement was approved by the house and senate on july 31 and august 1 1996 on august 22 1996 the president signed the welfare reform law but cited his serious concerns over the ban on noncitizens and the new food stamp work rule for ablebodied adults without children both of which were to be revisited in later years related programs medicaid child welfare eg foster care child nutrition supplemental security income ssi eligibility housing and the social services block grant also entered the reform debate initial proposals generally maintained transitional medicaid for those leaving welfare with the advent of block grants to replace afdc new feature was added continued medicaid eligibility for those who would have been covered under states afdc programs sweeping child welfare provisions restructuring federal child welfare support into one or more block grants were in versions of welfare reform through 1995 but only medicaidlike adjunct eligibility rule found its way into law child nutrition initiatives also were controversial at one point holding up the agreement on hr 4 block granting school lunch and other child nutrition programs was strongly opposed in the senate and the final accord eschewed even pilot block grants substituting administrationbacked cuts in child nutrition subsidies for child care providers serving higherincome families to gain needed savings hr 4 did not adopt senate changes in housing programs to support work efforts but included restrictions on disabled children s eligibility for ssi benefits because of burgeoning rolls in all the various reform bills from early 1995 on finally with the emphasis on services in other block grants and the ability to transfer money from tanf in the bill money for the social services block grant was reduced under proposal originating in the senate costs and savings budget effects were evident throughout consideration of reform legislation and savin gs were seen by some as major goal federal budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20807crs5 1 note the 105th and 106th congresses rescinded and modified some of the 1996 cuts restoring ssi medicaid and food stamp benefits to many noncitizens boosting spending on worktraining for food stamp recipients and expanding food stamp benefits for those with high shelter costs and eligibility for lowincome households with cars further the 105th congress created welfareto work wtw grants to help states move severely disadvantaged tanf recipients into jobs and reduced federal payments to states for food stamp administrative costs to correct for funding received under tanf block grantsreduction targets were implicitly or explicitly part of the debate all along and number of components of the reform package were crafted and included so as to fit costsavings limitations savings from reforms closely related to tanf decreased over the course of the reform debate and in the end increased costs were attributed to family support programs particularly because of child care commitments at enactment the overall federal spending reduction projected to be achieved through the welfare reform effort was more than 50 billion over 6 years but these savings were largely obtained by dramatic reductions in food stamps and support for noncitizens and lesser cuts in ssi child nutrition and other programs highlights of the enacted welfare reform law the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act prwora pl 104193 enacted august 22 1996 dramatically reshaped federally supported welfare programs and helped reduce federal welfare related spending it replaced the depressionborn afdc program with tanf block grant to states it also imposed citizenship requirement for many benefits and reduced spending on food stamps ssi child nutrition and the ssbg however it increased funding for child care and created mandatory block grant for care of children in lowincome families at the time of passage the congressional budget office cbo estimated that the law would cut mandatory federal spending by net total of 541 billion over 6 years restrictions on benefits for noncitizens accounted for 44 of this total and food stamp revisions for 431 family cash aid tanf ended unlimited matching funding for family cash welfare afdc and created fixed block grants for statedesigned programs of time limited and workconditioned aid

federal funds it required states to engage recipients in statedefined work after 24 months of aid achieve minimum participation rates in federally recognized work activities and spend on needy families from their own funds at least 75 of the sum they spent in fy1994 on programs replaced by tanf maintenanceofeffort moe rule food stamps the 1996 law made the most extensive changes in food stamps since the 1977 rewrite of the food stamp act it gave states more control over food stamp operations and coordination with family cash aid added work rule for ablebodied adults without dependents and expanded existing work rules cut future benefits and tightened financial and nonfinancial eligibility tests expanded penalties for violating rules and controls over trafficking and encouraged electronic delivery of benefits child care the new law created mandatory block grant for child care to low income families and gave states more flexibility to design child care policies the

entitled states that meet an moe child care spending requirement to extra funds which they must match with state dollars appropriated for the block grant was 139 billion over 6 years more than 4 billion above spending levels estimated by cbo for the replaced programs the law also authorized 7 billion in funding through fy2002 for the child care and development block grant ccdbg and it permitted states to transfer up to 30 of their tanf grant to ccdbg the combined funding streams provided by the 1996 law now are referred to as the child care and development fund ccdf alien eligibility the 1996 law barred federally funded tanf for newly arriving aliens other than refugeesasylees for the first 5 years of residenc unless they have substantial us work history or militaryveteran connection leaving eligibility in other cases up to the states without regard to their arrival date the same noncitizens were barre d from food stamps and ssi and the law placed similar constraints on medicaid eligibility social services block grant ssbg the welfare reform law reduced the 28 billion entitlement ceiling for the ssbg under title xx of the social security act by 15 and entitled states to 238 billion annually in fy1997fy2002 tanf law also allowed states to transfer up to 10 of their tanf grant to ssbg child support enforcement the new law required the federal

states operate an automated centralized collection and disbursement unit streamline the paternity determination process implement procedures to withhold suspend or restrict the use of drivers licenses and some other licenses of debtor parents medicaid the 1996 law required states to provide medicaid to families who would be eligible for afdc if that program still existed as on july 16 1996 with some modifications permitted in treatment of income transitional medicaid for those leaving welfare was continued other programs budget cuts also were made by changing other welfare and non welfare programs the new law established separate disability definition for children in the ssi program which narrowed eligibility and it reduced child nutrition subsidies notably for day care homes serving
