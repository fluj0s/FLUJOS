term smart grid refers to distri bution system that allows for flow of information from customers meter in two directions both inside the house to thermostats and appliances and other devices and back to the utility this could allow appliances to be turned off during periods of high elect rical demand and cost and give customers realtime information on constantly changing electric rates efforts are being made in both industry and government to modernize electric distribution to improve communications between utilities and the ultimate consumer the goal is to use advanced informati onbased technologies to increase power grid efficiency reliability and flexibility and reduce the rate at which additional electric utility infrastructure needs to be built both regulatory and technological ba rriers have limited th implementation of smart grid technology at issue is whet her distinction for cost allocation purposes can be made between the impact of sm art grid technology on the wholesale transmission system and its impact on the re tail distribution system another issue limiting the deployment of this technology is the lack of consistent standards and protocols there currently are standa rds for these technologies this limits the interoperability of smart gr id technologies and limits futu re choices for companies that choose to install any par ticular type of

nerc 2007 electricity supply and demand database figure 1 electric transmission networksmart grid provisions in hr 6 110th congress introduction and overview the us electric power system has historically operated at such high level of reliability that any major outage either caused by sabotage weather or operational errors makes news headlines as th august 14 2003 midwes t and northeast blackout demonstrated loss of electric power is very expensive and can entail considerable disruption to business travel government services and daily life the electric utility industry operates as an integrated system of generation transmission and distribution facilities to liver power to consumers the electric power system in the united states cons ists of over 9200 electric generating units with more than 950000 megawatts of gene rating capacity connected to more than 300000 miles of transmission lines more than 210000 miles of the transmission lines are rated at 230 kilovolts kv or higher figure 1 1 in addition approximately 150 control centers manage the flow of ectricity through the system under normal operating conditionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34288crs2 2 the three currents are sinusoidal functions of time but with the same frequency 60 hertz in three phase system the phases are spaced equally offset 120 degrees from each other with threephase power one of the three phases is always nearing peak 3 1kv1000 volts 4 the loss of power on the transmission system is proportional to the square of the current flow of electricity while the current is inversely proportional to the voltage 5 transmission towers also support fourth wi re running above the other three lines this line is intended to attract lighting so that the flow of electric ity is not disturbedmost electricity in the united states is generated at power plants that use fossil fuels oil gas coal nuclear fission or renewable energy hydropower geothermal solar wind biomass at the power plant energy is converted into set of three alternating electric currents called threephase power2 after power is generated the first step in delivering electricity to the consumer is to transform the power from medium voltage 1550 kilovolt kv to high voltage 138765 kv alternating current figure 2 3 this initial stepup of voltage occurs in transformer located at transmission substations at the generating facilities high voltages allow power to be moved long distances with the greatest efficiency ie transmission line losses are minimized4 the three phases of power are carried over three wires that are connected to large transmission towers5 close to the ultimate consumer the power is steppeddown at another substation to lower voltages typically less than 10 kv at this point the power is considered to have left the transmission system and entered the distribution system the transmission system continues to become more congested and siting of transmission lines continues to be difficult to try to maximize operation of existing infrastructure efforts are being made in both industry and government to modernize electric distribution equipment to improve communications between utilities and the ultimate consumer the goal is to use advanced information based technologies to increase power grid efficiency reliability and flexibility and reduce the rate at which additional electric utility infrastructure needs to be built some utilities have been using smart metering meters that can be read remotely primarily for billing purposes however these meters do not provide communication figure 2 the electric power systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34288crs3 6 personal communication tom casey ce current technologies august 2 2007 7 pl 10958 1252back to the utility with information on voltage current levels and specific usage similarly these meters have very limited ability to allow the consumer the ability to either automatically or selectively change their usage patterns based on information provided by the utility the term smart grid refers to distri bution system that allows for flow of information from customers meter in two directions both inside the house to thermostats and appliances and other devices and back to the utility it is expected that grid reliability will increase as additional information from the distribution system is available to utility operators this will allow for better planning and operations during peak demand for exam ple new technologies such as programmable communicating thermostat pct could connect with customers meter through home area network allowing the utility to change the settings on the thermostat based on load or other factors pcts are not commercially available but are expected to be available within year6 it is estimated that 4 peak load reduction could be achieved usin g smart grid technologies both regulatory and technological ba rriers have limited th implementation of smart grid technology the federa l energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the wholesale transmission system and the states regulate the distribution system in general the federal government has not interfered with state regulation of the electric distributi on system however the energy policy act of 2005 epact05 required states to consider ploying smart meters for residential and small commercial customers7 at issue is whether distinction for cost allocation purposes can be made between smart grid technologies impact on the wholesale transmission system and retail distributi on system if ferc and the states cannot determine which costs should be considered transmission related federally regulated and which should be considered distributi on related state regu lated utilities may be reluctant to make large investment s in smart grid technologies another issue limiting the deployment of this technology is the lack of consistent standards and protocols th ere currently are standards for these technologies most systems are able to communicate only with technologies developed by the same manufacturer this limits the interoperability of smart grid technologies and limits future choices for companies that choose to install any particular type of technology the partment of energys does office of electricity delivery and energy reliability in partnership with industry is developing standards for advanced grid design nd operations in addition doe is funding research and development projects in this area httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34288crs4 8 california energy commission energy
