aircraft and gives deputized pilots the authority to use force including lethal force to defend the ﬂight deck against criminal and terrorist threats participation in the federal flight deck oﬃcer program established under the arming pilots against terrorism act contained in pl 107296 is limited to pilots of air carriers providing passenger air transportation or intrastate passenger air transportation pilots of cargo air carriers may not participate in the program however several bills hr 765 hr 1049 hr 2115 hrept 108334 s 165 s 516 s 1657 s 1657 seek to include allcargo air carrier pilots in the program with enactment of this legislation focus on the issue of arming pilots has turned to implementation of the federal flight deck oﬃcer program these implementation issues fall into four broad categories 1 pilot selection and screening 2 equipment ie ﬁrearms and ammunition and the risks they may pose to aircraft and passengers 3 training and 4 operational procedures this report describes several implementation issues within each of these areas that may require continued legislative oversight and possible clariﬁcation regarding the intent of the legislation the report also

debate over legislation to arm pi lots proponents argued that the potential benefits of deterring or thwarting terrorist and criminal acts against passenger aircraft outweighed the inherent risks associated with arming pilots however opponents of policy allowing pilots to be armed with lethal weapons ar gued that such programs safety risks and monetary costs significantly outweighed these potential benefits risks cited included potential distraction to the flight crew dangers that weapon discharge could pose to the aircraft or its occupants and security concerns associated with carrying firearms in secured areas of the aviation system proponents countered that these risks could be effectively mitigated but recognized that these are important issues to be addressed for successful implementation of the policy to arm pilots with enactment of this legislation focu s on the issue of arming pilots has turned to implementation of the federal flight deck officer program these implementation issues fall into four br oad categories 1 pilot selection and screening 2 equipment ie firearms and ammunition and the risks they may pose to aircraft and passengers 3 training

federal flight deck officer program the homeland security act of 2002 p l 107296 contains provisions to deputize volunteer pilots of air carriers providing passenger air transportation or intrastate passenger air transportation as federal law enforcement officers permitting them to carry firearms and use force including lethal force to defend the flight deck against acts of criminal violence or air piracy these provisions are collectively known as the arming pilots against terrori sm act the program established under this act is the federal flight deck officer program and qualified pilots deputized under this program are referred to as federal flight deck offi cers participation in the program was initially limited to pilots of passenger aircraft but has recently been extended to include other flig ht crew members such as flight engineers and flight crews of allcargo air carriers see pl 108176 the arming pilots against terrorism act specified that within three months of enactment the tsa was to begin the process of training and deputizing qualified pilots as federal flight deck officers the tsa conducted prototype tr aining class in april 2003 and began full implementation of the progra m in july 2003 pilot organi zations have estimated that as many as 30000 eligible pilots may vol unteer to participate in the program1 however the transportation security ad ministration tsa expects that number may be much lower2 pilot groups have voiced cerns that as the program has evolved over the past year sm aller numbers of pilots than expected have applied for the program because in their opinion the application procedures imposed by tsa and the remote location of training facilities is overly burdensome to many pilots considering participation in the program3 legislative background during the 107th congress representative don young and representative john mica introduced the arming pilots against terrorism act hr 4635 107th congress at that time the bush ad ministration voiced initial opposition to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31674crs2 4 see gao02822r information concerning the arming of commercial pilots for detailed outline of reasons presented by those favoring and opposing the arming of pilotsconcept of arming pilots with lethal weapons as amended by the aviation subcommittee of the house committee on transportation and infrastructure on june 19 2002 and as ordered repor ted by the full committee on june 26 2002 the bill contained provision that cappe d participation in the program at 2 of eligible pilots and limited the program to twoyear test period on july 10 2002 representative peter defazio offered an amendment on th floor to remove the 2 cap on the number of pilots who could participate in the program and also deleted the 2year sunset provision contained in the bill the amendment was adopted twice by large majorities and hr 4635 passed by vote of 310113 on may 25 2002 senator robert smith introduced the arming pilots against terrorism and cabin defense act of 2002 s 2554 107th congress which contained similar language to the final version of hr 4635 107th congress passed by the house on september 4 2002 senator smith ffered an amendment to the senate version of hr 5005 107th congress bill introduced to create department of homeland security that included provisions for arming pilots similar to those contained in hr 4635 107th congress on november 12 2002 representative richard armey introduced hr 5710 107th congress as new vehicle for establishing the department of homela nd security and

agreed to the senate amendment to hr 5005 107th congress on november 22 2002 and it was signed by president bush on november 25 2002 becoming pl 107296 debate over the issue of arming pilots fo cused on the benefits risks and costs associated with implementing the program proponents principally pilots and pilot unions argued that the potential benefits of deterring or thwarting terrorist and criminal acts against passenger aircraft outweighed the inherent risks associated with arming pilots opponents of policy allowing pilots to be armed with lethal weapons including the airlines and several prominent aviation safety experts argued that such programs safety risks and monetary costs outweighed th potential benefits key risks cited by critics of the program include added workload and responsibilities associated with participation in the program that may distract pilots from primary flying duties and safetyrela ted functions risks of firearm discharge to innocent passengers or aircraft structure and systems and proliferation of firearms on airc raft and in secured areas of the aviation system that is counter to other security objectives4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31674crs3 many of these concerns raised by critics of the plan to arm pilots have been recognized by both congress and proponents of the plan as key issues to be addressed in program implementation in the first session of the 108th congress debate focused on whether pilots of allcargo aircraft should be included in the federal flight deck officer program allcargo pilots were initially excluded from the program in the final wording of the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 in the first session of the 108th congress several gislative vehicles were introduced to expand the program to cargo pilots as well as to other flight crew members such as flight engineers on february 13 2003 rep john mica introdu ced hr 765 and on march 5 2003 sen bunning introduced s 516 both bills sought to include cargo pilots in the federal flight deck officer program while s 516 s ought to also include other flight crew members such as flight engineers separate standalone bill s 1657 introduced by senator bunning was passed by th senate on novemb er 10 2003 similar legislation hr 1049 and hr 3262 was also introduced in the house also the air cargo security act s 165 passed by the senate on ma 9 2003 contained provision that sought to include allcargo pilots in the federal flight deck officers program an amendment offered by sena tor bunning samdt 903 to s 824 was included in the faa reauthorization legi slation pl 108176 and was enacted into law on december 12 2003 this provision expa nds the federal flight deck officer program to include other flight crew members such as flight engineers and to flight crew members flying for allcargo air carriers implementation issues implementation of the federal flight deck officer program requires assessments of the standards and guidelines for 1 pilot selection and screening 2 equipment 3 training 4 operational proce dures and 5 costs to implement the program the tsa formed task force to address these issues and developed plan for implementation of the program while congress has noted that the tsas decisions regarding the methods for imple menting procedural requirements of the program shall be subject to review only fo r abuse of discretion continued legislative oversight of the program is likely to be an issue for the 108th congress furthermore the 108th congress debated nd passed legislation pl 108 176 allowing pilots of allcargo air carriers and flight engineers to participate in the program pilot selection and screening what types of screening and select ion criteria are needed for volunteer pilots prior to and wh ile participating in the program issues considered during implementation of the program include the process for selecting and screening of volunteer pilots seeking to become federal flight deck officers the legislation re quires further assessment to determine whether additional background checks should be required beyond that specified by section 44936a1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31674crs4 5 this section describes requirements for crim inal history record checks and reviews of available law enforcement databases and record s of other

international befo re the committee on commerce science and transportation us senate on aviation security july 25 2002 7 examples of confirmed deliberate acts by flight crew personnel to crash commercial aircraft include an intentional crash of japan airlines dc8 in 1982 an attempted hostile takeover of federal express dc10 in 1994 by an offduty flight engineer who intended to crash the airplane into fedex headquart ers and the 1999 theft and intentional crash of an air botswana atr42 into two other air botswana aircraft additionally there have been other high profile crashes of passenger ai r carrier aircraft such as the 1997 crash of silk air boeing 737 in in donesia and the 1999 crash of an egyptair boeing 767 off the coast of rhode island where intentional pilo t action was suspected but never conclusively determined it should however be noted that none of these crashes involved flight crews of us flag carriers providing passenger air service 8 see eg james n butcher assessing pilots with the wrong stuff call for research on emotional health factors in commercial aviators international journal of selection assessment 10 12 march 2002 168184of title 49 code of federal regulations5 additional selection and screening criteria could help to ensure that pilots selected to participate are physically and psychologically capable of carrying out th duties and responsibilities associated with participation in the program and maintain the standards set forth by the program while serving as federal flight deck officer s screening measures could be used to assess whether pilot poses security or sa fety threat by possessing firearm on the flight deck or by being traine d in the use of lethal force proponents of this new law point out that pilots already undergo rigorous pre employment evaluations and screening thr oughout their careers with an air carrier captain stephen luckey chairman of the national fight security committee of the air line pilots association alpa international noted that pilots are undoubtedly the most highly sc rutinized employees in the work force submitting to battery of preemployment evaluations flight physical every six months random drug and alcohol testing and criminal history records check among other formal examinations additi onally pilots are constantly interacting with and undergoing facto monitoring by their airlines management their peers faa personnel and others6 on the other hand despite preexisting meas ures for screening and evaluating pilots recent examples of confirmed and suspected suicides and sabotage of aircraft by flight crew personnel suggest potential need for more detailed background checks of pilots wishing to participate in th federal flight deck officer program7 however there is little agreement on whether additional screening including psychiatric evaluation of pilo ts would be able to detect pilots who would pose risk by participating in the program some argue that current screening and peer monitoring of pilots are insufficient and detailed psychiatric screening and psychological testing is needed to adequately assess the mental health of pilots8 others argue that many common mental health conditions can be masked duringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31674crs5 9 see httpwwwsecureskiesorg 10 keith l alexander som pilots oppose gun rules the washington post 13 february 2003 p a13 11 matthew weinstock tsa pilots wage war these evaluations they assert that the costs of implementing such elaborate screening measures would far outweigh the marginal improvement in assessing the mental health of pilots beyond that obt ained through the scrutiny pilots already undergo proponents for arming pilots also ar gue that by having access to the flight deck pilot intent on causing harm ready possesses the means to do so and introducing firearm on the flight deck doe s little to add to that already existing capability they argue that historically incidents of deliberate acts by pilots to harm the airplane and its occupants ar extremely unusual and current background checks screening and evaluations of pilots are more than adequate for assessing their fitness to participate in the federal flight deck officer program the arming pilots against terrorism act specifies that pilots who are former military or law enforcement personnel shoul d be given preferen ce to participate in the federal flight deck officer program this could be one way to mitigate the risks identified above at least am ong the initial cadre of depu tized federal flight deck officers by giving preference for participa tion in the program to persons that were already deemed fit to carry firearm it is also of note that the law does not limit participation to us citizens therefore another implementation issue is whether additional background checks will be required for nonus citizen pilots volunteering to participate in this program while provisions for waiting periods and background checks have been established for foreign pilots seeking certain types of advanced flight training in the united states since september 11 2001 it is uncertain whether additional background checks and wa iting periods would be needed for foreign pilots seeking to participate in the federal flight deck officer program particularly if the pilot has an extensive employment record flying for us air carriers currently tsa procedures require that pilots applying for the program undergo additional psychological screening back ground checks and medical examination beyond those already required of airline pilo ts the airline pilots security alliance apsa grassroots organization supportin g efforts to arm pilots has called the tsa screening requirements unacceptable and redundant with many existing faa and airline screening requirements9 however the tsa asserts that the proposed screening measures are similar to those used in selection of federal law enforcement officers including federal air marshals to determine an individuals fitness to carry firearm and act in law enforcement capacity and are necessary to ensure that participating pilots meet these same standards10 according to tsa about 6 percent of the applicants for the program are screened out prior to initial training 2 percent fail to meet the qualifications specified by law 3 percent are eliminated through psychological screening and 1 percent have problems identified by the background check11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31674crs6 12 statement of captain edward m davi dson director flight

253 may 2 2002 equipment what are the tradeoffs between firearms effectiveness and risk to the aircraft the legislation identifies the selection of firearms and ammunition as an issue to be addressed in developing procedural require ments for the program the legislation also specifies that an analysis shall be conducted to assess the risk of catastrophic failure of an airc raft as result of the disc harge including an accidental discharge of firearm into the avionics electrical systems or other sensitive areas of the aircraft the legislation further sp ecifies that information developed in this analysis shall be treated as classified information and not disclosed if significant risks are determined to exist the under secretary shall take actions to minimize these risks the selection of firearms and ammunition for use in the program is an important consideration because the unique environment of the flight deck and the fact that pilots are not primarily law enforcement officers make this program quite different than other law enforcement applications of firearms opponents of arming pilots have argued that stray bullet could cause serious damage to aircraft systems and structures and jeopardize flight safety speaking before the senate committee on commerce science and tran sportation captain edward m davidson director of flight safety and quality assurance for northwest airlines cautioned that bullets could pierce flight deck windows crea ting potentially catastrophic cockpit decompression could strike one of the flight decks many multifunctional instruments putting at risk numerous safety critical systems or could strike critical electronic navigation equipment cated beneath the flight deck12 depressurization of the airplane at altitude would necessitate that the f light crew use supplemental oxygen and complete checklist procedures in response to the depressurization similarly loss of critical aircraft systems may require flight crews immediate attention accomplishing re quired safetyrelate d tasks may prove difficult during struggle with intruders in the cockpit however in testimony before the house subcommittee on aviation mr ron hinderberger director of aviation safety for the boeing company stated that the risk of loss of the aircraft due to stra round from handgun is very slight boeing commercial service history cont ains cases of gunfire onboard inservice airplanes all of which landed safely hinderberger fu rther noted that commercial airplane structure is designed with sufficient strength redundancy and damage tolerance that single or even multiple handgun bullet holes would not result in loss of the aircraft single bullet hole in the fuselage skin would have little effect on cabin pressurization13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31674crs7 14 ricardo alonsozaldivar in test some us airline pilots may carry guns as early as april the angeles times 20 february 2003 15 richard h p sia tsa revisits gun contract congress daily july 30 2003 16 tsa reaffirms decision on german firearm supplier congress daily october 22 2003it has been reported that the weapon initially chosen for the program was smith wesson 40caliber miautomatic pistol that is commonly used by law enforcement agencies14 more recently it was announced that german weapons manufacturer heckler koch who makes similar 40caliber handgun was awarded the tsa contract to supply up to 9600 guns for the program15 this award was questioned particularly by other bidde rs and supporters of buy american principles this prompted tsa to reevaluate the contract bids but heckler koch again came out on top in the reevaluation process the company is building manufacturing facility in colu mbus georgia that will eventually supply guns for the federal flight deck officer program nd create about 200 us manufacturing jobs16 as the program evolves further resear ch and development of firearms and ammunition more specifically tailored to the needs of federal flight deck officers and the unique environment of the flight deck may be needed factors to be examined include enhancement of firearm effectiveness in the flight deck environment and mitigation of the risks of accidental discharges inadvertent shootings of innocent passengers and po ssible depressurization of the cabin or disabling of aircraft systems from fi rearm discharge the law provides for temporary suspension of the program if the firearm of federal flight deck officer accidentally discharges due to shortcomin g in standards training or procedures until the shortcoming is corrected training who should conduct the training the law specifies that training of federal flight deck officers was to begin within three months after enactment fo llowing enactment the tsa convened task force to define the training program and address other implement ation issues the law provides that the training program ma be administered either by the under secretary or by firearms training facility approved by the under secretary this leaves to the under secretarys discretion whether the training will be provided by tsa facilities and staff by facilities and staff of other federal law enforcement agencies or organizations or by contract or facilities one advantage of using tsa facilities is that doing so could maximize standardization of training for pilots and compliance with the standards and guidelines established by the under secretary it could also improve coordi nation of training and pro cedures between federal flight deck officers and federal air marshals who will need to coordinate and communicate effectively when dealing with inflight situations that may arise however tsa training facilities may become overburdene d

especially given that the pilots will need to complete this training during their time off one alternative that has been consid ered is to use federal bureau of investigation fbi traini ng facilities in december 2001 the fbi released its proposal for training airline pilots term ed the cockpit protection program the advantage of this plan is that it is ready well defined and includes assessments of the facility and staff requirements needed to administer the training the disadvantage of this program is that it re moves the training from the direct control of the tsa who would instead assume an oversight role to ensure that training standards established by the under secretary are maintained also this arrangement may not offer the opportunity for specific training regarding the coordination of duties and responsibilitie s between federal flight deck officers and federal air marshals another federal entity named as possible provider of training for federal flight deck officers is the federal law enforcement training center fletc which has facilities in glynco ge orgia charleston south ca rolina and artesia new mexico these facilities may provide capabilities to train rger groups of pilots at locations that may be more convenient to some but lik the fbi facilities these facilities may have limited oversight by tsa and ma not offer the opportunity for training on coordination with federal air marshals using contractor facilities andor cont ractor staff to administer training to federal flight deck officers are also opti ons but ones that pose several challenges extensive oversight of contr actor provided training may be necessary to ensure that established curriculum and qualifications standards are maintained if multiple contracts are used to train federal flight deck officers standardization of training across vendors may be difficult to maintain one advantage of using contract training for the program might be the reduction of capital investment for facilities and personnel prototype training program was held in april 2003 used fletc facilities in glynco georgia to train an initial group of 48 pilots full imp lementation of the program began in july 2003 at the glynco facilities as well as facilities in artesia new mexico in september 2003 the prog ram was moved in its entirety to the artesia new mexico facilities because that site has aircra ft mockups for training that were not available at glynco and other law enforcement training at glynco georgia was limiting facilities available for the prog ram there some pilot groups have complained that the tsas reliance on single site and the remote location of the artesia new mexico f acility 269 miles from the n earest major airport in albuquerque creates considerable inc onvenience for attending the training17 admiral loy noted that while the initial training is being conducted at federal facilities as the program evolves there very well may be private sector

of federal air marshals training to ensure that the officer maintains exclusive control overthe officers firearm at all times including training in defensive maneuvers and training to assist the

and federal air marshals while many of the details of the federal air marshal training program are classified nd cannot be disclosed it has been reported that the program consists of 10 ½ weeks of progressive training starting with basic marksmanship followed by reactive firearms training scenarios followed by advanced firearms techniques specific to the aircraft cabin environment followed by scenariobased exercises using wide body and narrowbody aircraft mockups 20 pilot groups including alpa and the allied pilots association apa have suggested that initial training for federal flight

classr oom instruction firearms training and tactical drills the legislation also specifies that federal flight deck officers will have to re qualify at an interval required by the under secretary the fbi cockpit protection program specified an annual requalifica tion interval the selection of re qualification interval will need to strike balance between adequately ensuring that qualification standards are maintained while ensuring that the process does not overburden tsa resources or place an undue schedule burden on fe deral flight deck officers who will need to requalify during time away from their flying jobs how will the effectiveness of the training be evaluated the law does not specify any criteria or guidelines for assessing the effectiveness of the program or the training provided under the program given that the primary objective of the program is deterrence of terrorism and criminal acts against the flight deck effectiveness of the program in this regard will be difficult if not impossible to assess successful terrence may be indicated by statistics regarding security incidents aboard aircraft however it will be difficult to attribute any reduction in security incidents directly to this program this is especially true in consideration of the fact that the fede ral flight deck program is but one component of larger effort to heighten aviation secur ity in response to terrorist threats that also includes enhanced passenger and baggage screening and th deployment of federal air marshals nonetheless the effectiveness of certain elements of the program can be assessed for example the effectiven ess of training can be assessed through evaluation of performance during requalifica tion also effectiveness of the program with regards to risk management can be ssessed though analysis of data on incidents of firearms mishandling accidental discha rges lost and stolen weapons and so on operational procedures storage and transportation of the firearm should the weapon be stored at secu re airport facilities or carried by the federal flight deck officer traveling to and from duty the legislation identifies storage and trans portation of firearms as an issue to be addressed in establishing the procedur requirements for the program the legislation specifies that particular ttention should be given to storage and transportation of firearms on internationa l flights and when the pilot leaves the airport to remain overnight away from the pilots base airport pilot groups have argued for allowing federal flight deck officers to

pilots the washington post 20 february 2003 p a8 24 ibidopponents of such plan argue that pilots carrying weapons both in airports and to and from work could be the target of terrorists and criminals seeking to steal their firearms and increases the potential for mishandling of the firearm and accidental discharges in february 2003 tsa task force study ing the implementation issues for the federal flight deck officer program recommended the use of lock boxes for transporting the firearms pilot groups have voiced concerns that the use of lock boxes undermines the intent of the legislati on which they believe specifies that the officer maintains exclusive control ove r his or her firearm at all times22 the tsa has indicated that its decision is based on the very specific nature of the mission outlined in the legislation which permits p ilots to use their weapons only in defense of the flight deck the tsa considers the lock box as means to minimize the risk that the firearms will be used in other situations however the airline pilots security alliance apsa is concerned that the use of lock boxes to transport firearms may make pilots particularly vulnerable targets for thieves seeking to steal their weapons and provides pilots with means for personal security to protect against this threat23 currently tsa requires the firearm to be carried in secured lock box and only opened inside secure cockpit should the firearm be concealed concealment of the issued firearm is not specifically addressed in the legislation but was significant issue considered in establishing the pro cedural requirements of the program carrying concealed firearm would prevent the flying public from determining which pilots were federal flight deck officers doing so could prevent federal flight deck officers from becoming targets of attempts to seize or steal firearms concealing the firearms could also benefit pilots who are not participants in the program since individuals intending criminal acts against flight deck will not have foreknowledge of whether the pilots on th flight deck are armed or not on the other hand carrying concealed weapon in the airport terminal outside controlled access areas of airports and during travel to and from work could complicate security screening and law enforcement efforts to establish pilots status as federal flight deck officer authorized to carry concealed firearm pilot groups have also raised the issue of whether federal flight deck officers will be permitted to carry backup firearms24 it is common practice among law enforcement officers to carry concealed backup firearms currently the flight deck officers are only issued one weapon which must be transported in secured lock box that is concealed in pilots cases but not

program as an issue that was addresse d in establishing the pro cedural requirements for the program adequate methods for preventin g forgery of identification and accounting for misplaced or stolen identification are needed to ensure that terrorists and criminals cannot breach security checkpoint s by impersonating federal flight deck officers the aviation and transportati on security act atsa pl 10771 115 stat 597 mandated the establishment of uniform system of identification for all state and local law enforcement personnel for use in obtaining permission to carry weapons in aircraft cabins and in obtaining access to secured area of an airport if otherwise authorized to carry such weapons the tsa also currently has several research efforts examining technolog ies for establishing standardized transportation worker identification card twic and for exploring the use of biometric technologies for iden tification future deployme nts of systems using these technologies may provide enhanced capab ility to assure positive identification of federal flight deck officers federal flig ht deck officers are identified by credentials issued by tsa but specific procedures for verifying these credentials is considered security sensitive information where should screening and iden tification checking of federal flight deck officers take place if it is determined that concealing the identity of federal flight deck officers would be desirable aspect of the program then security screening of federal flight deck officers and other flight crew at s ecurity checkpoints in open public spaces may diminish the effectiveness of the program as previously noted public identification of federal flight deck officers may have negative consequences for both federal flight deck officers who may be targeted in attempts to seize firearms and for pilots not participating in the program whose flight s may be targeted if it is determined that federal flight deck officer is not on boar d screening of pilots in open view may also compromise specific security procedures to validate the identity of federal flight deck officers however alternative arrang ements for screening of flight crew may be impractical particularly at smalle r airports where employee and passenger screening are collocated flight deck operational procedures where should the firearm be pl aced during flight operations the legislation identifies the placement of federal flight deck officers firearm on board the aircraft to ensure security and ease of retrieval as an issue to be addressed in developing the procedural requirements of the program holstered weapon may present safety hazard as it ma interfere with the pilots full range of motion and prevent performance of normal f light deck duties holstered weapon may also be difficult to access from seat ed position however alternative optionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31674crs13 25 while the act contains language limiting th liability of air carriers and federal flight deck officers for damages arising from federal flight deck officers use or failure to use firearm there is ambiguity whether this protection would extend to other flight crew actions particularly actions related to flig ht operations during periods when one pilot is performing federal flight deck officer functionsinvolving aircraft modifica tions for securing firearms on the flight deck would require industry retrofitting of flight decks for all affected transport category airplanes and faa certification of these designs simple designs may be easily approved and implement ed however more elaborat designs for housing firearms on the flight deck may require more deta iled test and evaluation as part of the certification process due to significant differences in flight deck layouts among transport category aircraft standardization across aircraft types in manner that optimizes positioning of the firearm may be difficult to achieve these designs may also have difficulty accommodating differences in physical dimensions and handedness among federal f light deck officers what coordination of flight crew and law enforcement personnel is needed the legislation identifies interaction between federal flight deck officer and federal air marshal on board the aircraft and methods for ensuring that pilots are able to identify law enforcement officers authorized to carry firearm aboard the aircraft as issues to be ddressed in establishing the pr ocedural requirements of the program such coordination will need to address concerns over concealing the identity of federal air marshals while allowing sufficient coordination between them and federal flight deck officers airlines have procedures in place for identifying armed law enforcement officers and making these individuals known to flight crews these procedures may need to be enhan ced and further standardized by tsa to ensure that flight crews can easily recognize armed law enforcement officers on board and coordinate w ith them if needed the legislation also identifies the divisi on of responsibility between pilots in the event of an act of criminal violence or air piracy for instances where either one or both of the flight crew are federal flight deck officers as an additional issue to be addressed in implementing the program this raises question of what if any training and educati onal materials regarding the federal flight deck officer program will be made availabl to nonparticipatin g flight crew and cabin crew members currently only very limited information about the program is available to them while flight crews and cabin crews alread receive initial and recurrent training in faa mandated crew resource management crm training programs that facilitates coordination of duties and re sponsibilities airlines are unlikely to address the subject of division of responsibility when pilot mu st perform duties as federal flight deck officer citing that this is federal function and possibly fearing liability issues if such matters are addressed in training25 furthermore there is requirement in the legislation for training or education of nonparticipating f light crew personnel regarding the program and most details of the program have not been released because of their security sensitive nature thus it has been largely left up to individual federal flight deck officers to brief nonparticipating flight crew on thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31674crs14 coordination of flight duties if the flight deck we re attacked the coordination among multiple flight crew members who are deputized federal flight deck officers is likely much less troublesome as they ve undergone the same standard training and thus have better unde rstanding of the division of responsibilities during an attack how should disturbances in th passenger cabin be handled the legislation specifies procedures for ensuring that the firearm of federal flight deck officer does not leave the cockpit if there is disturbance in the passenger cabin as an issue to be addressed in blishing the procedural requirements of the program current guidelines and procedur prohibit federal flight deck officers from intervening in cabin disturbances rather federal flight deck officers are instructed to use their weapons and traini ng only in the defense of the flight deck which is consistent with the intent of the law establishing this program disturbances in the passenger cabin are ft to be handled by flight attendants federal air marshals or any other law enfo rcement personnel on the aircraft federal flight deck officers are instructed to use their judgment and any available information they can ascertain from flight attendants and so on to determine the best course of action for diverting the aircraft to location where ground based law enforcement can intervene if needed while the aviation and transportation security act pl 10771 specifies that the faa may develop and implement methods such as video monitors or other surveillance technologies to alert pilots in the flight deck to activity in the cabin such devices are not yet available but are being developed what procedures should be est ablished for opening the cockpit door and leaving the cockpit additionally the legislation specifies pro cedures for ensuring that the firearm of federal flight deck officer does not leave the cockpit if the pilot leaves the cockpit for personal reasons as an issue to be addressed in estab lishing the procedural requirements of the program procedures relating to opening the cockpit door for other reasons are not specifically addressed in the legislation but were examined in the implementation of the program r easons for opening the cockpit door and leaving the cockpit during flight include flight crew meal and beverage service flight crew changes on longdura tion flights use of the lavatory and abnormal or emergency situations that require actions outside of the cockpit such events may result in physical separation between the fe deral flight deck officer and his or her firearm if the firearm is to be secured on th flight deck at all times occasions when the cockpit door is opened and when the flig ht crew is moving about may in fact be the most risky times with regard to potential attack procedures may be needed to address these various scenarios and mitigate the risks associated with opening the cockpit doorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31674crs15 26 congressional budget office congressional budget offi ce cost estimate hr 4635 arming pilots against terrorism act p 2 27 ricardo alonsozaldivar op cit sara kehaulani goo tsa nearly ready to begin 28 matthew weinstock tsa pilots wage war of wordscosts what will the costs to th federal government be the law specifies that the under secretary shall be obligated to provide all training supervision and equipment needed for the program at expense to the pilot or the air carrier employing the pilot thus direct training costs will be the obligation of the federal government this will include initial training and qualification as well as recurrent training and requalification of pilots in the program the federal government is also obligated to provide equipment needed for the program these equipment expenses will primarily consist of issued firearms and ammunition as well as any equipment needed to maintain the firearms this may also include facilities to house firearms at airports the federal government will also incur the costs of additional background checks or screening that may be necessary to determine the fitness of pilot to participate in the program total costs to the federal government for the program will be highly dependent on the number of pilots that volunteer and qualify to participate in the program as well as the rate at which pilots are tr ained and deputized congressional budget office cbo cost estima tes for the program were based upon earlier proposed legislation 107th congress hr 4635 that limited participation to 2 percent of pilots employed by air carriers in this estimate the cbo assumed that it would cost about 8000 per pilot annually to cover the co sts of equipment training and travel26 this figure does not include costs required to manage the program in preparing to implement the prototype program tsa s indicated that it will cost about 10400 per pilot for training and equipment the tsa budgeted total 500000 to conduct the prototype program27 in the consolidated appropriations resolution for fy2003 pl 1087 the tsa was given 8 million to startup the federal flight deck officer program and begin full scal implementation of the program which began in july 2003 the homeland security appropria tions for fy 2004 pl 10890 117 stat 1137 gave the tsa 25 million for continuing the program at this funding level more than 2000 pilots could be deputized as federal flight deck officers by the end of fy 2004 assuming tsa is able to c onduct the background screening and training for this number of pilots over the course of the fiscal year currently tsa is conducting weekly initial training classes of 48 pilots each28 what will the costs to part icipants and airlines be the law specifies that pilots participating in the program shall not be eligible for compensation from the federal government for services provided as flight deck officer the law further states that the federal government and the air carriers shall not be obligated to compensate the pilots for any training qualification or re qualification to carry firearms under this program consequently pilots are nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31674crs16 compensated by the federal government while attending training while the air carriers employing pilots participating in this program are not obligated to compensate pilots such compensation may be topic for negotiations between air carriers and pilot unions consequently policies may vary from one air carrier to another similarly indirect costs of training such as travel to and from the training site and lodging and per diem while in training could either be paid by the individual pilots participating in the program or by the air carriers employing these pilots while pilots may use their access to free airline transportation on space available basis for travel to and from the training site it is likely that most other indirect costs arising from participation in th program will be the responsibi lity of the pilots themselves given the airlines early oppos ition to this program it is unlikely that compensation for pilots and payment of their indirect costs associated with participation in this progra m would be concession that airlines are likely to make in negotiations with pilots unions this is especially true in light of the economic difficulties facing many airlines that prompted them to request tax relief from the federal government and ask for conce ssions from pilot unions and other labor groups rather than vice versa conseque ntly in the current economic environment pilots will most likely have to complete training qualif ication and re qualification during their own time and are likely to pay the indirect costs for training and participating in the program out of pocket one issue that may arise is whether these out of pocket expenses incurred by pilots participating in the program will be tax deductible while the law specifies that equipment cost is federal obligation it is uncertain who would pay for cockpit modifications if it is determined that such modifications are needed to store or secure firearms used in the program onboard the aircraft even if the direct costs for making such modifications are covered by the federal government air carri ers may be burdened by indi rect costs associated with removing aircraft from service to make any needed modifications the current program does not require an cockpit modifications scope of the

carrier servic that are not applicable to cargo air carrier operations include the presence of large numbers of passenger on board the aircraft carrying firearms in controlled access areas where rge numbers of people are present and coordination of law enforcement duties and responsibilities with federal air marshals and other law enforcement officers on board the aircraft cargo flights initially could not participate in the program nor could flight engineers or other flight crew members who are not formally considered pilots however provision in the faa reauthorization legislation pl 108176 expanded the program to include all flight crew member s of both passenger and allcargo air carrier aircraft proponents for including cargo pilots am ong the cadre of federal flight deck officers note that layers of security pr otection similar to those in place to protect passenger air carrier aircraft are not required for air cargo operations they argue that this leaves cargo flight crews vulnerable to potential terrorist threats against cargo aircraft including large and heavy aircraft that could be used in an attack similar to that launched on september 11 2001 they suggest that this vulnerability can be mitigated by allowing cargo air carrier pilots to participate in the program in statement issued november 15 2002 captai n david webb chairman of air line pilot associations fedex unit expressed the following view cargo aircraft is devoid of cabin attendants and air marshals however at airlines such as fedex employees nd vendors are routinely boarded political maneuvering by the cargo industry has sh ielded them from the level of security screening mandated for the passenger term inal the entire burden for the security of the aircraft rests on the two or three p ilots in the cockpit there is little we can do to defend the aircraft against terrorist attack stripping us of the ability to carry firearms in the post911 environment is an appallingly irresponsible act and the worst part is that it is our own managements that did this to us with discussion warning ju stification whatsoever29 opponents argued that the general pub lic does not have authorized access to cargo aircraft and therefore enhanced groundbased security measures to better protect cargo aircraft and improve screening of employees authorized to access these aircraft would make deputizing cargo p ilots as federal flight deck officers unnecessary some also argued that costly training for federal flight deck officers is not needed for cargo pilots because the operational environment of cargo aircraft does not introduce the same risks associated with arming pilots of passenger aircraft30 consequently separate program with separate standards training and guidelines was considered by some to be more suitable for implementation in the air cargo industry besides cargo air carrier pilots other p ilots such as ondemand air charter pilots and pilots flying for fractionalownership programs may also seek participation in the program although this has not happened to date proponents for including these pilots in the federal flight deck officer program may argue that currently there arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31674crs18 few if any security protections to guard against threats of air piracy and criminal violence in these types of aviation operations arming these pilots they argue may serve as the most viable means for providing security in these highly varied operations where control of access to the aircraft and flight deck is more difficult opponents of such proposal argue that the inclusion of these pilots in the federal flight deck officer program would significantly increase the costs of the program and would lead to further proliferation of fir earms in the aviation environment that may compromise other security initiatives thus far there have been legislative initiatives to include these types of pilots in the ffdo program
