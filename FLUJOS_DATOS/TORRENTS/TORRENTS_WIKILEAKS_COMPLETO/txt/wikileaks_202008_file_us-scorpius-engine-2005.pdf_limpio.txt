development of the scorpius loxkerosene engine family dr jeffrey muss sierra engineering inc dr shyama chakroborty and dr ivett leyva microcosm inc abstract microcosm and sierra engineering have been developing series of lowcost pressure fed loxkerosene engines to power the scorpius family of launch vehicles this paper focuses on the design fabrication and testing of 20k lb f ofo triplet injector with flighttype ablative chamber the test results indicated good performance and stability the ablation rates were higher than desired minor design modifications an d additional testing will complete the engine verification process introduction microcosm has been involved in the development of lowcost ablative engines since the inception of the scorpius program in 19921 lowcost pressurefed engines constitute one of the three key technologies used on the scorpius family of suborbital and orbital launch vehicles the other technologies are allcomposite propellant tanks and high perfor mance pressurization systems hpps the scorpius family of engines are lowcost simple pressurefed designs of thrust classes ranging from 5k to 320k lb f the engines use lox and jeta kerosene to power all stages for example the sprite minilift vehicle shown in figure 1 is capable of launching 800 lb m to leo2 microcosms 20k lb f engines and its derivative larger engines are configured in various launch vehicles within the scorpius family based on the payload requirements of the respective launch vehicle single 20k lb f engine is used on the suborbital srm vehicle as well as for the individual pods of the sprite booster and sustainer stages figure 1 sprite minilift launch vehicle larger vehicles use cluster of these engines to meet the propulsion requirements for example the eagle vehicle capable of carrying two times the payload of the baseline sprite vehicle 1600 lb m to leo is configured with two 20k lb f engines in each of the pods of the first and second stages the liberty vehicle wi th roughly four times the payload of the sprite vehicle would require four 20k lb f engines per pod instead to minimize the complexity of the copyright 2005 by microcosm inc published by the

20050356l 11 pagessystem microcosm plans to use single 80k lb f thrust engine in each pod of the liberty vehicle the upper stages of the various launch vehicles in the scorpius family require lower thrust than the booster and 2nd stages the upper stage weight also optimizes with reduced tank pressures 200 psi for the upper stage versus 550 psi for the booster the lower tank pressure mandates reduced engine chamber pressure the eagle launch vehicle requires an 8k lb f thrust class upper stage engine design studies have shown that the booster engi ne design can be operated at the reduced thrust levels with minor modifications this not only minimizes the development cost of the engine it keeps the production cost down as the engine shares many parts with the booster engine engine design the engine technolog started with the design development and flight demonstration of 5k lb f thrustclass engine figure 2 for expendable engines ablativelycooled chambers provide good performance at greatly reduced cost compared to regenerativelycooled chamber designs the flight engine utilized likeon like doublet injector and an ablative chamber although an foof split triplet was also tested microcosm began working with sierra engineering sierra to develop lowcost 20k lb f injector in late 2002 scorpius requirements for the 20k lb f engine are listed in table 1 sierra traded seven different injection element concepts on variety of criteria including performance stability compatibility development cost and recurring cost the trade ranked an fo triplet like doublet and pintle as the top three injector concepts the ofo triplet injection element is ideally suited for loxhydrocarbon propellant combinations where the injected of mixture ratio mr for optimal performance is about 26 figure 2 5k lb f thrust chambers table 1 20k lb f scorpius launch vehicle engine requirements propellants oxidizer lox per milprf22508f fuel jeta per astm d165504 nominal mixture ratio mr

maximum wall temperature 3900 r compatible with silica phenolic chamber liner triplet injectors offer the potential for higher performance than the doublet injector even with the coarse injector pattern needed to achieve acceptable stability characteristics3 however wall compatibility can be an issue with ofo triplet injectors this injector is the baseline for the current family of scorpius launch vehicles the injector includes 63 ofo triplets with equal orifice diameters 0116 inches canted showerhead fuel film cooling ffc orifices 66 are located around the periphery adjustment of the ffc orifice size and inclusion of metering plate permit the ffc to be varied between 2 and 12 the injector layout incorporates flooded lox manifold for enhanced cooling of the injector face figure 3 detailed transient thermalstructural of the injector assembly showed very little plasticity and ratcheting cyclical manson strain range is below 00059 with life predicted to exceed 580 cycles with safety factor of 10 the injector was designed to reduce production costs while enhancing reliability interpropellant leak paths were eliminated materials with excellent oxygen compatibility were selected4 welds were reduced to two with neither contributing to crit1 failure brazes were eliminated the component designs were iterated with machine shops to optimize them for cnc machining pretest analysis suggested that the engine would be at least sp ontaneously stable without the use of stability aids testing was planned in both steel hardwall chamber and flighttype ablative chamber provisions were made to include ¼wave acoustic cavities if necessary cavity spool was built for the hardwall chamber and the ablative chamber could be cut to create the necessary recess the ablative combustion chamber is made of silica phenolic with graphiteepoxy filament overwrap this is scaleup of the 5k lbf chamber fabrication process figure 4 ignition of the 1st stage booster engine will utilize ground ignition system likely pyrotechnic or bipropellant torch however the 2nd and 3rd stages rely on pyrophoric ignition for highaltitude ignition and restart capability the injector incorporates three ports that can be used for both chamber pressure measurement and injection of the pyrophoric ignitier fluid initial ground testing utilized pyrotechnic ignition system figure 3 20k lb f triplet injector before t and after b faceplate is attached the development of an 80k lb f thrust engine for the liberty vehicle derived from the 20k lb f triplet engine was initiated under phase i sbir from afrl parallel development is proceeding figure 4 20k lb f ablative chambers engine testing 2week engine test campaign was conducted in the north test cell of test stand 2a at edwards afb during may 2005 testing was performed using both the hardwall steel chamber figure 5 and three flighttype ablative chamber figure 6 two injectors were tested sn 001 with 38 ffc and sn 002 with 71 ffc figure 5 20k lb f with hardwall chamber on test stand 2a at edwards afb there were twelve succ essful hot fire tests table 2 out of eighteen attempted tests most failed tests were associated with facility redline kills test chamber pressure pc ranged from 243 to 392 psia and covered mr range from 218 to 236 the maximum test duration was 30 seconds up to 5 starts were performed on single ablative chamber posttest inspection of the injectors showed good hardware durability there was damage to the injector face figure 7 couple small pits were found on the injector periphery one was associated with remanufactured film cooling injection hole figure 8 throat erosion appeared to be uniform figure 7 characteristic velocity c was the primary performance metric as thrust was not measured during this test series redundant measurements included propellant flowrate and injector face pressure delivered c calculations accounted for throat c d and total pressure loss between the injector face and throat the throat area was estimated from pre and posttest throat measurements using conservative assumptions for throat growth rate detailed uncertainty analysis was performed on the calculated c uncertainty was computed to be 139 about 76 fts c specific impulse isp values were estimated from delivered c and predicted nozzle efficiency this translates into an isp uncertainty of 4 lbfslbm figure 6 20k lb f engine firing with flighttype chamber the delivered c ranged from 5423 to 5547 fts during long duration tests the estimated vacuum isp ranged from 281 to 288 lb fslbm in all cases exceeding the required 280 lb fslbm there is weak trend of increasing engine performance with increasing chamber pressure figure 9 and figure 10 the data also shows weak downward trend in c with increasing mr figure 10 there is clear decrease in performance as ffc percentage is increased figure 9 test 19 was very near the nominal engine operating condition producing an average c of 5387 fts 934 efficiency and vacuum isp of 285 lbfslbm figure 7 posttest images of injector sn 001 t and chamber sn 002 b dynamic combustion stability was never demonstrated per cpia 6555 the injector was initially tested in steel hardwall chamber that did not include acoustic cavities during the second bipropellant test test 3 the injector transitioned from rough combustion 8 peaktopeak roughness to an organized limitcycle 1t instability 2800 hz the instability resulted in only minor damage to the injector pitting of the face bolts however errors in the engine shutdown sequence resulted in damage of the hardwall chamber yielding it unusable on subsequent tests figure 8 closeup of pit on injector lip associated with remanufactured ffc orifice subsequent testing was performed using ablative chambers the chamber headend was modified to create ¼wave acoustic cavity the ablative chambers did not include highfrequency chamber pressure measurements however the injector instrumentation included triaxial shock accelerometers data from test 3 showed good frequency correlation between the accelerometers and the chamber pressure measurement and it permitted the accelerometer amplitude to be roughly correlated with chamber pressure oscillations figure 12 data from test 17 indicates steady acceleration of approximately 70 g peaktopeak which corresponds to about 20 psi peaktopeak about 75 of pc the effectiveness of the acoustic cavity was also demonstrated during the course of test 17 there were several large amplitude about 80 psi or 35 of pc pops figure 13 these pops damped quickly approximately 4 msec well below the cpia 655 requirement damp time of less than 21 msec the chamber ablation rate was slightly higher than desired for the scorpius launch vehicle family booster and sustainer engines in particular there was too much erosion in the barrel portion of the chamber the barrel ablation rate is high in part because the film cooling injection orifices were not configured for the incl usion of the acoustic cavity the inclusion of the acoustic cavity forced the ffc to jump the cavity inlet before creating fuel film along the wall the location of the cavity lip should have been considered when the ffc spray angle was set the barrel ma terial density and fuel film cooling injection features are being adjusted to enhance compatibility between the chamber and the triplet injector this should minimize the erosion rate the barrel wall could also be made thicker to increase life three narrow field radiometers were mounted to measure the exhaust plume emission figure 14 data comparisons with model plume calculations showed good agreement the model plume calculations are critical part of the vehicle base heating analyses summary the scorpius family of rocket engines has achieved development milestone 20k lbf ofo triplet injector was tested with flighttype silica phenolic ablative chambers the calculated isp ranged from 281 to 288 lb fslbm with an uncertainty of 4 lbfslbm total of 12 tests were run with maximum run duration of 30 sec 1t instability 2800 hz occurred early in the test series with the hardwall chamber nine subsequently tests in an ablative chamber incorporating ¼wave acoustic cavity showed good stability characteristics the ablation rates were slightly higher than desired minor design changes to the injector and the ablative liners are being performed to complete the 20k lb f engine development references 1 conger re chakroborty s wertz jr and kulpa j the scorpius expendable launch vehicle family and the status
