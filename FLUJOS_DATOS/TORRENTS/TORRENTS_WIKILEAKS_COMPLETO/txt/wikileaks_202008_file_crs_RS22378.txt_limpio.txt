ukraines orange revolution and us policy by steven woehrel and crs issue brief ib92089 russia by stuart d goldman background russian energy and pipelines russia is major player in world energy markets in 2004 its 1700 trillion cubic feet tcf of natural gas reserves were the largest of any country they are 74 greater than those of iran holder of the next largest reserves russia also is the worlds largest gas producer the worlds largest gas exporter and the second largest oil exporter energy exports have been major driver of russias economic growth in recent years making the russian economy vulnerable to energy price fluctuations the natural gas sector however is impaired by ageing fields near total domination by gazprom the staterun gas monopoly government regulation and inadequate export pipelines which are operated by gazprom thus russias gas production has risen only modestly since the late 1990s this limitation and law requiring gazprom to supply the gas used to heat and power russias domestic market at belowmarket prices provide gazprom strong incentive to export and to increase the prices it charges foreign customers exports have been increasing russian gas now provides about onefourth of the gas consumed by europe and twothirds of gazproms revenue comes from sales to europe where gas is sold at much higher prices than in russia president vladimir putin has hailed these exports as the central means by which russia will reclaim its status as world superpower which it lost when the soviet union collapsed in 1991 the ukrainian gas pipeline system plays large role as an intermediary connecting russia with growing european markets and ukraine itself is an importer of russian gas congressional research service the library of congress crs2 in the past few years however turkmenistan has become ukraines largest source of natural gas imports more than 90 of ukraines natural gas imports are reexported to world markets about 3800 billion cubic feet bcf of russian and turkmen natural gas transited ukraine route to europe in 2004 this represented roughly 30 of oecd europes natural gas imports and 80 of russias natural gas exports1 in 2004 piped russian gas accounted for 72 of hungarys gas consumption 44 of germanys 29 of italys and 26 of frances gas and ukrainian politics not only have russias natural gas supplies to ukraine and the transit of russian gas through ukraine to europe been key to ukraines economy but some ukrainian officials and others have long had profitable ties with gazprom and russian officials in ukraine these ties have resulted in vast fortunes being made and political power for few one former ukrainian energy official yuliya tymoshenko emerged as key figure in the opposition to president leonid kuchma after he dismissed her from the government in 2001 the orange revolution in ukraine in 2004 resulted in the ouster of the prorussian leadership and the election of the reformist and prowestern viktor yushchenko as president he appointed tymoshenko as prime minister who vowed to fight corruption in ukraines energy sector infighting httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22378 within the governing coalition between tymoshenkos supporters and business leaders close to yushchenko including over tymoshenkos investigations of the gas industry led yushchenko to dismiss her in september 2005 the january 2006 russian gas cutoff gazprom reportedly began talks with ukraine in early 2005 on increasing the price of gas ukraine resisted arguing that an existing agreement guaranteed low price 50 per thousand cubic meters or tcm until 2009 gazprom in mid2005 requested price rise to 160 per tcm but in late 2005 requested 230 per tcm2 president putin in late december stated that russias fraternal ties with ukraine dictated his open intervention and he offered loan to ukraine to help it pay for the higher priced gas when ukraine rejected this proposal russian state television showed putin and gazprom head aleksey miller one of putins longtime associates agreeing on december 31 to cut off supplies to ukraine ukraine compensated by using some gas that gazprom intended for european customers prompting gazprom to accuse ukraine of stealing and of being an unreliable transit country ukraine argued variously that it was continuing longtime arrangement of taking gas as transit fee in lieu of cash or that it was taking delivery of gas provided by turkmenistan the shortfall in gas reaching european customers prompted their immediate protests and gazprom restored pipeline flows on january 2 2006 the russian government and gazprom on january 4 hurriedly reached an interim agreement with ukraine on complicated formula for ensuring gas supplies to ukraine until april 2006 the agreement calls for gas to be purchased by ukraine through an 1 energy information administration ukraine country analysis brief january 2005 2 gazprom also requested higher gas payments from armenia georgia and moldova while russias foreign minister pointed to the request to prorussian armenia as evidence that political motives were not involved putin had stressed that it is one thing to subsidize our neighbors and friends and another thing to subsidize let us say shady business in ukraine fbis december 29 2005 doc cep27141 february 5 2006 doc cep27048 crs3 intermediary firm rosukrenergo this firm pays for gas from central asia at lower price and from russia at higher price and provides it to ukraine at an average price of 95 per tcm3 the agreement also provides for higher transit fee payments to ukraine in cash rather than in gas perhaps more troubling for ukraine the accord calls for the creation of joint venture between rosukrenergo and the ukrainian gas firm naftogaz that grants the former onehalf of ukraines domestic market putin hailed the agreement as establishing actual market relations and as guaranteeing stable conditions for delivering russian fuel to our european partners for years to come4 implications for russia and ukraine russia the gas cutoff has highlighted for many observers the intertwined relations between gazprom and the russian government and the use of gazprom as an instrument of foreign policy some observers have placed credence in gazproms argument that because most of its other foreign customers paid more for gas the previous gas payments by ukraine were below the market rate other observers have discounted gazproms assertion that the gas cutoff was necessary or appropriate to convince ukraine to pay more they have argued that gazproms actions were driven less by business motives than by the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22378 strategic goals of the increasingly authoritarian putin government these include according to this argument punishing ukraine for democratizing and moving toward the west gaining control over transit pipelines to europe and being accorded neosuperpower status5 whether russia is succeeding in any of these goals will depend on the outcome of the planned march 2006 legislative election in ukraine see below and other developments gazprom seemed unsuccessful in gaining control over transit pipelines in ukraine although it appeared to gain greater influence over gas sales to domestic customers in ukraine some observers have dismissed assertions by putin and others that russia is becoming an economic and political superpower they have argued that economies like russias where the energy sector is the main engine of growth are economically fragile and that such countries have not been central players in international politics while many european and soviet successor states that purchase russian gas may be vulnerable to russian pressure in the near term russias economic growth could suffer in the long term if the states diversify their suppliers if it comes to choice some believe that europe will diversify suppliers and take other measures before abandoning policy of urging democracy and human rights in russia and central asia6 some observers have argued that russias gas cutoff was less the result of rational business decisions or strategic objectives and more the result of infighting among corrupt politicians and criminal elements in both russia and ukraine they question the role that rosukrenergo plays in delivering gas to ukraine and its nontransparent ownership and 3 many observers have raised concerns about the ownership and operations of rosukrenergo formed in 2004 onehalf of its shares are owned by gazprom other undisclosed shareholders allegedly include russian and ukrainian government officials and organized crime elements 4 rossiya television january 4 2006 russiaukraine agreement was signed on february 2 2006 establishing the joint venture 5 mary dejevsky the independent uk january 3 2006 6 alexander motyl ukraine vs russia january 17 2006 crs4 finances these critics have raised concerns about whether russia will become less reliable as an energy supplier and higher risk for foreign energy investments7 ukraine the russiaukraine gas cutoff and subsequent agreement may have significant impact on ukraines economy and political situation ukraine is one of the most energyinefficient countries in the world ukraines key export industries especially iron and steel production are heavily dependent on cheap energy higher prices could be the incentive for ukraine to finally follow through on efforts to improve energy efficiency and to seek alternative sources of supply ukraines control of pipelines from russia to western european markets has long been balanced by ukraines dependence on russian energy as occurred during the january 2006 gas crisis russian efforts to impose higher prices can be countered by ukraine imposing higher transit tariffs or even by diverting gas earmarked for europe however russia plans to build pipeline under the baltic sea to germany by 2010 that would bypass ukraine and could remove ukraines leverage yushchenko has acknowledged that ukraine must eventually pay market prices for gas but has insisted that the increases occur gradually to permit the economy time to adjust httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22378 the gas crisis came as ukraine was gearing up for march 2006 legislative elections these elections are likely to be key to ukraines domestic reforms and geopolitical orientation in recent opinion polls in ukraine the party of regions headed by the pro russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych is the most popular single party in ukraine yanukovych has said that the gas crisis shows the need for ukraine to join common economic space with russia this stance plays to strong sentiment in the eastern ukrainian powerbase of the party of regions for closer ties to russia it also serves the purposes of eastern ukrainian businessmen who are the main backers of the party of regions these businessmen although not eager to subordinate their personal interests to those of russia nevertheless depend on russia for the cheap energy needed to power the steel and other energyintensive industries that they control8 the gas cutoff has also dealt blow to the credibility of the current ukrainian government led by yushchenkos our ukraine bloc the agreement was criticized by tymoshenko and other observers on several grounds including the dubious reputation of rusukrenergo critics and more importantly rosukrenergo officials said that the agreement provided guarantees that the gas price will remain fixed at 95 per tcm for five years if this is true russia would therefore appear to be free to instigate another crisis in the future perhaps when temperatures in ukraine drop in late 2006 objections to the gas deal caused the ukrainian parliament to adopt vote of confidence in the government in january 2006 yushchenko has maintained that the vote was illegal and has refused to dismiss the government nevertheless the impact of the crisis on the outcome of the legislative election is unclear public opinion polls have shown that support for the main political groups in ukraine has not changed substantially since the gas crisis if yushchenko is perceived 7 financial times january 25 2006 igor torbakov eurasia daily monitor january 6 2006 peter rutland and donald jensen quoted in peter lavelle russia profile january 13 2006 8 fbis february 6 2006 doc cep27227 february 7 2006 doc cep27008 crs5 to have bungled the gas crisis it may further demoralize his supporters depressing turnout in western ukraine on the other hand russias perceived bullying of ukraine could help yushchenko or other parties not closely associated with moscow analysts have noted that in the wake of the gas crisis putin has appeared more conciliatory toward yushchenko they believe that this may reflect kremlin preference to handle russianukrainian relations informally at the highest level pattern adopted by the presidents of both countries since ukraines independence in 1991 however yushchenkos avowed prowestern orientation and reluctance to join common economic space or other political or economic union with russia may have required that he be softened up by the use of the gas weapon according to these observers by such strategy putin may be hoping to secure foreign policy or economic concessions from yushchenko particularly if the party of regions becomes the strongest party in ukraine after the march election it is possible that putin hopes that weakened our ukraine will enter coalition government with the party of regions rather than with tymoshenko who would likely continue to question the gas deal9 putin may also hope to achieve russias goal of ownership of ukraines pipelines and storage facilities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22378 however such russian objectives may be hard to achieve even with the use of the gas weapon most observers believe that it is unlikely that yushchenko will change his prowestern views moreover even under the previous incumbent the prorussian president kuchma ukrainian leaders pursued policy of appearing to promise russia more than they could or would deliver both in foreign policy and in control over gas infrastructure in ukraine in order to secure cheap energy while preserving assets key to ukraines independence however this temporizing ukrainian strategy may have hit dead end with putins more businesslike approach to the gas issue forcing ukraine either into russias political orbit or casting it out into closer relationship to the west implications for us interests the russiaukraine gas dispute has raised concerns about russias domestic and foreign affairs ukraines sovereignty and issues of us and international energy security the administration appeared to take cautious approach toward the russia ukraine dispute over gas pricing but responded forcefully to the january 1 cutoff in common with european governments the united states emphasized russias culpability state department spokesman sean mccormack criticized russia for using energy for political purposes and for acting while europe was in the midst of an extreme cold spell he stressed that while the administration supported gradual increase in prices to market levels it disagreed with precipitous increase and cutoff secretary of state condoleezza rice likewise on january 5 stated that russia had not appeared to be responsible actor in the international economy by making politically motivated efforts to constrain energy supply to ukraine she warned that such efforts also raised concerns about russias suitability for the 2006 chairmanship of the g810 9 eurasian daily monitor february 3 2006 10 the state department statement january 1 2006 daily press briefing january 3 2006 secretary condoleezza rice remarks at the state department correspondents associations breakfast january 5 2006 she later urged continued engagement interview with bob schieffer continued crs6 some observers argue that us concerns about the gas cutoff should not interfere with higher priority usrussian cooperation in combating terrorism or addressing such issues as nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea11 others suggest that the cutoff is emblematic of rising russian neoimperialism which threatens energy security and sovereignty in the soviet successor states and the wider euroatlantic region some of these observers warn that the west is again faced with containing russia12 the russian gas cutoff may increase us government concerns about energy security including the diversity of liquefied natural gas lng suppliers in testimony on february 2 2006 john negroponte the director of national intelligence warned that the gas cutoff was an example of how energy can be used by russia as both political and economic tool and that such actions by key producer states and others pose significant us national security risks or foreign policy challenges13 deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza appeared to reflect such concerns during midjanuary 2006 visit with turkmen president saparamurad niyazov reportedly the two sides discussed cooperation on developing and exporting turkmen energy resources in order to enhance competition on european markets the visit also may have reflected greater us advocacy of multiple oil and gas pipeline routes in the caspian sea region httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22378 including those that do not traverse russia or iran the gas cutoff may affect decisions by us firms about investing in the russian lng industry for future imports14 european governments became increasingly concerned about energy security issues after the gas cutoff european union eu energy ministers plan to meet in march 2006 to discuss cooperation and the development of alternative energy sources and transit routes on february 9 european commission president jose manuel barroso urged euroatlantic cooperation on energy supplies and polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz the next day called for the eu or nato to formulate euroatlantic energy security pact to protect against coercion by gas and oil suppliers15 the gas cutoff has heightened concerns among some in congress that usrussian cooperation on counterterrorism and other strategic issues is threatened and that russia is failing to democratize respect the independence of fellow soviet successor states and meet other conditions of us assistance the cutoff may also strengthen views among some members that russia is not suitable host for planned july 2006 g8 group of eight industrial democracies summit in moscow on energy security senator john mccain reflected such concerns when he called in early february for the g8 leaders to boycott the summit in part because of russias autocratic handling of the gas dispute16 10 continued of cbss face the nation february 12 2006 11 dimitri k simes angeles times january 14 2006 financial times january 6 2006 12 david
