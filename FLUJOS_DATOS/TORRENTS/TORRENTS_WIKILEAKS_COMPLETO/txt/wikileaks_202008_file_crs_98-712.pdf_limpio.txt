about holds and their exact origin appears lost in the mists of history they probably evolved from the early traditions of comity courtesy reciprocity and accommodation that characterized the senates work holds have received limited attention from scholars journalists or pundits in part because there is hardly any public record of who places holds how it is done often by letter to the party leader how many holds are placed on any bill or how long they will be honored by the majority leadership the list of democratic and republican senators who have holds on various asures is kept by the respective leaders of each party only senators may use holds but there have been instances when they have been invoked by legislative staff house members lobbyists or executive officials may request senators to place holds on measures or matters that they prefer the senate not take up originally used by senators to ensure that they would be notified in advance about any timelimitation agreement or motion to proceed and consulted about certain bills and nominations that may be brought to the floor holds have evolved to become potent extraparliamentary practice

party leaders understand that to ignore holds could precipitate objections to unanimous consent requests and filibusters unlike filibusters which may be partly educational in their purpose and which are televised nationally over cspan holds require public utterance little surprise that holds are sometimes referred to as silent filibuster holds are useful devices for gaining leverage and fostering negotiations senators for example may indicate that they have holds on measures or nominations to alert appropriate colleagues that they want to be consulted about measure or nomination signal displeasure with the administration or retaliate in kind against lawmakers who have placed holds on their bills in todays workloadpacked and deadlinedriven senate holds are often particularly effective at the end of session when sponsors of measures may be more open to compromise with the lawmakers having holds on their bills holds too have the virtue of giving lawmakers additional time to study legislation especially during the endofsession rush to adjourn and alerting party leaders to potential scheduling problems g22g162g153g142g156g561g152g143g561g10g152g149g141g156g561 informally there have been attempts by some analysts to classify holds for example there are socalled informational holds where senators wish to be informed or consulted before measure or nomination is brought to the floor revolving or rotating holds where one senator and then another and so on will place holds mae west holds which suggest that the senators who employed the hold wants to bargain with the proponents of the legislation or nomination retaliatory or titfortat holds and choke holds where the objective is to kill the affected bill or

see crs report rl31685 proposals to reform holds in the senate by walter j oleszek the objective of the proposals is not to eliminate the practice but to subject it to openness and accountability for

three days after they have provided written notice to party leader s 2349 failed to be enacted into law the next year the senate adoptedfor the first time evera formal and statutory policy limiting
