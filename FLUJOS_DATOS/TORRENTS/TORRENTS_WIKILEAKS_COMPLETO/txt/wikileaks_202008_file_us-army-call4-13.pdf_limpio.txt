killed during combat operations combat operations and force protection operations remain as relevant and critical during phase iv as during phases iiii multitude of challenges face army forces presently in and out of theater our models of how to man equip and train the force for offensive operations do not link up across the board when dealing with stability and support operations our current doctrine deals with linear battlefield and unified phases of operation our soldier skill sets are focused on the primary mission conversely onthejob training is being used today in theater to prepare soldiers to plan and execute missions that were looked at before as secondary or tertiary great advances are being made in understanding cultural issues at local levels battalion and companygrade officers are challenged to understand and manage issues dealing with the iraqi people with little or training to support their decisions highlight to the tenacity of these soldiers is their ability to overcome lack of training in understanding to execute political and strategic objectives current iraqi sentiment has evolved from personal relationships between coalition soldiers and iraqi citizens because these relationships differ from location to location and person to person it is hard to correlate events and actions with relationship successes or failures an armor task force commander in baghdad described his methodology as that of plotting and measuring everything after positive or negative event he would have his staff evaluate all actions they had conducted before during and after the event this would allow him to correlate activities with outcomes and develop ttp tactics techniques and procedures for future success while not all actions provided equal measures or correlating events this methodological approach helped establish base line of comparative success for his task force it allowed him to utilize the army approach of bda battle damage assessment in regard to stabilization and support operations this task force was very in tune with the local iraqi populace in their area of operation bond was built and cultivated over many months resulting in trust between the military and civilian population as result of this established relationship new anxiety has developed due to the impending transfer of authority toa the local leaders inquired about the replacement force and their capability to be as good as the current command the incumbent task force felt it imperative to prebuild success in established events so that the new command could capitalize on their past positive efforts obviously all of the effort and work to continue positive momentum would be conducted by the current command the local population would see the new command arrive and continue to demonstrate success from the start due to the seamless transfer of authority this is an example of positive exchange and establishes template for future relief in place rip operations that guarantees support from the local community while thankful for the removal of the former regime elements fre to include saddam hussein the local populace has short memory of their past lives they tend to be focused on the current issues and have reasonable need for communication language barriers pose difficult task for all levels in this effort missed intent in local negotiations can mean future significant problems in dealing with other issues poor communication effort may alienate local company commander and cause significant problems in future community negotiations it is imperative that communications be clear and effective and that all concerned are aware of its implications in the iraqi operational environment ioe success in civil administration requires an understanding of iraqi religious and tribal institutions and their relationship with the secular ii for official use onlyoperation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirforms of government inherent to democracy and proposed by the coalition provisional authority cpa furthermore us plans and practices cannot be successful in the absence of knowledge and understanding of iraqi sentiments and perceptions this is all the more important given the high turnover of cpa personnel and the lack of regional expertise held by the majority of coalition military and civilians in iraq although nominally running iraq maneuver commanders are generally not trained in the complexities and subtleties of the area this has resulted in some us practices serving to alienate common iraqis who initially supported the coalition to partially rectify this some oif units have sent division and brigade commanders and staff to jordan to receive instruction on how to operate effectively in arabmuslim iraq despite the excellent work done by numerous soldiers to make parts of the information operations io campaign work effectively phase iv io is executed sporadically in oif vertically integrated horizontally synchronized io campaign simply does not appear to exist some us units understand and use the concepts of setting objectives developing themes and setting measures of effectiveness moe others do not understand the process and therefore are just conducting operations without any measure of success or failure some commanders use tactical psychological operations psyop teams tpts as reactive measure when negative second or third order effects occur most io battle drills are reactionary in nature us commanders grapple with the concept of information operations across the range of military operations while some affirm that this is an io fight and that it should be the priority for coalition efforts others believe that io is not an option but that offensive operations should be the main effort of this stability operations phase io doctrine does not meet the needs of commanders in an operational environment for variety of reasons discussed in the io chapter io does not seem to be integrated into the armys officer education system oes warrant officer education system woes or noncommissioned officer education system ncoes on consistent or standardized basis furthermore io does not appear to be incorporated into most collective training events either as doctrinal component of collective training or as component of training assessment soldiers are performing functions vastly different from those on which they have trained this continues to be challenge this is prevalent with almost every mos in the theater all soldiers are being asked to perform infantry missionsoperations for which they have received very little training they have had to learn through an onthejob training program that has little room for forgiveness but it has become their dominant routine the challenge to hone their skills for successful mission accomplishment has been formidable the performance of combat engineers is perfect example they are continuing to conduct their primary missions of mobility countermobility and survivability but now include direct infantry tactics required by operations such as cordon and search and move to contact route clearance improvised explosive device ied detection elimination of captured ammunition and unexploded ordnance disposal have also become primary missions the shortage of trained explosive ordnance disposal eod personnel and eod detachments has made the engineers force multiplier in this area of operations engineers in one brigade combat team bct have detonated over 80000 tons of unexploded ordnance uxo their vertical and horizontal skills are being employed to satisfy requirements in support of combat operations and host nation building remarkable performances are being realized throughout theater negotiation skills and management of funds now become requirement at the company command and higher levels young commanders are contracting for construction and materials and beginning projects that will assist in future community relations these types of skills are not trained in the traditional officer and noncommissioned officer school systems onthejob training has become the norm the only hesitancy relates to the personal desire to accomplish the process right young company commander described his experience in acquiring materials for road and bridge construction because the local population knew that culvert pipe was required for the project the price escalated upon questioning the vendor it became apparent that local family needs combined for

felt one was paying attention commanders emergency response program cerp funds were provided to commanders to allow them to make improvements in their communities that will have direct and positive impact some have completed school improvements others purchased equipment for the civil defense forces or local police departments others were able to hire garbage collectors or improve roads in and around town because of the flexibility offered by this system commanders can listen to their district or neighborhood advisory counsels and spend their funds in areas that will have the most positive effect in many cases the goals attained may not be closely associated with the national strategic plan but the benefits derived paved the way to better human understanding and relations weapons of terror are still the method of choice for the opposition ieds and vehicleborne improvised explosive devices vbied are the weapons of choice these devices and methods of employment are becoming increasingly sophisticated the terrorists utilize ttps of their own they are watching and monitoring traffic patterns and looking for the obvious regularly scheduled convoys or troop movements they seem to have minimal intelligence on key visitor movements the devices being used are better disguised continually improved and detonated with more precision current methods include the use of remote devices car remotes and garage door openers the trigger mechanisms are now being delayed for maximum effect during one particular event the terrorist detonated an ied injuring soldier knowing his comrades would be quick to respond to the injured troop he waited for additional soldiers to show up and detonated second explosion which produced multiple injuries these methods have large psychological effect on our troops they need to be able to respond to wounded comrade but are slowed by the possible impact of moving too quickly our soldiers are becoming more aware of their surroundings and different signs as one commander coined look for the absence of the normal or the presence of the abnormal this situational awareness can save lives and provide valuable intelligence that might help eliminate terrorist threat it is impossible to prepare for mortar and rocket attacks knowing the locations of bombproof bunkers is probably the most important deterrent most attacks occur between 1800 and 2400 hours because the terrorist can work under the cover of darkness but not be noticed because other personnel are still moving around most attacks are inaccurate most of the mortar and rocket devices are launched through pvc pipes laid on sloped berms and pointed in the direction of known coalition force locations they can be fired individually or in volleys coalition forces have been very successful in vectoring launch locations and apprehending the launch personnel supplying maintaining and sustaining the force has presented new and interesting opportunities and

summary the doctrinal concept of information operations io as combat multiplier seems to be universally misunderstood at nearly every level of the army the common misconception of io is that it is another staff stovepipe with undefined and unresourced missions vertical staff effort that does not seem relevant to combat operations conversely effective io is simply horizontal synchronization effort this effort aligns all the units extant functions and operations to the commanders intent for the purpose of defeating the adversary through information superiority in other words io simply synchronizes the great things we already do operational security opsec civil affairs ca psychological operations psyop public affairs pa electronic warfare ew physical destruction intelligence intel deception computer network attackcomputer network defense cnacnd and many more in order to successfully accomplish the mission io is also vertically integrated with higher and lower io plans io doctrine does not provide sufficient guidance for operations in the iraqi operational environment ioe during operation iraqi freedom oif units and staffs have had to develop numerous methods of planning synchronizing and executing io that are not addressed in doctrine fm 313 information operations november 2003 describes the various io elements the supportingrelated activities their linkagescapabilities and has heavy emphasis on the integration of io in the military decisionmaking process mdmp it lacks however much information on how io officers should do their jobs in other words doctrinal tactics techniques and procedures ttp do not translate into operational ttps fm 313 information operations states effective io is an integrated effort that synchronizes the effects of core io elements supporting and related activities to accomplish specific objectives designated by the commander the goal of io is to gain and maintain information superiority this condition aids commanders in seizing retaining and exploiting the initiative io is commanders operation the commander and staffs input and involvement are critical to successful io program phase iv io was at best executed sporadically in the ioe this does not demean the excellent work done by numerous fine soldiers to make parts of the io campaign work effectively which some certainly did vertically integrated horizontally synchronized io campaign simply did not appear to exist in the ioe since it did not exist it was not possible to execute despite the tremendous efforts on the part of those who participated some us units have firm grasp on setting measures of effectiveness moe and are using them others do not understand the process and therefore just conduct operations without any measure of success or failure some commanders are using tactical psyop teams tpts as reactive measure when bad second or third order effects occur most of the io battle drills in theater are reactionary in nature they for official use only 1operation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirare essentially afterthought implemented when things do not go according to plan in kinetic operations throughout the ioe us commanders grapple with the concept of io across the range of military operations romo this is evident from many statements made by commanders some affirmed that this is an io fight and that it should be the priority for coalition efforts while one commander stated that the only way to eliminate the insurgency was to kill every one of them another stated that we will not be able to win the hearts and minds of the iraqis but may be able to win their minds in their hearts they will always hate us yet another commander stated that io was not an option but that offensive operations should be the main effort battalion commanders are dealing with multitude of issues which impact the units ability to conduct effective io units are heavily involved in the communities in their area of operations ao they are dealing with all of the local leaders restoring infrastructure including institutions such as schools hospitals and utilities all while dealing with force protection measures and the likelihood of daily attacks in phase iv where units and resources could be devoted wholly to stability operations so units find themselves committed to offensive operations and maintaining defensive and sometimes distant posture from the locals several issues emerged from the observations visits and documentation review i commanders and staffs generally do not understand the io process or its relevance simplicity and applicability as combat multiplier io is again staff synchronization effort that aligns the activities and messages of command for the purpose of gaining and maintaining information superiority is is is simply the use of information to accomplish friendly objectives and prevent the adversary from accomplishing his objectives unfortunately some us commanders seem to believe io is either product that psyop units create civilmilitary operation or just talking points not one single officer interviewed was aware that opsec was core element of io in fact not one unit visited had person assigned as the opsec officer currently it is difficult to gauge whether actions taken in theater are producing is ii doctrinal io focuses on the operational level that is the combatant commander land component commander lcc and corps levels resources follow doctrine and the operational levels are where the scarce io resources have been applied in ioe however the focus of stability operations io is appropriately placed on the civilian populace tribal leaders mullahs and other unconventional warfare leadership it is precisely at these critical nodes that the resources are either nonexistent or extremely scarce the very levels at which they are needed the most this doctrinal disparity precludes consistent programmatic application of io throughout the various organizational levels of io planning and execution iii currently the fa30 course only addresses io in the mdmp the program of instruction poi for fa30 needs to encompass much broader perspective and to include information about how io is to be implemented at the tactical and operational levels of war most of the current doctrine in fm 3l3 includes only broad philosophy on io full spectrum operations at the strategic level changes to the poi should include better understanding of the implementation of the core supporting and related roles of io such as tpts ca teams pa ew and military deception md there should also be sufficient practical exercises in the art of nonlethal targeting and setting measures of effectiveness moe the fa30 instruction should also teach io officers how to produce io situation templates sitemps and analysis for inclusion in intelligence preparation of the battlefield ipb iv io needs to be addressed in the curriculum of all officer education system oes courses it is imperative that officers at all military educational levels mel have good understanding of io concepts elements and practicality this would contribute significantly to understanding accepting and incorporating io into army operations and culture 2 for official use onlyoperation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirio doctrine is still in its infancy with tremendous potential as combat multiplier to bring about change within the army as whole io must be incorporated into all phases of the oes it must receive equal attention and detail in the poi as the battlefield operating systems bos io functional area training must include more training and education in the synchronization of io elements io training for officers needs to encompass more than integrating io into the mdmp if they are to integrate synchronize and coordinate all the io elements in combat operations then these officers need to have full understanding of the scope capabilities and limitations of those assets unit level exercises warfighters mission rehearsal exercises mres and combat training center ctc operations need to have all elements of io incorporated into the scenario commanders need to exercise their staffs in an environment which produces second and third order effects based on kinetic operations for official use only 3operation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirchapter 1 information operations topic io synchronization methods of units observation synopsis the information operations working group iowg and unit targeting boards are two of the most common methods used to affect io synchronization with limited io staffing at the division level and none at the brigade and below level staff officers developed innovative methods to plan and execute io as well as to evaluate the success of io in the context of the overall operation different units adjusted their battle rhythms to maximize the use of the iowg and the targeting process units varied in the frequency of conducting iowgs and targeting boards there is doctrinal method for the format or conduct of the iowg it is unique to each units area of operations ao at the brigade and below level for example the pa officer and ca plannersexecuters have much bigger role in the conduct of io often in its execution the io cell has dedicated io officer so the command typically designates an officer to fill that function at one brigade the fso filled the function of the io officer and the core io cell consisted of the io officer psyop planner pao and ca planner along with s2 and s3 representatives and the units combat camera noncommissioned officer in charge ncoic although none were io trained this io cell was very effective in developing and executing an io plan optempo kept them from meeting on regular basis so they would conduct an iowg as needed to develop support plans for pending operations through these meetings the brigade developed some tactical deception plans in response to insurgent activities during raids insurgents were able to use human intelligence resources to gain advance notice of pending raid they would watch the gates when the strike force departed and phone ahead to warn their cohorts the plans they developed and executed delayed the insurgents decisionmaking process on how to respond resulting in successful raids for the unit senior leader involvement is especially helpful as it keeps the units key leadership updated on the units io activities and allows them venue to offer guidance and feedback also general officercommander involvement ensures maximum participation from the various unit staff elements one division io officer was effective in involving senior leaders but did it through venue different than the iowg once week she and the pao personally briefed the assistant division commander for support adcs on their io activities this update worked very well for this particular unit but potential disadvantage is that the absence of other staff elements during the update may result in less complete picture of the io effort than if the staff is present ideally the io cell should conduct short mid and longterm planning to support the commanders overall campaign however the ioe often dictates otherwise keeping staffs in reactive mode this reactive mode seems to be more exaggerated the lower you go in echelon at the brigade and below level staffs primarily focus on the shortterm versus any kind of longterm planning available actionable intelligence drives the shortterm planning and units have to adapt to these shortterm requirements in order to develop plans that support quick fire missions staffs on the ground were able to successfully overcome these reactive missions through effective staff coordination one division used talking points to successfully outline the left and right limits of the brigades by establishing the divisions position in certain areas ie leader engagement with the local iraqi political religious or economic leaders additionally this division would participate in its higher headquarters io summits which was successful method other units could use in their io planning and execution 4 for official use onlyoperation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirlessons learned units devised and used variety of formats and structures for the iowgs and targeting boards to evaluate success of an operation they found one that worked for their command that encompassed all aspects of success and failure determining the criteria of success or measure of effectiveness was critical mission of these groups good working relationships among the staff are imperative for effective io synchronization successful io used the iowg and targeting board to build these relationships they made the meeting agendas relevant and facilitated maximum participation from all the staff elements the use of pa talking points is an effective means of providing broad guidance to subordinate units in io synchronization current themes and io focus the iowg and targeting board were used in the successful io programs to vet talking points among the staff quarterly io summits assisted headquarters across the board in synchronizing io conducted either by live conference or video teleconference these meetings allowed the io officers and planners the ability to leverage other units successes and adapt them to their ao an effective method of conducting iowgs is to integrate the meetings into the units battle rhythm senior leader involvement in the iowg and overall targeting process leads to successful vetting of the io program staff participation worked well during senior leader updates many units found effective workarounds to offset the disadvantage of not having an io officer some units dualhat staff officer using the fso in the io officer role worked well for some some units successfully used targeting board specific for io and ca target development this board allows the unit to focus on nonlethal fires and leverage the intelligence available g2 representation in the iowg and targeting board is critical for successful io dotmlpf implications doctrine review revise and fuse joint and army io doctrine to address iowg development staffing and processes leadership and

typical for many different staff sections s2 io s3 etc to request the tactical psyop team tpt to collect information in different areas some of these requests were specific questions and some were ongoing collectables the tpt detachment commander working with the staff representatives would develop his own priority intelligence requirements pirs that would cover the spectrum of the information required by the different staff elements one example of this pir occurred after the lead iraqi shia cleric sistani issued press statement calling for immediate elections they developed and answered these pirs and passed the information up through the daily psyop situation report sitrep this information was valuable not only to the higher hq but also to national strategists pirs are normally developed by the s2g2 and approved by the commander in this case the detachment commander is working outside the box in developing his own pirs and collecting on them also it shows the importance of building strong interpersonal relationships with the various staff officers within the command to establish good working relationships tpts at brigade level use facetoface and word of mouth as the best ways of communicating with the local population they have discovered that they need to use tactics techniques and procedures ttps that are outside the conventional army way of conducting business for example they have found that locals are much more receptive when the soldiers are engaging them in uniform without helmet body armor and load bearing equipment lbe this may sound like common sense however force protection measures require them to maintain this uniform when outside the compound psyop at the tactical levels can benefit from the ability to operate unconventionally another example is that dedicated security can have great benefits over relying on combat patrol for security combat patrols have specific mission which will take priority over providing security for tpt current force protection requirements necessitate more personnel weapons and vehicles than what tpt would traditionally have by mtoe tpts have worked around this by teaming with counterintelligence ci teams each team will provide security for the other while conducting their missions the similarity of their missions allows them to share intelligence us divisions do not maintain central database or conduct human factors analysis on all entities that play roles in their aor such as civic leaders religious imams terrorists and insurgents human factors analysis is currently conducted at the national level by the defense intelligence agency there is mechanism for conducting this task at the operational or tactical level as general rule the ipb process lacks with regards to io us forces understood who saddam hussein and his commanders were and how they operated but did not understand all the other parties at play once the war came to conclusion such as tribal leaders local leaders and imams they had very little information about them through process of trial and error us forces have formulated picture of these leaders within each battalions aor in one us division the g2 has charted all the enemy leaders in his aor the g5 knows who the civil leadership is psyop knows who all the key communicators are however these three databases are not shared thus far one has the manpower to take ownership of it the g2 does not want it because they are only tracking former regime loyalists frls and adversaries the g5 does not want it because they are only tracking community leaders and the psyop units do not want it because they do not have the manpower one is capable or trained to do human factors analysis which according to fm 313 information operations is defined as actions taken to influence others decisionmaking processes to affect or influence adversary decisionmaking commanders need to have this level of analysis down to the tactical level commanders and staff are making some progress at their level however one is collecting this information into central database to develop true picture of the whole aor for official use only 7operation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirand to develop an organized analysis they are overcoming it by trial and error the iocoord believes it would it be helpful at the division level to conduct tactical level human factors analysis lessons learned the development of pir to support the io program encourages and facilitates establishment of good working relationships soldiers interaction with the populace can have tactical operational and sometimes strategic implications tpts engage the populace and provide information that normally can only be answered by operationalstrategic assets psyop at the tactical levels benefit from the ability to operate unconventionally the divisions are inadequately staffed to conduct the appropriate link and pattern analysis to benefit commanders at the tactical level who are conducting io and there is limited capability to maintain central database for capturing all information pertaining to all leaders within the divisions aor as result battalion and brigade commanders are learning the aor by simple trial and error to be successful at the operational and tactical levels human factors analysis level of information must be available to division brigade and battalion commanders and staffs currently all human factors analysis is conducted by the defense intelligence agency on strategic or nationallevel personalities dotmlpf implications

information operations topic c public affairs and the media some us units are conducting media analysis despite doctrinal requirement for pao or s1 to do so and it has been very valuable to commanders in addition soldiers that are acting as the pao have not been trained in pa or in conducting media analysis one brigade pao maintained every news piece that was written about her unit which was useful tool for dealing with future visits from organizations that report either positively or negatively on the positive side the unit may want to maintain relationship with the media and leverage them when they need to get release for story in one particular unit the reporter really embraced the unit and it led to public relations benefits on the negative side units can see who the unfriendly or hostile organizations are or the ones that tend to report false information that gives them an advantage in developing coas for dealing with the media in the future for example units can simply deny them access to embed or be prepared to debunk any false information they release the biggest impact the media has on the battlefield is relaying to the public what is actually happening on the ground some units put lot of energy into working with the media and it paid off in dividends they went beyond simply accommodating the media to actually integrating embracing them into the unit the pao emphasized the good news events ongoing in the units ao the establishment of the iraqi civil defense corps icdc was concept that was very useful in countering negative publicity establishment of the icdc reinforced the coalition message that we are working to rebuild their country and turn it back over to them there are great benefits to embracing the media it is human nature to lean more positively toward people or an organization that treats you right there will still be media coming to units with preconceived agenda counter to us interests and working to satisfy that agenda it is important to work with the media whether they have an agenda or not because they are going to get and report their story one way or another embracing the media has greatly assisted us forces in communicating our message many times media will report or focus on only the negative things that are ongoing in an ao us brigade commander made an insightful comment that is very relevant the media are not there for us they are there to sell product and it seems to that more often than not it has to have negative twist to it to cause enough sensationalism to sell this brigades pao was very active and aggressive in knowing what was going on in her ao for example she would go on missions with their ca assets which gave her an understanding of the good things going on it paid off well when media would put out negative piece in an area she was able to counter it by getting other media out to the areas and having them report on ongoing positives such as school restoration or reopenings one of their biggest challenges was getting out the good news stories one pao was aggressive in encouraging media to venture out during the day usually members of the media would tend to focus on combat operations at night and miss out on all the operations that were ongoing the pao was very persistent in this encouragement and it paid off major media outlets such as abc and ap covered these stories one of the biggest challenges was getting the media to bring and wear the proper uniformequipment for force protection purposes again this was overcome by the fact that the unit would actually integrate the media into the unit the unit would normally inbrief all embeds which included an ao brief force protection requirement and so on once again persistence paid off translation was also challenge all the media could speak english but at times subtleties in the language were missed in translation the pao would work to overcome this by finding personnel within the unit that spoke the language and have them present when the journalists were interviewing this not only helps for translation purposes but people tend to be friendlier 10 for official use onlyoperation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirif they have someone around that speaks their native language units were also accepting of foreign journalists they found it was benefit to have them on our side they also brought in outlets that are traditionally hostile to our operations such as jazeera again the media will get their story one way or another so it was helpful when we gave them our side one pao used some innovative techniques in dealing with foreigninternational journalists the pao hosted media luncheon with key media players including foreign and us journalists from the new york times and angeles times the discussion during the luncheon was informal and toward the end one of the units generals go will answer questions both on and off the record this kind of event gives unit the ability to get the whole story out to the press from the units pewrspective there is always go involvement at these luncheons the pao stated they have been able to mitigate several things that may have come up in the press by use of these luncheons the luncheons have been held at former republican guards officers club which has been converted to rest and recuperation rr center for the soldiers this pao also set up an open house for the local baghdad correspondents as they saw with other iraqi journalists the local media had very little training or experience in how to do real reporting this event helped them see the kinds of things the coalition was doing as well as some of our capabilities and equipment they had static equipment displays and offered blackhawk rides they also got all the contact information for the journalists so they could use them for future events the pao stated they have never had problem with the media releasing information designated as off the record one go reminded the pao to be careful and not get too relaxed in dealing with the media the implication being that the media still have their own job to do and lot of times they are pursuing an agenda that often conflicts with the missions the army is conducting in the summer of 2003 one unit established media operations center moc in baghdad which is used by both io and pao personnel the moc serves several functions but is primarily work area for the io and pao staffs they hired several locals as interpreters one innovative action of the pao was the establishment of journalism school for local iraqi writers when the moc was established local baghdad journalists were hired to write articles for divisionsponsored periodicals the journalists were not wellschooled in journalistic techniques because of all their training and experience with the former regime the division set up sixweek journalism school for the journalists to give them good base knowledge in media correspondence the pao ncoic ran the school the journalists worked primarily for the io section as most of their work was oriented toward the baghdad population us division io staff has developed relationships with numerous newspapers in their ao as result they use them as method of getting their messages to the local population the io officer is very aggressive in writing articles on significant events and running them in the newspapers the articles normally have about 23 day turnaround time from submission to publication they also use these papers for public service announcements in one article they commented on the coalition provisional authoritys article 19 freedom of assembly although they use several newspapers they use the biggest three to get the most distribution these are sabah manar and azzaman one brigade requires its subordinate units to write articles for the local papers this is wellreceived by the local newspapers because it takes lot to put out paper everyday the locals welcome the assistance each week the task forces turn in local good news story from their ao the brigade io officer submits these for publication in the paper they will include pictures as well the local newspapers all have internet addresses so the io officer will just send them the story to include in the next edition via the internet one pao stated that it would be beneficial to integrate iopaca play into the mission rehearsal exercises mre in order to develop and sustain solid working relationship this for official use only 11operation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report

important to develop good working relationships with the media always be cautious and avoid releasing sensitiveclassified information an advantage of embedded media is that many of them embrace the unit this translated well into future reporting on the unit training local iraqis to be journalists and then using them to write stories in coalition periodicals has proven to very successful developing good relationships with local host country newspapers is an effective method for distributing io messages local papers in host country nations want to make money and fill out all of the

effectiveness moe information operations io measures of effectiveness moe is one of the biggest challenges in developing good io campaign strategy the iraqi operational environment ioe is characterized by varying degrees of success and methodology in this effort this is largely due to the decentralized and diverse areas of operation ao and the lack of formal training in developing moe amongst the staff specific indicators to measure io effectiveness are extremely hard to establish one of the more effective methods to use is facetoface interaction with the targeted audiences to gain feedback assets used to conduct facetoface include unit patrols psyop teams and ca assets ca personnel are one of the more effective facetoface assets to use to gain feedback from targeted audience they have an advantage in that their mission requires them to establish rapport with the local population although ca teams are not doctrinally intelligence collectors ca teams in the field have provided feedback from the local population to their unit s2s for inclusion into database these feedback databases can be an excellent source for io personnel to use to develop indicators of successfailure of io conducted and to aid in their moe analysis s2s should be included in the iowg dedicate and incorporate intelligence specialists into the io cell for moe analysis these specialists must also stay plugged in to the s2g2 they also must have base knowledge of io in order to develop and analyze moe one us division uses both subjective and objective criteria for measuring effectiveness in its io operation each of these is tied to specific io objective which in turn relates to one of the four pillars identified by the coalition provisional authority cpa these four pillars include governance economy military and infrastructure this unit has established website on the siprnet exclusively for the io campaign plan on this site there are many products pertaining to the plan including io estimate io objectives and moe each of the io objectives has specific moe listed underneath the moe are measured by green amber and red status each of these is monitored by the brigades and the iocoord updates the moe each week the iocoord assesses how the division is doing with regard to each of these goals each week it is virtually impossible to collect on each of the goals nor is there way to collect on all these things without putting additional requirements on an already overtasked unit therefore the iocoord makes this assessment based on his understanding of the aor and feedback from the brigades another division in southern iraq uses an operational analysis oa cell for the development and analysis of moe although the questions run the spectrum of operations it has heavy emphasis on io the unit uses weekly surveys to query population samples throughout the ao they then take the results and analyze the trends that occur over time it is continuous iraqi attitude survey and is conducted by an independent civilian scientific research organization this has two advantages 1 the research organization provides trained dedicated personnel to perform the task and 2 since they are not in the units chain of command the organization can be the honest broker we observed that when dealing with statistical analysis data can be used to provide picture other than reality the survey consists of approximately 2030 questions and includes overall 14 for official use onlyoperation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirclimate attitude questions such as what do you think of what the coalition is doing and when do you think coalition forces should leave they use their own unit patrols to conduct the surveys but have recently begun to hire local iraqis and train them in survey techniques in order to conduct the surveys this will provide wider range of population to sample and should prompt the locals to provide more honest answers other sources used in their operational analysis are patrol reports campaign effectiveness data assessment and reporting cedar political advisor polad reports and intelligence reports us maneuver battalion near baghdad uses graphic depiction of security and infrastructure events matched with their goals and objectives to measure their effectiveness their brigade headquarters has goalsobjectives which they call lines of operation the battalion is nested underneath that with key tasks kts the kts are further broken down into collective tasks that support each of the kts security is measured by number of incidents ieds demonstrations weapons firing etc this is graphed to show the decline or rise in incidents by sector if there is an increase the battalion looks at what was done differently if there is decline then it will be similarly investigated the battalion also looks at anticoalition graffiti or flyers random weapons firing and ieds these are the information requirements ir on which the patrols report in the kt of civil infrastructure the battalion evaluates details such as the number of hours of electricity or water available per day and the frequency of trash pick up in the neighborhood some of the criteria in these areas are rather subjective in nature but provide additional tools for analyzing the operational environment the unit has clearly identified indicators in their sector to measure security and infrastructure needs which are matched with their campaign goals and objectives the kt are measurable and can be graphically depicted to show rises or declines in overall compliance by the iraqi people the battalion commander is directly involved in this process which gives it the credibility and leverage desired to make this good program for the staff and company commanders lessons learned one of the most effective methods for obtaining data for use in measuring io effectiveness is facetoface encounters with targeted audiences units can use patrols psyop teams and ca teams to gain this essential feedback incorporating io moe into the collection plan will provide the necessary information for input into the io feedback database the feedback database can then be used to develop indicators of successfailure of the io plan and aid in the moe analysis the siprnet website is good tool for units to use to share data regarding the moe of the io campaign the unit makes subjective analysis using feedback from subordinate units to evaluate moe one unit successfully used an oa cell supported by data from an independent organization to survey the local population and provide operational assessments the use of both subjective and objective criteria that are nested beneath the division and the cpas goals

coordinator iocoord role an o4major only one of the several iocoords interviewed has received any formal io training one us division utilized an information operations working group iowg to coordinate and synchronize their io efforts for several months after cessation of major combat operations it was chaired by the iocoord and the members were mostly lowerlevel division staff officers such as the pysop commander and public affairs officer pao the iowg is longer conducted the iowg became dysfunctional because the appropriate staff elements were not present at the meeting if the group were chaired by member of the command group the iowg would have been more successful the effects coordination cell ecc has taken its place the iocoord firmly believes that io should be the priority in their current operations even though he believes this should be the priority senior staff has ever participated in the iowg the division fire support team coordinator dfstcoord incorrectly stated that io was civil military operations cmo he further incorrectly related that iocmo was being taken care of at the ecc effects tasking order eto meeting with key staff members who were responsible to each of the ministries within the coalition provisional authority cpa before deploying to iraq the commanding general of one us division sent request to the department of the army da g3 requesting additional io support for the division this request was denied by central command centcom as result this division did not have the resources to conduct io properly the iocoord does not believe the mission was properly resourced or supported by da or io proponency the iocoord firmly believes that they need an fa30 trained officer at the brigade level and not someone who has the job as an additional duty another staff officer is going to focus on his primary role and think about io secondarily the s2s and fire support officers fsos have done very good job in iraq as the io officers in their brigades the fsos were underemployed in some areas and have done well with targeting however they do not understand the interrelationships of all the components of io io is much more than targeting in contrast to this division another us unit has battle rhythm with an iowg on its calendar three days week monday wednesday and friday although scheduled they only conduct the meetings as needed or on an oncall basis they will usually meet at least once week during that time the io officer meets with the assistant division commander for support adcs and provides an updateexecutive brief on io activities the io officer will also brief the commanding general cg once week during the morning battle update brief bub on io activities as result of the command groups involvement io is viewed as very significant by division staff if the senior leadership of the division is involved then the rest of the staff will be involved us units are longer deterred from engaging in mosque one us division has begun targeting imams that preach anticoalition rhetoric or are supporting insurgents with safe haven and arms the cg is the approval authority for going after an imam the iraqi mosque is very sensitive area and has many possible second and third order effects if entered improperly therefore the unit must have this operation carefully planned and every contingency covered us units have developed method that is working now in iraq for this procedure for official use only 17operation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirwhen unit goes into mosque after particular imam and something goes wrong they have to have an immediate message that can be disseminated to the people the unit has to give the facts and make them understandable to the public units have created battledrill messages and products for contingency operations they also produce fact sheet to hand out to explain what is happening and why it is happening this sheet will explain why their mosque is being entered why their imam is being targeted or arrested such as he is preaching violence anticoalition rhetoric or hiding weapons or former regime elements fres us units take combat camera comcam along with them to film the entry they wear surgical booties to keep soldiers boots from being on the floor thus far the iraqis have been satisfied if the unit can show why they are there us units use the iraqi civil defense corps icdc when practical to assist with the raid especially to go into areas that are sensitive the handbillfact sheet is used to explain their presence the fact sheet will have statements such as on 22 dec the imam said to kill americans or on 22 dec the mosque was announcing on the loud speaker to bomb this or attack that the iraqi people will understand why the imam is being taken away the unit also needs to ensure that during the filming of the raid areas of the mosque entered are shown to indicate the condition of the mosque the unit turns over the mosque to the mosque security personnel the comcam captures all of this to include telling the security personnel they now have responsibility for the security and condition of the mosque if these steps are followed then nothing will be disturbed in that mosque and attributed to us soldiers soldiers also make sure the mosque security personnel know that they have the responsibility of having the mosque open for prayers in the morning at 0800 the morning after us representatives are standing at the council of religious affairs to give notification of the need for new imam following these procedures avoids an international incident it is not called mosque targeting it is called imam targeting five imams have been replaced thus far because of the way they do it and the io campaign that goes with it it has been very successful the armed baath party is using the mosques as safe havens for hiding personnel and weapons the baath party has qualms about using the mosque as an operations center nonus unit has been able to develop and implement good io campaign with limited resources this division has an artillery major filling the function of iocoord this officer has deputy an infantry captain assigned to him but neither has been trained in io the unit conducts their iowg in coordination with the higher headquarters issuance of their biweekly io effects fragmentary order frago they also conduct oncall iowgs in response to fragos that have specific io tasks this timing allows the unit to receive the latest guidance from their higher headquarters and develop their own plan and tasks on how to carry out the guidance the unit also has division effectstargeting board that provides more guidance to the io staff the targeting board is conducted on weekly basis the io staff takes the guidance from the targeting board and combines it with the guidance from their higher headquarters and molds the two together in this nonus division the major is in charge and focuses primarily on plans and policy the captain fills the function of operations officer the io cell and media operations provide the interface with cpas media operations they also have psyop support element pse comprised of major and two ncos however this is the limit of their psyop staffing for the entire division they are going to expand their psyop capabilities in the next few months with each brigade forming tactical psyop team tpt the psyop officer is schooltrained and has experience in afghanistan the divisions media cell consists of major who is in charge and staffed press information center this is more robust than what the us has seen at most divisions but more limited than what the us has seen at the corps level media operations controls the divisions one comcam team the comcam team has both still and video capability this is not their primary mos however as has been seen with lot of the specialized staff elements they are detailed to fulfill those functions 18 for official use onlyoperation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirthe division receives io guidance from the joint headquarters as well as their own division targetingeffects board the guidance from the joint headquarters is primarily in the form of biweekly io effects frago and occasionally specific effects fragos the overarching higher hq guidance is in its overall campaign plan which has four lines of operation security essential services economy and governance for those lines of operation the joint headquarters has established eight io objectives which the division has refined into their subobjectives specific to their region their overarching goal is to focus on maintaining consent and support of the people the divisions information campaign is executed by military diplomacyleadership engagement psyop posture presence profile and influence of physical effects it also involves the related activities of media operations and civil military coordination cimic the divisions target audiences are the general population terrorists and criminal gangs tribal religious and civilpolitical leaders internalregional media and nongovernmental organizations ngo the general population is the target audience that they can affect most directly terrorists and criminal gangs are affected more indirectly mainly by marginalizing them through the general population they use diplomacy and leadership engagement to affect the various leadership figures one of their most effective io activities that is the production of weekly good news document that they distribute to their brigades and the media the brigades use this document as basis for their engagements with the local leadership they usually get this document out few days prior to the friday prayers in order to reinforce the positive things the imamsclerics are saying about the coalition and to counter the negative things this helps to shape public perceptions of the coalition another example of activities meant to shape public perceptions is their posture presence and profile as opposed to other units we have seen the soldiers here maintain different force protection profile such as wearing berets as opposed to helmets and full battle rattle they also encourage their patrols to interact with the population and provide talking points to them for their engagements with the populace for all divisional units visited recurring theme is the lack of staffing and trained io officers all but one unit has only one officer attempting to synchronize coordinate and deconflict the io campaigns for their division all io personnel coming into theater need to be fa30 trained the us army needs to build additional psyop ca and pa training into their program of instruction poi for the fa30 course or they need to require that all fa30s attend additional training such as psyop ca and pa courses the divisional staffs were not properly resourced to conduct io in this campaign the officers assigned have only limited knowledge about the core supporting and related io activities currently the fa30 course heavily emphasizes the mdmp as it applies to io fm 313 information operations focuses mostly on the mdmp and how the io officer will interact with the other divisioncorps staff officers neither doctrine nor the fa30 curriculum addresses how to actually do the job once in theater especially when it comes to addressing the other io disciplines such as psyop ca and pa io officers need to know how psyop and pa operate these functional areas to need to be part of the trainup for the unit deploying electronic warfare ew assets are limited at the division level as they are throughout all levels of the army one of the new systems that has become available to the divisions is stargrazer capabilities of this system are classified therefore it will not be discussed with any specificity due to the operational restrictions in its applicability the main point of the observation is that the army is pretty limited in ew assets most assets such as stargrazer are unknown at the division level if known their capability and practicability for specific operations are likely unknown as well for official use only 19operation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirlessons learned successful iowgs received command emphasis this typically ensured that the appropriate staff members were present for the meetings the meeting can be chaired by member of the command group or the group can give the cg or adc weekly update briefs most officers in general did not understand the concept role and relevance of io in most cases it is linked it to psyop civil military operations cmo or computer network operations there are not enough trained io personnel available to cover all operational deployments down to the brigade level the fsos were given the additional duties as iocoord in phase iv due to the significant decrease in the fire support requirements but the fsos priorities shifted back to fire support when the situation dictated io cannot be conducted properly without the appropriate trained personnel current mtoe slots at the division level need to be filled prior to deployment some units and officers mistakenly believe that io does not apply to combat operations that it only applies to so io does not function well as an additional duty given to another primary staff officer most of the officers appear to see io as secondary functionadditional duty the weekly briefings to the adc and the cg allow the io officer to receive senior leader inputguidance to the division io plan it also shows that the senior officers in the division have an active interest in and support io imams can be targeted and mosques can be entered while conducting raid proper procedures need to be followed and the populace must have clear understanding of what is going on and why all actions taken inside mosque must be documented use the icdc where and when practical to conduct the searches of the more sensitive areas of the mosque da and centcom did not support one divisions request for

brigade combat team bct north of baghdad conducts weekly information operations working group iowg or what they call the ioca targeting group the ioca targeting group consists of the fso psyop pao ca comcam s2 and s3 the fso has the additional duty of iocoord and chairs the group they go over the intel summary and any needs for existing operations the bct started weekly ioca targeting group after transitioning to stability operations and support operations saso environment but longer do it due to shift in operational tempo optempo the focused shifted to io only after they shifted to the saso effort in addition the iocoord was the fso during the initial combat phase of operations his focus during combat operations was primarily on delivering lethal fires for the brigade commander one was working io for the brigade during this phase operations tend to dictate that planning is more shortterm and operations tend to be dictated by available intelligence human intelligence humint source will give the bct target if determined to be legitimate target then 24 to 48 hours later the bct will go after that target so they quickly change whatever they are doing and shift to that mission that is the battle rhythm they have as result the ioca targeting group focuses mainly on shortterm planning and reactionary planning on targets of opportunity there is not any doctrinal guidance on conduct of an iowg fm 313 information operations does not give any information on the subject of an iowg the manual mostly focuses on planning and execution at the corps level and above this is good ttp on the planning targeting and conduct of maneuver brigade io cell the brigades are not staffed with io personnel and have limited io assets with the core capability of psyop five tpts and related elements of ca and pa they are also not authorized pao but most commanders have designated one io in the division is mainly decentralized the guidance they receive from division is the weekly talking points this has been common thread with all the bcts they use these as general guidance in developing their own talking points specific to their aor as well as their engagement plan the talking points are used at all levels of command from brigade to company in their engagements with tribal and local leaders and imams the ca teams use them as well again the most effective means of getting the message out seems to be with facetoface and word of mouth leaders have found that sometimes they are at an advantage when engaging some of the local leaders such as the tribal sheiks the sheiks want to maintain their power base so often they cooperate with the coalition although sometimes grudgingly some brigades also have newspapers that they use for io purposes most of the papers are funded through the cerp but the brigade tries to keep it balanced because they do not want it to have too heavy coalition flavor creditability when the brigades began conducting cmo in conjunction with peace enforcement operations there were virtually newspapers or radio stations operating within their aors in some areas the brigades lack the resources to win the io fight there are limited newspapers in their ao the ones that exist were established or reinforced by the units on the ground and their distribution is also limited there is radio available in most areas in those areas the only means of delivering psyop and command messages is through facetoface meetings psyop leaflets and minimal newspaper coverage the television capability in these areas is from jazeera and arabia these stations provide only negative content with regards to us presence in iraq this is the best medium for distributing messages in the area just as it is in the united states but is only available in limited areas during the previous regime satellite tv 22 for official use onlyoperation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirwas prohibited amongst the local populace now that they are liberated nearly every household has tv and satellite dish this provides the former regime loyalists frl with great method for delivering negative information messages to the public the best deception is reinforcement of an already preconceived perception an overwhelming number of iraqisarabs believe that the us is there to steal oil and iraqs resources and has intention of leaving since this is the mind set of the average arab this is what the media presents in tv coverage the media selectively pursues only stories that support this angle you will not find local media portraying stories of coalition forces rebuilding schools hospitals or other infrastructure improvements these stories do not reinforce the understood perception without the capability to present information in this medium it is very difficult to counter their campaign messages units have had to aggressively pursue the use of leaflets to counter frls information however this cannot match the distribution of tv one brigade does have radio and tv station in its sector the commander has taken proactive approach in getting his message out the brigade has their own iraqi version of cspan and the commander holds government council meetings where they talk about all the positive things that are being done for the local populace the staff persuades the local media to participate they have procured funding to purchase tv cameras and equipment which they use to record the events this empowers the locals to hold their government officials responsible for their civic duties in addition the unit is very cautious about what and how much information is presented over this medium the less involvement the coalition has with it the more credible it becomes as an information source otherwise it would be viewed simply as another coalition propaganda vehicle there is doctrinal requirement for pao or s1 to conduct media analysis but it is being done in couple of different brigades one pao maintained every news piece that was written about his unit useful tool for dealing with future visits from organizations that report either positively or negatively for example on the positive side the unit may want to maintain relationship with the media and leverage them when they need to get story out there was an example in one particular unit in which the reporter really embraced the unit which led to future benefits on the negative side they can see who the unfriendly or hostile organizations are or the ones that tend to report false information that gives the unit an advantage in developing courses of action coas for dealing with them in the future for example they can simply deny them access to embed or be prepared to debunk any false information they put out one armor battalion uses its s3 air to coordinate its io plan some others use the fso or s2 to coordinate io one battalion assesses targets and determines effects desired through the commanders intent specified tasks from the military decisionmaking process mdmp and specified tasks from brigade products are crafted to achieve the effects and desired end state products may include but are not limited to flyers posters messages published in newspapers messages broadcast on the radio and messages broadcast on the television one battalion found measuring the effectiveness of products extremely difficult the only intelligence gathering tools available are the companies operating in their assigned aos their brigade hosts weekly io meeting to pass information to subordinate units recently this meeting has been cancelled due to relief in place rip and redeployment preparation the battalion does not conduct io meetings because there is only one io representative the s3 air in this case the availability of intelligence and fluid nature of kinetic operations in low intensity conflict produce situation in which most io planning at the battalion level is focused on near term events io is planned based off specified tasks from brigade and the battalion and brigade commanders intents the fluid situation in iraq does not allow battalion to conduct longterm io planning most io messages are planned developed and distributed within one week the only long term planning the unit can accomplish is for events that are scheduled and cannot be adjusted such as ramadan the overwatch for the io campaign at battalion level is usually the executive officer or the operations officer and ultimately the battalion commander for official use only 23operation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirjunior officers need more rounded and unconventional education in order to prepare for stability operations some maneuver battalions pointed out that key lesson learned was the use of officers in nonconventional roles one battalion is using its fso to do io and s5 they know that the fso understands d3a decide detect deliver assess and effectsbased targeting but the fso has to be able to do many things other than targeting these officers who are schooled in their basic branches come here and have to conduct onthejob training ojt for most of these tasks they are doing io project management construction engineering io interface etc all of the things that you learn as you get higher in rank for example at brigade you have an s5 to deal with these things this young group of officers has assisted in the recruiting and training of the iraqi fixed protection service fps they have also overseen and managed the fps they have supervised the construction of critical infrastructure needs such as sewage water trash removal and electricity they worked with ngo and ios to get resources and take care of these projects when cerp money is not available or has dried up they have worked with neighborhood advisory councils nacs and district advisory councils dacs to prioritize projects and cerp allocations they have worked on the bid process to ensure there is some kind of equity and transparency in society that does not understand this process the iraqis have always conducted these things by family or political connections or bribes the officers have helped and assisted in neighborhoods to establish democratic councils where there has never been anything like it in the past one battalion in baghdad has observed significant problems with expectation management two key problem areas were with cerp funds and relief in place rip in the first area the battalion had spent considerable time building trust and faith with the local interim government this had been constructed with many facetoface meetings and prioritization of projects to be completed much of this good faith was destroyed when the cerp funds were longer available to the battalion commander some of this trust is now being restored but only through significant effort by the command and the availability of funding in the second area the locals have demonstrated anxiety of the impending rip they fear that the incoming command will not be as understanding of their situation and may have other priorities plus in their society most things are accomplished through relationships trust and good faith they fear the loss of these relationships therefore the current command has attempted to build quick wins for the incoming command they have purposely delayed the completion of several projects as part of their io campaign they place banners on all infrastructure projects to highlight the construction that took place courtesy of the nac and the unit itself so by delaying the completion of several of these projects they will be allowing the incoming command to place their name on these grand openings as result the unit will build credibility with the nac and good faith with the locals in that neighborhood the unit will not have to wait weeks into its rotation to have success and build trust with the people in its aor there are authorized slots in maneuver brigade or battalion for information officers therefore commanders assigned other staff officers to function as their elements io officer in most cases it was the fire support officer because this officers role was greatly diminished in the stability operations and support operations role he was also the likely choice because of his understanding of the targeting process however most of the targeting at the battalion and brigade level is directed at former regime entities and not at traditional influence type targeting found in the balkans scenarios in all situations the fsos were not trained in io before deployment they learned as they went along they were not planning for io or preparing for io until major combat operations were declared complete all officers are subject to assignment as io officers in battalion and brigade assignments as an additional duty io needs to be incorporated into the poi for all officer education system oes courses such as the officer basic course obc captains career course ccc and intermediate level education ile this provides all officers with broader base of knowledge about io to utilize when called upon to perform io as an additional duty 24 for official use onlyoperation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirlessons learned officers assigned the additional duty of io officer were not be able to effectively execute those duties during combat operations because they were primarily focused on their designated specialty one brigades ioca targeting group focuses on shortterm planning due to the fluid and reactionary ioe this provides them with the flexibility to react to available intelligence and current operations most commanders in iraq have designated an officer as the pao most have had little or pa training or education the satellite television stations in the region provide mostly negative information regarding the coalitions efforts in iraq commanders are using local newspapers to counter this information in places where they did not exist they have assisted iraqis in establishing writing and distributing newspapers the local populace has developed considerable trust and bond with oif i units the local populace is significantly concerned about the current transition of forces and the impact it will have on the relationships that have been built with our departing forces the coalition has limited television capability mostly in the baghdad region this makes it very difficult to counter adversary campaign messages junior officers are not prepared to operate in unconventional roles outside their branch specialty the oes does not appear to have adequately incorporated civil affairs media relations public relations and information operations into its poi although not resourced with io personnel some brigade staffs were still able to effectively conduct io and synchronize with the higher and lower echelons units appointed someone on their staff an additional duty appointment as the io officer an effective io campaign estimate should include complete assessment of the entire countrys ability to provide media information in order to be prepared to counter negative news stories and adversary

and socioeconomic divisions maneuver commanders are responsible for the law and order and administration of their assigned areas civilmilitary operations cmo is critical element to both the establishment of safe and secure environment and to the countrys transition to selfsustaining civil administration implicit in this endeavor is coordinated effort on the part of the coalition simultaneous to the continuous empowerment of and transition to local and national iraqi governance civil affairs ca forces work for maneuver commanders and provide technical guidance and expertise defined commandsupport relationship coupled with clear understanding of that relationship is an essential step for optimal integration with the maneuver unit specifically the integration of ca with the s5g5 staffs is crucial task forces encountered several challenges in conducting cmo multiple ca brigade headquarters were deployed their integration posed unique challenges for the coalition ca augmentation to the coalition provisional authority cpa posed unique challenges as well the iraqi operational environment ioe required certain force protection measures to which ca units were not accustomed or task organized coalition forces had to adapt in order to conduct cmo in this environment in the ioe success in civil administration requires an understanding of iraqi religious and tribal institutions and their relationship with the secular forms of government inherent to democracy and proposed by the cpa us plans and practices cannot be successful in the absence of knowledge and understanding of iraqi sentiments and perceptions this is all the more important given the high turnover of cpa personnel and the lack of regional expertise held by the majority of coalition military and civilians in iraq although nominally running iraq maneuver commanders are generally not trained in the complexities and subtleties of the area this has resulted in some us practices serving to alienate common iraqis who initially supported the coalition to partially rectify this some oif units have sent division and brigade commanders and staff to jordan to receive instruction on how to operate effectively in arabmuslim iraq the security situation in parts of iraq dictates modification of equipment and the development of tactics techniques and procedures ttp in order to maximize success integration with supported units requires communications equipment while ca teams require crewserved weapons and additional armored protection on their vehicles for official use only 29operation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirchapter 2 civil military operations civil affairs topic integration of the task force cmo effort observation synopsis the common perception throughout the theater is that roadmap for the rebuilding of iraq does not exist there is not plan that outlines priorities with short medium and longterm objectives if such national plan exists with the cpa it has not been communicated adequately to coalition forces task force staffs at all levels of command have reiterated that there is clear guidance coming from baghdad the inability to develop or articulate plan contributes to lack of unity of effort between the coalition and cpa for the soldier on the ground conducting cmo the lack of higher guidance is believed to be an outcome of lack of understanding of one another and feeling of mutual unmet expectations between the two entities coalition commanders and staff view the cpa as understaffed sluggish hesitant to make decision and often detached from the true situation on the ground with cpa officials on 90day rotations much time is required for replacements to become knowledgeable with the specific issues and players they are facing nine months after the declared end to major military action cpa staffs in the center portions of the country are estimated at 20 strength whether rooted in the lack of staffing or to security concerns there appears to be an inability of cpa headquarters baghdad to get the needed eyes on what is happening subsequently cpa directives appear to be out of synch with the current situation in contrast cpa views the military as unwilling to yield impatient and not willing to accept that diplomacy takes time the apparent lack of unified rebuilding plan is as much result of the military planning priorities as the lack of cpa direction in preparation to deploy maneuver units admittedly did not focus on cmo the focus was on the war fight as opposed to phase ivtype operations the major outcome of the lack of coalition plan is that each brigade combat team bct outside of baghdad is conducting its own cmo campaign many brigades and battalions did not develop cmo annexes although ca units are credited with gravitating to what they believe needed to be done the cmo effort could have been more effective units conducted multiple duplicative assessments and commanders emergency response program cerp monies were spent with clear vision on how the projects would tie in to the cmo end state despite not knowing the coalitions vision of the end state bct s5 organized the brigadewide cmo effort through weekly meetings with battalion task force s5 and key members of the brigade staffs this provided forum for horizontal integration among the battalion task forces another factor affecting integration was that command and support relationships between ca units and the task force were vague and inefficient both ca unit commanders and maneuver task force commanders state that the command relationship between ca elements and the supported units was unclear fm 4110 civil affairs operations states because ca units are neither organized nor equipped to provide unilateral c2 command and control of attached units they are normally attached to higher commands ca units were not attached to units below the division level many ca detachments and teams were either operational control opcon to bcts or remained attached to the division and placed in general support of bct one ca battalion remained task organized to its ca brigade its detachments were in direct support of two separate bcts that ca brigade remained task organized to its ca command cacom in this arrangement the cacom and ca brigade had to exercise c2 over subordinate units to 30 for official use onlyoperation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirinclude the issuance of orders many ca commanders and ca team leaders consider the ca brigade as not staffed equipped or trained to provide operational c2 maneuver unit commanders uniformly stated that they preferred to have the ca units down to the smallest team element attached to them to ensure unity of effort maneuver unit commanders believed that ca support at both the brigade and battalion level did not provide them effective control and influence of cmo only by being in the rating scheme does maneuver commander consider his ca elements as responsive to his plan attachment provides the basis to build habitual relationship it also provides greater sense of constancy that the commander has that combat multiplier when needed for their part through living and working with the supported unit ca element can better integrate as part of the task force the bct commanders also desired that each battalion task force commander who controls battlespace be provided his own dedicated ca team this did not occur most ca battalion commanders preferred that their detachments and teams not be attached to maneuver units these commanders stated that such an arrangement would remove their role in shaping cmo and subsequently they would serve little purpose likewise ca detachment and ca company commanders roles would be degraded if their subordinates were attached out to maneuver units ca teams struggled with the question of for whom do i work while maneuver commanders struggled with the question of for whom do they work the ca commandsupport relationship selected needs to be mission enemy terrain troops time civilian metttc dependent it needs to be an outcome of true analysis the supported unit commander the ca commander and ca team chiefs need to clearly outline the roles responsibilities and expectations of all parties the question of who works for whom has significance for staffing of units as well as functional area support in phase iv operations bcts have major role to play in cmo but within the bct task force s5 staffs were often understaffed for the cmo effort these staffs had to be augmented by the supporting ca unit disrupting the ca forces task organization the typical maneuver division mtoe for the g5 section authorizes 1 x ltc05 and 2 x spce4 combat brigades and battalions are not authorized an s5 at division level 3soldier g5 staff is wholly inadequate to execute the required staff functions as the cmo cell as described in fm 1005 staff organization and functions likewise the need for brigade and battalion s5 officers and staff in the ioe is imperative some divisions and brigades obtained g5 and s5 personnel from the individual ready reserve these augmentees ca experience and knowledge varied some were not graduates of the ca course some had not been actively involved in ca activities in over eight years for brigades that did not acquire an s5 prior to deployment an available officer was designated the s5 oftentimes the fire support officer assumed this additional duty despite previous ca or cmo experience or training some of these s5s adapted quickly to their new role as result maneuver divisions and brigades relied on the supporting ca units to augment their staffs specifically at the division level cmo planner proved essential without an s5 in peacetime the brigades and battalions were mistakenly comfortable with not incorporating s5 input into the mdmp however ca battalions are not structured to provide staff augmentation cells they had to pull individuals from teams strip commanders from detachments or reassign teams outright to provide the needed staff augmentation to the g5 and s5 staffs all of these actions diverted assets that were needed in the field the dual assignment of ca detachment commander as the brigade s5 severely limited that individuals ability to circulate amongst his teams as he was often inundated with staff requirements g5s5 staff augmentation needs to be built into the battle roster for deployment if not built outright into the mtoe for official use only 31operation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirregardless of the how the g5s5 billet is filled g5s5 derive prestige and effectiveness based on their perceived connections to channels of command commanders should publicly praise their liaison staff with the host nation failure to do so will decrease overall effectiveness commanders should generally have their liaison personnel accompany them on all meetings with local nationals the role of the ca brigade headquarters was undefined and subsequently the headquarters was not effectively used the ca brigade headquarters is doctrinally attached to units that are corps level and above in anticipation of humanitarian crisis resulting from ground combat operations four ca brigades were mobilized and deployed even though only one corps headquarters was deployed humanitarian crisis occurred and the ca brigade headquarters subsequently did not have readily apparent mission one ca brigade headquarters staffed and ran the humanitarian operations center hoc in kuwait and also provided 26soldier operational planning team opt to division another operated the humanitarian assistance coordination center hacc in baghdad and provided c2 responsibility over subordinate ca battalions and separate ca companies however due to its location inside the secured green zone the haccbaghdad had limited local populace interaction one ca brigade provided support to the corps support command coscom fourth brigade was divided to support the haccjordan to support an area support group in kuwait and to support the marine force operating in iraq these ca brigade headquarters also filled billets in or directly supported by cpa each of the ca brigades deployed with their staff sections outside of the one ca brigade providing c2 the staff elements g1g4 had function the one ca brigade affecting c2 had to do with only 3soldier s3 cell additionally the ca brigade was not outfitted with the necessary organic field communication equipment to communicate with subordinate units hampering the ca brigades even further was the fact that they did not have much in terms of organic mobility assets there were expectations of the ca brigades by the ca battalions that were unfulfilled one unmet expectation was to capitalize on the ca brigades functional specialists there was minimal vertical integration of the functional specialties in many cases the endeavors of the ca brigade eg conducting assessments duplicated those of the ca battalion that was functioning in the same area the ca battalions looked to the ca brigade to synchronize the cmo effort which did not occur ca direct support detachments opined that the cmo effort would have benefited from more direct support teams as opposed to staffing the ca brigades there were units eg field artillery and engineers controlling battlespace who could have greatly benefited from dedicated ca teams that were not available to them the ca command and brigades became force provider to cpa and thereby reduced their unit effectiveness the cpa actively sought staffing assistance due to its lack of personnel individuals from one ca brigade and cacom filled critical positions although these ca personnel both individually and collectively made significant contributions to the overall national effort their absence degraded the efforts of the teams from which they were drawn these individuals were perceived as indispensable by cpa and subsequently efforts by the ca brigade and cacom to reintegrate them into their original teams were met by resistance from cpa in many cases the rating scheme for these individuals fell within cpa channels as result commanders were challenged to direct their own assigned personnel ca forces require support from maneuver units due to force protection requirements the requirement level is dependent upon the division task force one division task forces 32 for official use onlyoperation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirrequirement for convoy to leave the forward operating base fob was minimum of three vehicles minimum of three service members sm per vehicle and two crewserved weapons most bcts in this division granted an exception by allowing ca teams to depart with two vehicles for convoys within 10 km of the gate during daylight hours only captain may approve daylight movement but battalion commander must approve any night movement many ca battalions operated under the mtoe of sixsoldier direct support team dst with two high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles hmmwvs one coa for dst to meet the force protection requirements was to combine teams or at least provide each other half team to meet the 9soldier 3vehicle rule another coa was to coordinate with fellow slice element other nonorganic units faced the same force protection challenge thereby creating conditions for mutual support arrangements third coa was to request additional vehicular and personnel support from the supported maneuver unit the first two coas required the establishment of informal relationships and fair amount of bargaining due to the quidproquo aspect of these coas negative result was that ca teams did not depart the fob on missions as often as they desired the third coa optimal for the ca team was viewed negatively by some maneuver task forces some supported commanders did not favor having to provide support to supporting unit other commanders however made ca force protection augmentation top priority these ca teams were better able to optimize their time and efforts an initial drawback to all ca forces in theater was the lack of crewserved weapons in addition to personnel and vehicles most ca elements had to rely on the maneuver unit to provide the crewserved weapons since the typical ca battalion possesses only four m249 squad automatic weapons saws plusup of m249s to the ca forces in theater was provided later in their deployment lessons learned cmo suffered from the lack of clear task and purposes nested in cmo annexes from the national level to the battalion task force command and support relationships need to be clearly defined at the onset of an operation and refined continuously the ca command relationship selected needs to be metttc dependent ca units and supported units need to address g5s5 staff augmentation prior to deployment to minimize task organization disruption venue for clearly outlining the supported commands expectations is through the mission letter an alternative recommendation is to staff division g5 sections with their gotowar complement the cmo situation on the ground could have greatly profited from an increase in general purpose ca teams as opposed to ca brigade headquarters ca brigades and ca commands providing personnel support

focus which varies by brigade while one brigade commander stated explicitly that he was not in iraq to win hearts and minds but rather had combat mission to destroy the enemy other brigade commanders stressed that gaining the emotional and intellectual acceptance of the iraqi people was the only way that american forces could be successful in iraq within the theater american operations differ from british operations in that the british integrate cmo with all operations and include responsive and proactive io program in short cmo is not always given command emphasis in us operations lack of emphasis may come in the form of not providing securityescort vehicles to allow dst to function under force protection requirements the administration and reconstruction of country the size of iraq exceeds the capabilities of us ca forces and the coalition provisional authority cpa as result it is necessary for major subordinate command msc assets to engage in administering the country consequently it is necessary to leverage assets from division and brigade such as medical engineering and law enforcement this involves functional specialists within the division linking up with their corresponding iraqi counterpart for instance division medical personnel help to rejuvenate the local hospitals and departments of health engineers assist in public works and the provost marshal office pmo assists with police forces however these specialists and many s5 have never received any training or introduction to cmo orientation to cmo is not emphasized in officer basic or advanced courses in light of the ongoing requirements in iraq greater orientation in cmo to all officers would be helpful this could occur in the captains career course furthermore knowledge of contracting and scope of work sow is critical for all ca forces cmo activities are heavily reliant on the timely targeted and efficient application of funds particularly cerp funds training in contracting negotiations and sow would add significantly to the success of us forces in cmo environments structure to manage civil reconstruction projects within any size task force is necessary to ensure unity of effort and optimal impact on the overall cmo plan given the importance of cmo in stability and support operations saso division and brigade commanders have developed tactics techniques and procedures ttp to direct the focus of their staffs to address cmo one such ttp is to use nonlethal effects matrices in the form of an effects coordination cell ecc to track individual projects and available funding both at the division and brigade levels the ecc is headed by the fire support officer fso due to the existing staff of the fire support section coupled with the fact that indirect fires are not being heavily utilized currently in iraq this additionally capitalizes on the established relations between division and brigade fsos added to this is the fact that most of the battalion s5 are also the battalion fso this basically shifts the focus of the artillery structure in the division to accommodate projects and contracts once week one division ecc conducted video teleconference with the division commander and all brigade commanders also involved are all primary and special staff officers for instance the division surgeon briefs on ministry of health issues the judge adjutant general jag briefs on ministry of justice the provost marshal pm on ministry of the interior the division engineer diveng on public works etc inherent in the success of the ecc is timely and accurate bottom up information from each sector this involves the garnering of public sentiment by forces interacting with iraqis on daily basis the ecc allows for an organized targeted equitable distribution of cerp funding in the division ao 36 for official use onlyoperation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirfurthermore it is important to overlay military sectors upon existing geopolitical boundaries in iraq iraq is divided into eighteen provinces and coalition forces have established military boundaries throughout the country in some cases the military boundaries do not correspond with the geopolitical boundaries this results in the iraqi governor having to deal with more than one military chain of command as well as military chains of command having to deal with multiple iraqi governance and administrative structures it also necessitates military forces establishing habitual relationships with more than one cpa regional office since the cpa has aligned itself with existing iraqi geopolitical divisions the effects are similar at the battalion level where town and county leaders are forced to deal with more than one battalion commander in areas where coalition forces have aligned their division brigade and battalion boundaries with iraqi geopolitical divisions there is greater unity of effort and consistency in dealing with iraqi governments the collapse of the baath party and subsequent debaathification efforts resulted in an absence of local iraqi governing authorities as result us forces appointed governance officials as well as neighborhood town and district councils in the case of baghdad this was done largely in concert with the cpa outside of baghdad this was done by the msc without guidance from the cpa the creation of local governments needs to be standardized local governance structures are not bounded entities rather they are components of larger governing structures expertise must be leveraged and diffused to the lower tactical levels this expertise includes ca legal financial and interagency in order to leverage expertise and create consistency in diyala and salahdin provinces the msc created mobile training team to advise on ttp for creating town district and provincial governing bodies throughout the province this had the result of providing division unity of effort and creating compatible structures that could interact with each other this is significant in that the msc has two provinces in its aor and that each of the provinces coordinates both with other provinces and with the central government in baghdad this is further significant in that the expertise needed to establish local governments is not doctrinally present at the maneuver battalion or brigade level under the present environment that expertise does exist to some degree at the division level by virtue of their association with the cpa and the presence of ca governance section at the ca brigade level failure to incorporate expertise and standardization at this level would result in variety of different government structures that would eventually have to be modified in order to be in accordance with the national governance plan this also serves as mechanism for timely funding of government structures unemployment and security are currently the biggest concerns of iraqis projects are extremely helpful but should include provisions for the employment of iraqis unemployment in turn creates resentment and fertile ground for the recruitment of anticoalition elements there is significant discussion in the msc concerning the relationship between projects and the creation of secure environment in this vein there are attempts to correlate improvements in the security situation with the amount of money spent in constructionreconstruction projects due to the virtually unlimited number of variables inherent to the situation in iraq the establishment of positive correlation within acceptable margins of error is virtually impossible nonetheless the restoration of nations economy is vital element in securing political stability and needs to be the center of constant attention lessons learned division and

preparation in language as well as political ideological and cultural training cultural awareness in the ioe goes beyond the simplistic do not use the left hand or show the feet that is characteristic of us briefings and preparation for operations in the middle east rather cultural awareness is component of the politics religion values history society and economics of particular region in other words culture transcends all aspects of society and cannot be delineated into separate simplistic category unto itself in the middle east arab values are amalgamated into islam which in turn is an evolving system that reproduces itself sociopolitical establishments such as tribes are historical fact that in turn embody economic and religious imperatives and interact with local and national governments cultural awareness thus needs to address different forms of religion political structures and modes of production and their influence on given region failure to understand the role of tribalism for instance has led to some american units disproportionately empowering tribal structures while others have virtually ignored them in iraq religion and politics cannot be separated consequently an academic understanding of islam is less relevant than an understanding of the unique versions of islam that exist in the different areas of iraq and the role that each plays training for us forces in iraq thus needs to focus less on arab culture and more on the specificity of iraq operations in iraq require understanding of tribal and religious structures these are often in competition with other governing and administrative structures such as town councils and local police in single town there can be multiple forms of authority to include religious leaders tribal leaders elected councils prominent and educated citizens as well as former and newly appointed leaders these sources of authority may be complementary or in competition so it is important to deal with appropriate leaders tribal leaders for instance have limited authority within certain parameters such as settling minor disputes between their own tribal structures in other matters and places tribal leaders have limited or authority failure to recognize the different sources of authority can disrupt existing governance and resolution structures in this light consistent guidelines that promote understanding should be forthcoming from the cpa and the us army the use of translators is an area meriting improvement due to lack of trained military arabicspeaking linguists and contracted third country translators us forces are reliant on locally hired translators this has the potential to cause problems due to the disproportionate influence and bias that translators tend to wield this can result in some groups being favored at the expense of others while the subsequent animosity towards the translator may be directed at american forces in an extreme example of this american forces that entered iraq with kuwaiti translators encountered negative iraqi response stemming from animosity between iraqis and kuwaitis similarly tribal and sectarian affiliations of locally hired translators may interfere with us objectives and operations in short the lesson is to be aware of ones operating environment and the differences between the nationalities and ethnicities in the middle east coalition forces in iraq are engaged in combat operations against insurgent forces that do not wear uniforms and who take advantage of populated areas to hide in despite the challenges this presents coalition forces need to integrate an awareness of the iraqi perceptions of american practices and operations tactics such as detaining the family members of anticoalition suspects destroying the houses of captured suspects without judicial due process and shooting at iraqi vehicles that attempt to pass coalition vehicles on major highways may bestow for official use only 39operation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirshortterm tactical advantages however these advantages should be weighed against iraqi sentiments and the long term disadvantages associated with the image that this creates it is practice in some us units to detain family members of anticoalition suspects in an effort to induce the suspects to turn themselves in in exchange for the release of their family members in at least one such example note to that effect was left by american forces whereas this might have the immediate desired effects the detention of women and children without due process contributes to lasting negative image of the us military in the eyes of the iraqis and could thus severely undermine overall us goals in the region such practices further show disregard for the iraqi culture women and children for example contribute to the honor of men and families their detention conveys that the us is not honorable in its dealing with the iraqi people when it is necessary to detain iraqis it is important that timely and accurate information be provided to the families of the detainees via the civil military operations center cmoc initially in iraq it took several months for information concerning detainees to be transferred to ca forces this was later reduced to about two weeks with the information being accessible on sipr webpage the lesson learned is that this information should be provided to the families as soon as possible so as to avoid the appearance that the us is secretly detaining or possibly executing iraqis this was common tactic of the saddam hussein regime that the us should not be associated with it is common practice amongst us forces to fire warning shots in the direction of civilian vehicles or at civilian vehicles that are attempting to pass slowmoving convoys along major highways in iraq although this may be perceived to contribute to the immediate shortterm protection of american forces this policy varies by unit and region in iraq and is not accompanied by an information campaign to inform iraqis of the dangers of approaching american convoys from the rear this is particularly important while operating in other coalition sectors where this is not common practice the british sector for instance is relatively free of anticoalition attacks yet american convoys moving north from kuwait from the british sector have fired at british contractors who drove near the american vehicles on major highway common sentiment amongst iraqis is that the us is in iraq for its own economic interests and not for the greater welfare of the iraqi people additionally in culture where honor plays major role and where gaining the acceptance of the population is critical to mission success it is important for american soldiers to have positive image along these lines there have been confirmed cases in both the british and american sectors of coalition forces stealing money from iraqis on raids while these do not represent official coalition policy or practice by any means these examples can be used by anticoalition elements to mobilize anticoalition sentiment by conveying that the coalition is not honorable nor does it have the best interests of the iraqi people in mind historically in the middle east it has been difficult to neatly differentiate between religion and politics consequently in addition to being place of religious worship mosques have often been used for political activism and even military operations in iraq it is thus often necessary for us forces to enter mosques in order to search for weapons or arrest suspects because of the sensitivity of entering mosque however american forces have adopted ttp to minimize the impact these include the use of iraqi police ip andor iraqi civil defense corps icdc as the lead elements in entering the mosque when ip or icdc are not available and americans must enter the mosque the use of translators to explain us actions is absolutely mandatory prior to entering mosque worshipper is required to remove his shoes and wash his feet this is unrealistic for american soldiers conducting raid to circumvent this american soldiers have adopted the habit of placing plastic surgical booties over their boots if it is necessary to arrest an imam muslim cleric it is important that this action be accompanied by an information 40 for official use onlyoperation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iircampaign that explains why the person is being arrested additionally coordination should be made immediately with the ministry of religious affairs to have replacement imam as soon as possible as general rule mosques should not be entered or raided on friday the muslim day of worship american forces have engaged in the practice of destroying the houses of anticoalition suspects whereas this might appear to be an effective measure the destruction of private residences creates animosity amongst many iraqis this is sensitive issue that needs to weigh shortterm military success against longer term antiamerican sentiment additionally the destruction of houses used by insurgents is common tactic used by the israeli military in the occupied territories of the gaza strip and the west bank the tactic is known throughout the middle east and highly publicized by the arab media aside from the immediate hardships imposed on the family members who lived in the house the association of the us with israel undermines the image of the us providing the iraqis with liberty and democracy under the aegis of operation iraqi freedom in the past american forces have mistakenly raided the wrong house and in some cases caused significant damage to the house and hardship to the occupants given the multiple sources of information and lack of street addresses in many areas this is perhaps unavoidable to address this however one division created task force neighborhood the task force is basically collateral damage response team that repairs damages and processes claims within twentyfour hours of the raidsearch and explains the mistake the team is composed of engineer ca psychological operations psyop and legal personnel even when the right house or person is targeted ca forces need to be able to explain us actions to the iraqi populace consequently ca forces need to be involved in all planning processes for operations affecting iraqi civilians and all command and staff elements should be fully briefed by army lawyers concerning the legality of different types of us actions additionally maneuver units should have feedback mechanism for assessing the impact of their operations and ascertaining host nation opinions and sentiment without doing so american forces have idea if actions such as destroying houses are effective or counterproductive currently american forces are operating in relative vacuum of iraqi sentiments this stems from lack of utilizing methodologically acceptable survey techniques continually throughout us sectors in iraq the limited perception of iraqi sentiments comes largely from reliance on translators or iraqis who visit cmoc these people are not necessarily representative of wider iraqi sentiments and could present significantly skewed picture of iraqi perceptions and attitudes this contrasts with the british who have developed 20question survey that is continually administered throughout their area of operations inherent to virtually all operations in iraq is the need to operate in crowds of iraqi civilians such crowds may range from curious children to impassive bystanders to politically oriented crowds improper reaction to crowds could result in compromising the security of coalition members or causing ill will amongst iraqis by overreacting in the form of using violence or giving the impression of fear or panic consequently it is important that us military receive training in how to deal with crowds in iraq this is all the more important given the light footprint and firepower often exhibited by ca forces interaction with crowds can also be augmented through situational and cultural awareness the areas around mosques on friday are generally crowded and often politicallyideologically charged additionally peak hours in the local markets can increase the size of crowds when dealing with crowds that are potentially threatening methods alternative to yelling shoving threats and violence exist these include use of iraqi police use of translators the for official use only 41operation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirhasty establishment of symbolic barriers such as engineer tape physical barriers such as concertina wire as well as engaging directly in conversation with members of the crowd coalition forces operating in iraq are faced with number of muslim religious holidays the haj and ashura are particularly noteworthy not only because of their religious significance but also because they involve the cross border movements of thousands of people for instance forces throughout iraq recently had to deal with roughly 70000 pilgrims going to saudi arabia for the haj the majority of the pilgrims took an overland route through the western desert anbar province and drove into saudi arabia thirtytwo thousand pilgrims were transported by air from kuwait city this involved gaining country clearance into kuwait and obtaining visas from saudi arabia this affected tacticallevel maneuver and ca units in that they were faced with establishing temporary camp in safwan for 32000 pilgrims while they were awaiting their saudi visas the actions of ca forces involved erecting tents providing food and water and coordinating directly with the red crescent ashura is shia religious holiday that involves movement of tens of thousands of shias from iran and iraq to najaf and karbala central iraq like the haj it is an annual event that is considered religious requirement the prevention of pilgrims from fulfilling either the rituals of the haj or ashura will have negative national and international consequences consequently it is critical that ca forces be properly educated to advise commanders on the importance of providing security support and passage to muslim pilgrims it is noteworthy to mention that this is not limited to iraq coalition forces operating in afghanistan have similarly had to take measures to facilitate the movement of pilgrims to the haj lessons learned conduct iraqspecific trainingdo not conduct generic arab culture training or middle east training there must be mechanism to monitor iraqi opinion and sentiment ca should be integrated into the planning process to help assess second order effects of military operations involving iraqi civilians weigh shortterm tactical gains with longterm implications and second order effects tribes in iraq are reality and should be dealt with from position of understanding of their roles and power failure to do so can result in their gaining disproportionate power to the exclusion of educated iraqis and those not affiliated with the more powerful tribes it is inevitable that mistakes will be made and that collateral damage will occur make

resourceful ca units obtained the consent of maneuver commanders to use confiscated or captured foreign weapons specifically the akms and the ak47 these weapons provided greater firepower in relation to m9s and m16s ca commanders and team members believe personnel must be trained on the safe handling operation and maintenance of these weapons the weapons and ammunition are easy to obtain from the bct for training on ranges ca elements had to rely on crewserved weapons to be provided by the supported unit until additional m249s were shipped to theater from the continental united states conus until ca soldiers could be familiarized with the weapon system the handover of an m249 was inadequate supported units had to also provide gunners the suite of communication equipment provided to ca elements also proved inadequate specifically only one multiban intrateam radio mbitr was issued per team this arrangement prevented team that was split between two vehicles from communicating since not all vehicles were outfitted with the single channel ground to air radio system sincgars many ca teams relied on commerciallybought unsecure twoway radios the need for vehicletovehicle communication given the threat to direct fire ambush and improvised explosive device ied cannot be overstated equally imperative was the need for the ca element participating in meeting to communicate with the ca element elsewhere in the building or outside with the vehicles the harm to both personnel and equipment from ied is greatly reduced when traveling in an uparmored hmmwv the need for

noncompliant forces were continuously observing us forces to identify vulnerabilities the enemy attacked those vulnerabilities at the time and place of his choosing units had to develop their battle skills in an onthejob training mode to cope with the ever changing complexion of the battlefield there were safe zones for us forces in iraq every us operation had to be planned prepared and executed

varied tasksmissions upon arrival in iraq forward operating bases needed to be constructed base infrastructure became the primary engineer mission and with the development of force protection for entrance gates and fighting positions because their mission was going to be temporary one based upon mission guidance class iv materials were not included in their basic loads they soon found out that class iv materials were very short in the theater some units had had the foresight to prefabricate guard towers before moving into the ao these towers worked well to point but lacked the structural integrity to support the sandbags necessary for overhead and side protection hescobastion baskets and new jersey barriers proved to be the items of choice for serpentine traffic layouts and vehicle checkpoint locations care had to be taken in their installation to insure that ieds could not be hidden in or around these devices baskets needed to be capped so that devices could not be buried in the dirt fill material on top baskets also needed to be keyed into the earth to avoid being blown out when mortar rounds landed close in front berms hesco barriers and new jersey barriers were difficult to construct and move the combat engineer brought the bare minimum of equipment to complete this type of construction and found that leasing the necessary equipment in country was not an easy task the biggest equipment shortfalls included frontend loaders cranes small emplacement excavators sees and bobcattype loaders the armored combat excavator ace commonly found in the combat engineer battalion proved adequate for berming operations but had its hands full when trying to penetrate hard or rocky soil maintenance of the major drive systems on the ace proved to be challenge to company mechanics equipment associated with combat heavy battalion was needed to perform the construction mission of base camp development but few of those resources were available on top of the base camp development task it was soon determined that not enough personnel were available to support cordon and search operations convoy security operations and general site patrolling because fighting as infantry is secondary engineer mission combat engineer personnel were chosen to plan and execute these missions problems surfaced immediately the combat engineer did not have the infantry weapons laser sights and night vision devices necessary to insure operations success in addition the engineer vehicles needed were not uparmored and most lacked crew served weapons mounts if vehicle did have weapon mounts most did not include armor around the mount to protect the firer the engineer soldier went about his business and fabricated what he needed and mounted it where he needed it things have improved dramatically since the beginning of the war more uparmored vehicles are arriving and laser sighting equipment is being provided to the units needing these systems improvements can still be made by equipping hmmwvs with infrared headlight systems to enable drivers to move in blackout mode but be much more aware of their movement area than what blackout drives allow special portable lighting systems could be provided that would shine high intensity light away from vehicle checkpoint or security gate thus making it more difficult to see the soldiers manning that point the tigris and euphrates rivers and their small tributaries provided safe haven to many of the insurgents trying to destabilize the us mission in iraq both rivers had small islands that needed to be patrolled because in many cases they were part of the terrorist escape route boats for patrolling and insertion of forces were inadequate for the mission requirements the engineer began using bridge erection boats when the initial bridging tasks were completed they also had access to small assault boats found in the multirole bridge company inventory neither type really met the requirement the assault boats were too slow and hard to maneuver in the 48 for official use onlyoperation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iirswift currents encountered the bride erection boat although powerful still lacked the speed for insertion operations and did not come equipped with the proper types of weapon mounts for crew served weapons although the combat engineer lacked the mission essential equipment to conduct cordon and search operations convoy escort duties and general site patrolling they were able to utilize what they had to complete the mission the ability for individual soldiers to communicate with one another during tactical operations was significant shortfall walkietalkies bought at home station were the radio of choice although they lacked secure capability they were effective for mantoman communications squad leaders needed immediate contact with squad members during cordon and search operations convoy commanders had to be able to talk to all of their vehicles to coordinate response in the event of terrorist attack patrol leaders required immediate information to respond to challenges caused by civilian traffic flow in their area of operations and movement of civilian personnel individual communications equipment is essential for tactical movement and movement to contact operations the most significant shortfall faced by engineer commanders concerned training for the fight in an urban environment training for this type of combat was completed during much abbreviated training sessions at mobilization stations or while at home station emphasis was not placed on these missions because combat engineers usually are involved in breaching operations and general engineering missions the same can be said of other types of cs and css units training for fighting in an urban environment was secondary or even tertiary to their primary missions brigade combat teams had active duty and reserve military police units interwoven into their structure this resource provided the training help needed by commanders to prepare their cs and css personnel for fighting in an urban environment the civilian police skills brought to the battlefield by national guard and army reserve units was without doubt the centerpiece of cordon and search operations lessons learned more uparmored vehicles with crew served weapons mounts need to be provided to engineer units faced with tactical convoy security operations cordon and search operations and general area patrolling missions individual communications equipment that can operate both secure and nonsecure needs to be included in the combat engineers equipment requirements weapons for tactical squad operations must be provided to combat engineers thermal night vision goggles and laser sights

the munitions available to him and the deterrent effect of the wouldbe target it is imperative that the coalition soldier be encouraged to think terrorist and attempt to undermine his opportunities by presenting difficult target terrorist attacks seldom follow identical patterns however if an attack has been successful it is likely to be repeated if the opportunity presents itself again it is not

often soldiers have seen evidence of an attack but have failed to act upon it it is imperative that all combat indicators are reported recorded and acted upon these indicators are the driving force in

starting point to perhaps track down retailers that might supply certain type of timing device or other incidental part this forensic approach is proactive method to take the advantage away from the insurgent in the eod arena numerous caches of captured enemy ammunition and unexploded ordnance has been discovered and secured bct commanders have called upon the combat engineer division artillery and any other type of combat or combat service support unit to help in securing these sites until destruction of the ordnance is completed the mission for destroying these lethal caches has usually

css to sustain their operations the gs role of an eod company reduces ownership by the division the linkage between the combat engineer battalion trained in demolition operations and eod detachments is natural one this should be sustained for all tactical operations and particularly in the complex urban terrain of iraq with its recurring terrorist attack profile the use of ieds as standoff weapon system requires rapid response to avoid unnecessary hazards to civilians and the less attuned logistics convoys that must frequent the streets to acquire support resources eod detachments are rare commodity and maneuver commanders typically turn to combat engineers for assistance when they are not available engineers and eod detachments should work together and should attend joint training

synopsis stability and support operations saso will continue to be the primary missions in iraq for the foreseeable future when stability operations began commanders were delegated cerp funds to complete local projects that would provide immediate benefits to the communities this program proved to be force multiplier in that it provided the local commander with tools to address immediate community needs iraqi citizenscontractors were hired and paid for by coalition forces to complete civil works projects that would have an immediate impact on the health and wellbeing of the community unfortunately commanders lacked the skilled personnel to professionally define the projects they were asked to do these projects originated locally from neighborhood action councils nacs personnel on these councils had high expectations as to the quality of work and materials incorporated into the completed project their expectations were rarely met throughout oif contractors selected for construction projects repeatedly failed to meet customer quality standards and delivery dates written contracts that defined the scope of work construction standards and delivery dates were not used because contract specialists were not available engineer staffs in theater were not prepared to take over designbuild missions because their focus remained in the warfighting arena in addition commanders have not had access to personnel with contract writing ability contract agent is available at the division level but in most cases is so busy with division level contracting that writing and approving contracts for cerp funded projects gets relegated to wait in line scenario cerp projects need to move quickly to help develop communities and build rapport with the iraqi people because of these problems money from cerp funds was not utilized to its fullest potential to utilize cerp funds or any funds available in theater to their fullest extent plans and specifications need to be developed that govern construction or the quality expected when items are purchased and installed in addition time lines toward completion are essential in that they determine how much and when contractorsupplier will receive payment for goods and services delivered this is not how things began happening in iraq but how things should be happening today boiler plate contract documents would be useful for small projects and for purchases that are repeated over and over for large projects construction contracts need to be written with specifications that can be clearly understood supplies and provisions should be bought using structured purchase orders that specify quality and delivery times and projects should be paid for based upon having met contract specifications and specific delivery criteria one final comment concerning specifications is that iraqi construction standards are not comparable to continental us conus construction standards and justifyably the cost of construction to iraqi standards is not and should not be equal the development of the iraqi forward engineer support team ifest at the division level helped in the development of large dollar projects the ifest has been very successful in coordinating work through both the engineering community and iraqi contractors both have been found to be very competent and have the ability to complete quality work in order to insure quality control and quality assurance on these projects the ifest has also had the mission of providing for construction inspection this has been accomplished by hiring quality iraqi engineering firms to complete the mission this has been successful program after firms with limited experience have been weeded out the same goes for contractors contractors that do poor job have been eliminated from the contractor pool for official use only 59operation iraqi freedom oif caat ii initial impressions report iir at the battalion level and lower contracting with local construction companies has been challenge it seems that anyone who wants to be contractor rolls in his wheelbarrows and makes an attempt to go to work high level community figures have been eager to help assign work to contractors who turn out to be part of their families these firms have little or construction experience and are soon weeded out and not used in future projects design firms have been hard to find but once found have provided quality work knowledgeable interpreter is the key to finding quality firms for both design and construction lessons learned engineering firms and construction firms are located anywhere but may be limited in their ability to provide quality product manager must be cautious in chosing the right firms because many are unable to complete the

impressions report iirchapter 3 engineer topic us army corps of engineers usace observation synopsis one of the most formidable challenges faced by maneuver commander during operation iraqi freedom was that of establishing forward operating base after an area of operations was secured forward operating bases had to be established to house and support troop occupation as well as provide adequate force protection these facilities were constructed in urban areas with many fixed structures and areas completely void of any hardened structures commanders had to make decisions concerning base camp footprint resource requirements to construct each camp and facilities to support the soldier decisions had to be made concerning the utilization of containerized troop housing versus tent cities electrical and communications grids had to be designed and constructed water for shower facilities had to be piped to the correct areas and gray water accumulated at the proper discharge points dining facilities had to be constructed to protect food processing areas and troop service areas and once completed these facilities had to be maintained for extended durations because of the size of the battlefield commanders have had to develop many separate plans and requirements for beddown of soldiers in the area of operations these plans include the layout of the basecamp the type of facilities necessary to support the soldiers during their occupation and the cost of completing the facilities usace recognized early on that the commander with his many and varied requirements might need help in designing and developing basecamps this provided the incentive to develop the base development team bdt to do contingency master planning for base camps unfortunately most commanders wereare not aware of the best method for contacting us army corps of engineers usace in addition many felt that the cost of using usace was not justified usace needs to improve the communication process so that maneuver commanders know how to reach the right person with the right question this communications simplification should reap broad benefits for usace as long as the productsservices that usace provides can be shown to add value to the finished productobjective toe units do not have good grasp of the capabilities of the usace they are focused on the mission capabilities of combat engineers units have described usace capabilities as that of large organization managing infrastructure in conus such as lakes rivers and dams they know that some mapping and aerial photography capability is provided by the corps in addition there is general knowledge that the corps is involved at very high level with reconstruction of infrastructure in the aor some units were familiar with the fest

with civilians but much outside of the warfighter efforts and activities to achieve the best utilization of usace lnos need to be embedded at the brigade and battalion level usace lnos would provide the communications link necessary for reachback and would open the door for problem solving using the many and varied centers of expertise the corps brings to the table the portable teleengineering

would have more than paid for any cost associated with using the resources available from usace in one bcts ao security for route 1 is high priority several abandoned structures along this route provide cover and concealment for potential sniper operations one structure in particular has been recognized as prime sniper location on more than one occasion convoys and bde personnel have been the target for small arms fire the dilemma faced by the commander was how to secure this structure to eliminate the sniper problems sending team to constantly police the building was out of the question due to lack of personnel the best alternative was the destruction of the building two alternatives were evaluated to complete the destruction of the building the first alternative for leveling the building was through the use of air bombardment issues of collateral damage to the roadway and other structures and possible injury to civilians made this solution difficult to execute the second alternative focused on controlled demolition of the structure using c4 or other explosives the problem faced by the brigade centered around engineering expertise on how and where to place charges to affect total collapse how much explosive needed to be placed at each critical location and what work would be needed to clean up the site after demolition the brigade asked the division engineer for help in solving the problem the division did not have the structural engineers or explosive experts to develop solution the division reached back to usace at its headquarters stateside usace immediately forwarded the request for help to their center of expertise on demolitions and explosives structural engineers were called in to review photos of the building and determine the critical explosive locations other engineers determined the explosives necessary to drop the structure within matter of days the solution and subsequent results were forwarded back to the division hq the division was very complimentary to usace for their quick response lessons learned liaison with the corps should be directed through the festa embedded with the division simplifying communications

transfer from another unit and strapped 3k smft on the back of stake and platform sp trailer for distribution however since the fsb is not designed to provide water distribution personnel were taken out of hide to perform the water missions thus impacting other missions there were forward operating bases fobs without water source wells canals or creeks which required water to be trucked in some of the fobs have water sources nearby but still outside the wire tactical water distribution system twds was not reliable option as it was subject to frequent sabotage additional force protection was added to these sites to secure the water source there are numerous fobs that did not have access to city water for nonpotable water requirements and had to rely on reverse osmosis water purification unit rowpu water for all water requirements this was primarily because there were not enough distribution and storage assets for nonpotable water once water bag or semitrailer mounted fabric tank smft is used for nonpotable water it cannot be used for potable water even if there was process to refit the bags to make them suitable for potable water storage the means to accomplish that does not exist in this austere environment the nonpotable water requirement was on average just as great as the potable water requirement however because of the risk associated with using bags for both types of bulk water units were forced to rely solely on potable water for all bulk water requirements aircraft washing became large consumer of bulk water this would be perfect candidate for bulk nonpotable water however since there was ability to store or transport nonpotable water units were forced to use large quantities of rowpu water for these operations water distribution compatibility was also an issue the 5k smft can only fit on an m872 trailer which none of the fsbs has only 3k smfts will fit on an 871 trailer however 3k smfts are in extremely short supply in one case the csg managed to cut and rebind 5k smfts and make them into 3k smfts after some trial and error these did eventually work very well an additional issue with compatibility was the waste incurred when using 5k smft to fill 3k bag because there is way to staunch the flow from 5k bag 2k of water would inevitably end up dumped on the ground much of the armys water storage systems are unsuited for longterm use and were fragile in this operating environment softskin storage smfts and onion skins did not always hold up to the environmental conditions for example one fob lost its sole bulk water source when helicopter landed in the fob and kicked up rock which punched hole in the smft the partial solution to storage and distribution lay in buying hardsided barrelshaped containers approximately 450 gallons each mounting them on palletized load system pls flatrack and equipping them with hoses these camel racks enabled the fsbs to distribute various amounts of water and have reliable storage for bulk water for

fuel intended for foreign national use prior to cf operations in theater iraqi bulk fuel assets were managed with centralized style having all decision and direction provided from the ministry of oil mo located in baghdad it provided local operation managers one source that all could blame and it was the standard practice to blame all shortages errors and mismanagement on the mo since cf assumed oversight and shared local management decentralized approach to fuel assets has proven far more successful decisions are made independently by local iraqi fuel managers forcing greater assumption of responsibility project development is emerging and future operations are greater consideration in their decisionmaking process as iraqi managerial autonomy emerges foreign national backsliding into former operational management style is of great concern tracking of bulk fuel from iraqi refineries and distribution companies is difficult challenge due to inadequate tracking mechanisms and extensive smuggling conducted by organized crime since coalition forces have taken control of iraqi infrastructure refined petroleumbased products have been restricted from export iraqi drivers are diverting mass quantities of refined products such as benzene kerosene and diesel to iran and surrounding countries the primary means of illegal export are the road tanker converted pickup trucks buses fishing boats and small barges which can easily slip through border patrols once across the border traffickers transfer the fuel products to middlemen who sell the products making profit increase five times the original price in other cases falsified documentation is produced which allows traffickers to justify the loss lessons learned since coalition forces have assumed oversight of bulk fuel provided to the civilian population from the mo more decentralized management style has emerged and has successfully encouraged more assumption of responsibility by local managers as management autonomy by iraqi nationals emerges return to the familiarity of centralized approach is of concern coalition forces have limited capability to track the illegal trafficking of large quantities of fuel across the borders of iraq most escorted convoys are making deliveries without any problem or corruption unescorted convoys are risk for smuggling activities and illegal sell of

concern was the need for threevehicle convoy to transport patient to higher level of care or to retrieve patients from the area where they were injured current doctrine does not appear to take these factors into account and assumes that the ambulance either field litter ambulance fla or track will be able to move independently on the nonlinear battlefield in iraq the threevehicle requirement severely limited the number of patient transports that could be accomplished in given period of time it also often delayed transport of less critical patients until enough vehicles and personnel to man them could be located to accompany the ambulance this was further complicated by the requirement of crew served weapon on each convoy an asset the medical platoons or companies do not normally have lessons learned additional armored vehicles are needed in the medical companies and platoons to accompany ambulances in multivehicle convoy to higher level of care establish an sop for providing timely patient pickup from the battle site to the aid station and then to higher levels of care if needed in an environment with high risk of insurgent attack dotmlpf implications organization provide

health service support subtopic 11 personal protection weapons for medics observation synopsis medic on convoy or raid typically carries an m16 rifle for personal protection in addition to his aid bag the length of the full sized m16 rifle makes it difficult to exit hmmwv that still has its doors or carrylift patient usually the rifle needs to be put down on the ground or left with the vehicle when treating casualty making it difficult to keep in arms reach if the m16 rifle is affixed to the medics web gear typically with dring or strap to the right side bending over patient on the ground results in the weapon restricting range of movement lessons learned since medics carry weapons purely for personal defense an m9 pistol or an m4 carbine would serve them better than an m16 rifle while treating casualties this would allow them to maintain control of the weapon while caring for patient instead of laying it on the ground dotmlpf implications materiel provide medics healthcare providers with an m9 pistol and 9mm submachine gun hk mp5 or similar light and small enough to keep affixed to the soldier during all aspects of combat casualty care in the field as an alternative
