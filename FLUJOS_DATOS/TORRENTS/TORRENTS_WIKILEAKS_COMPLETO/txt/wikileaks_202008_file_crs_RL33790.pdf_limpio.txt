the establishment of an independent office of congre ssional ethics within the house of representatives to be made up of nonmembers which w ould screen allegations and could initiate on its own initia

109th congress comparative analysis by r eric petersenstructure function and duties of the new ffice of congressional ethics is discussed in the last section of this report prior to the adoption of hres 895 and the creation of the office of congressional ethics several options and issues were considered including the creation of an independent ethics commi ssion within the legislative branch with authority to receive disclosure reports including congressional gifts lobbying disclosure and member fi nancial statements require d under law and congressional rule or the creation of an independent ffice of public integrity proposals of this nature would have included either an entity to serve the entire congress or within each chamber and coul d have been tasked with recei ving financial disclosure and other reports filed by members congre ssional officers and their staff under the ethics in government act of 19784 as well as reports filed by registered lobbyists under the lobbying disclosure act lda5 various proposals would have created such an office to be authorized to audit re gistration and disclosure forms investigate any alleged violation of any rule or othe r standard of conduct and present case of probable violations to the committee on sta ndards of official conduct of the house of representatives the senate select committee on ethics or the department of justice as appropriate other proposal s would have such offices substantially supplant current standing et hics committees in the house and senate by authorizing such outside entities to provide information and guidance to members congressional officers and their staff regarding any rule s and other standards of conduct applicable in their official capacities or to substitute for the current offices of the clerk of the house and secretary of the senate by pr oviding guidance to lobbying registrants of their responsibilities under lda6 procon discussion the potential consequences of reorgani zing investigation and enforcement of ethicsrelated activities are unclear for example in regard to enhanced oversight of the interactions between lobbyists and mbers of congress and their staff it is arguable that vesting administrative oversight in the chamber ethics committeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33790crs3 7 fourteen senators were expelled during the civil war for disloyalty to the union and one other senator was expelled in 1797 also for disloyal conduct 8 actually 21 members and one delegate 9 see crs report rl31382 expulsion censure reprim and and fine legislative discipline in the house of representatives by jack maskellmight provide more opportunity to monitor those interactions because those panels already have jurisdiction over congressi onal ethics rules governing members interactions with lobbyists on the othe r hand it is not clear how those panels might oversee the disclosure of lobbying interac tions with executive branch officials or enforce laws governing the behavior of lobbyists similar concerns might affect ethics commissions or public integrity ffices based in the legislative branch regarding matters related to the enforcement of congressional ethics requirements critics of curre nt congressional disciplinar proceedings have argued that the inherent and structural conflicts in congressional selfdiscipline are the causes of what is seen by some to be an apparent reticence of congress to enforce ethical standards against its own members members often seek to cooperate to large extent with one another in the legisl ative process and there may be natural reticence for members to do something detrimental to one another many members are now reluctant to serve on an ethics committee where the proceedings may take great amount of time and where the member may be subject to criticisms from the public if perceived as being too lenient or from congressi onal colleagues if perceived as being too harsh actual disciplinary actions by the full senate or house have in fact been relatively rare the senate has censured eight senators in its history and has not expelled member of the senate since the civil war7 the house has censured 22 members8 and reprimanded eight others while expelling five of its members in its history three during the civil war for di sloyalty to the union and the most recent expulsion in 2002 after conviction of conspir acy to commit bribery receipt of illegal gratuities obstruction of justice and ot her charges in connection with receipt of favors and money in return for official acts9 the relatively low number of actual disciplinary actions may be attributable to some degree to the fact that many member s facing such disciplinary action prefer to resign from congress rather than to pursue the matter in other instances the voters have effectively resolved the matter by either not renominating the member in primary or voting the individual out of office in the general election before disciplinary action is comple ted many commentators f eel that for conduct which does not affect the proceedings of the ins titution itself the voters by way of the ballot box are the proper judges of the conduct and fitness of the member and congress should not interfere with that judgment there has been some concern expresse d about providing for an independent office of public integrity possibly compos ed in part of nonmembers in that congress might be abdicating constituti onal and institutional responsibility for selfprotection although potentially diffi cult task it is one expressly assigned eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33790crs4 house of congress by the constitution ther is also fear that if nonmembers more frequently recommend censu res andor reprimands such actions may lose their importance and potency as statement of strong congressi onal disapproval and punishment there is an additional pr actical problem of having an entity or organization involved in the enforcement and oversight of congressional ethics rules such as one or more of the co mmissions proposed which does not and is not the same entity that interprets and provides opinions based on those same ethics rules function which is and has traditionally been within the jurisdiction of the so called ethics committees in the house and senate the house committee on standards of official conduct and the senate select committee on ethics in addition to those concerns some of the potential issues raised by current practices in congressional selfdisciplin and reasons for more independent office of public integrity that could ar ise have been suggested to include perceptions by the public that internal selfdiscipline presents inherent conflicts for members w ho have difficulty judging their peers perceptions that collegial atmos phere pervades in the house and senate to protect member from strong disciplinary recommendations reluctance on the part of members to serve on the ethics committees since regardless of what ethics recommendation might be made the public may perceive anything s hort of expulsion as only minor penalty for member while an action taken against another member could have long term institutional consequences for collegiality comity and the deliberative capacity of congress perceptions that an independent office might reduce or eliminate the challenges of implementing current ethics enforcement regimes which have at times been used as tool of partisan conflict and perception that independent exa mination of the evidence and the making of disciplinary recommendations may be more impartial in judging members conduct on the other hand some of the fact ors which may argue against having chamberbased or legislative branch commissions involved in the congressional disciplinary process might include perception that by delegating some portion of the process for addressing alleged viol ations of chamber ethics rules members of congress may be seen as shirking their constitutional duty and their institutional responsibility to investigate or punish their own members concern that disciplinary action may be left to those who do not have the working knowledge and apprecia tion of the factors and realitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33790crs5 10 united states constitution article i section 5 clause 2of congressional life service as member of congress or the currently accepted norms of ethical behavior in congress increased application of sanctions including more frequent censures or in the house censures or reprimands which may dilute the impact of such actions taken by either chamber and unnecessarily hamper certain conduct of chamber business proceedings carried out by an independent commission may be more cumbersome adding dditional layers of procedure that may be overly legalistic technical and costly to participants than more summary collegial exercises of peer discipline and enforcement of congressional ethics can not be entirely independent of either chamber or else cons titutional concerns related to speech or debate clause immunity issues may arise constitutional issues questions have been raised as to whether an independent commission or similar body in the legislative branch of government which is concerned with congressional ethics enforcement would co mport with the provisions of the us constitution there are two initial and interconnected constitutional questions concerning 1 the authority to discipline members of each house of congress and 2 member of congresss privilege for speech or debate authority to discipline members delegation the us constitution expressly assigns the enforcement of internal ethics and disciplinary matters regarding their own members to the senate and to the house of representatives respectively specifically authorizing and empowering each house of congress to establish its own rules for proceedings and to punish its own members for misconduct each house may determine the rules of its proceedings punish its members for disorderly behaviour and with the concurrence of two thirds expel member10 one of the particular purposes of this express grant of rulemaking and internal housekeeping authority to each house of congress as well as certain grants of particular privileges and immunities to the members of congress and the countervailing authority for selfdiscipline was to ensure the independence of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33790crs6 11 united states v ballin 144 us 1 5 1892 see also discussion in united states v

doubt the propriety of the provision authorizing each house to determine the rules of its own proceedings if the power did not exist it w ould be utterly impractical to transact the business of the nation note also thomas jefferson each house of congress possesses this natural right of governing itself the papers of thomas jefferson julian p boyd editor vol 17 at 195196 1950 at kurland and lerner the founders constitution vol ii at 300 1988legislature from executive and judicial influence and to establish the congress as an independent coequal branch of the federal government11 the express constitutional language of article i section 5 clause 2 and the principles behind this authority thus provi significant indication that the final authority for internal congre ssional punishment of member must remain within the legislative body itself that is any enfo rcement of congressional ethics rules or federal law that involves legislative punishment cont emplated in and pursuant to article i section 5 clause 2 such as fo r example censure an expulsion or loss of seniority should be carried out by the h ouse or senate itself concerning one of its own members however even if the final authority to punish member by the legislature might not be delegated to nonme mbers is there an impediment for each house of congress to delegate the authority for f actfinding information gathering and the making of preliminary recommendations with in that process the constitution does not express the form manner or mechanism that internal ethics enforcement procedures preliminary to punishment of one of its own members must take in congress12 as noted by the supreme court as rule the constitution speaks in general terms leaving congress to deal with subsidiary matters of detail as the public interests and changing conditions may require13 the same language that provides to each house of congress the express grant of authority to make its own rules and the associated authority to discipline and punish its own members would appear to give to each house of congress broad discretion and authority within this constitutional framework to fashion and direct its own internal operations nd functioning as befits legislative assembly which is an independent coequal branch of gove rnment under our governmental system of separated powers14 this broad authority

noted that these matters are not reviewable by court see roudebush v hartke 405 us 15 19 1972 and barry v united states ex rel cunningham 279 us 597 613 616 1929 16 nixon v united states supra at 232 17 nixon v united states supra at 229 236238 citing baker v carr 369 us 186 217 1962explication application and finition of internal proce dural matters in both houses of congress15 that the congress has fairly wide ra nge of discretion in establishing the particular procedures for fact finding gathering evidence and information on matters which the members themselves must finally judge was clearly expressed by the supreme court in nixon v united states in nixon the supreme court turned down legal challenge to the internal proce dures that the senate had adopted for impeachment actions the petitioner an impeach ed federal judge argued that the senate may not dele gate to committee the responsibility of holding an evidentiary hearing on an impeachment and then merely receive report for final action nixon argued that because the constitution re quires the senate to try cases of impeachment the actual hearing or adjudication on an impeachment in the senate must be before the entire senate th court however found that the constitution did not seek to place such restrictions on the senates procedures for fact finding and receiving evidence in impeachme nt cases the word try in the constitution did not impart particular procedure for the entire senate to follow in considering the matter similarly the use of the term senate in the constitution did not imply that the entire senate must be invol ved in all of those functi ons and did not require that preliminary matters be barred from being delegated and findings simply reported to the full body as noted by the court petitioners interpretation would bring into judicial purview not merely the sort of claim by petitioner but other similar claims based on the conclusion that the word senate has imposed by implication limitations on procedures which the senate might adopt16 in nixon however it should be noted the dele gation of authority by the senate was to one of its own duly constituted committees made up of senators and staff employees answerable to members of the nate the delegation was thus not to an outside independent commission or body made up of nonmembers of the institution and thus while the precedent is certainly important it may not answer definitively the question raised significantly the court in nixon found that the claims of the petitioner were nonjusticiable that is they were not proper subjects for judi cial review because under the political question doctrine and its separation of powers implications the court found textually dem onstrable constitutional commitme nt of the issue to coordinate political department17 since these are matters specifically assigned in the constitution to the congress congress has broad discretion in establishing

likely be available the process of disciplining mber of congress is not surrounded with the panoply of protective shields that are present in criminal case an accused member is judged by specifically articulated standards and is at the mercy of an almost unbridled discretion of the charging body from whose decisions there is established right of review see also powell v mccormack 395 us 486 1969 where the court did examine house exclusion proceedings because the congressional action there ruling on members extraneous qualifications for office offended other express constitutional provisions

the case would be nonjusticiable and if this were an expulsion case i would think that justiciable controversy were presented 395 us at 553 19 united states v ballin 144 us 1 1892 20 united states v

1966procedures that it uses and the courts w ould not review such procedures absent conflict with another specific section of the constitution in ternal ethics matters and procedures regarding enforcement of standa rds of official conduct and decorum are similarly matters that have been expressly assigned within the constitution to each house of congress absent violations of other express constitutional guarantees these matters and the procedures establishe d by each house with respect to them are within the discretion of each house and it is possible that the federal courts would similarly find that they involve such matters for which there is established right of review by the courts18 the specific procedures adopted by eith er house in investigating and fact finding in disciplinary matters are as noted above undertaken as an exercise of the rulemaking authority of each house under the rulemaking authority expressly committed to each house of congress in th constitution the legislature has broad discretion for establishing for itself the pa rticular procedures that it will use in its internal processes19 the supreme court has explained the constitution empowers each house to determine the rules of its proceedings it may not by its rules ignore constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights and there should be reasonable relation between the mode or method of proceeding established by the rule and the result which is sought to be attained but within these lim itations all matters of method are open to the determination of the house and it is impeachment of the rule to say that some other way would be better more accurate or even more just it is continuous power always subject to be exercised by the house and within the limitations suggested absolute and beyond the challenge of any other body or tribunal20 within the constitutional framework of each houses authority to punish its own members and to make its own rules for its proceedings it is not clear that either house of congress or both houses would be prohibited by the constitution from assigning such tasks as initial investigations fact finding and the making

report to the ppropriate standing committees in the house and senate statemen ts or findings concerning alleged ethical violations making findings recommenda tions or referrals concerning member of congress and ethical viola tions appears not to be puni shment or discipline in this process but rather merely factfinding exercise in preliminary stage that is for example finding that sufficient evidence exists that there is probability eg probable cause that particular member has violated ethical standards any statement findings conclusions or refe rrals to the appropriate house or senate committee would then be adjudged by members of congress on the respective ethics committee in the first instance and then if any institutional discipline or punishment is to be given member of congress such action must be taken on the floor by the members of the full house or senate since the entire exercise of authority to actually punish members fo r misconduct appears to be retained by each house of the congress in this process such factfinding and preliminary findings process employed would arguably entail valid exercise of congresss rulemaking authority to adopt the procedures

but to protect the integrity of the legislative process by insuring the independence of individual legislators see also kilbourne v thompson 103 us 168 1881 27 powell v mccormack 395 us 486 503 1969

immunity an even thornier question concerning the delegation of authority to an outside or independent entity for ethics investigations and enforcement however may be the practical issue of the speech or bate immunity of mbers of congress under article i section 6 cl 1 of the us constitution senators and representatives for any speech or deba in either house shall not be questioned in any other place members of congress may therefore not be questioned and made to answer in any other place for their official legislative activities which are covered by the speech or debate privilege that is generally legislative conduct or activities that are an integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes by which members participate in committee and house or senate proceedings with respect to the consideration and passage or rejection of proposed legislation25 the framing within the constitution of this absolute immunity for members of the national legislature with regard to th eir official legisla tive activities and conduct was to help assure that the legislature would be coequal independent branch of government by preventing intimidation of legislators by the executive and accountability before hostile judiciary26 and is seen within our representational form of government as performing the important function of ensuring that legislators are free to represent the intere sts of their constituents without fear that they will later be called to task in the courts for that representation27 the immunity granted in the speech or debate clause in article i section 6 highlights the practical importance of the provision in the constitu tion providing the specific countervailing grant of authority to each house of congress to discipline and punish its own members in article i section 5 this authority for each house to discipline its own members would extend even to protected legislative conduct since an internal disciplinary matter in the house or senate regarding representative or senator respectively is not questioning in any other place but rather is in that place as such in addition to providing each house with tool necessary to protect the integrity of its own proceedings article i section 5 clause 2 provides that there is some place other than merely the vo ting booth that members of congress could be made to answer for behavior and misconduct in re lation to internal official legislative activities28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33790crs11 28 continued speech or debate clause was intended to free the congress and individual members from possible harassment and usurpations by other br anches of the government however each member of congress would enjoy full license to misuse his congressional immunity if each house were not given correlative powers and responsibilities to police members behavior 29 senate select committee on ethics v packwood 845 fsupp 17 22 ddc 1994 stay pending appeal denied 510 us 1319 1994since the clause refers to speech or debate in either house and then provides that for such speech or debate in either house members are not able to be questioned in any other place there is an inference that such other place would be outside of the previous referred to either house if this were the case then an entity which is not part of the structure of the hous or the senate that is which is not the institution itself or one of its duly constituted committees might conceivably be any other place to which the immunity would apply this would provide substantial and perhaps insurmountable obstacl to internal ethics investigations and enforcement actions dealing with any legislative activity of member of congress which is covered by the clause problem that an internal ethics committee made up of either representatives in the hous or senators i n the senate does not confront if however the place that the phrase any other place refers to is merely considered to be the entire legislative bran ch under the theory that the purpose of the clause was to protect individual legislator s and thus the integrity of the national legislature from intimidation and control of the executive and judicial branches of government then it could be possible th at joint commission or an independent entity in the legislative branch may be fficiently inside as to overcome speech or debate challenges to its questioning of members and to the delivery and compilation of evidence that the entity might attempt to compel regarding what would otherwise be protected covered gislative conduct certainly however the more independent an entity is from the house and the senate the greater the possibility would appear that the entity would be considered an outside entity and not part of either house of congress there appears to be specific judicial decision or case law that is precisely on point as to this particular issue that is whether proceedings in legislative entity other than duly constituted committee of the house or the senate or the house or senate itself would be considered in any other place in which member could not be questioned concerning hi s or her protected covered legislative conduct in one federal court case involving an internal investigation of ited states senator however the court there appeared to lend some credibility to the proposition that only duly constituted committee of either house acting for the house or senate itself would have the authority to question and br ing to task member of that body for official legislative conduct the united stat district

and functi ons of an independent commission or body in the legislative branch concerning the filing and oversight of lobbying disclosure reports and registrations by outside private lobbyists who are required presently to file and register with the clerk of the h ouse and the secretary of the senate under the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 as ame nded such commission could be the repository for

of law to appropriate law enforcement authorities or congressional committees with respect to ethics enforcement that is investigation and forcement of congressi onal ethics standards and complaints concerning members of the house nd senate however depending on the independence of such commissi on from the house and senate and from the direct control of members of the house and senate the question of speech or debate immunity of members of congre ss may arise to provide substantial impediment to enforcement factfinding and ethics oversight activities when they concern protected

office the office of congressional ethics is considered independent because the office is to be managed and supervised by board which although appointed by current members of the house six bo ard members jointly agreed upon by the speaker and the minority leader recommending three members each w ill be chosen entirely from among outside persons that is persons who are not currently members or employees of the house of repr esentatives or any other current federal official furthermore former memb er of congress may only serve on the board after being out of office for at least one year and board members are to agree not to run for elective federal office for three years after service on the board32 of significance to the independence of the board is the fact that board members do not serve at will of those who appointed them but rather may be removed only for cause and only upon joint nd bipartisan agreement of both the speaker and the minority leader33 as noted by the task force in the majority report on the proposal among the goals of the task force was to introduce an independent review element by nonmembers34 although some commentators have criticized the concept of an independentnonmember office or commi ssion involved in legislative ethics enforcement as an abdication or shirking by the house of its express constitutional responsibilities and role of forcing legislative disciplin other commentators have criticized the office of cong ressional ethics from differe nt direction that is that the new ethics office is not structurally separate nor completely independent or autonomous from the house of representatives it is argued in this latter criticism that the issues of conflicting loyalties and the ability to exercise independent and impartial judgment may continue to be raised in the case of an entity part of the house and whose members are appointed by mbers of the house in assessing the independence of any board or office that is to be involved in the investigation enforcement and review of internal sta ndards and rules of c onduct within the house of representatives attention must be given to the constitutional issues raised by the

the house of representatives would incur in attempting to question member about conduct relating to members official duties35 functions and duties the principal function and duty of the oce is to provide an independent preliminary screening of ethi cs or conduct allegations ag ainst members and staff to determine whether such allegations which must bear on the performance of official duties and the discharge of official responsibilities of members or staff36 have sufficient merit that they should be form ally investigated by the house committee on standards of official conduct alt hough there are specific provisions for formal complaints from parties outside of congress the oce may initiate preliminary review of any matter relevant to offici misconduct of members or staff upon written request of two members of the office as long as the two members are appointed by diffe rent political party leaders in the house thus insuring some bipartisanship before initiating review of conduct37 after 30day preliminary review of the matter under consideration secondphase review of 45 days may occur if three members of the oce affirmatively vote to continue review38 if there is affirmative vote to continue the review of matter will terminate aftera 30day preliminary review after the preliminary and secondphase review are completed the oce may transmit to the standing ethics

making of any such recommendation subject s of oce review are to be allowed to make presentations orally or in writing to the board40 in reporting and referring matters to the house committee on

regarding the validity of the allegations upon which the referral is ba sed and may not opine as to the guilt or innocence of the individua l who is the subject of the

formal investigation of allegations or complaints and any referrals or recommendations for congressional discipline made to the house itself will thus continue to be exclusively within the jurisdiction of the house committee on standards of official conduct it is of course possible that conduct matter that the new office considers substantive upon recommendation to the house committee on standards for further review could still as critics have argued be buried stonewalled or not acted upon by the members of the house who make up the house committee on standards as there is requirement for the committ ee to conduct such investigation or to make any disciplinary reco mmendations upon matter referred to it from the oce42 there is thus still the potential for socalled partisan gridlock where the house committee on standards evenly divided between majority and minority party memb ers could not agree by the required majority of the members to proceed on ma tter however because there will be recommendation from the new office of congre ssional ethics to further investigate matter and because such report from the oce to the standards committee will be made public within certain limited time frame if the standards committee does not act on the matter or the committees vote is inconsistent with the recommendation of the board43 there might be more public and political pressure on the members who make up the standards committee to act on matter that an independent non member board has conclude d merits investigation among its express duties and responsib ilities the oce is not authorized to provide advice and interpretati on of the rules of the house and would thus need to rely upon the members and the staff of the house committee on standards for such interpretations and whether any particular conduct would rise to violation under the current interpretations and specific advice given by committee staff in addition to not offering advice and interpretation the new office of congressional ethics may not discipline any member or staff employee and may not issue any reprimand reproval or other judgment concerning conduct critics ve raised this issue as potential failing point of the duties re sponsibilities and independence of the proposed entity however if an independe nt entity were to punish members for official misconduct in such way there would certainly be issues raised about delegation to nonmember body the house s constitutional authority as well as the houses constitutional responsibility to punish its own memb ers under article i section 5 cl 244 outside complaints the resolution establishing the oce does not provide or set up any formal mechanism or specific proce dure for the filing or acceptan ce of ethics complaints or allegations from outside sources that is from groups organizations or individuals who are not current members of the house although specific procedure or mechanism is established

review of ethics allegations on its own such actions may be taken upon the written notification of any two members of the board as long as one member had been nominated by the speaker and one by the

house rules to the committee on standards of official conduct subpoena authority in screening and evaluating allegations of misconduct in both its preliminary review and its later secondphase re view the oce may ask for and gather information and receive testimony from parties46 but it does not have the authority to subpoena material or witn esses to force cooperation furthermore the oce is not given the authority to ask the house co mmittee on standards to issue subpoena on its behalf this lack of subpoena aut hority has been one of the focal points of criticisms of the task force proposal47 for those persons who are providing or forwarding allegations of misconduct there is ample incentive of course to provide to the oce any and all material evidence and documents supporting co mplaint or allegation so that such allegations would not be dis missed out of hand even fo r members or staff who are the targets or subjects of an initial review of allegations there appears to be some incentive to cooperate with the oce and significant disincentive to be uncooperative and appear obs tructionist such noncoope ration and lack of candor could at least theoretically be considered by staff and board members of the oce indicative of something to hide and t hus somewhat supportive of the substance of the underlying allegations at least to the extent that they would warrant further review by the committee furthermore such noncooperati on and obstructionist actions themselves could c onstitute conduct that might po ssibly be included in the grounds for referral to the house co mmittee on standards and have been grounds upon which congressional ethics probe s have proceeded in the past48 specifically in referring matter to the house committee on standards the oce is to describe the relevant information that it was ble to obtain and witnesses whom it washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33790crs17 49 hres 895 section 1c2ciii 50 hres 895 section 1c1b 51 hres 895 section 1c2a 52 there are legal issues concerning whether an independent board in the house made up of persons who are not members of the house may be granted subpoena authority by simple resolution the vehicle establishing this office or whether such authority as in the past in the case of task forces and commissions must be given by statute 53 subsequent to the introduction of hres 895 other alternative proposals have been made including hres 1003 and hres 1018 the principal mechanism for change in hres 1003 110th congress would have been to add four persons who are not elected members of or territorial delegates to the house but rather are former house members to full membership on the current standing co mmittee on ethics the house committee on standards of official conduct such nonme mbers selected by the speaker and the minority leader would have the same powers and privileges as the other members of the committee but could not act as chairman alt hough committee of the house such as the house committee on standards of fficial conduct could clearly employ staff to assist the committee in carrying out its functions and could use an outside counsel an advisory committee or task force made up of nonme mbers or combination of members and non members to assist the committee in its investigative work factfinding and to make recommendations there are certain constitutiona l issues which may be raised concerning the appointment of persons who are not elected members or territorial delegates to membership on congressional committee to exercise the constitutional functions of the house delegated to it by house rules see eg michel v anderson 14 f 3d 623 630 dccir 1994 the appellees for their part forthrightly concede that the house could not permit persons other than the traditional legates to perform the role currently played by the delegates it would thus not be open to the house to authorize by rule say the mayors of the 100 largest cities to serve and vote on house committees hres 1018 110th congress would establish in the house an independent commission known as the house ethics co mmission made up of six current members of the house and six former members of the house having the six republican members and former members appointed by the democratic leader and the six democratic members and former members appointed by the repub lican leader such commission would have broad authority comparable to the current sta nding ethics committee to investigate alleged continuedunable to interview and the reasons for such inability or failure to do so along with any recommendations for the i ssuance of subpoenas where appropriate49 additionally the preliminary and sec ondphase review process which is intended to be of short dura tion may more readily meet ch expectations if the oce is without subpoena authority as noted the process engaged in by the oce is intended only to be an expeditious initial screening or initiation process and the preliminary review of the oce is to be completed within 30 calendar days50 if the oce votes by affirmative vote of four members to move onto secondphase review such review is to be completed within 45 days of initiation which can be extended by 14 more days upon affirmativ vote of majority of the board51 the issuance of subpoena52 and if contested the potential litigation through the courts in attempting to quash such subpoena or to require more specificity would invariably entail substantial delay of this initial process and make the timeliness requirements and thresholds far more difficult to meet53httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33790crs18 53 continued violations to hold hearings and take testimony to issues subpoenas and to report directly to the house findings and recommendations fo r discipline additionally this commission would be authorized on its own accord to issu any letter of reproval or admonition to sitting member of the house it may be not ed that certain powers and functions of such proposed commission such as the power to issue subpoena on behalf of the house which are delegated in this proposal to nonmembers by simple resolution as opposed to delegation by law may raise unique and unprecedented issues on the delegation of such authority generally when such authority is provided to nonmember bodies such as legislative task forces and commissions such aut hority is provided in law see for example the 911 commission authorization in intelligen ce authorization act for fiscal year 2003 pl 107306 605a2ii iii 116 stat 2383
