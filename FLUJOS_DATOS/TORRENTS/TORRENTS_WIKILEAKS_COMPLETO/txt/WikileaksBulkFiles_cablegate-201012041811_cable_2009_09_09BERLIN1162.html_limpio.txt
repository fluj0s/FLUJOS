next foreign minister the world according to fdp chairman guido westerwelle ref berlin 594 classified by ministercounselor for political affairs george glass fo r reasons 14 b and d summary 1 cnf free democratic party fdp chairman guido westerwelle may be on the verge of becoming foreign minister and vicechancellor in christian democratic union cduchristian social union csufdp government after the parliamentary elections on september 27 he has strong craving for political power and recognition after spending eleven years in opposition westerwelle previewed his foreign and security policy objectives and views in major speech at the german council on foreign relations dgap on may 4 speech for which the media nicknamed him guido genscher playing on westerwelles ideological leanings and close relationship with former fdp foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 2 cnf westerwelles dgap remarks provided us with glimpse of westerwellian thought they were short on substance suggesting that westerwelles command of complex foreign and security policy issues still requires deepening if he is to successfully represent german interests on the world stage see reftel while he is transatlanticist westerwelle questions the breadth of us power and us calls for stronger german engagement he also harbors resentment that he has not been taken more seriously by the washington political establishment note embassy will report septel on more detailed foreign policy implications for the us of westerwelleled mfa end summary westerwelles foreign policy priorities 3 c westerwelles most important foreign policy priorities will be focused on global disarmament and arms control in remarks in schwerin on september 17 westerwelle called again for the removal of all us tactical nuclear weapons within the context of negotiations with nato from german soil he was very critical of the bush administrations missile defense plans but was quick to praise president obamas recent announcement on missile defense saying this move created additional international confidence westerwelle remains committed transatlanticist but he has been consistently cautious of committing german troops to outofarea deployments afghanistan was the exception westerwelle continues to support germanys isaf mandate but he has also indicated that the fdp wants to bring german troops home from afghanistan as soon as possible provided the mission has been successfully completed westerwelle and the fdp support close engagement with russia and see it as strategic partner westerwelle has pursued close ties with russias leadership during his eleven years in opposition on iran westerwelle has talked about the need for dialogue but his partys probusiness orientation makes him particularly skeptical of sanctions and resistant to unilateral efforts to cut back trade the unlikely foreign minister 4 cnf by his own admission westerwelle has never seriously harbored fascination for international affairs fdp bundestag member marina schuster told poloff recently that foreign policy is not westerwelles true love but that he will take this position due to its high profile and as it is tied to the position of vicechancellor fdp contacts tell us that he plans to remain foreign policy generalist which suggests he will have plenty of time to wax lyrical on domestic politics to the potential detriment of political harmony in possible future cducsufdp coalition he also finds very appealing the prospect of being one of the only cabinet members besides the chancellor who can choose his media advisors which suggests that westerwelle will continue to place great emphasis on cultivating his public image 5 cnf there is contrast between westerwelles increased public support and successful leadership of the fdp versus the continued skepticism often bordering on contempt shown by much of the german foreign policy elite toward him opinion polls show that westerwelles public image has improved substantially in the last year in particular but as one well known foreign policy analyst in berlin told poloff he lacks the gravitas and is seen as too berlin 00001162 002 of 004 opportunistic to be trusted as foreign minister at the conclusion of his dgap speech several mfa desk officers remarked to poloff that they were not yet persuaded that westerwelle had the foreign and security policy expertise necessary to become successful foreign minister although they had doubts about his ability to get up to speed quickly there was consensus among desk officers driven perhaps by political bias that westerwelle was arrogant and too fixated on maintaining his cult of personality negative reaction to his dgap speech reflects the foreign policy communitys skepticism of westerwelle hes genscher 6 cnf like dan quayle in 1992 westerwelle wants to compare himself to his mentor hansdietrich genscher but in the eyes of the foreign policy community he is genscher nevertheless westerwelles worldviews have to large extent been shaped by genscherism british academic timothy garton ash described genscherism as an attempt to maintain and improve germanys ties with wide range of states which were themselves pursuing quite different and quite contrary objectives this complex balancing act involved saying somewhat different things in different places genscherism also embraced foreign policy culture of restraint while emphasizing the models of cooperation and continuity in german foreign policy which westerwelle discussed in his may 4 speech at the dgap genschers culture of restraint had profound influence on westerwelles thinking thus making him very skeptical about committing germanys armed forces to overseas military operations note afghanistan was an exception although with the caveat that germanys area of responsibility there would remain limited to the north and would concentrate on police training and civil reconstruction efforts septel end note transatlanticist with twist 7 cnf at the june 30 meeting westerwelle quickly confirmed his transatlanticist credentials westerwelles views on the united states role in the world however also defines his brand of transatlanticism according to westerwelles political biographer majid sattar westerwelle has never been able to shake his skepticism about how the united states wields power in the world citing an exchange with former us ambassador to germany richard burt 19851989 sattar recalls how westerwelle forcefully intervened in discussion the ambassador was having on us foreign policy during the cold war to say but you are not the police of the world sattar comments further that westerwelle was immune to any transatlantic brainwashing although westerwelle used his dgap speech to criticize the united states under the bush administration for its excessive focus on the war on terror and unilateralism saying that the united states had lost its compass more than once westerwelle quickly changed his tune when he talked about the positive impact that president obama has had on us foreign policy since his election 8 cnf westerwelle also made clear that he believes germany needs to be more engaged in us policymaking he criticized chancellor merkel for not having been more engaged with washington on issues of mutual interest especially arms control when washington has been engaged in extensive policy reviews he suggested that the fdp would quickly fill the vacuum should they enter government westerwelle to washington what about 9 cnf westerwelle has found it hard to conceal his resentment toward washington based on his feeling that neither its top leadership nor the embassy in berlin had courted him during his time in opposition at june 30 meeting between the former cda and westerwelle he criticized the bush administration for its failure to seek political dialogue with him also revealing was westerwelles slight edge on his sense of humor first charming us by inquiring about secretary clintons health after her elbow injury and next joking that he would ask the secretary if the embassy had conveyed his best wishes 10 cnf partially due to his insistence on only highlevel meetings in washington and therefore limited contact westerwelle remains relatively unknown political figure in the us although he has traveled there many times unlike his future potential cabinet colleague berlin 00001162 003 of 004 christian social union csu economics minister karltheodor zu guttenberg westerwelle has little professional experience in the united states since he never made extensive efforts to introduce himself to the washington policy community unfortunately our attempts to reach out to westerwelle were often rebuffed with the excuse that he would only meet the ambassador only after extensive embassy negotiations with westerwelles staff were former cda and poloff able to secure the june 30 meeting comment 11 cnf one week before the parliamentary elections polls indicate that westerwelle stands good chance of becoming germanys next foreign minister position he has been preparing for since 2002 if westerwelle becomes foreign minister we can expect tough love diplomacy from someone who prides himself in being our close friend but who in reality remains skeptical about the us and its foreign policy objectives westerwelle will be friend but he will not hesitate to criticize us if vital german interests are at stake or being challenged westerwelles prickliness toward the united states would likely be neutralized by the longsought attention from washington he would receive if he becomes foreign minister germanys foreign policy elite will continue to view him with skepticism the factor that assuages some of this concern however is that one expects him to be able to match chancellor merkel if he does become foreign minister and policy experts tell us that foreign policy influence is likely to shift even further to the chancellery end comment bio notes 12 u dr guido westerwelle was born on december 27 1961 in bad honnef near bonn to dr heinrich and erika westerwelle family members note that westerwelle inherited the unbridled aggressive temperament of his father and the calculated deliberate and hesitant cleverness of his mother his parents divorced when he was 8 years old which according to westerwelle himself left scar on his educational and physical development after the divorce westerwelle was raised by his father lawyer and he maintained close relationship with his mother also career lawyer who lived nearby stefan and henrik guidos half brothers one from each of his parents previous relationships were older and soon left the house to live on their own westerwelle grew up with his younger brother kai they were very similar and both were considered active extroverts who enjoyed debates westerwelle enjoys horses and to this day he is an avid equestrian 13 sbu westerwelle is openly gay he has said that this was not problem at home since he was raised to be selfconfident and his family was very liberal in addition bonn where westerwelle went to university was liberal town westerwelle officially came out rather quietly in the political world in 2005 at merkels 50th birthday party when he brought his partner michael mronz sports manager to the party mronz is currently steering board member of the 2009 berlin world track and field world championships ironically westerwelle is conservative on gay rights he is keen to protect the special status of marriages and families under german law he opposes adoption by same sex couples but says that he wishes he could have children 14 u westerwelle developed an early taste for politics being the editor of his high school newspaper he caused school controversy when he named teachers who he felt did not respect students who had transferred into the secondary high school system from the grammar school system as result of his story many teachers developed dislike for westerwelle he further developed his political thinking when he attended an event with hansdietrich genscher and otto graf lambsdorff during the 1980 parliamentary elections it was at that time that he decided to join the fdp and form an fdp youth group in bonn westerwelle eventually became lawyer but his younger brother kai once said he had the impression that being lawyer was never his brothers real goal his understanding of the media and their use for his own political purposes is envied by many politicians he takes proactive approach to overseeing his partys media operations in front of the camera westerwelle comes across as serious sharp and calculating and almost comical at times with what is perceived as very exaggerated presence in person people say westerwelle is very gallant funny and sarcastic berlin 00001162 004 of 004 15 u in his free time westerwelle enjoys attending concerts and reading he enjoys running beach volleyball sailing horseback riding and mountain biking he collects paintings from new leipzig school artists such as neo rauch and tim eitel and is fond
