security highway and rail modes summary hundreds of thousands of trucks nd railroad tank cars transport tons of hazardous materials h azmat daily there is virt ually an unlimited number of ways that these shipments are at risk from attack by terrorists by implementing layered system of measures affecting shippers carriers and drivers many in the public and private sectors seek to reduce ssociated security risks this system involve s incident prevention preparedness and response major challenge is to increase cost effectively the security of th shipments especially those that pose the most danger to the public while still meeting to the extent possible the transportation requirements of commerce the 109th congress is considering legislation such as hr 3 hr 153 hr 909 hr 1109 and hr 1414 and s 230 which includes provisions intended to pr omote hazmat transportation security the departments of trans portation dot and home land security dhs have taken numerous actions to enhance the s ecurity of hazmat transportation for example dot requires shippers and carriers to implement security plans regarding specified hazmat transportation dot gran ts encourage states to conduct inspections of trucks transporting hazmat also do t has contacted thousands of companies seeking to improve their security programs and also has established communication links with industry dhs conveys threat information to law enforcement and industry and conducts vulne rability assessments dhs administers grant that provides training and the communications infrastructure which facilitates truck drivers and others to repor t safety and potential security concerns dhs seeks to determine whether commercial drivers pose security threat necessitating denial of their hazmat endorsement on their commercial drivers licenses despite these efforts there remain many vulnerabilities in the current layered system of hazmat transportation security measures at co st much more could be done to expand the scope strengthen the rigor and accelerate the pace of the federal role in this area hr 153 and hr 1109 include provi sion that would require the dhs to prepare vulnerability assessment of freight rail transportation and to identify security risks that are specific to the transportation of hazmats by rail hr 153 would provide grants to address threats pertaining to the security of hazmat transportation by rail hr 909 would establish research program intended to advance security measures for hazmat tr ansportation hr 3 which the house has passed includes provision intended to ensure that mexican and canadian domiciled truck drivers transporting specified hazmat loads in the united states are subject to background check similar to that required of us drivers other options include increased security awareness training for state truck inspectors and certain employees of truck leasing companies nd requiring enhanced security plans and communication systems for carriers of high hazard materials shipments beyond those now required each of these options poses co sts that need to be evaluated within the context of other investments this report deals only with hazmat

final rule march 25 2003 68 fr 14510 hazardous materials transportation security highway and rail modes the challenge and reality introduction hundreds of thousands of trucks and ra il tank cars transport tons of hazardous materials hazmat daily these cargoes have the potential to be instruments or targets of terror hazmat shipments can be attacked or hijacked by terrorists intercepted hazmat shipments that are poi sonous infectious radioactive flammable or explosive can be used to harm larg groups of people also hazmats can be maliciously released to attack buildings and critical infrastructure the department of transportation dot asserts that secu rity threats specifically targeting hazmat transportation are real and ongoing1 the security of such shipments especia lly those that can be used as weapons of mass destruction is attrac ting much attention by the transportation community governmental officials emergency res ponders and terrorists many in the public and private sectors seek to reduce risk by establishing layered or reinforcing system of measures affecting companies drivers and shipments this system involves incident prevention preparedness and response inspection of commercial drivers and vehicles regulation of the s ecurity aspects of transportation operations including routing securityoriented tr aining of employees and planning and training for emergency response are key activities major challenge is to cost effectively increase the security of these shipments especially those that pose the most danger to the public while still meeting to the extent possible the transportation requireme nts of commerce this report provides ge neral overview of hazmat tr ansportation security and focuses on the federal role the report firs t summarizes an array of key governmental activities that might be encompassed in layered system of security enhancements this theoretical system is then compared to summary of the status of current federal governmental efforts more specifically the report outlines illustrative key actions taken by the dot and the department of homeland security dhs to promote hazmat security in surface transportati on the report then summarizes some concerns associated with the federal effort in promoting hazmat transportation security specifically commenting on the adequacy of some dhs and dot effortshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs2 as well as routing preno tification and research cerns finally the report presents ten options that might be c onsidered to further strengthen hazmat transportation security this report does not address private sector efforts to promote hazmat security and does not cover the special security measures associated with the transportation of highlevel nuclear shipments furthe rmore this report deals only with hazmat security in the rail and highway modes theory and reality there is virtually an unlimited number of ways that the hazmat transportation system is at risk from attack by terrorists rail track or signals can be sabotaged tank trucks and rail cars can be attacked and poisonous gases can be released estimates indicate that there are over one million hazmat shipments per day in the united states simply put there are too many points of vulnerability to ensure security during hazmat transportation nevertheless decision makers are asking what is the federal government doing to promote hazmat transportation security what are the shortcomings of the current security safe guards are the dot and the dhs taking prudent timely and cost effective measur to promote hazmat transportation security and what other effective m easures could these department s implement at reasonable cost this report provides insight into each of these areas of concern instead of ensuring security layer ed approach whic h marshals different reinforcing measures to promote hazmat secu rity is gradually being deployed this system includes private sector initia tives underpinned or supplemented with governmental efforts such as research outreach directives advisories and regulations this layered approach does not absolutely ensure security but it enhances security by marsha ling different approaches the theory what are some key governmental components that might be included in layered system of security measures in theory initiatives that might be implemented include indepth and re liable background checks or security threat assessments of drivers transporting certain loads of hazmat special permits required for carriers of highhazard materials to ensure that they have achieved specified levels of safety and security effective and definitive securityoriented training requirements for hazmat employees and requirements for adequately enforced carefully designed security plans and procedures for certain hazmat transportation operations such system would be ove rseen by cadre of federal and state inspectors also planning and training gr ants might be obligated to help prepare emergency responders in case th ere is release of hazmat grants to train and enable the transportation community to alert officials to possible terrorist threats might also be included in this theoretical system routing of high hazard shipments might be designed to appropriately balance safe ty security emergency response and operational or logistical concerns the reality as discussed in detail in the next section and summarized in table 1 below the dot and dhs have taken numerous actions intended to increase the security of specified hazmat shipments httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs3 2 any driver person or regulated entity that might be subject to safety or security regulations or directives including those pe rtaining to hazmat transportation chemical or biological materials or agents determined by the secretary of health and human services or the attorney general as being threat to the national security of the united states the commercial drivers license or the hazmat ndorsement should not rely on this report but instead should consult and follow official and cu rrent regulatory information or directivestable 1 summary status of dot and dhs efforts2 activity status security threat assessments of specified commercial drivers including indepth background checksdhs administers initial process implemented first cycle of fingerprintbased checks likely to be completed during 2010 evolving program challenges remain special hazmat permits for certain carriers dot requires for specified highway carriers but relatively new process securityoriented training regulations dot requiressecurity plans dot requires for specified hazmat carriers and shippers but specificity and criteria for plans could be substantially enhanced resulting in additional costs to some companies routing requirements variety of routing requirements exist but comprehensive national routing system for all hazmat shipments that requires evaluations and tradeoffs of detailed safety security logistics and economic costs and benefits grants to improve planning for and emergency response to hazmat releases dot administers grant to improve communications and reporting of safety and potential security concerns dhs administers comprehensive securityoriented audits dots primary emphasis remains on safety compliance with dots hazmat transportation regulations pertaining to security is now enforced primarily by dot personnel dhs does not have permanent field capability in this area dedicated full time to cargo inspection but dhs does conduct few assessments of high risk corridors in the rail mode source congressional research servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs4 3 many of dots hazmat responsibilities were previously conducted by the research and special programs administration rspa this agency within dot longer exists and rspas hazmat responsibilities were transferred to the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsain sum dot and dhs have administered millions of dollars of various types of grants to assist state inspectors industry and emergency responders spent millions of dollars planning and implementing programs and issuing security oriented proposals or regu lations and required the tr ansportation industry and commercial hazmat drivers to spend much larger sums to comply with federal requirements through these and other actions described in detail later in this report dot and dhs working with industry are creating layered system of security measures whether the scope rigor and pace of these actions is adequate or not is subject to debate survey of illustrative dot and dhs activities dot and dhs both have important responsibilities in promoting hazmat transportation security presented belo w is survey of illustrative dot and dhs activities although this discussion presents each of these departments activities under separate headings it is important to remember that they do consult with each other and seek to coordinate activities dot activities the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 states that the dot secretary is to prescribe re gulations for the safe trans portation including security of hazmats in intrastate interstate and foreign commerce dot maintains that addressing security concerns should be part of an overall strategy to manage the risk of hazmats during transportation differe nt modal administrations in dot have conducted an array of activitie s to promote hazmat transportation security among the most significant actions are dots vis its to thousands of hazmat carriers and issuance of the security planning and training regulations and permit requirements mentioned below dots federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa federal railroad administra tion fra and the pipelin and hazardous materials safety administrations phmsa are key participants in promoting the security of hazmat transportation in the surface mode3 fmcsa has influenced security efforts through direct contacts with industry enhanced regulatory requirements grants to state motor carrier safety officers diverse training and operational testing of security measures for example this agency has conducted more than 37 000 vis its to hazmat trucking companies to provide technical assistance intended to nhance the security of their operations since april 2003 fmcsa has conducted more than 850 security contact reviews during which its specialists seek to determine whether motor carriers security plan and security training procedures comply with federal regulations enforcement actions have resulted from these reviews furthermore fmcsa requires truckinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs5 4 for additional information see for example httpwwwfmcsadotgovrulesregsfmcsrfinal0414654_hazmat_safety_permitshtm fmcsa states motor carrier must meet cert ain conditions to receive this special permit including motor carrier must have satis factory security program in place and must be registered with phmsa satisfactory secur ity program consists of 1 security plan as prescribed in 49 cfr part 172 subpart i 2 means of communication that will enable the vehicle operator to contact the motor carrier during the course of transportation and 3 means of providing hazardous materials empl oyees with security training as required in 49 cfr part 172 5 httpwwwfmcsadotgovsafetyprogshmsecurity_plan_guidepdf 6 according to phmsa the security plan must include an assessment of possible transportation security risks for shipments of specified hazmats and appropriate measures to address such risks the plan must incl ude various components including measures to confirm job application information provided by specified employees to address the continuedcompanies transporting shipme nts of certain highly zardous materials to obtain special hazmat safety permit4 fmcsa has stated that the permit is needed because certain highly hazardous materi als should they be released in crashes or attacked by terrorists would be more dangerous than some other hazmats fmcsa also has provided enforcement grants to border states to enhance inspection of hazmat shipments entering the united states so fmcsa sponsored an evaluation of variety of technologies intended to enhan ce security eg systems to track trucks transporting hazmats and ways to stop th vehicles in case of hijack more specifically fmcsa supported an operati onal test involving about 100 trucks equipped with an array of securityorien ted technologies this on the road experiment assessed the costs and benefits of various security enhancing technologies and communication systems to ascertain oppor tunities for further advances also this agency issued guide to developing an effective security plan for the highway transportation of hazardous materials whic h was developed by battelle and totalsecurityus5 in addition fmcsa has provided training to its safety specialists to increase their knowledge of the federa l transportation security re gulations this dot modal administration is also delivering short course to police officers entitled trucks and terrorism the course is intended to help police officers recognize suspicious activity pertaining to trucking operation eg shipping oranges into florida during their orange harvesting season or suspic ious action of driver that may indicate terrorist intent fmcsa s developed an extensive communicationsnotification system as well that reaches hundreds of thousands of drivers and thousands of companies regarding possible security threats and other securityrelated information fmcsa has warned industry of heightened security situations and provides alerts regarding specific vehicles or shipments dots pipeline and hazardous materi als safety administration phmsa formerly part of the research and special programs administration rspa requires each regulated entity person or company which offers or transports in commerce specified hazmats to develop and implement security plans6 some in industryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs6 6 continued assessed risk that unauthorized persons may gain access to the hazardous materials covered by the security plan or transport conveyances being prepared for transportation of the hazardous materials covered by the security plan and to address the assessed security risks of shipments of hazardous materials cove red by the security plan route from origin to destination including shipments stored incidental to movement 7 personal communication with various hazmat industry officials 2004 8 personal communication with dot 2005 9 for example phmsa regulation states that by certain date each hazmat employee must receive training that provides an awaren ess of security risks associated with hazardous materials transportation and methods designed to enhance transportation security this training must also include component cove ring how to recognize and respond to possible security threats after march 25 2003 new hazmat employees must receive the security awareness training required by this paragraph within 90 days after employment also phmsa regulation states by december 22 2003 each hazmat employee of person required to have security plan in accordance with subpart i of this part must be trained concerning the security plan and its implementation security training must include company security objectives specific security procedures employee responsibilities actions to take in the event of security breach and the orga nizational security structure for additional information see for example 49 cfr 172704 training requirements 10 httphazmatdotgovriskmgmtrmsefrmsefhtmconsider dots rule on security plans to be overly broad in its applicability some are concerned that dots assessment of wh ether companys security plan meets federal requirements is too subjective7 this dot regulation covers wide array of companies including those offering or tran sporting load of hazmat that needs to be placarded thus this regulation covers much of the hazmat industry according to spokesman the dot has chosen not to be too prescriptive in its security plan regulation and instead within the genera l framework of what is required expects each company to develop and implement appropriate measures tailored to its specific operating conditions and commodities being transported8 phmsa also requires that security awar eness training must be provided by specified date to all hazmat employees and that employees of companies required to prepare security plan must receive training on the plan9 fmcsa fra and phmsa inspectors are seeking to promote compliance with these regulations and state that they are bringing enforcement actions against companies that are not in compliance with the security regulations also phmsa has issued framework for risk management applicable to the tran sportation of hazardous materials the product designated as the risk mana gement selfevaluation framework rmsef is intended to help compan ies develop hazmat security plans10 phmsa also administers grant program that provides training to emergency responders dealing with spills of hazmat primarily as result of industry effo rts underpinned by actions taken in partnership with dhs and dot railroad security has tightened since 911 with respect to hazmat transportation by ra il the fra is participating in various government and private sector efforts to conduct review and security risk assessment of hazmat shipments through various major metropolitan areas fra hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs7 provided technical advice to the dhs on ta nk cars and hazmat transportation also fra conducts hazmat training for first re sponders that deals with possible toxic releases due to security or safety issues fra has participated in hazmat security exercises that focused on response to terro rist strikes affectin g all transportation modes in addition fra s conducted more than 1200 insp ections of shippers and railroads to check for compliance with dots hazmat security regulations fras inspection and oversight of rail bridges and track have direct relevance to security concerns also fra provides intelligence sharing with the railroads on security matters dhs activities the dhs is the lead federal departme nt concerned with promoting homeland security dhs activities are wide ranging and may directly or indirectly affect transportation security in general and sometimes hazmat transportation security in particular this partment seeks to reduce threats to transportation infrastructure and operations and improve associated fe deral response to these threats for example dhs conducts threat determina tions assesses vulnera bilities and risk and issues information warnings and advisori as well as develops various security plans and strategies also dhs has issu ed standardized management plan for incident response this department operates the homeland security operations center which serves as the primary nationallevel center for realtime threat monitoring and situational awareness dom estic incident mana gement and related information sharing efforts dhs also runs the homeland security information networkprotected critical infrastructur information program which is communications and alert notifications link allo wing federal state and local officials to exchange information rapidly that pertains to all security issues including hazmat transportation security dhs also administers multifaceted research and development rd program focused on broad range of secur ityoriented technologies or systems some of which have direct bearing on transporta tion of hazmats some areas of research or technology development include technolog to track hazmat shipments improved detection of nuclear mate rials improved emergency response strategies and characterization and reduction of the vulnerability posed by toxic industrial materials in transport sometimes dhs rd is conducted in close c ooperation with dot for example dhs and the fra have s upported research to examine how breaches of tank cars caused by small arms fire might be detected the transportation security administra tion tsa is the key agency within dhs that affects transportation security the aviation and transportation security act provides this agency with broad responsibility and authority for security in all modes of transportation including the aut hority to develop po licies and strategies for dealing with threats to transportation security and to enforce

and dot agree that they share responsibility for hazmat transportation s ecurity in memorandum of understanding mou regarding broad transportation s ecurity responsibilities and communications dot acknowledges that dhs has primary re sponsibility for transportation security and that dot supports dhs by providing technical assistance and helping dhs with its security policies when possible dot retains statutory authority and responsibility for such matters as transporta tion of hazmat including security tsas primary emphasis has been on aviation security with much less attention and money directed at surface transportation concerns thus in terms of resources invested tsa states that it has b een unable to place the focus on hazmat transportation security that is warranted12 tsas activities intended to promote hazmat transportation security are not concentrated in one office but are part of the responsibility of several of its offices tsa maintains that this structure is intended to maximize resources and program effectiveness tsa uses variety of diffe rent approaches seeking to improve the security of hazmat shipments these include planni ng communications research and training activities one of tsas earlier planning activities was to develop document called the sector specific plan ssp for trans portation which is part of the broader national infrastructure protection plan the ssp is intended to 1 identify participants in the transportation sector their roles and relationships and means of communication 2 identify critical transportation assets 3 assess transportation sector vulnerabilities and pr ioritize asse ts 4 identify protective programs 5 measure security performance and 6 prioritize research and development to advance security technologies13 hazmat transportation security however is not considered as separate transportation activity under the ssp but rather this area is encompassed under various modal portions of the plan for security and other reasons this draft plan has not been released to the public some members of congress are particularly interested in vulnerability assessments several bills introduced in the109th congress including hr 153 and hr 1109 include provisions that would re quire the dhs to prepare vulnerability assessment of freight rail transportation and to identify security risks that are specific to the transportation of hazmats by rail with respect to promoting hazmat s ecurity tsa is involved in several informationfocused activities for example tsa routinely communicates with industry representatives and st ate officials about security threats often on weekly basis tsa has conducted num erous briefings for various stakeholders including thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs9 14 written communication from the highway watch program 2005 15 ibidhazmat industry to inform interested parties on relevant s ecurity activities and concerns tsa sponsors an array of outreach and training activities that are intended to promote hazmat transportation security for example tsa dhs has provided about 41 million to the american trucking associations highway watch program this program trains truck dr ivers and various highway wo rkers to identify and report safety incidents and potentia l security threats that occur on roadways funds from this program are also used to link trans portation professionals with law enforcement first responders and the intelligence comm unity via tsas transportation security operations center participants in this program report safet hazards and potential terroristrelated activity in the transportation industry providing rich source of threatrelated human intelligence that is analyzed and channeled to law enforcement national security agencies and industry14 since june 2004 the highway watch call center has res ponded to more than 1415 calls of which more than 200 were reports of suspicious activity that could be construe d as possible preoperational surveillance probing or otherwise abnormal activity within the highway community15 highway watch has trained lmost 50000 participants from all areas of the highway community and plans to train over 450000 during 2005 the highway watch information sharing and analysis center isac issues beon thelookout bolo alerts suspicious inci dent reports various analytical reports and emergency traffic routing advisories tsas role in hazmat security is evolvi ng and many of its efforts are conducted with the direct support of or in consulta tion with the dot for example on august 16 2004 tsa and rspa now phmsa i ssued request for comments and information on the feasibility and impacts of initiating security enhancements regarding rail shipments of toxicbyinhalation tih materials both agencies are examining the need for possible hardening of aspects of the rail transportation system for tih materials and the cost s and benefits of these measures for example these agencies are considering whether to revise temporary storage requirements applicable to rail tank cars transporting tih materials and whether to require removal of identifying marks names stenciling placards or other content indicators from rail tank cars used to transport tih materials an issue is whether alternative means of hazard communication are practicable that would concurrently promote safety emergency response and security some fear that existing communication requirements could help terrorist or criminal identify potential target for harm but many in the em ergency response community want dot to continue to require its hazards communica tions system tsa has sponsored study that bears on this issue also tsa and phmsa are considering how the security plans pertaining to tih materials required by phmsa might be improved and whether and howhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs10 16 department of transportation and depa rtment of homeland security hazardous materials

and railroad industry spokesman 2005 19 as specified in solicitation issued in 2005 the transportation security administration intends to competitively seek offers to accomplish the following 1 identify test and evaluate at least three technically different but commercially available solutions to track trucks in all 50 states 2 develop test and evaluate prototype for centralized truck tracking center 3 develop test and evalua nonproprietary universal interface system or set of protocols that will allow alerts and tracking information to be transmitted from all commercially available tracking systems to prototype truck tracking center 4 evaluate the feasibility of utilizing the developed universal set of protocols or interface system to pass truck tracking information between truck tracking center and 24hour government intelligence operations center 5 provide an independent analysis of the recommendations and validate the results of 2 3 and 4specific criteria for these plans might be required to more adequately address security risks it remains uncertain what actions either tsa andor phmsa will take as result of this august 16 2004 initiative and when such actions might occur this august 16 2004 regulatory announcement suggests that tsa intends to take much more definitive role in promoting the security of these materials in the rail mode more specifically dot and dhss focus on rail is only the first phase in an interdepartmental multi phase effort to assess and secure the transportation of tih in all transportation modes to creat an endtoend secure tih supply chain16 in addition tsa was tasked by the ho meland security c ouncil to conduct rail corridor assessments in eight high threat areas experts from industry fra and others under tsas leadership conduct th analyses which typically include vulnerability assessments analysis of freight operations and buffer zone protection studies as result of this process tsa provides recommendations to industry and governmental officials in the corridor and tries to get cooperation and buyin from various stakeholders to impleme nt the necessary improvements17 t s h s completed its assessment of the washington dc corridor and states that it has made progress on assessing corridors in ohio nd new jersey based on discussions with the railroad industry and tsa dhs has not provided any direct funding to any railroad to improve its security infrastructure in any of these corridors18 tsa however states that there have been secu rity enhancements as result of the rail corridor assessments tsa also is managing pilot project to test various truck tracking technologies and plans to develop test nd evaluate prototype for centralized truck tracking center19 researchers plan to examine questions regarding the interoperability of various technologies and the linking of various alerting and information systems between truck tracking center and government intelligence center tsa also provided fmcsa with funds to help that ag ency formulate its zmat carrier permit program which was previously mentioned tsa is initiating security awarenesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs11

the united states commercial motor vehicle transporting hazardous material until the operator has undergone backgr ound records check similar to the background record s check required of operators of commercial motor vehicles licensed in the united stat to transport hazardous materialsprogram for the truck leasingrental industr one of the purposes of this effort would be to increase the sensitivity of count er employees to possible security risks such as illegal transport of hazmat posed by someone seeking to rent truck with terrorist intent other parts of the dhs also affect va rious aspects of hazmat transportation security for example the us customs and border protection cbp is installing scanners that can detect radioactive materials as trucks drive out of marine terminals cbp also has issued rule requiring dvanced notification of cargo including chemical cargo manifest data on specified shipments into and out of the country20 the office for domestic preparedness in dhs conducts planning activities and provides training for those that might deal with terrorist attack involving hazmat transportation tsa and hazmat drivers tsa also assesses intelligence and other data seeking to identify persons who pose threat to transportation security with cooperation from the states tsa is gradually implementing section 1012 of the usa patriot act pl 10756 this provision seeks to reduce some of the security risks associated with hazmat transportation by requiring security threat assessment of drivers with hazmat endorsement on their commercial drivers license cdl this process which includes immigration and database checks may deter terrorist from obtaining or keeping such an endorsement neverthe less the hazmat transportation system remains vulnerable to attac k members of congress ar overseeing implementation of tsas program reviewing its financial impacts and deciding whether to explicitly require in law similar review of canadian and mexicandomiciled drivers transporting specified hazmats into the ited states this provision is included in hr 3 which the house passed21 during 2004 tsa screen ed 27 million commercial drivers with hazmat endorsement by comparing driv ers names and other information to those on variety of databases these checks generated more than 100 leads that were sent to the fbi tsa recognizes that the reliability of this process will be improved by incorporating fingerprintbased criminal background check for each of the next five years tsa will put roughly 15 of the commercial drivers seeking to renew obtain and in some cases transfer hazmat endorsement through more comprehensive threat assessment process including fingerprin tbased records review this complex process is underpinned by deta iled federal regulati ons and state procedures that pose costs or uncertainties for drivers or carrier s through its adjudication process tsa will face the difficult task of quickly res ponding to many drivers appealing tsashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs12 22 fmcsa regulation states after the date following january 1 2005 that motor carrier is required to file motor carrier identifi cation report form mcs150 according to the schedule set forth in sec 39019a of this ch apter the motor carrier may not transport in interstate or intrastate commerce any of the following hazardous materials in the quantity indicated for each unless the motor carrier holds safety permit initial decisions effectively denying their hazmat endorsement or seeking waivers from program standards tsa conducts na mebased checks periodically of drivers holding hazmat endorsement on their license tsa and the states have faced many challenges in the development and implementation of this initiative the complete program was originally planned to start in 2003 however it was delayed several times as of january 31 2005 tsa has not permitted state to issue new hazmat endorsement with cdl until determination has been made that an pplicant does not pose security threat starting may 31 2005 this tsa rule also app lies to drivers seekin g either to renew cdl with this endorsement or in some cases to transfer hisher license from one state to another policy issues associated with hazmat transportation security there are several policy issues associated with the federal role in the security of hazmat transportation these include concerns regarding the adequacy or impact of some federal hazmat transportation security efforts limited inspector resources routing and planning and prenotification of shipment s and research related to security technology adequacy or impact of some federal hazmat transportation security efforts despite the efforts and accomplishments of the dot and dhs that were noted in the previous section many vulnerabilities remain in th current layered system of hazmat transportation security as discu ssed below some of the federal efforts to promote security are just beginning to ve an impact and some of these impacts are rather limited in reach or scope fmcsa activities starting in early 2005 fmcsa began issuing hazmat permits to carriers transporting specified high hazard materials all carriers subject to the hazmat safety pe rmit requirements eg 49 cf r 385403 are required to go through the permit process essentia lly the first round of carriers should be considered for the permit within approximately the next 21 months as they register or renew their registration with fmcsa22 as this occurs fmcsa will issue temporary permits nd conduct compliance reviews on t hose carriers without safetyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs13 23 personal communication with fmcsa 2005 24 fmcsa states we are requiring companie s holding safety permits to develop communications plan that allows for the pe riodic tracking of the shipment this may be accomplished either through phone calls or radi calls placed by the driver or through an electronic monitoring or tracking system at minimum the communication plan must require contact from the driver or electronic tracking equipment at the beginning and end of transportation during loadin g or unloading of permitted material or at the beginning and end of each duty period if the driver is making the calls he or she should make them during periodic rests taken for reasons other th an making the call or at the beginning and end of each duty period while not operating the ve hicle or obtaining necessary rest if the company has any reason to suspect the shipment has been stolen diverted or otherwise off route because of lack or delay of cont act from the page 39353 driver or for other reasons then the company should contact th transportation security administrations tsa transportation security coordinati on center at 703 5633236 or 703 5633237 for additional details see dot regulations including httpwwwfmcsadotgovrules regulationsadministrationrulemaki ngs0414654hazmatsafetypermitshtmrating that meet other eligibility requirements for hazmat permit fmcsas review is intended to check the compliance of these carriers with various fmcsaissued safety regulations as well as phmsaissued hazmat security regulations during the compliance review fmcsa states that its safety specialists audit the certifications made by industry as part of the permit application or fmcsa will issue the hazmat safety permit to those carriers with sa tisfactory rating that otherwise meet the requirements for the permit as previously indicated fmcsa has already reviewed hundreds of hazmat carriers to check for their compliance with the phmsaissued regulations prior to january 1 2005 it is difficult to assess the impact of fmcsas permit requirements on security because so few carriers have actually obtai ned the permit to date fmcsa expects that eventually some 3100 carriers will s eek this permit as of march 21 2005 about 180 carriers had receive d permits while 125 appli cations were rejected23 the financial penalties that can result from enforcement cases based on fmcsas compliance reviews plus the legal consequen ces of falsifying certifications required to obtain the permit serve as two for ces promoting compliance with phmsas security plan regulations fmcsa main tains that increased security measures required as part of the permit program reduces the chance that the high hazard materials transported by the covered carriers could be used in terrorist attack although this statement may be true co mpliance with current federal security measures which leave much discretion to industry regarding required measures to be taken could still leave considerable vulnerability to attack and also do not require constant 247 communications for high hazard shipments between carrier and the driver24 dhs activities as previously noted tsas ro in hazmat transportation is evolving not surprisingly some of tsa s efforts are just beginning to have an impact for example the fingerprintbased security threat assessment that tsahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs14 25 written communication from tsa 2005 performs on cdl holders regarding their hazmat endorsement began in early 2005 the actual impact of this process on hazmat transportation security is difficult to determine but most observers would agree that at best its impact will be rather limited in the broader scheme tsas threat assessment process may deter someone who may be terrorist from obtaining or keeping hazmat endorsement but that person still can do harm using hazmats in transportation without first obtaining hazmat endorsement the ques tions could be asked is terrorist likely to acquire or maintain hazmat endorse ment if they need to submit to fingerprint check an immigration status check criminal b ackground review and multipledatabase nameonly checks does the benefit of obtaining hazmat endorsement overcome the potential risk of being uncovered as terrorist tsas security threat assessment process however is not intended or designed to address all the vulnerabilities in the hazmat transportation system in the war against terrorism tsas threat assessment process is viewed by some as prudent m easure by others as feel good measure it is generally recognized however that this investment is inherently limited in its impact on the other hand by not being able to obtain or keep such an endorsement easy access to some parts of the hazmat transportation system can be reduced thus making it more difficult to do harm also tsas security threat process may make it more difficult for group of terrorists to organize coordinated attack using hazmat furthermore tsas nameonly based checks have gene rated more than 100 leads that were sent to the fbi according to tsa the impact or reach of some of tsas other efforts to promote hazmat security also is limited to date tsa has not issued comprehensive set of regulations that requires the various key components of the hazmat transportation industry eg all high hazard shippers and carriers to implement detailed system of securityoriented measures that meets specified criteria beyond those now required by dot there is little indication that the tsa plans to issue such comprehensive regulations at least in the nearterm although this agency working with dot may first strengthen requirements pertaining to tih mate rials transported in the rail mode tsa notes that it has been working with the dot on the issuance of certain security directives and guidance documents that would be designed to address the security risks associated with shipping and transporting certain types and quantities of hazmat tsa maintains that before the agency issues any regulations or adopt standards for key components of the haz mat transportation industry detailed risk assessment and identifi cation of system vulnerabilitie s should take place doing so will allow tsa to properly prioritize and focus their resources on those areas that are deemed to be most vulnerable and subject to terrorist acts25 it remains uncertain when tsa will issue new security directives or guidance documents pertaining to hazmat transportation security also dot and dhs have not issued fi nal regulation that would result in ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs15 26 route security however must be cons idered in the dotrequired security plans 27 personnel communications with tsa 2005 national routing system governing all rail and highway hazmat shipments that requires local or state jurisdictions to ta ke into account and ev aluate various safety considerations security risks and logistical tradeoffs and dictates specific routes and securitybased procedures more importa ntly there is not consensus that there should be such routing system26 for certain events often involving large numbers of people dhs states that it works cooperatively with industry to encourage appropriate measures to reduce risk associated with certain hazmat shipments in the impacted vicinity for example tsa may encourage industry to hold certain shipments for several hours away from certain populated areas limitations of federal and state inspector resources limited federal and state inspection of hazmat shipments also poses security concerns especially in highly populate d areas federal and state motor carrier specialists and railroad inspectors prima rily focus on promoting compliance with applicable safety regulations in gene ral security problems can be much more difficult to detect than safety problems funding limitations for inspector resources allow only small percentage of the vehicl tank trucks and tank cars entering or near heavily populated areas to be checke d many safetyregulatory inspectors are not equipped with the necessary technologie s eg radiation detection devices that would help detect some potential security risks the increased use of technology eg radiation detectors would enhance security but there are associated costs furthermore based on discussions with various participants in the commercial vehicle safety community it appears that all inspectors funded by the motor carrier safety assistance program mcsap do not uniformly receive formal and detailed training on hazmat transportation security concerns and appr opriate interrogatory techniques regarding this challenge nor are all state motor carrier inspectors trained policemen with full law enforcement res ponsibilities and arrest powers fmcsa plans to conduct security awareness tr aining for mcsap personnel during fy2005 furthermore tsa notes that in its fy2005 appropriations the agency was given the authority to hire 100 inspectors primarily to promote security for passenger railroads tsa maintains that it has some flexibility to use these personnel to conduct some cargo inspections as conditions arise27 dhs states that it has allocated funds that will be used to improve the security traini ng of many groups including state motor carrier inspectors there are other limitations many truck inspections occur away from heavily populated areas along the interstates if mo re of these inspections occurred in highly populated areas the effectiveness of such in spections as security measure might be increased additional inspections of sh ipments in urban ar eas although sometimes difficult to conduct might reduce security vulnerabilities especia lly if trucks with highly hazardous loads are found in locati ons that are not along intended delivery routeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs16 28 hr 1414 calls for the dhs secretary to issu regulations pertaining to the routing of extremely hazardous materials through or near an area of concern the bill requires the dhs secretary to determine whether or not the transporta tion could be made by one or more alternate routes at lower security risk and if the secretary determines the transportation could be made by an alternate r oute the use of such alternate route except when the origination or destination of the sh ipment is located within the area of concern 29 crs report rs22041 legal issues concerni ng state and local authority to restrict the transportation of hazardous materials by rail routing the desire to enhance security has catalyzed renewed interest in the routing of hazmat shipments especially for rail sh ipments near or through heavily populated areas28 some have voiced concern over the possibility of terrorists attacking or hijacking shipments of chlorine and ot her hazmat federal state and local government agencies are evaluating impacts on safety interstate commerce transportation logistics and security that w ould need to be considered as part of any proposal to reroute certain high hazard s shipments permanently away from such locations at least one jurisdiction the di strict of columbia has enacted law that was intended to have the net effect of temporarily prohibiting the transportation of certain hazmats through part of its juri sdiction while not an outright ban the law requires that except in cases of emergency it shall be illegal in specified zone to transport without permit specified hazmat the law authorizes the dc department of transportation to issue such permits upon determination that there is practical alternative route which appears to be st ringent standard for review this law has been challenged in federal court many in the freight railroad industry do not want to provide municipalities or other local jurisdictions definitive role in the routing of hazmat shipments they fear that such change in policy would l ead to proliferation of ordinances higher transportation costs and disr uption of operations there is concern that rerouting of such shipments away from highly populated areas could adversely affect the safety of less populated remote co mmunities add trip miles fo r hazmat transporters require travel over routes that have lower quality rail transportation infrastructure encounter areas with less emergency res ponse capability or present other operational challenges for carriers questions have also been raised bout the legal ability of state and local jurisdictions to impose such restrictions on transportation crs report states reviewing the relevant statues includi ng the hazardous materials transportation act and the federal railroad safety act it would appear that state and local governments may be preempted from enac ting legislation that would prevent or hinder the transportation of zardous materials in inters tate commerce this same report also points out the constitution s dormant or negative commerce clause may also prevent state or locality from imposing such restriction as it could arguably be seen as imposing an undue burden on inters tate commerce29 on the other hand some groups maintain that high hazard shipments which posehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs17 30 public citizen homeland unsecured

catastrophic event caused by well placed terrorist attack on certain high hazard shipments could kill t housands and endanger hundreds of thousands of people the argu ment has been made that the number of rail cars to be rerouted is relatively small number and that alternative train routes can be used some hazmat shipments ve been voluntarily rerouted away from populated areas public citizen consumer advocacy gr oup maintains that little has been done since september 11 2001 to secure hazmat transportation from terrorist attacks this organization points out that the bu sh administration has not supported the rerouting of trains transporting hazmat away from heavily populated areas public citizen maintains that train cars are particularly vulnerable to attack and that it is unclear when dot and dhs will finalize ne w regulations to strengthen security affecting the rail mode this organization also maintains that government monitoring of trucks carrying zardous material remains weak30 public citizen also asserts that there are major deficiencies in fmcsas hazmat permit regulation which was previously discussed planning and prenotification the government accountability offi ce gao recommended that dhs and dot jointly develop riskbased plan that addresses the security of the nations rail infrastructure and establish time frames for implementing security actions necessary to protect hazmat rail shipments gao r ecommended that in developing these plans these agencies should address how much information should be disclosed to local communities regarding the types and quantities of hazmat passing through or stored in transit in these communities31 some members of congre ss want to increase the information provided to governmental entities for example s 230 provides that state homeland security coordinator may up to 12 times in 12m onth period request from rail carrier comprehensive list of all hazardous materials scheduled to be transported through such state during any 6month period howe ver the bill specifies that railroad carrier submitting list under this section sha ll not be required to include on such list information relating to the specific times locations or amounts of shipments of hazardous materials othe rs assert that community officials and responders need to know much more about the materials transported through or close to their jurisdictions on the other hand oppone nts point out with over an estimated one million hazmat shipments daily general prenotification requirement would be expensive burdensome on industry and an almost impossible task with so many shipments passing through so many different jurisdictions each day some claim that local responders would become overwhelme d with the quantity of information regarding these hazmat shipments and that current emergency response planning andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs18 32 technology may be one means of reducing risk from terrorists at reasonable cost it is widely recognized that technology is an important aspect of most if not every security plan but technology remains only one component of ev ery security plan an array of different technologies such as vehicle tractor and tr ailer and load tracking systems emergency and constant communication systems remote shut off systems biometric and electronic driver verification systems and improved fencing of freight areas are being considered or are already deployed in the hazmat transpor tation industry some technologies have been deployed more widely than others investment in technology for security purposes is not simply cost but such an investment can dd to the bottom line of business security systems can be integrated with business operati ons technology that improves security can improve the productivity of carrier or opera tioneg the specific location of cargo can be determined and monitored to respond to cu stomer requests and losses from criminal activities might be reduced training obviates the need for uni versal prenotifi cation requirement research compared to many other areas of tr ansportation security research and development rd it appears that relatively few federal dollars have been allocated to advance hazmat transportation security successful rd could yield lower cost security systems and provide more eff ective technology to improve security32 as previously indicated dot has tested vari ety of technologies to promote security including tracking technologies and comm unication systems dhs also conducts some research and pilot tests in this area additional research and testing might include work on the breaching of different containers transporting hazmats the spill or dispersion patterns of different types of commodities improved tracking and communication technologies and incr eased knowledge about how different combinations of hazmats might react with each other and implications for security countermeasures and response such research requires s ubstantial funds but it could provide better information st rategies and technologies to improve security and emergency response some members of congress are particularly interested in the area of research and hazmat transportation security for exam ple hr 909 calls for the establishment of hazardous materials c ooperative research program the purpose of at least one of the studies to be conducted under the proposed program would be to provide an assessment of opportunities fo r integrating and supplemen ting safety and security measures for hazardous materials tran sportation hr 153 and hr 1109 both authorize research program that would in part be intended to support enhanced security for transportation of hazardous materials by rail policy options and legislative initiatives policy options the federal role in promoting the security of hazmat transportation is evolvinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs19 there are many additional measures that could be taken to enhance security but each of these poses its own set of benefits and costs that need to be considered within the context of many policy factors such as alternative uses of federal and industry resources likelihood of effec tively reducing the risks from terrorist attacks and impacts on the operational efficiency and productivity of the surface transportation system many different approaches and m easures intended to improve hazmat transportation security are being considered table 2 outlines several options some of which are interrelated nd overlap and also summarize s selected advantages and disadvantages of each table 2 options intended to enhance hazmat transportation security with selected advantages and disadvantages options approaches to cons ider advantagesdisadvantages 1 increase federal financial assistance to help governmental entities or the private sector pay for enhancements that promote hazmat surface transportation security legislation such as hr 1109 has been introduced that would authorize the secretary of homeland security to award grants directly to public transportation agencies for allowable capital security improvements including tunnel protection systems and chemical biological radiological or explosive detection systems hr 153 would authorize the secretary of homeland security to award grants to hazmat shippers freight railroads and owners of rail cars used in the transportation of hazmat for multiple purposes including to address threats pertaining to the security of hazmat transportation by rail tsome supporters maintain that federal funds could supplement publicsector security enhancements others favor support of either public or private sector initiatives these supplemental funds could expedite infrastructure and operational enhancements to promote security federal funds could help pay for security measures that impose costs difficult to recover in the marketplace or those that exceed reasonable outlays by governmental jurisdictions tcongress however faces the difficult task of allocating limited funds among many other security investments opponents could argue that the private sector should pay for security measures to protect its infrastructure httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs20 options approaches to cons ider advantagesdisadvantages 2 require background check or security threat assessment of persons renting trucks and require security awareness training of personnel working for truck leasing companiestsomeone intent on doing harm could use rented truck filled with hazmat as weapon supporters point out that this provision is intended to reduce vehicle access to persons that pose security threat by increasing the security awareness of personnel working at rental counter and by conducting background check on the person seeking to lease such vehicle security risks might be reduced tthose against such proposal can point to the costs incurred in conducting background check uncertainty of payoff from these additional measures and privacy concerns 3 require improved vehicle tracking mechanisms that can obtain the exact location in realtime of truck transporting high hazard shipments and require constant 247 twoway communication systems between drivers and carriers or some other designated agent to improve monitoring of all high hazard shipmentstsupporters assert that it would be useful if the location of high hazard shipments could be identified at all times and that communication systems be available on 247 day basis this information could be especially important in helping law enforcement and in determining if vehicle were hijacked t those against requiring improved tracking and communication systems for all high hazard shipments point to the costs that would be incurred such costs might be especially burdensome for small carriers it would also be essential to ensure that informa tion regarding the exact location of certain shipments did not get into the wrong hands 4 require rerouting of certain high hazard shipments as part of national routing system that takes into account both safety and security concerns and tradeoffst supporters maintain that the risks of certain high hazard shipments is so great that these shipments should be rerouted away from heavily populated or high profile areas such routing decisions should be based on consideration of numerous factors including security as well as safety topponents point out that rerouting poses an array of difficulties that were previously discussed in the section dealing with routing an additional challenge would be the complexity or difficulty of developing such national routing standardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs21 options approaches to cons ider advantagesdisadvantages 5 require security threat assessments for canadian and mexicandomiciled hazmat drivers transporting specific hazmats into the united statestsupporters point out that it makes little sense to require that usdomiciled cdl holders transporting specified hazmat to go through security threat assessment process and not to require the same for canadian and mexicandomiciled drivers transporting specified hazmat into or out of the united states tthe international logistics or mechanics of conducting such security threat assessments would need to be worked out and in some cases may present certain challenges 6 require dhs and or dot to issue specific directives or regulations meeting definitive performancebased criteria intended to enhance the security of certain high hazard shipments substantially beyond current security and training requirements and provide dhs dedicated and fulltime field staff with aud it capabilities to ensure compliance with such directives or regulations hr 1414 would require the dhs secretary to issue regulations pertaining to physical security measures for extremely hazardous materials such as the use of passive secondary containment of tanker valves and other technologies to ensure the physical integrity of pressurized tank cars used in transportation additional security force personnel and surveillance technologies and barriers communications regarding the movement of such materials to concerned federal state and local law enforcement authorities and terrorism response plans for shipments of extremely hazardous materials as well as the use of currently available technologies and systems to ensure effective and immediate communication between transporters of extremely hazardous materials and all entities charged with responding to acts of terrorism involving shipments of extremely hazardous materialstsupporters could assert that the risks of transporting certain high hazard materials is so great that additional and more rigorous securityoriented measures are needed especially when these materials are transported through high profile or highly populated areas topponents could argue that the costs of these additional measures have not been justified it is partly question of priorities and resources and evidence of the need for such actions versus the costs that would be imposed on industry httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs22 options approaches to cons ider advantagesdisadvantages 7 provide good samaritan protection to anyone reporting possible security threat regarding hazmat transportationtsupporters point out that this option could provide some legal protection to those reporting suspicious activity topponents note that good samaritan legal protection should be provided by state law 8 require hazmat employees working in the highway mode to be aware of the capabilities and functions of the highway watch program as part of the federally required security training for hazmat employeestgiven the federal investment in the highway watch program of about 41 million and its accomplishments to date supporters assert that hazmat employees working in the highway mode should be required at least to be aware of the program and its capabilities to respond to security concerns or threats t on the other hand some in industry do not favor additional training requirements that are federallymandated 9 require all inspectors funded under the motor carrier safety assistance program mcsap to meet at least performance based or minimum level of training pertaining to basic security awareness and associated interrogatory techniques regarding hazmat transportation and require states applying for mcsap funds to address how their program promotes security and to ascertain whether their state needs to obtain additional radiological or chemical detection devices or additional security awareness training for their inspectorstmcsap officers are key part of the first line of defense against the use of hazmat transportation as weapon in the highway mode supporters assert that many mcsap officers would benefit from additional training in hazmat transportation security awareness and interrogatory techniques not all mcsap officers have radiological and other chemical detection devices tsome of those concerned about this option maintain that the primary emphasis of mcsap must continue to be on safety and funds should be allocated accordingly if mcsap officers are to play greater role in promoting security then some assert that systematic means to pay for this additional responsibility should be funded outside of the basic core mcsap monies 10 maintain the status quo by simply letting dhs and dot and industry gradually improve the security of hazmat transportation source congressional research servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32851crs23 concluding observation although there are many opportunitie s to further strengthen hazmat transportation security satisfactorily addr essing all of the points of vulnerability would be extremely costly depending upon the performance standards and scope of additional federal requirements hundreds of millions of dollars or more could be required and even after such investments the hazmat transportation system would still be essentially an open system and not secure unless the costs of security enhancement could be recaptured many companies would be unwilling to pay for additional investments in th is area beyond those already implemented especially in the absence of additional governmental re gulation furthermore additional security checks that cause substantial delays impose costs on commerce on the other hand those seeking additiona l investments in security measures to protect the public point out that the costs of well placed attack on an extremely hazardous shipment eg shipment of toxicbyinhalation gas would be catastrophic there are many options that dhs and dot could pursue to reduce the chances of such an event one key challenge is to identify those additional measures that are reasonable ie cost effective the timing of future actions remains uncertain but some progress toward this objective is gradually being accomplished
