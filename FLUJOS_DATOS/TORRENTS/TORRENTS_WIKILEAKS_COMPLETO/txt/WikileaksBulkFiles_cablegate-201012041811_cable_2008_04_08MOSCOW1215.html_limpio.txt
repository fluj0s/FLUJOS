preinauguration signals ref moscow 1187 and previous classified by cda daniel russell reasons 14 b d 1 c summary among some kremlincritics and establishment figures speculation has grown over the past month that putin and his entourage may be laying the groundwork for return to the kremlin rather than safeguarding the transition of presidentelect medvedev while our contacts speculate that putin has kept his political options open some point to his selfconceived historic mission to return russia to its former glory concerns over rapacious and selfdevouring elite and distrust of medvedevs longterm ambitions as fueling recent maneuvers to further entrench the outgoing presidents powers acknowledging medvedevs personal loyalty to putin observers point to competition among staff and rumors over mrs medvedevs ambitions for her husband rumors notwithstanding little of this speculation has factual underpinning but it does reflect continual nervousness among the elite about putins intentions and the fate of the tandemocracy putins intentions and actions have rarely if ever been correctly forecast over the past year by moscows political elite end summary putin once and future president 2 c some moscow politicians and kremlin watchers are reading postelectoral and preinaugural political maneuvers ref as signs of the possibility that putin could return to the kremlin either at the end of medvedevs term or in the event of underperformance or disloyalty before as kremlin opponent xxxxx told the ambassador putins continued domination of political life the focus on his transition to the white house rather than on medvedevs shift to putins kremlin office the possible creation of cabinetlike host of deputy prime ministers and putins decision to take up leadership of the ruling party has fueled theories that putin could be keeping his options open to return as president putins xxxxx and others have stressed is how to override the political predisposition that leads russians to look to the kremlin whether to the tsar or the general secretary for authority as president xxxxx argued medvedevs stature will be enhanced both constitutionally and psychologically 3 c acknowledging todays shift in political speculation away from the hypothesis that putin would serve limited period as prime minister in order to safeguard medvedevs transition prominent xxxxx argued that putins decision to lead united russia was about protecting his own interests and not those of medvedev absent preexisting gentlemans agreement with the presidentelect xxxxx characterized putins choreography of the last several weeks as humiliation of his successor xxxxx told us that based on blowback from kremlin ideological guru vladislav surkov over critical xxxxx articles it was clear to him that putin wants to be the leading guy as an example of kremlin sensitivities xxxxx pointed to surkovs quick intervention in the wake of an ng article that described medvedevs prospective rule as period of liberal thaw because the term thaw connotes khrushchevs initial reign xxxxx noted it begged the question of who was stalin and implied that change was needed rather than the continuation of putins course putins historic mission internecine clans 4 c pointing to putins sense of historical mission in returning russia to its previous world power status analysts tell us that intraelite divisions remain too poisonous and the prospect for elite conflict too great for putin to remove himself from power construct that he and not system of checks and balances polices xxxxx who also serves on medvedevs think tank questioned why putin sought dictatorial powers over the party given his preexisting facto command of united russia his decision was alarming xxxxx claimed because it demonstrated the uncertainty that exists in putins entourage over the political transition despite the fact that all executive powers will be shared between putin and medvedev and the government machinery will be as focused on putin if not more xxxxx separately suggested that putins party leadership was an additional layer of protection should medvedev become too confident with the presidential perquisites and seek to modify putins imprimatur moscow 00001215 002 of 003 5 c as longtime advocate of third presidential term for putin xxxxx editor xxxxx told us that putin had been hemmed in by his desire for international legitimacy even though amending the russian constitution to remove term limits would have been easy and understandable in the context of russias stage of political development xxxxx speculated that the facto rejiggering of power between the kremlin and white house was awkward but necessary given putins selfimposed requirement of respecting the russian constitution while xxxxx argued that the concentration of power was temporary phase in long very long evolution to more democratic institutions liberal critics like former duma deputy xxxxx see the accumulation of power with putin in facto and jure control over the club of the top administrative and economic nomenclature as an end in itself as xxxxx noted the flurry of presidential orders shifting kremlin staff to white house positions in advance of putin becoming prime minister on may 8 were an interesting reflection of putins mentality rather than have little dima sign the presidential decrees authorizing the transfer of cadre putin continued to dictate the terms of his premiership revealing how lopsided this partnership will be at the outset 6 c amidst the political uncertainty the idea of russia evolving into parliamentary republic is batted around but mostly batted down while both xxxxx and rao ues and sps opposition party deputy xxxxx were at loss to explain putins decision to head united russia absent strategy based on constitutionally reconfiguring russias political system each conceded putins public opposition to the idea given putins domination of politics since medvedevs march 2 electoral win many viewed his comments at the oneyear memorial of former president yeltsins death that the presidency would continue to serve the russian people and protect russias sovereign interests as significant xxxxx confirmed to us that during the course of his xxxxx with medvedev the presidentelect was insistent that russia required presidential system and dismissive of public speculation over the tandem 7 c xxxxx while discounting the role of opposition parties at present warned against gor policies that created competition between bureaucrats rather than parties while russia was not democracy xxxxx maintained that it was on path that could lead to democracy but only if more pluralism was built into the system the problem with the ruling partys selfconscious imitation of japans liberal democratic party with its creation of clubs he stressed was that united russia lacked intraparty ideological coherence and competition at the end of the day it would not matter what liberal united russia duma deputy pligin thought but rather how the kremlin told him to vote that would determine the outcome of any duma contest the challenge for medvedev xxxxx posited will be to reintroduce faith in the system among middle class voters who stayed home or spoiled their ballot that their voice matters it is that portion of the electorate xxxxx stressed that the government will need to rely upon for support for economic modernization staff and spousal ambitions 8 c the maneuvering begs the question of what putin and his entourage could possibly fear in the reflexively loyal medvedev ekspert magazine speculated that the mere formation of an economic thinktank ref b by the presidentelect had been enough to raise concerns of rival team and vision when asked xxxxx did not dispute the analysis acknowledging that between the outgoing and incoming presidents staff there were elements of competition even on minor issues such as extending press invitations for the inauguration xxxxx said that confusion over lines of authority had led to delay united russia duma deputy and kremlin spindoctor sergey markov admitted to us that the transition had produced legislative and political paralysis with everyone waiting for directions on how to work with the tandem 9 c the role of medvedevs wife svetlana in generating tensions between the camps remains the subject of avid gossip xxxxx hinting at svetlanas reputation for aggressive social climbing xxxxx was less discrete calling her stupid and ambitious woman who purportedly had already drawn up list of officials who should suffer for their betrayal of moscow 00001215 003 of 003 medvedev when first deputy prime minister sergey ivanov was ascendant comment 10 c in the absence of facts speculation is driving moscow political currents while it will be months before we get better sense of the division of labor between medvedev and putin the sense here is that the preinaugural atmospherics have diminished rather than buttressed medvedevs political stature and fueled nervousness among moscows hypersensitive political elite as to whether the succession question has been definitively resolved putin has been master of the political surprise over the past year and consistently bamboozled the chattering class and pundits as to his longterm intentions russell
