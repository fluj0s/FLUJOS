of the committees tax cut is smaller difference arising principally from hr 2s partial rather than full elimination of individual taxes on corporate dividends and capital gains and the expiration of

and stimulus the presidents budget proposal contained tax cuts targeted at specific activities and investments tax incentives and would make the 2001 tax cuts which are scheduled to expire in 2010 permanent according to joint tax committee estimates the presidents 726 growth package his proposed tax incentives and limination of the 2010 expiration would together reduce revenue by an estimated 1575 billion over 10 years neither the pr oposed tax incentives nor provisions making the 2001 tax cu t permanent are contained in hr 2 the jobs and growth tax act hr 2 brief overview of the house taxcut bill on may 6 the house committee on ways and means approved hr 2 the jobs and growth tax act of 2003 the bill pr oposes tax cut estimated at 550 billion over 10 years it incorporates with some differences the principal elements of the economic stimulus taxcut package proposed by president bush in february with his fiscal year fy 2004 budget plan hr 2s principal provisions are cut in the tax rates applicable to dividends and capital gains temporary increase in the expensing allowance for small busine ss temporary depreciation bonus for investment in machines and equipment an acceleration to 2003 of several phasedin tax cuts enacted under the economic grow th and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 and temporar increase in the alternative minimum tax amt exemption for individuals major difference between hr 2 and presidents proposal is the treatment of capital gains and dividends the pr esident proposed complete elimination of individual income taxes on corporates ource capital gains and dividends hr 2 proposes reduction of rates rather than elimination of tax and would apply to most capital gains not just those on corporate stock another difference between hr 2 and the presidents proposal is that several of hr 2s accelerations of tax cuts are temporary and would expire at the end of 2005 reverting to the phasein schedule enacted by egtrra these temporary pr ovisions include the widening of the 10 rate bracket the increase in the child credit and the doubling of the standard deduction for married couples largely as result of these differences the proposed size of hr 2s tax cut is smaller ove r 10 years than the presidents plan 550 billion compared to the 726 proposed by the president1 in contrast the bills proposed tax cut is larger than the 350 billion tax cut contained in the budget reconciliation instructions given to the senate finance committee in the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution hconres 95 for further information on the pres idents tax proposal see crs report rs21420 president bushs 2003 tax cut proposal brief overview by david l brumbaughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31904crs2 acceleration of the 2001 tax cuts egtrra contained number of broad tax cuts that it scheduled to be phased in gradually over the period 2001 2010 among the phasedin cuts were three percentagepoint reduction in marginal tax rates schedul ed to be phased in over 2001 2006 an expansion of the lowest tax br acket effective in 2008 gradual increase in the perchild tax credit over 2001 2010 to 1000 from prior laws 600 gradual increase in the standard deduction for married couples to twice that of singles over the period 2005 2009 and an increase over 2005 2008 of the width of the 15 tax bracket for married couples to twice the width of that for singles in general hr 2 would move up the point at which egtrras reductions are effective applying each of the full reduc tions in 2003 to illustrate egtrra set marginal tax rates at 10 15 27 35 and 386 for 2001 2003 at 10 15 26 34 and 376 for 2004 2005 and at 10 15 25 33 and 35 for 2006 until egtrras general expirati on in 2010 hr 2 would apply the 2006 rates in 2003 table 1 below presents sc hematic view of the effective years for the various tax cuts scheduled for phase in under egtrra and accelerated by hr 2 hr 2 would not accelerate all the tax cuts scheduled to be phased

taxes on income investors earn on their corporate sector assets including removing taxe s on capital gains earned on corporate stock and on dividends paid by corporations the administrations proposed tax exclusion for such income would amount to an estimated 3958 b illion over fy 20032013 this would constitute over half 545 of the total revenue cost of the economic growth portion of the presidents proposal the plan would institute form of what economists term integration of taxes on corporate income under current law much of corporate equity income is taxe d twice once under the federal corporate income tax and once under the individual income tax when stockholders sell their stock or receive dividends the administr ations proposal to exclude both dividends and capital gains from tax would eliminate one of the two levels of tax rather than eliminating individual taxes on corporatesource income hr 2 proposes to reduce tax on corporate dividends and noncorporate as well as corporatesource capital gains under current law capital gains are generally taxed at maximum rate of 20 10 for ta xpayers in the 15 ordinaryincome rate bracket for capital gains hr 2 would reduce these rates to 15 and 5 respectively the proposal would treat dividends received from domestic corporations as capital gains for pur poses of applying the rates alternative minimum tax exemption under current law an indi vidual generally pays either his or her alternative minimum tax amt or regular tax whichever is larger the two liabilities ordinarily differ because taxable income is defined differently under the amt and different tax rates are applied to taxable income amt tax rates are generally lower than those of the regular tax in additi on taxable income is generally defined more broadly under the amt it contains more items of income and provides fewer benefits rather than providing the sa itemized or sta ndardized deduction or personal exemptions as the regular tax the amt applies to amt taxable income in excess of an exemption amount that is phased out at higher income levels under temporary rules enacted by egtrra the amt exemption is 49000 for couples and 35750 for singles but is scheduled to fall to 45000 and 33750 respectively for tax years beginning in 2005 and thereafter hr 2 proposes to increase the amt exemption to 64000 for couples and 43250 for singles the increased exemption would apply to 2003 2004 and 2005 but the amounts would revert to those scheduled under current law in 2006 and thereafter increased expensi ng benefit for small business investment in broad terms the tax code does not permit businesses to deduct the entire cost of investments in the year they are acquire d investment outlays in tax parlance are not permitted to be treated as expenses expensed such as wages which are deducted in the year the outlays are made for example when firm buys newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31904crs6 machine it is not incurring cost but simp ly trading one asset cash for another of equal value the machine instead busin esses are generally required to gradually deduct the costs of tangible assets broad ly machines equipment and structures over period of years as the gradual decline in the assets value does impose cost the tax rules generally specify how rapidly tangible asset can be depreciated from the point of view of firm the more qui ckly depreciation deduc tions can be claimed the better since the sooner deduction is claimed the sooner the savings it represents can be invested and earn return in general if an asset is permitted to be deducted more rapidly than it actually loses value tax benefit is conferred if the entire acquisition price of an asset is deducted in the year of purchase ie if the asset is expensed the value of the benefit is the equivalent of exempting the assets return from tax notwithstanding the tax code s general depreciation rule s section 179 of the tax code permits firms to deduct immediately expense up to 25000 annually of outlays for machines and equipment but not structures the benefit is linked to small business by phase out provision under its terms the expensing limit is reduced on dollarfordollar basis by th amount qualified investment in year exceeds 200000 thus for example firm that invests 210000 in year could expense only 15000 hr 2 would increase the expensing limit to 100000 for property placed in service in 20032007 the increase would expire for 2008 and thereafter the plan would also increase the beginning of the phaseout range to 400000 also for 20032007 enhanced depreciation allowance as noted above the tax code generally re quires firms to depreciate their tangible business property over period of years the tax code governs how rapidly the cost of an asset can be depreciated by sp ecifying the number of years over which deductions must be spread t he recovery period and the portion of the assets total cost that can be deducted in each year of the recovery period notwithstanding these rules and also as descri bed above section 179 of th tax code permits firms to deduct expense certain amount of inves tment outlays in first year an asset is placed in service in addition the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107147 enacted on temporary ba sis special depreciation bonus under which 30 of the cost of qualifying bus iness property generally machines and equipment but not structures can be deducted in the year of purchase the provision applies to property purchased dur ing the threeyear period from september 11 2001 to september 10 2004 and placed in service before 2005 hr 2 would provide new temporary firstyear allowance under which firms are permitted to deduct 50 of the cost of machines and equipment in their first year the allowance would cover property acqui red after may 5 2003 and before january 1 2006 period spanning roughly two years and eight months net operating losses firms are generally subject to federal tax on their taxable income that is their gross revenues as defined by the tax code minus allowa ble deductions if firmshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31904crs7 2 an outline of the plan is posted on the bureau of national affairs website at httpippubsbnacom the outlay portions of the plan also propose 44 billion in increased outlays over 10 years that are not included in the 177 billion jobs creation part of the proposaldeductions in given year exceed its taxable revenues it incurs loss for tax purposes net operating loss or nol firm s incurring an nol in particular year are permitted to carry back the nol nd deduct it from taxable income earned in the preceding two years if firm possesse s positive taxable income in either of the two carryback years it receives tax re fund for the deductions generated by the nol if some or all of the firms nol remains after deducting it from taxable income in the carryback years if the nol is larger than the sum of taxable income in the carryback years any remaining nol can be carried forward up to 20 years and deducted from taxable income in the futu re in general an nol that is carried back and used to generate tax refund is more valuable to firm that an nol carryforward of the same amount because of discounting the idea that firms and other economic actors value resources they have in the present more than the same resources received at some point in the futu re to illustrate the sooner firm obtains the tax savings from deduction the sooner it can invest the savings and begin to earn return on them the 2002 act temporarily increased the nol carryback period to five years from two the extended period is app licable for nols arising in 2001 and 2002 hr 2 would extend the period for which the fiveyear carryback is available to nols incurred in 2003 2004 and 2005 the house democratic proposal on may 7 house democratic leaders nnounced the outlines of an alternative tax and outlay package that would cut taxes and increase selected outlays by an estimated 177 billion over 10 years2 of that total the proposed tax cuts would reduce revenue by an estimated 106 billion ove r 10 years the plan also contains revenue offsets revenuerais ing tax increases that are designed to offset the cost of the tax cuts so that there would be net change in revenues over 10 years for individuals the plan would acceler ate to 2003 part of the scheduled increase in the perchild tax credit th plan would increase the credit to 800 as described above in table 1 the credit is currently 600 and is scheduled to increase to 800 in 2009 and to 1000 in 2010 the proposal would also accelerate to 2003 the expansion of the 10 taxrate bracket that egtrra scheduled for 2008 as well as unspecified tax cuts for married couples for businesses the proposal would incr ease the expensing benefit for small business investment undertaken in 2003 to 75000 from current laws 25000 the plan would also provide 50 first year depreciation bonus for 2003 and 10 bonus for 2004 the proposal would also implement the provisions of hr 1769 rep crane bill that addresses the controversy between the united states and the europeanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31904crs8 3 for more information on the eti controversy see crs report rs20746 export tax benefits and the wto foreign sales corpora tions and the extraterritorial
