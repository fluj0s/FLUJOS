governmentwide initiative to subject activities or functions performed by federal agencies that are deemed commercial to publicprivate competition commercial activity is defi ned by the office of management and budget omb as recurring service that could be performed by the private sector whereas an inherently governmental activity is an activity that is so intimately related to the public intere st as to mandate performan ce by government personnel1 as explained by the administrator of the office of federal procurement policy ofpp in early 2002 competitive sourcing is means to an end with the means being competition generally publicprivate competition and the end being better management of our government and better service for our citizens2 omb expects competitive sourcing to result in significant performance improvements such as reducing costs improving accountability or increasing efficiency3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32079crs2 4 see also us office of management and

during the year initially agencies were expected to compete total of 15 of their commercial ftes by the end of fy2003 congressional testim ony provided by the thenadministrator of ofpp in march affirmed that this had been the original goal we put 15 percent up over 2 years as goal that we thought was appropriate for almost every department and agency to meet because they had not subjected as general proposition particularly at the civilian agencies they had never subjected any of these jobs that are clear ly commercial in nature to the pressures of competition21

the panel was charged with examining circular a76 nd fair members included senior federal government officials industry and union repr esentatives and competitive sourcing experts after yearlong study cap released its report improving the sourcing decisions of the government on april 30 2002 however the administrator also not ed that omb had begun working with agencies to develop goals suited to their particular circumstances we sat down with each department and agency over the period of the past i would say 6 to 9 months to determine what was an appropriate plan for that agency there are agencies where it is not appropriate right now for them to be competing 15 percent22 next at hearing in september the administrator explained that the combined target of 15 was governmentwide goal not goal that each agency was required to meet i would like to take an opportunity to clarify what is tremendous amount of confusion and misrepresentation about our goals first its an aggregate 15 percent governmentwide goal its not 15 percent at each agency23 criticism of ombs competitive sourcing targets surfaced in 2002 the primary allegation was that the goals or targets were arbitrary in march for example senator george v voinovich voiced his concerns about ombs targets i am concerned that the benchmarks the administration has adopted for its competitive sourcing are arbitrary and potentially damaging as were the clinton administrations downsizing efforts what measurement criteria did the administration use to come up with 50 pe rcent figure what is the logic behind it24 in april the commercial activities panel cap issued its report on circular a76 and related issues25 one of the panels recommendations was that the government adopt 10 sourcing principles developed by cap the sixth principle was avoid arbitrary fulltime equivalent fte or other arbitrary numerical goals while the panel did not comment explicitly about the administrations competitive sourcing targets it did explain its ra tionale for avoiding arbitrary goalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32079crs7 26 commercial activities panel improving the sourcing deci sions of the government washington gao 2002 p 47 27

reform subcommittee on technology and procurement policy oversight hearing to review the findings of the commercial activities panel p 137 29 ibid pp 4344this principle reflects an overall concern about arbitrary numbers driving sourcing policy or specific sourcing decisions the success of government programs should be measured by the results achieved in terms of providing value to the taxpayer not the size of the in house or contractor workforce any fte or other numerical goals should be base d on considered research and analysis the use of arbitrary percentage or num erical targets can be counterproductive26 later in 2002 the comptroller genera l commented in correspondence and in congressional testimony on ombs targets i have seen evidence to indicate that ombs numerical fte goals were based on considered research and sound analysis in addition i am not aware that ombs fte goals took into full account the capacity of agencies particularly civilian agencies to conduct publicprivate competitions27 i believe the administrations current quot as targets call it whatever you want violate the sourcing principles re commended by cap because they are arbitrary28 ombs response to these charges was that the interim goals were an effort to prompt agencies to establish the infrast ructure necessary to conduct competitions at hearing in september the thenadmin istrator of ofpp elaborated on this point let be clear about the application of this aggregate governmentwide goal of 15 it is not intended as an arbitrary quota such as the ones that were put into effect through most of the 1990s when the workforce was reduced by 324580 ftes like you mr chairman rep resentative thomas m davis i have always opposed arbitrary fte cuts and caps as this subcommittee has heard say before competitive sourcing is not about outsourcing or downsizing the workforce to the contrary it is about creating incentives and opportunities for efficiency and innovation through competition thus as we work with agencies and evaluate their progress the real issue is whether an agencys plan first builds an infrastructure for publicprivate competition and then implements competitions over the longterm while omb will presume that an agency has built such an infrastructure if it compet 15 percent of its commercial ftes we have been careful not to apply this goal in rigid or arbitrary manner29 2003 targets pl 1087 hjres 2 108th congress consolid ated appropriations resolution 2003 congressional interest in the administrations

identified commercial activities available for competition they consider in disciplined way which of these might benefit most from comparison with the private sector agencies are generally focusing use of publicprivate competition on commonly available routine commercial services where there are likely to be numerous capable and highly competitive private sector contractors worthy of comparison

_tech_correctionpdf visited jan 5 2005 in summary ombs initial competitive sourcing efforts particularly those efforts related to targets or goals sought to institutionalize pub licprivate competition across the federal government and spur the development of sufficient infrastructure within agencies for carrying out competitive sourcing tasks and activities the initial goals remained in place with some modification which lasted briefly as result of clay johnson iiis april 17 memora ndum until the thenofpp administrators congressional testimony on july 24 2003 th ere does not appear to be any publicly available information that documents whether ombs goals were successful in prompting agencies to establish infrastru ctures sufficient for conducting competitions and performing related tasks if only some agencies were successful in this area it remains to be seen what means omb might use to continue to promote infrastructure development among federal agencies anot her related issue is whether omb plans to assess the capability of each agency to handle its competitive sourcing workload while the revised scorecard criteria may provide some insight into these issues the criteria alone may not be sufficient th criteria tend to focus on output however outputbased criteria are not necessarily wellsuited to measuring other features or characteristics such as agency capac ity or the quality of competitions and inventories hr 2989 transportation treasury and independent agencies appropriations act 2004 the house committee on appropriations report that accompanied the

following the announcement of those competitive sourcing goals targets or quotas specifically detailing the research and s ound analysis that was used in reaching the decision although the 15 percent competitive sourcing target has been reiterated on several occasions since the enactment of that act ombs position is that the reporting requirement has not been triggered because new target has been announced the committee notes that the 15 percent target is governmentwide and separate targets could be established for individual agencies depending on their circumstances to the extent that omb establishes individual agency targets in its internal guidance the agency is directed within 30 days of establishing such targets to submit report to the house and senate committees on appropriations that indicates each agencys compe titive sourcing target the report should specifically detail the research and analysis that was used in determining each agencys individual target goal or quota to the extent that such targets change over time omb is directed to maintain an uptodate record of such changes and convey the changes periodically to the house and senate committees on appropriations

savings actual savings the projected number of ftes scheduled to be competed in the next fiscal year and description of the agencys competitive sourcing decisionmaking process the initial report is due 120 days after the da of enactment which was january 23 2004 the remainder of section 647 allows agency heads to establish performance period greater than five years for any agency function that was won by federal employees in publicprivate competition permits agency heads to use appropriated funds for monitoring the pe rformance of any activity that has been subjected to publicprivate

congress as required by pl 1087 and reaffirmed by house action on hr 2989 in 2003 without explicitly stating that it was responding to congresss request for information ombs report provided an explanation for its initial goals of 5 10 and 50 and stated that omb had dr opped these goals in favor of targets established through collaborative process between itself and agencies42 should the explanation for ombs interim and longterm goals be deemed insufficient the fact that omb has abandoned these goals could possibly be construe d as relieving it of the responsibility to provide considered resear ch and analysis for its original targets nevertheless it is possible that interest in competitive sourcing targets and ombs role in their development could continue should congress wish to obtain the research and analysis used to develop agency competition plans it may need to contact federal agencies nd departments including omb language in ombs competitive sourcing report

publicprivate competition46 an agency develops its own competition plan presumably following the process described in ombs competitive sourcing report47 however it appears that this is only an initial plan the final plan is product of negotiations between the agency and omb48 the rationale for final plan coul d include in addition to an agencys documentation the research and analysis omb used in making its determination about the contents of the agencys plan and any changes that resulted from omb agency negotiations the recommendation in the report accompanying hr 2989 notes that in the event that omb establishes individual agency targets in its internal guidance report on competitive sourcing targets is due to the house and senate appropriations committees the question is how to interpret internal guidance broad interpretation could include written and verbal guidance including negotiations between omb and agencies possible benefit of increasing the visibility of ombs guidance to agencies could be to dispel any concerns that ombs expectations or instructions are communicated treated or perceived as targets encouraging or requesting agencies to publicize their competition plans prior to entering into negotiations with omb also could shed light on this phase of the competition plan process on the other hand increased visibility of the pr ocess particularly communications between agencies and om b could disrupt the development of agency competition plans and provide an oppor tunity for outside parties to attempt to influence the process ombs expectation compete 416000

as omb noted in its july 2003 report approximately 26 of the workforce from agencies bein g tracked under the pma are engaged in commercial activities that should be available for competition50 this

of how commercial functions were sorted into the available and not available categories fair invent ories reportedly were the source of these numbers and reason codes were used to determine whether commercial function should be classified as availabl or not available for competition53 according to ombs estimate the number of commercial ftes available for competition is 416000 this figure re presents 48 of the total number of commercial ftes and it is comparable to the original longterm target for competitive sourcing 50 which equate d to 425000 ftes while omb elected to eliminate the 50

looking for is for an agency to have plan in place and pretty aggressive plan to compete anything thats open to competition look at the green standard on the scorecard which sa ys we contemplate having plan in place at every department and agency to compete every activity that is commercial in nature and open to competition to get to green we want pretty significant plans in place to compete an activity that is commercial in nature thats about 418000 jobs54 the administrator also reportedly said we still expect agencies to compete everything open to competition55 this statement might reflect the possibility that the number of commercial activities available for competition could fluctuate from year to year freed from blanket targets such as the initial goals of 5 and 10 that each agency was expected to meet agency personnel might in reviewing their commercial and inherently governmental lists determine that some functions had been erroneously classified while it is easy to

omb or through consultation between the two the percentage of available commercial positions in competition plans may seem higher than expected particularly in light of the elimination of the 15 and 50 targets however agencies possibly could have decided despite the elimination of these goals not to change their competition plans as reported in government executive it is not clear that ombs move to scrap broad targets will result in fewer job competitions it seems to have had little if any effect so far after her july 24 2003 announcement angela styles t hen ofpp administrator went to meeting of the presidents management council composed of the deputy secretaries of each cabinet department she told them that omb was willing to renegotiate their initial compe titive sourcing plans designed when the white house was still prodding agencies to compete 15 percent of their jobs deemed commercial under the 1998 federal activities inventory reform fair act but few agencies took her up on the offer i havent had that many agencies come back in to talk she said i th ink the agencies are pretty comfortable with their plans61 possibly federal government agencies ve not taken advantage of the opportunity to revisit their competition targets and plans omb guidance on green competitive sourcing plans i n memorandum dated december 22 2003 the deputy director for management omb advised agencies on how to prepare green competition plan62 developing and implementing longrange competition plan fy 2004fy2008 is fundamental standard for success in achie ving green rating on the

plans is that the information contained therein will ensure that competitive sourcing is carefully and regularly considered option for improving the costeffectiveness and quality of its agency commercial operations63 t h memorandum does not include guidance on how to prepare yellow competition plan summary of the components as requi red by the memorandum is as follows general decision making process explain the general process the agency uses to determine which commercial activities are competed b activities to be announced for competition identify the activities that the agency is planning to announce for competition in fy2004 or other period negotiated with omb c handling of other reason code b activities for activities that are not identified in item b above but have be designated as reason code b on the 2003 fair act inventory identify managements plan for taking timely and effective advantage of competition d potential constraints identify the most significant factors up to three that limit the agency from giving greater consideration to competitive sourcing than is reflected in its plan also identify wh at the agency is doing to minimize these constraints and when it expects to have minimized the constraints64 additional detailed guidance is provided in an attachment to the memorandum deadline is provided for submission of initial agency competition plans updated plans are to be completed by august 1 of each year and if any changes have occurred agency management is expected to explain them ombs instructions do allow for an agency to identify functions and associated ftes that will not be subjected to competition by the end of fy 2008 the agency must provide rationale for any activities that are excluded from competition plans and b functions and associated ftes that need further study in order to determine whether they should be subjected to competition by the end of fy200865 the notion of developing longterm competition plan that includes all agency functions with reason code b is consis tent with ombs july 2003 and september 2003 competitive sourcing reports the crite ria for longterm competition plans as described in the december 22 2003 memora ndum allows agencies to determine which functions and how many ftes to compete each year that is an agency tailors plan to its particular needs and circumst ances encourages agen cies to compete all commercial functions that carry reason code b and relies on agencies to develop rationales for carrying out publicprivate competitions these were significant features of the reports issued by omb in 2003 the requirement for all commercialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32079crs32 activities carrying reason code b to be included on longterm competition plans appears to reinforce the expectation that all of these functions eventually will be subjected to publicprivate competition conclusion ombs approach to the establishment and application of competitive sourcing goals has evolved since the inception of the administrations competitive sourcing initiative in 2001 originally the goals of 5 and 10 applied to each agency later the cumulative goal of 15 was characterized as governmentwide aggregate target meanwhile congress pa ssed legislation dir ecting omb to provide rationale for competitive sourcing targets in summer 2003 omb announced publicly that it had abandoned its numerical goals and that it d begun collaborating with agencies on the development of thei r competition plans at that time omb also revised the scorecard criteria for co mpetitive sourcing additionally although omb dropped the longterm goal of 50 it indicated that it ex pected agencies to compete all functions identified as commercial and available guidance issued by omb on green competition plans suggests th at agencies should plan to compete most if not all eligible commercial activities it remains to be seen how successful various agencies will be in meeting the revised scorecard criteria and in meeting ombs expectation for competing all eligible functions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32079 crs33 appendix table 5 executive branch management scorecard
