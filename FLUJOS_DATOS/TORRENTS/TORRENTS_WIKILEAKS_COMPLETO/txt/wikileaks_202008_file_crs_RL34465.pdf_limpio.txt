administration amendments act fdaaa pl 11085 was signed into law on september 27 2007 the law reauthorizes four expiring food and drug administration fda programs and expands the agencys authority to ensure the safety of prescription drugs and biologics medical devices and foods fdaaa represents the most comprehensive fda legislation since the food and drug administ ration modernization act of 1997 fdama pl 105115 the primary impetus for the legislation was the renewal of fdas authority for two key user fee programs that were set to expire at the end of fy2007 the prescription drug user fee act pdufa last reauthorized in 2002 pl 107188 and the medical device user fee and modernization act mdufma enacted in 2002 pl 107250 the law also reauthorizes two other expiring authorities which are related to pediatric pharmaceuticals the best pharmaceuticals for children act bpca last reauthorized in 2002 pl 107109 and the pediatric research equity act prea enacted in 2002 pl 108155 in addition to the reauthorizations fdaaa contai ns several other fdarelated provisions these include provisions designed to enhance drug safety spark the development of pediatric medical devices expand the types of trials and the substance of information in clinical trial databases create new nonprofit entity to assist fda with its mission improve food safety and affect number of other areas related to public healt h several of fdaaas provisions contain the authorization to appropriate funding these are listed in appendix many create additional responsibilities with deadlines for federal agency personnel see appendix b in addition several of the authorities have sunset dates in 2012 or early 2013 see appendix c fdaaas impact on fda is important to two ongoing policy discussions one discussion centers around the possibility of additional legislation to refine or restructure the agencys regulatory role understanding current law as amended by f daaa is good starting point for any such discussion the second discussion is about health care reform the agency plays critical role in bringing medical products to market which is descri bed below in performing that role as refined by fdaaa fdas regulation of dical products affects their quality availability and cost

services hhs regulates the safety of most human foods1 all animal feeds and certain other products such as cosmetics2 the agency also regulates the safety and effectiveness of human drugs biologics eg vaccines medical devices and animal drugs3 those products regulated for effectiveness must be reviewed and approved by fda before they can be placed in commerce process called premarket approval fda is tasked with postmarket surveillance for these products as well products regulated only for safety may enter commerce with little fda oversight though the agency may inspect production facilities and require that certain good manufacturing practices be carried out 1 the united states department of agriculture usda regulates the safety of meat and poultry products 2 for more information on

it regulates that it determines to be unsafe media coverage of issues related to the safety of food eg spinach drugs eg vioxx and medical devices eg cardiac stents has brought congressional attention to fda s performance and the funding it has available to carry out its statutory responsibilities for those products requiring premarket approval central issue for congress is how best to balance the need for the agency to help speed the products it regulates to market if they are safe and effective and correct them or keep them from entering or staying on the market if they are not for human foods animal feeds and other products not requiring premarket approval key issues relate to fdas ability to assure product safety and protect public health by preventing health threats from occurring or by identifying and responding to problems quickly

drug and cosmetic act ffdca th public health service act phsa and the united states code usc the usc citations vary in specificity to match the citations listed in fdaaa when table text extends across previous and current law fields this indicates one of two things if an fdaaa cite is present fdaaa is reauthorizing or restatin g portions of provisions identical to those of the prior law if fdaaa

1992 in fy1994 the first year fda noted pdufa revenue use in its budget justification documents the fees contributed 97 of the human drug programs budget at the time of fdaaas passage the 4 crs report

drug program budget6 in the years leading to pdufas enactment in 1992 fda consumers and manufacturers all sought to shorten the time between manufacturers submission of an application and the agencys decision on whether to approve the product fda lacked the funding for staff to review those products quickly with pdufa congress ga ve fda revenue source to supplement direct appropriations congress also structured pdufa to restrict the use of collected funds to new product review and established mechanism for agencyindustry collaboration to create performance goals that set targets primarily for review times pdufa has had range of effects new application review times decreased from 29 months in 1987 to 17 months in 19947 pdufas restriction of the use of fee revenue to premarket review created what many saw as an imbalance between resources available to premarket and postmarket activities in its 1997 and 2002 reauthorizations congress gave fda limited authority to use some of the fees for postmarket safety activities during 2004 discussions in preparation for pdufa iv several safety problems with aggressively marketed drugssuch as vioxxreceived wide publicity this heightened the ongoing concern over the balance of attention between premarket review and postapproval safety monitoring fdaaa reflects that increased focus on postapproval drug safety throughout but especially in this title described below and in title ix enhanced authorities regarding postmarket safety of drugs discussed later in this report title i of fdaaa addresses types of fees authoriz ed fee revenue authorized uses of fees new fees for the advisory review of directtoconsumer television advertisements reauthorization and report requirements and effective dates as summarized in the following material types of fees fdaaa reauthorizes the assessment coll ection and use of three types of fees from manufacturers of drugs and biological products these are application fees establishment fees and product fees authorized fee revenue fdaaa establishes fee revenues for each fiscal year of 392783000 with various adjustments for inflation workload rent and rentrelated expenses and finalyear adjustments congress added to that base amount fee revenues for drug safety totaling 225 million over the fiveyear reauthorization authorized uses of fees the new law expands the list of postmarket safety activities for which the fees could be used these include developing and using adverseevent datacollection systems including information technology system s developing and using improved

makes certain other amendments to the regulation of devices congress initially gave the agency the authority to collect such fees in 2002 with the medical device user fee and modernization act mdufma pl 107250 mdufma established user fees for premarket applications pmas 8 premarket notifications 510ks9 and other types of requests to market medical devices the 2002 law incorporated by reference performance goals for many types of premarket device reviews it also enabled thirdparties to conduct establishment inspections and added new regulatory requirements for reprocessed singleuse devices in fy2007 when fdaaa was enacted medical device user fees generated 35202000 this represents an increase of 1447 over the amount first collected in fy2003 in fy2007 devices user fees comprised 90 of the agencys user fee revenue and 18 of its total budget10 fdas authority to collect medical device user fees was due to expire on october 1 2007 congress reauthorizes the authority in mdufa 2007 s ubtitle in subtitle b it amends some aspects of the regulation of medical devices the details of each of these are discussed below

reauthorizes fda s expiring authority to collect user fees through october 1 2012 and makes certain other changes to mdufma the primary change is that mdufa 2007 adds three new types of user fees annual establishment fees registration fees and 30day fees the first two are to be paid regularly by establishments with devices on the market generating predictable base of device user fee income for fda mdufma had only enabled the collection of fees for applications related to fdas approval or clearance of product which the agency had noted made the agencys user fee income difficult to predict this was because the number of applications could vary from year to year the agency asserted that by contrast fees paid annually would result in revenue stream that was more reliable this move toward more predictable funding stream mirrors the approach taken by pdufa for drugs and biological products 8 pma is generally required for new medical devices and those that necessitate fdas highest level of safety controls 9 510k is generally required for medical devices similar to ones already on the market 10 crs report rl34334 the food and drug administration budget and statutory history

for fy2008 and then includes subsequent annual increase in fee amounts through fy2012 despite the fy2008 decrease in the amounts of individual fee amounts the total fee revenue generated will increase from fy2007 levels revenue lost in reduced fee amounts will be offset by revenue generated by new types of fees mdufa 2007 changes some provisions relevant to specific types of fees both mdufma and mdufa 2007 generally establish fee amounts for various types of activities by setting them as proportion of the cost of submitting pma the amount charged for pma is therefore also called the base fee mdufa 2007 strikes provision that had required the secretary to adjust the premarket notification fee amount annually in unique way instead it sets it like other fees as percentage of the base fee amount for different fee the fdaaacreated establishment fee the law gives the secretary the authority to increase the fee amount in fy2010 if too few manufacturers have paid it mdufa 2007 changes the law regarding reduced fees paid by small businesses in several ways under mdufma entities qualifying as small businesses had certain fees waived and paid others at reduced rate mdufa 2007 further reduces the fee amounts small businesses pay removes provision that the assets of partners and parent firms be considered in small business qualification and enables foreign firms to qualify as small businesses regarding modular applications those submitted to fda in separate pieces mdufa 2007 for the first time also affords the possibility of refunds for applications withdrawn at different points mdufa 2007 extends trigger requirement beyond fy2007 indefinitely 11 the trigger which is designed to ensure that user fees supplement rath er than supplant direct appropriations requires that there be certain amount of medical devicer elated direct appropriations in order for the secretary to assess medical device user fees and be expected to meet performance goals mdufa 2007 amends provision regarding the collection of fees in excess of the amount authorized the previous law required that if fees collected for fiscal year exceed the authorized appropriation the excess would be subtracted from the subsequent years authorization by contrast mdufa 2007 allows excess fees to be carried over to cover shortfalls over the course of several years mdufa 2007 amends provision describing how fda may use the device fees it collects the new provision in theory could have enabled fees to be expended on postmarket activites but does not appear in practice to have done so it states that fees will be dedicated toward expediting the process for the review of device applications and for assuring the safety and effectiveness of devices as set forth in letter from the secretary to relevant congressional committees commitment letter 12 it is conceivable that assuring the safety and effectiveness of devices could be interpreted to encompass postmarket surveillance however the commitment letter does not list surveillance and enforcement activities in addition mdufa 2007 maintains two separate 11 the fy2007 trigger was articulated in the medical device user fee stabilization act of

expenditure of user fee funds to premarket activities13 mdufa 2007 requires the secretary to continue to file annual performance and fiscal reports through fy2012 and writes these report requirements into the ffdca the law also requires that the performance report include information on previous cohorts for which the secretary had not given complete response in fdas development of its performance goal recommendations to the congress mdufa 2007 maintains mdufma s requirements that the agency consult with an array of groups and take specified steps to invite public input unlike the previous law mdufa 2007 specifies that the recommendations be revised upon consideration of public comments requires the recommendations transmittal to congress and writes the performance goalrelated requirements

device producers must register with the secretary it also reduces from twice to once per year the requirement that those who register with the secretary provide list of devices on which they perform specific functions eg the manufacture preparation propagation com pounding or processing of device mdufa 2007 amends electronic registration regulations to require electronic filing as default and without necessitating rulemaking by the secretary as would have previously been required mdufa 2007 amends two portions of the ffdca s provisions regarding records and reports on devices first it adds requirement that the secretary promulgate regulations establishing unique identification system for medical devices second it modifies the reporting requirements for devices linked to serious injuries or deaths mdufa 2007 revises the requirements for inspections by accredited third parties in three ways first it reduces administrative requirements associated with qualifying for the program second

enacted based upon reports of critical need for pediatric medical devices that help diagnose and treat diseases and conditions affecting children apparently developing medical devices for children is less profitable and more problematic than developing them for adults fewer children need medical devices than adults and children have physical attributes eg size biochemistry growth rates activities and environmental influences that are different from those of adults in order to encourage the development of the pediatric devices pmdsia creates some new reporting requirements related to certain pediatric devices offers several types of incentives to manufacturers to create pediatric medical devices and gives fda the authority to require postmarket studies of approved pediatric devices to ensure their continued efficacy and safety pmdsia creates set of reporting requirements for applications made under ffdca 515 and 520m 14 section 515 governs pmas to market class iii devices these require fdas highest level of safety controls section 520m governs humanitarian device exemptions hdes an hde allows manufacturer with device aimed at us patient population of less than 4000 to market the product without having to demonstrate its effectiveness only its safety and to have certain application fees waived the exemption from proving effectiveness is designed to encourage manufacturers to develop medical devices for these small markets assisting patients with rare diseases and conditions who might otherwise not be served pmdsia creates requirements for both types of applications inserting new section 515a into the medical device approval regulations section 515a requires those requesting approval to market device under 515 and 520m to include if readily available description of any pediatric subpopulation with the disease or condition that the devices is intended to treat and the number of affected pediatric patients section 515a also allows the secretary to conclude that adult data can be used to support reasonable assurance of effectiveness in pediatric subpopulations as appropriate the section also requires the secretary to report annually to relevant congressional committees specified information about pediatric devices approved in the preceding year pmdsia creates one set of incentives for manufacturers to create pediatric medical devices by making some modifications directly to the hde primarily pmdsia exempts some specified manufacturers of pediatric devices from the general hde prohibition on selling device for an amount that exceeds its costs of research and development fabrication and distribution the exemption extends only to specified requests submitted on or before october 1 2012 pmdsia 14 the requirements do not attach to premarket

and inspection authorities and creates reporting requirements for adverse events related to devices that qualify for the pricing exemption the law also requires the co mptroller general to submit

demonstration project to promote pediatric device development the law authorizes 6 million per year for fy2008 through fy2012 to support the demonstration grants and related activities the law also requires the national institutes of health nih director to designate contact point to help pediatric medical device developers locate funding in addition it requires the secretary to submit plan for expanding pediatric medical device research and development to relevant congressional committees finally the pmdsia incorporates certain postmarket surveillance measures related to pediatric medical devices it expands the conditions under which the secretary may require postmarket studies as condition of approval for class ii or iii devices 15 to include devices expected to have significant use in pediatric subpopulations these studies may exceed the general 36month limitation in duration if necessary to assess the impact of the device on pediatric populations growth and development the pmdsia also includes related dispute resolution provision entitling manufacturer to request review during which the device may not be deemed misbranded except as necessary to protect public health 15

manufacturers with financial incentive to conduct pediatric use studies on their patented products the pediatric studies of drugs provision provided that if manufacturer complied with written fda request for specific pediatric study fda would add si x months to its market exclusivity for that product 18 this tool is the second approach that fda and congress have taken to encouraging pediatric drug research the other required pediat ric assessments of new products is discussed in the preceding section of this report regarding fdaaa title iv in 2002 the best pharmaceuticals for children act bpca 2002 pl 107109 reauthorized the exclusivity provisions for another five years it also added provisions to encourage pediatric research of products that were longer covered by patent or other marketing exclusivity agreements to which pediatric exclusivity was not relevant it required the secretary to list those offpatent products for which pediatric studies are needed to assess safety and effectiveness it also established an offpatent research fund at nih phsa 409i and authorized appropriations of 200 million for fy2002 and such sums as are necessary for each of the five years until the provisions were set to sunset on october 1 2007 for onpatent drugs whose manufacturers declined fdas written requests for studies and therefore exclusivity bpca 2002 amended ffdca 505a to allow fda to refer drugs needing pediatric studies to the foundation for the nih fnih phsa 499 creating second program of fdanih collaboration 19 other provisions in the 2002 bpca included giving priority status to pediatric supplemental applications the establishment of an fda office of pediatric therapeutics opt the definition of pediatric age groups to include neonates and direction to the secretary to contract with the iom for review of regulations federally prepared or supported reports and federally supported evidencebased research all relating to clinical research involving children the iom report to congress was also to include recommendations on best practices relating to research involving children 20 title v of fdaaa again reauthorizes the pediatric exclusivity program amending ffdca 505a to sunset on october 1 2012 it also encourages research on offpatent products strengthens the 18 during that sixmonth period fda would not grant marketing approval to another identical product

labeling changes are approved all within the agreed upon time frames an applicant who turns down request on the grounds that developing appropriate pediatric formulations of the drug is not possible must provide evidence to support that claim the new law requires that the sponsor propose pediatric labeling resulting from the studies for product studied under this section the labeling must include study results and the secretarys determination whether those results demonstrate the drugs safety and effectiveness if the results do or do not indicate safety and effectiveness or if they are inconclusive the product sponsor must disseminate labeling change information to health care providers and the commissioner must report to the secretary on the review of all adverse event reports and recommendations on actions in response other provisions of the law set time frames for the actions it requires public notice requirements are expanded beyond the current notice of an exclusivity decision to include copies of the written request the secretary must also publicly identify any drug with developed pediatric formulation that studies had demonstrated to be safe and effective for children that an applicant has not introduced onto the market within one year new dispute resolution process includes referral to the pediatric advisory committee the internal review committee which fdaaa title iv requires the secretary to establish must review all written requests the secretary with that committee must track all pediatric studies and labeling changes according to specified questions other provisions require applicants to submit along with the report of requested studies all postmarket adverse event reports regarding that drug refine study scope to allow the secretary to include preclinical studies and except from exclusivity any drug with another exclusivity that is to expire in less than nine months fdaaa amends phsa section 409i as discussed ea rlier which required that the secretary through the nih director and in consultation with the commissioner and pediatric research experts list approved drugs for which pediatric studies are needed to assess safety and effectiveness it changes the specifications from an annual list of approved drugs to list revised every three years of priority study needs in pediatric therapeutics including drugs or indications if the secretary determines there is need for pe diatric information for drug for which pediatric studies have not been completed the secretary must either issue proposal to award grant to conduct such

that revise fdas approach to advisory committee members conflicts of interest fda uses advisory committees to provide the agency with independent advice from outside experts on issues related to human and veterinary drugs biological products medical devices and food advisory committees make recommendations to fda which fda may or may not follow to be credible and useful many say that fda must eliminate or reduce conflicts of interest in its committees however others note that the most expert members in the field are of ten those involved directly or indirectly in the activities about which fda is seeking advice creating the potential for such conflicts in 2006 and 2007 the media reported that fda advisory comm ittees are biased in favor of drug approval and that many committee members have conflicts of interest 21 prior to the passage of fdaaa the law generally required that committee members be free from conflicts of interest but allowed for exceptions to that rule under specific circumstances conflict of interest might have required potential committee member to disclose the conflict refrain from voting andor not participate in committee depending on the nature of the conflict the law was articulated primarily in three locations 1 the federal advisory committee act 5 usc appendix faca 2 the fda advisory co mmittee policy 21 usc 355n which applied only to trials of drugs and biologicsnot devices and 3 law governing special government employeessuch as advisory committee membersacts affecting personal financial interest 18 usc 208 fdaaa inserts new provision into chapter vi i subchapter of the ffdca effective october 1 2007 the provision changes both the process of recruiting advisory committee members as well as some circumstances under which and processes by which conflictofinterest waivers may be granted the new provisions repeal 21usc 355n but move much of its substance to new location the effect is that the requirements previously only applicable to drug and biologic advisory committees apply to committees providing advice on all types of products that fda regulates fdaaa defines an advisory comm ittee as facacovered entity that provides the secretary with advice and recommendations regarding activities of the fda and defines financial interest as defined under 18 usc 208a this definition covers activities such as persons or their family members current or future employment tr usteeship or directorship on its face it does not apply to activities such as stock ownership former employment or receipt of grant or contract although fdas regulations do require disclosure of these types of activities fdaaa requires advisory committee member recruitment mechanisms to be focused on reaching experts from areas such as academia medical research institutions and public interest and 21 see for example shankar vedantam group says fda advisory panels show bias toward drug approvals washington post august 9 2006 available online at

exceptions to the financial conflict rules such as the use of waivers or written certifications fdaaa requires advisory committee members full financial disclosure prior to meeting on related matter

committee with essential expertise fdaaa restricts the perc entage of committees membership that may consist of people who have received one of three types of exceptions to the financial conflict

expands requirements for the registration of clinical trials and adds requirements for the publication of their results the text of the title was arrived at after extensive discussions which required an understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry and medical product development scientific inquiry is at its best an objective exercise in which results are not preordained and all valid findings are published medical product development depends upon traditional scientific methods and product sponsors are typically business enterprises prior to marketing product sponsors are required to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of their products typically through clinical trials however both sponsors and medical journals may be reluctant to publish the results of trials that fail to show that products perform better than placebo or that raise too many safety concerns in 2004 congress and others raised questions about the safety and effectiveness of several fdaapproved products eg antidepressants antiinflammatory drugs and cardiac stents about which unfavorable trial results had not been publicly disclosed 22 the issue of public access to all trial results regard less of their findings then gained significant traction prior to the enactment of fdaaa clinical trial registration was required at the outset of certain clinical trials testing drugs to treat lifethreatening diseases or conditions this requirement was criticized because it did not mandate the registration of broader range of trials because it contained enforcement mechanism and because it did not require the posting of trial results title viii of fdaaa contains provisions related to all three criticisms fdaaas provisions apply to trials involving not only drugs but also devices and biologics the act includes requirements pertaining to most clinical trials beyond phase i in general fdaaa requires that specified information be submitted by the trials responsible party rp usually the trial sponsor to the nih director following submission the nih director is to make the information publicly available via the internet with specified exceptions enforcement mechanisms are provided for noncompliant rps for the purpose of carrying out the clinical trials database provisions fdaaa authorizes 10000000 for each fiscal year further details of the way that fdaaa amends current law are discussed below in subsections entitled registry results coordination compliance and enforcement and other items g20g142g144g146g156g157g155g162g561 fdaaa requires the expansion of the existing data bank

build on decades of incremental additions to fdas regulatory scope and its ability to identify drug safety problems and to correct or minimize them since the 1938 passage of the ffdca the manufacturer of new drug has had to demonstrate to fda the products safety before the agency woul d approve it for marketing in the united states in 1962 the harriskefauver amendments to the ffdca added product effectiveness to the premarket requirements fda cannot assert that any drug is completely safe instead it considers whether given the available information the drug is safe enough when used correctly by the types of individuals and for the diseases or conditions for which it was tested fda and others must remain alert to new information as those drugs are used more widely because until very large number of individuals have taken drug rare adverse effect may not occur or very common condition may not be recognized as drugassociated prior to fdaaa the law allowed fda to require postmarket study as condition of its initial approval of marketing application but did not authorize fda to add such requirements after approval the law did not allow fda to require that manufacturers submit drug advertising material for review or approval before dissemination neither did it provide for civil penalties authorizing only the revocation of approval or licensing or the threat of revocation to compel manufacturers to change labeling or advertising

fdaaa requires the secretary to establish processing and ingredient standards update labeling requirements for pet food and establish an early warning and surveillance system to identify adulteration and outbreaks of illness associated with pet food the secretary is to work with states to improve the safety of produce and strengthen state food safety programs the act requires the creation of registry for reportable information on foods including human and animal products with safety problems that allows for the identification of the supply chain of the reportable food alerts are to be issued for such foods with records maintained and available for inspection additional provisions require attention to aquaculture and seafood inspection environmental risks associated with genetically

fdaaa provision adds new use to the older fda priority review mechanism rather than or in addition to providing the possible financial benefit of priority review to sponsor for its tropical disease product application fdaaa directs fda to reward that sponsor for developing that product by giving it priority review voucher that it can use for any one proposed subsequent product that would not otherwise qualify for priority review the new provision further alters fdas priority review mechanism by allowing the tropical disease product sponsor to transfer the voucher including by sale to another entity the secretary is to establish user fee program and set the fee amounts for sponsors of human drug applications that are the subject of priority review voucher the third topic addressed is the regulation of genetic testing fdaaa requires that if the specified secretarys advisory committee does not complete and submit its report and recommendations regarding regulation and oversight of genetic testing to the secretary by july 2008 the secretary is to enter into contract with the iom to conduct study and issue report on the topic the fourth topic consists of technical amendments to sections of the phsa 42 usc 201 et seq making five changes though the section is titled nih technical amendments the first provision does not apply to nih but is rather correction to pl 109417 the pandemic and all hazards preparedness act and applies to the hospital preparedness program administered by the hhs assistant secretary for preparedness and response the provision amends phsa section

research grants and not each degr eegranting program at th institution it further indicates that leaves of absence are to be subtracted when calculating the average time between graduate study and receipt of doctoral degree the fifth topic addressed is severability it directs that if any provision of fdaaa is found to be unconstitutional the remainder of the act shall remain in effect
