basic block grant is not adjusted for inflation or changes in the cash welfare caseload see caseload below it has lost 25 of its va lue purchasing power to inflation from fy1997 through fy2008 though tanf is best known for funding cash welfare payments for needy families with children the block grant and associated state moe funds are used for wide variety of benefits and activities in fy2006 expenditures on activities associated with traditional cash welfare programcash benefits administrative costs and spending on work activities totaled only 15 billion little more than half of total tanf and moe funds tanf also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been or are at risk of abuse and neglect cash welfare caseload in june 2008 17 million families consisting of 39 million recipients received tanf or moefunded cash welfare the cash welfare caseload is very heterogenous the type of family historically thought of as the typical cash welfare familyone with an unemployed adult recipientaccounted for less than half 45 of all cash welfare families in fy2006 another 13 of cash welfare families had an employed adult while 42 of all families had adult recipient childonly families include those with disabled adults receiving supplemental security income ssi adults who are nonparents eg grandparents aunts uncles caring for children and families consisting of citizen children and noncitizen parents cash welfare benefits tanf cash benefits are set by states in july 2006 the maximum monthly benefit for family of 3 ranged from 923 in alaska to 170 in mississippi benefits in all states represent fraction of povertylevel income in the median state illinois the maximum monthly benefit for family of three of 396 represents 29 of povertylevel income cash welfare work requirements tanf requires states to engage 50 of all families and 90 of twoparent families in work activities through fy2006 these participation standards were reduced for caseload reduction from fy1995 in fy2006 states achieved average work participation rates of 325 for all families and 459 for twoparent families beginning in fy2007 the 50 and 90 standards will be reduced for caseload reduction from fy2005 rather than fy1995 requiring many states to raise participation to meet these standards

nationally the available data do not show an increase in the cash welfare caseload as yet the latest official data on the cash welfare caseload from the department of health and human services hhs show that from june 2007 to june 2008 the cash welfare caseload had declined nationally 25 however more recent data suggests that the cash welfare caseload is rising in at least some states in florida the cash welfare caseload in december 2008 was 10 above the june 2008 level with much of the increase occurring during the three months october to december on yeartoyear basis the cash welfare caseload in california increased 59 from september 2007 to september 2008 on the other hand more recent data from new york the state with the second largest cash welfare caseload show increase through september 2008 the current level and historical trends in the cash welfare caseload is discussed later in this report

tanf has provided states with fixed funding since fy1997 the sharp decline in the cash welfare caseload see the discussion below meant that money was freedup from lower cash welfare costs that were allocated to other benefits and services that could be paid for with tanf funds these include wide range of benefits and services for disadvantaged families including financial aid for child care refundable tax credits for the working poor transportation aid pre kindergarten programs afterschool programs activities to help families who experienced or were atrisk of child abuse and neglect pregnancy prevention programs responsible fatherhood programs and programs to promote healthy marriages the fixed nature of tanf funding imposes some financial risk on states generally states bear the risk of increased costs from cash welfare caseload rise however tanf provides states with two sources of extra funding in the case of such as cash welfare caseload increase first states were given the ability to build up reserve funds with unused tanf grants that could be saved without fiscal year limit the latest data on these funds are fairly old september 30 2007 with unspent and uncommitted state balances totaling 19 billion they also provide only small cushion given the size of tanf federal spending and state maintenance of effort moe spending about 25 billion per year

grants for states that meet criteria of economic needeither high nd rising unemployment or increased food stamp renamed supplemental nutrition assistance program caseloads this permits the federal government to share in the risks of caseload rise stemming from economic circumstances the maximum contingency fund grant for fiscal year is 20 of the states basic block grant however the contingency fund was not used during the last recession 2001 currently 43 states meet the economic need criteria for eligibility for contingency funds as of middecember 2008 11 states have either received or indicated that they would apply for funds states that do not draw upon these extra sources of funds can also finance an increase in cash welfare costs by reducing tanf spending on some of the other activities listed above

of the current fiscal year fy2009 the contingency fund had 13 billion the congressional budget office cbo estimates that the fund will remain solvent through the end of fy2009 but run out of money sometime in fy2010 however these estimates are subject to lot of uncertainty whether the fund will be exhausted depends on whether few large states such as california and new york currently not drawing contingency funds begin to do so california is currently economically eligible new york is not for example if only the 11 states that are currently either drawing funds or have applied for funds receive them for the remainder of the fiscal year the fund will be able to pay them their full grant all year under this scenario balance of more than 700 million will remain at the end of this fiscal year however if california is added to the current 11 states drawing funds and they receive their maximum contingency fund grantcalifornia can draw up to 747 million in yearthe fund would be exhausted before the end of fy2009 there are other scenarios such as new york becoming eligible and some other large states also drawing funds in which the fund would be exhausted before the end of fy2009 as well g25g145g138g157g561g146g156g561g157g145g142g561g515g7g161g140g142g156g156g561g15g17g7g516g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g501g561 on august 8 2008 the department of health and human services hhs proposed to eliminate what is known as the excess moe credit towa rd the tanf work participation standards tanf sets numerical work participation standards for its welfare caseload 50 for all families 90 for its twoparent families for each state this standard is reduced one percentage point for each percent decline in its welfare caseload since fy2005 the excess moe credit is basically an addon to the caseload reduction credit allowing states to claim credit for cash welfare cases funded by state funds in excess of what they are required to spend under tanf maintenance of effort moe rules it reduces tanf work participation standards beyond the reduction allowed under the basic caseload reduction credit the excess moe credit is not part of tanf law it was created by regulations promulgated by the partment of health and human services hhs in 1999 hypothetical example this example shows how the caseload reduction credit and the excess moe credit could affect the fy2007 participation standards on the basis of caseload reduction between fy2005 and fy2006 for simplicity assume caseload in fy2005 of 100

families in fy2006 10 were funded by excess moe the caseload reduction credit would be based on 100 families in fy2005 and 80 families in fy2006 yielding credit of 10 percentage points for normal caseload reduction and 10 percentage points for the 10 families funded by excess moe that is the state would receive 20 percentage point credit reducing their effective after credit participation

yes the 1996 welfare reform law gave states the option of requiring drug tests for welfare recipients and penalizing those who fail such tests see section 902 of pl 104193 in addition to this option the 1996 welfare reform law contained two other provisions related to drug abuse and tanf applicants or recipients the law established lifetime ban on eligibility for tanf and food stamps for those convicted of drugrelated felony however states may either opt out entirely or modify and limit this lifetime ban see section 115 of pl 104193 further tanf allows states to establish individual

there are federal rules that help determine the amount of tanf cash benefits paid to family there are also federal rules that require states to use tanf to pay cash benefits though all states do so benefit amounts are determined solely by the states table 4 shows the maximum monthly tanf cash benefit by state and family size as of july 20062 the benefit amounts shown are those for single parent family with children some states vary their benefit amounts for other family types such as twoparent families or childonly cases states also vary their benefits by other factors such as housing costs and substate geography in general the table shows the highest benefit amounts paid in the state though the michigan amount is for wayne county detroit nd the new york benefit is for new york city3 most states base tanf cash benefit amounts on family size paying bigger families larger cash benefits on the presumption that larger families have greater financial needs the maximum monthly cash benefit is usually paid to family that receives other income eg earned or unearned income and complies with program rules families with income other than tanf often are paid reduced benefit moreover some families are financially sanctioned for failure to meet program requirement eg work requirement and are also paid lower benefit the table also shows the benefit amounts relative to povertylevel income tanf pays family in cash only fraction of poverty level income as officially determined and published by the department of health and human services for family of three in the median state illinois ranked 26th among the 50 states and district of columbia july 2006 monthly payment of 396 equalled 286 of povertylevel income at the extreme alaskas benefit equalled the highest percentage of povertylevel income 534 of alaskas poverty guideline which is higher than that for the lower 48 states whereas mississippi paid the lowest percentage 123 for family of three 2 states are not required to report to the federal government their cash welfare benefit amounts in either the tanf state plan under section 402 of the social security act or in annual program reports under section 407 of the social security act the benefit amounts in this report are from the urban institutes welfare rules database 3 in michigan higher maximum benefits were paid in washtenaw county 489 per month for family

the tanf statute requires states to have 50 of their caseload meet standards of participation in work or activitiesthat is family member must be in specified activities for minimum number of hours4 there is separate participation standard that applies to the twoparent portion of states caseload requiring 90 of the states twoparent caseload to meet participation standards states that fail the tanf work participation standards are penalized by reduction in their block grant amounts however the statutory work participation standards are reduced by caseload reduction credit the caseload reduction credit reduces the participation standard one percentage point for each percent decline in the caseload through fy2006 states were given credit for caseload declines that occurred since fy1995 beginning in fy2007 states will be credited only with caseload declines that have occurred since fy2005 the fy2007 effective aftercredit standard will be based on caseload declines from fy2005 to fy2006 the fy2008 effective standard will be ba sed on caseload declines from fy2005 to fy2007 states are not given credit for caseload declines that result from new restrictions on eligibility enacted by states since fy2005 the currently available caseload data do not tell what the effective aftercredit participation standards will be for fy2007 however cash welfare caseloads have declined over the past year from fy2005 to fy2006 the national average decline in the overall cash welfare caseload was about 6 if the average state is given caseload reduction credit equal to this decline the average state will see its effective participation standards reduced by six percentage pointsfrom 50 to 44

in fy2006 the national average work participation rate for all families achieved by states was 325 the participation rate within tanf achieved nationwide for the twoparent portion of the caseload was 459 this implies that many states would have to raise their participation rates from historical levels to comply with the fy2007 tanf work participation standards in fy2006 most states were in compliance with tanf work participation standards but indiana and guam failed to meet the standard for all families and arkansas the district of columbia and guam failed to meet the standards for twoparent families see table b6 in appendix b for fy2006 participation rates for all states fy2006 was the last fiscal year before the new work participation standard rules placed into law by the dra became effective see above 4 some families are excluded from the participation rate calculation
