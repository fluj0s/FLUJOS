provided an opportunity for qaeda and other terrorist groups to infiltrate the balkans however us and european peacekeeping troops aid and the prospect of euroatlantic integration have helped to bring more stability to the region in recent years moreover the september 11 2001 attacks on the united states underscored for the countries of the region the dangers of global terrorism and resulted in increased us attention and aid to fight the terrorist threat in part as result many experts currently do not view the balkans as key region harboring or funding terrorists in contrast to the middle east south asia southeast asia and western europe however experts note that the region may play secondary role in terrorist plans as transit point for terrorists as well as for recuperation moreover they agree that the regions continuing problems continue to leave it vulnerable to terrorist groups in the future us officials have cited the threat of terrorism in the balkans as an important reason for the need for continued us engagement in the region in addition to the need to take steps to directly combat terrorist infrastructure in the region us of ficials say that us efforts to bring stability to the region also help to fight terrorism they note that political instability weak political and law enforcement institutions and poverty provide breeding ground for terrorist groups us objectives are also outlined in the 911 commission report and the presidents national strategy for combating terrorism which calls for the united states to work with other countries to deny terrorists sponsorship support and sanctuary as well as working to diminish the underlying conditions that terrorists seek to exploit the united states has variety of instruments to fight terrorism in the balkans one is the direct involvement of us troops in kosovo the united states provides bilateral counterterrorism assistance to the countries of the region the overall us aid program to the region aimed at bringing stability through strengthening the rule of law and promoting economic reform also serves to combat the sometimes lawless climate in which terrorists can thrive us aid helps to develop bosnias export control regime including over weapons of mass destruction and dualuse technology the united states has encouraged regional cooperation on terrorism and international crime through the southeast european cooperation initiative seci in the longer term efforts to stabilize the region and thereby perhaps reduce its attractiveness to terrorists are also dependent upon integrating it into euroatlantic institutions the second session of the 110 th congress may consider legislation affecting possible terrorist threats in the balkans including in the fy2009 foreign aid

and political instability provided an opportunity for qaeda and other terrorist groups to infiltrate the balkans however us and european peacekeeping troops aid and the prospect of euroatlantic integration have helped to bring more stability to the region in recent years moreover the september 11 2001 attacks on the united states underscored for the countries of the region the dangers of global terrorism and resulted in increased us attention and aid to fight the terrorist threat in addition some countries outside of the region especially saudi arabia which were formerly key sources of terrorists and terrorist financing have cracked down on islamic militants which has in turn had positive impact on the balkans as result of these factors many experts currently do not view the balkans as key region harboring or funding terrorists at least when compared to th middle east north africa south asia southeast asia and western europe nevertheless experts caution that the region may continue to play role in terrorist plans largely as transit route for terrorists as well as for bases for attacks in other regions such as western europe there have also been efforts to recruit people from the region into terrorist groups moreover observers agree that the regions continuing problems leave it vulnerable to terrorist groups in the future the july 2004 report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states known as the 911 commission referred to central and eastern europe as region potentially vulnerable to terrorists due to significant muslim populations and weak border controls and security services 1 this problem may increase if terrorists currently concentrated in iraq disperse to the balkans and other regions some sources especially serbian and russian experts and officials have claimed that the balkans continue to form more dangerous threat to the united states and neighboring western europe than is usually acknowledged2 although large numbers of indigenous muslims live in the balkans due to its poverty and instability the region has not attracted large numbers of muslim immigrants who have been an important source of recruits for islamic extremists in western europe moreover opposition to terrorism has been strong among bosniaks bosnian muslims and albanians the largest indigenous muslim groups in the balkans these groups are generally more secular in outlook than muslims elsewhere most view themselves as part of europe and are grateful for the perceived us role in defending them against serbian aggression in the 1990s and for the continuing us contribution to the security of their countries charges of terrorism are often used as political weapons among countries or ethnic groups to try to attract international support for their cause for example serbian and bosnian serb politicians often make charges of qaeda training camps in bosnia and kosovo in an effort to discredit bosniaks and albanians for their part bosniak and albanian leaders deny the charges and accuse the serbs of supporting terrorism by harboring indicted war criminals some observers say that the terrorist threat is in fact much less serious than the regions more pressing problems such as corruption poverty and potential political instability they say that the international focus on the terrorist threat may divert attention from these more relevant issues 1 911 commission report p 366367 for text of the report see httpwww911commissiongovreportindexhtm 2 discussions with us and european officials

focus on terrorism may have some positive aspects it may push countries in the balkans to cooperate zealously with the united states on terrorism issues in hopes of securing us support for their regional goals and euroatlantic integration in addition there may be additional political support in the united states and other countries for dealing with the regions problems if they are viewed as potential source of terrorism given these factors perhaps of greater concern to most experts than the existence of significant muslim population in the balkans is the weakness of government institutions rampant corruption and poverty however despite these difficulties the countries in the region have provided very good cooperation with the united states in the global war on terrorism according to us officials3 consistent with security council re solutions adopted in the post911 fight against terrorism these countries have worked with the united states and other countries to arrest or expel terrorist suspects shut down nongovernmental organizations linked with terrorism and freeze or seize assets of persons and groups suspected of terrorist financing this report focuses on three countries bosnia and herzegovina albania and serbia including serbias kosovo province which is currently under international supervision the report deals with the role of islamic terrorist groups such as qaeda rather than indigenous nationalist groups pursuing local or regional objectives g4g152g156g151g146g138g561g138g151g141g561g10g142g155g163g142g144g152g159g146g151g138g561 after the breakup of communist yugoslavia bosnia and herzegovina was torn apart by civil war between bosniaks bosnian muslims serbs and croats from 1992 to 1995 the war resulted in the deaths of many thousands of persons and the displacement and impoverishment of large parts of the population desperate bosniakdominated bosnian government facing an international arms embargo and outgunned by breakaway bosnian serb forces accepted the help of iran as well as several thousand islamic radicals mercenaries and others the 1995 dayton peace accords which ended the conflict required all foreign forces to leave bosnia most did but some islamic radicals remained behind it is estimated that about 700 to 1000 former fighters stayed behind in bosnia after the war and became bosnian citizens by marrying bosnian women others received citizenship through bribing bosnian officials some qaeda operatives in bosnia had connections to members of bosnias intelligence service another legacy of bosniak wartime cooperation with islamic militants the experience of the bosnia conflict has also had an impact on terrorist groups worldwide bin laden and other qaeda figures mention the bosnian war as place where qaeda was active and as an important militant islamic cause terrorist recruiting videos often include footage of combat in bosnia in addition to fighters bosniaks also received assistance during and after the war from islamic charities and humanitarian organizations many of them from saudi arabia some of these groups served as fronts for qaeda which used them for planning attacks in bosnia and elsewhere in

western countries may enhance terrorist recruiting efforts4 according to us officials the us embassy in sarajevo and us military bases in bosnia were subject to several terrorist threats after september 11 2001 however bosnian opposition to terrorism has been broad despite the stilldeep ethnic divide in the country the united states still enjoys strong reservoir of support in bosnia especially among bosniaks for bringing peace to the country and providing postwar aid the largely secular and european outlook among bosniaks has caused friction with foreign islamic extremists efforts by the islamists to recruit bosniaks into their organizations have met with limited success 5 some bosniaks fear that terrorists will give bosnia bad name in europe thereby hindering their ability to travel there nd setting back bosnian efforts to join european institutions on the other hand some experts are concerned that widespread unemployment among bosniak youth coupled with dissatisfaction with us foreign policy could aid terrorist recruitment the 2005 state department terrorism report discusses an islamist extremist organization called active islamic youth which is associated with former foreign islamic fighters in bosnia it says that the group engages in outreach activities aimed at bosnian youth and publishes materials promoting islamic fundamentalism religious intolerance and antiwestern rhetoric in 2006 joint uscroatian intelligence report reportedly said the terrorist groups were attempting to recruit socalled white muslims from bosnia and other balkan countries whose physical appearance might arouse less suspicion in europe than person of middle eastern appearance bosnian officials have offered mixed assessments of this threat some say that it is significant concern while others admit it as possibility but note that they have concrete evidence so far for widespread recruiting efforts of this kind 6 in addition to facing the same problems of poverty and corruption as other countries in the region bosnia also suffers from institutional failings th at are result of bosnias recent development the dayton peace accords divided bosnia and herzegovina into two semiautonomous entitiesthe largely bosniakcroat federation and the mainly bosnian serb republika srpskawith weak central government critics have charged that this structure has stymied bosnias efforts to develop effective government institutions the 2006 state department country reports on terrorism notes that while bosnias counterterrorism cooperation with the united states was good the weakness of the bosnian state made it vulnerable to exploitation as terrorist safe haven or as potential staging ground for terrorist operations in europe us and international efforts to strengthen the central government have been resisted by the bosnian serbs who frequently charge the bosniaks with terrorist ties in may 2005 bosnian serb police chief dragomir andan claimed that the terrorists who carried out the march 2004 madrid bombings had been trained at alleged qaeda ca mps in bosnia and herzegovina eu police and other officials in bosnia said that they had seen evidence to support such charges such charges have coincided with an ongoing effort by international officials in bosnia to put the police key pillar of bosnian serb leaders power under central government control

terrorism in his 2002 state of the union address president bush singled out bosnia specifically for praise for its cooperation with the united states in january 2002 bosnia handed over to the united states bensayah belkacem whom us officials believed could be highranki ng figure in qaeda as well as five other suspects the suspects were originally from algeria although four gained bosnian citizenship all are currently interned at us facilities in guantanamo bay cuba the rendition of these men to the united states was sharply criticized by bosnian legal experts as violation of the rule of law as has their continued detention in cuba 7 bosnian prosecutors formally exonerated the men in 2004 after an investigation and bosnia formally requested that the four bosnian citizens be released from us custody in february 2005 the united states has so far rejected bosnias request in cooperation with us investigators bosnian authorities have investigated islamic charities suspected of having ties with bin laden in march 2002 bosnian police raided bosnian offices of the benevolence international foundation bif which is headquartered in illinois police found weapons military manuals fraudulent passport photographs of bin laden and other items bif leader enaam arnaout who was charged in us courts with concealing his relationship to alqaida received an 11year sentence

bosnia another raid this time on the sarajevo office of the saudi high commission for relief netted antisemitic and antiamerican materials as well as photos of us military installations 8 other qaeda

alharamain and almasjed alaqsa charity foundation and taibah international all qaedalinked organizations experts note that when some qaeda front organizations are closed down others often spring up to replace them the 2005 state department terrorism report said that the government remained vigilant against previously shut ngos renewing their activities authorities continued to investigate other organizations private companies and individuals for links to terrorist financing in february 2005 bosnian state and entitylevel governments agreed to form single joint database of all ngos and

that iran sharply scaled back its activities in bosnia soon after the end of the bosnian war in 199510 in 2005 the bosnian government set up citizenship review commission to strip bosnian citizenship from naturalized citizens who fraudulently obtained their citizenship have substantial ties to bosnia at present or obtained their citizenship because of government error or misconduct the commission reviews the citizenship status of former islamic fighters and withdraws citizenship when appropriate abou t 1300 cases fell within the commissions mandate in august 2007 bosnian officials said that they had revoked the citizenship of 613 persons who were granted citizenship improperly 11 those persons whose citizenship has been revoked must leave bosnia or be deported but bosnian authorities reportedly do not know the whereabouts of many of them because the addresses given on their citizenship applications are often out of date some of them may reportedly have changed their names gone into hiding are residing in other countries or have already been detained by authorities in other countries as suspected terrorists in 2006 bosnia deported two former islamic fighters including one who had returned to bosnia in 2005 after serving time in french prison for terrorist bombing in the 1990s in december 2007 bosnia deported another former foreign fighter to algeria others have been able to avoid deportation through lengthy appeals process some observers have asserted that the push to deport the remaining foreign fighters in bosnia is due to strong us pressure in august 2007 raff i gregorian senior us diplomat in bosnia said that there were more than ten and less than 100 qaeda supporters among the former islamic fighters in september 2007 bosnian newspaper claimed that bosnian central government security minister tarik sadovic estimated the number of persons posing threat to national security in bosnia was less than 50 not all of whom still remained in bosnia 12 in october 2005 bosnian federation police arrested two terrorist suspects with links to terrorist networks in western europe and confiscated weapons and explosives one is swedish citizen of bosnian origin and the other turkish national living in denmark they were accused of planning terrorist attack in bosnia or elsewhere in europe with the aim of forcing bosnia or other countries to pull their troops out of iran and afghanistan the men went on trial in july 2006 they were convicted in january 2007 and sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from eight to fifteen years in recent years

money laundering the bosnian state court and the state prosecutors office also deal with terrorism cases however most statelevel bodies with the partial exception of the state border service are not fully staffed or operational and lack funds resources and qualified personnel13 bosnia and herzegovina is party to the 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism the 2005 state department terrorism report noted that although bosnia possesses counterterrorism laws prosecutors have had difficulty in linking illegal activities to specific terrorism charges as result they have sometimes sought to convict suspects on such charges as illegal arms possession arms smuggling and conspiracy which often result in lighter sentences g3g149g139g138g151g146g138g561 as in the case of bosnia instability in albania gave foothold to qaeda in the 1990s poor internal security lax border controls and high rates of crime produced an environment conducive to terrorist activity some foreign islamic extremists used albania as safe haven and gained albanian citizenship some former albanian offici als were thought to maintain links with these foreign extremists islamic

have been only passing through serbia noting that the country lies on key transportation routes between europe and asia but that they could not be certain whether he had contacts with terrorist

have attempted to recruit followers among kosovo albanian muslims but these attempts have met with limited success ethnic albanian nationalists have committed terrorist attacks on serbian civilians in kosovo but there is little evidence so far that they are working with qaeda or other radical islamic groups some observers have expressed concern that powerful ethnic albanian organized criminal groups from kosovo albania and macedonia which play key roles in organized crime in europe and the united states could form an alliance with terrori st groups but so far such links have been detected

entering kosovo pisg in cooperation with unmik increased monitoring of 11 foreign ngos suspected of extremism and issued regulations restricting their activities including the appropriation of one mosque it also required each ngo to submit docume ntation that explains its projects and shows its bank accounts the kosovo islamic community kic evaluated foreign ngos and prohibited them from using

the men have been recaptured but shiti remains at large in early 2008 the united states and most eu countries may recognize kosovo independence under plan for supervised independence unmik may be succeeded by the international civilian representative icr that will lack unmiks direct administrative control however the icr would have the power to void any decisions or laws of the kosovo government that are inconsistent with the plan as well as the power to remove kosovo government officials who act in way that is inconsistent with the settlement the icrs mandate would last until an

reason for the need for continued us engagement in the region in addition to the need to combat terrorist infrastructure in the region us officials say that us efforts to bring stability to the region also help to fight terrorism they note that political instability weak political and law enforcement institutions and poverty provide breeding ground for terrorist groups these objectives are also outlined in the presidents national strategy for combating terrorism which calls for the united states to work with other countries to deny terrorists sponsorship support and sanctuary as well as to work to diminish the underlying conditions that terrorists seek to exploit the united states has variety of instruments to fight terrorism in the balkans one is the direct involvement of us troops natoled peacekeeping forces in bosnia and kosovo dubbed sfor and kfor respectively have provided important resources for antiterrorist efforts in the region nato troops and intelligence services work with their local counterparts and independently to track down and arrest suspected terrorists the powerful influence exercised by international officials in bosnia and kosovo gives the united states more freedom to arrest and deport terrorists than in many european countries which might object on civil liberties or other grounds sfor withdrew from bosnia in late 2004 and was re placed by an euled force the changeover resulted in the departure almost all of the us troops in bosnia the european unionled successor force to sfor has counterterrorism as part of its mandate in kosovo kfor has 16000 troops including about 1600 us troops which are expected to remain in kosovo after the provinces status is resolved kfor may eventu ally be replaced by an euled force although us and european officials stress that kfor will remain in kosovo for some time after status is determined the reduction of direct international control over kosovo will require the united states and other countries to establish close links with kosovo government structures the united states and its allies have made the creation of effective mechanism for fighting organized crime and terrorism one of its objectives in kosovo the overall us aid program to the region aimed at bringing stability to the region through strengthening the rule of law and promoting economic reform also serves to combat the sometimes lawless climate in the region in which terrorists can thrive for fy2008 the president requested 3295 million for bosnia 20 million for albania 5325 million for serbia and 15165 million for kosovo the relatively large sum for kosovo for fy2008 and an additional 279 million for kosovo in an fy2007 supplemental funding request is owing to us desire to support kosovo quickly after its

thereby perhaps reduce its attractiveness to terrorists are also dependent upon integrating it into euroatlantic institutions the prospect of euroatlantic integration for the region is encouraging these countries to take steps that will enable them to more effectively fight terrorism the european union has stated its goal of incorporating all of the countries of the region into the eu although this prospect seems long way off with the possible exception of croatia all of the countries of the region are seeking or may one day seek nato membership as well three na to candidate statesalbania croatia and macedoniaare linked in the us brokered adriatic charter which is aimed at improving their qualifications for nato membership the adriatic charter countries have contributed troops to peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan in addition albania and macedonia have contributed soldiers to usled operations in iraq one or all of the adriatic charter countries may be invited to join nato at the alliances april 2008 summit most observers believe that croatias qualifications for membership are stronger than those of the other two countries bosnia and herzegovina lacks the prospect of na to membership until it unifies its police forces implements key political reforms and cooperates with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia nevertheless it has deployed small

legislation on global counterterrorism issues providing funding and oversight for programs aimed at combating terrorism worldwide mainly in regions such as the middle east and south asia where the threat is deemed to be the greatest but also in other regions such as the balkans in addition congress has appropriated foreign aid for the balkans aimed at enhancing stability and improving the rule of law in the region objectives that also bolster counterterrorism efforts since the deployment of us forces to bosnia in 1995 in annual appropriations bills congress has authorized to president to withhold aid to bosnia if he certifies that the bosnian federation the bosniakcroat entity within bosnia and herzegovina is not complying with provisions of the dayton peace accords that require the withdrawal of foreign forces from bosnia or if bosnian intelligence cooperation with state sponsors of terrorism or terrorist organizations has not ceased the administration has not withheld us aid to bosnia on the basis of these provisions g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the united states and its allies have been able to reduce the terrorist threat from the balkans over the past decade for several reasons some of which may be applicable to other regions and others not the us insistence that all foreign forces leave bosnia in 1995 backed up by congressional aid conditions may have reduced the possible threat to us forces in bosnia in the immediate postwar period as well as removed serious threat to bosnian stabilization efforts us military interventions in bosnia and kosovo were perceived by muslims in the region to be undertaken to benefit them thereby bolstering proamerican sentiment most elites in the region both muslim and otherwise view the regions future as integration in euroatlantic institutions making them especially eager to help the united states fight terrorism in the region however observers note that complacency would be unwise conditions could emerge that could increase the terrorist threat in the future the stability of the region is fragile and law enforcement and other public institutions are still weak some terrorists now fighting in iraq may decide to redeploy to other regions including the balkans in the future conversely future recruits from the balkans could also go to iraq to join the insurgency terrorists could obtain weapons and explosives from the regions thriving black market in such items for use in attacks in western europe or other regions
