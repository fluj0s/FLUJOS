rate or sgr formula3 under the formula if cumulative spending on medicare physician services since april 1996 exceeds cumulative target expenditures over the same period reduction in the update for physician payments is required ie reduction in the conversion factor this has been the case since 2002 however congress has overridden the reduction since 2003 the previous override included in the medicare medicaid and schip extension act of 2007 pl 110173 mmsea increased the update to the conversion factor for medicare physician payment by 05 compared with 2007 rates for the first six months

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22904 medicare advantage mppa phases out medicare indirect medical education ime payments to private health plans ime payments account for number of factors that may legitimately increase costs in teaching hospitals currently under the statutory rules for medicare payments to medicare advantage ma plans an ma plan whose payment is based on medicare feeforservice rates also may be eligible to receive payment for ime in addition medicare pays teaching hospitals directly for the cost of ime when an ma enrollee is treated in the hospital beginning in 2010 this act requires that the medicare advantage benchmarks the maximum amount medicare is willing to pay private plan to provide required medicare benefits for every county be adjusted to phase out the cost of indirect medical education ime the amount phasedout each year will be based on ratio of 1 specified percentage 060 in the first year relative to 2 the proportion of per capita costs in original medicare in the county that ime costs represent the effect of the ratio is to phase out higher proportion of ime costs in areas where ime makes up smaller percentage of per capita spending in original medicare after 2010 the numerator phaseout percentage will be increased by 060 percentage points each year this provision does not apply to the benchmarks for ma plans in the pace program programs of allinclusive care for the elderly mppa also changes access requirements for private feeforservice plans pffs currently pffs unlike most other ma plans are not required to form networks of medical providers to meet certain access requirements pffs plans both nonemployer and employersponsored may fulfill access requirements by either establishing payment rates for medical providers that are less than the rates under original medicare or by developing contracts and agreements with sufficient number and range of providers within category to provide covered services under the terms and conditions of the plan any provider who before delivering service knows that beneficiary is enrolled in the crs4 pffs plan and has been given or has reasonable access to the pffs plans terms and conditions for participation is deemed provider beginning in year 2011 this act requires nonemployersponsored ma pffs plans operating in areas with at least two other plans that have provider networks to meet medicare access requirements by establishing written contracts with providers non employer sponsored ma pffs plans operating in areas with less than two other plans that have provider networks may continue to meet medicare access requirements through deeming beginning in year 2011 employersponsored ma pffs plans will be required to establish written contracts with providers employersponsored ma pffs plans will longer be able to meet access requirements in whole or in part by establishing payment rates that are equal to or greater than those under original medicare beginning in 2010 any pffs plan that chooses to contract with providers is required to meet the general access requirements applicable to ma coordinated care plans httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22904 cbo combined the savings estimates for the changes to ime and pffs it estimated that these provisions will save 125 billion over the 20082013 period and 475 billion over the 20082018 period the act also reduces the initial funding to the ma regional plan stabilization fund to one dollar when the fund was first established in the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 pl 108173 mma it had an initial funding level of 10 billion subsequent legislation reduced this amount to 179 billion the mma also required that portion of the savings accrued in the regional plan bidding process be added to the fund this act does not alter that funding stream so that money from the regional plan bidding process will continue to flow into the fund expenditures will be delayed one year until 2014 cbo estimates that these mppa changes save 13 billion over the 20082013 period and 18 billion over the 20082018 period other provisions the sections of the act described below are primarily other provisions with significant costs or savings of at least 2 billion over the 10year period 20082018 as estimated by cbo mppa adds additional preventive services to the list of medicarecovered preventive services the term additional preventive services means services not otherwise described in medicare law that identify medical conditions or risk factors that the secretary determines meet certain specified conditions the act also waives the deductible for the initial preventive physical exam also known as welcome to medicare and extends the eligibility period for this service from the first six months to the first year of part b enrollment cbo estimates that these changes cost 14 billion over the 20082013 period and 59 billion over the 20082018 period mppa increases the percentage that medicare generally pays for mental health services from 50 to 80 over the 20102014 period when the provision is fully phased in in 2014 outpatient psychiatric services will be paid on the same basis as other part b crs5 services cbo estimates that these changes cost 05 billion over the 20082013 period and 3 billion over the 20082018 period mppa increases effective january 1 2010 the assets tests applicable under the medicare savings program msp to those applicable under the lowincome subsidy program under the medicare part d prescription drug program 6290 for an individual 9440 for couple in 2008 updated annually cbo estimates that these changes cost 16 billion over the 20082013 period and 70 billion over the 20082018 period the act repeals the current law requirement for competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services in addition it specifies that the clinical laboratory fee schedule update otherwise slated to occur each year would be reduced each year from 2009 through 2013 by 05 percentage points cbo estimates that these changes save 06 billion over the 20082013 period and 20 billion over the 20082018 period the act also makes changes to
