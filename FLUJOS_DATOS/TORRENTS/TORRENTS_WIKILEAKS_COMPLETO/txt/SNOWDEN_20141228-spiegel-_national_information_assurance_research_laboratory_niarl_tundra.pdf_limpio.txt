information assurance directorate iad the nsacss commercial solutions center ncsc and the research directorate to develop an iad roadmap for information sharing obviously this is not the first time an agency or organization has developed roadmap on this topic for example community roadmaps were developed by the program manager for information sharing environment pmise at the office of the director of national intelligence information sharing environment implementation plan and the global information grid gig information assurance portfolio giap management office system technology evolution plan step for the secure information exchange sie thread of the gig information assurance architecture unlike previous community efforts this activity is focused on developing an internal iad information sharing roadmap ufouo so why is an internal iad information sharing roadmap needed while there are many reasons the primary reasons are to provide long term iad vision for information sharing that is common across the corporation to provide shared context eg corporate description of information sharing and the necessary activities to achieve information sharing and to provide tool to synchronize and anticipate individual iad ncsc and research activities related to information sharing in nutshell this roadmap is intended to be starting point for harmonizing all iad activities related to information sharing over an extended timeframe eg 57 years our goal is not to create roadmap that competes with existing community roadmaps our approach will be to synthesize existing community roadmaps into an internal roadmap that drives iad investments in information sharing lastly our roadmap will be living document and will be revised as the timeline moves to the right or as iad learns

program u the directors summer program dsp is the agencys premier summer program for mathematics undergraduates since its inception in 1990 the mission of the dsp has not been simply recruitment though small but steady percentage of dsp participants do come back to work at nsa often after obtaining an advanced degree but rather an outreach effort aimed at attracting the best mathematics students from around the country educating them about mathematics at nsa and thus establishing ties with the future leaders of the outside mathematics community ufouo while the dsp is hosted by the mathematics research group the technical directors come from across the agency in 2008 the technical directors were and s31223 this years 22 participants were culled from 260 applicants over 12 weeks students worked in small teams with nsa mathematicians to develop realworld solutions to classified operational problems ufouo over the years r21 personnel have supported the dsp both as project mentors who propose project and guide small group of students usually 12week halftime commitment and as technical directors of the program who select and interview the students find projects and mentors and serve as general technical and administrative support fulltime during the summer usually 2year halftime commitment ufouo this year in addition to presenting their results to both the director and deputy director of nsa the dsp was invited to give classified presentations toh professional staffer on the senate select committee on intelligence ssci as well as two members of the ssci technical advisory group ssirel projects from dsp 2008 of possible interest to r2 include randomizers study of open source randomizers tundra research of new statistic for codebook analysis and cloud implementing graph algorithms in cloud computing environment short summaries follow ssirel randomizers because of their use in the generation of keying material randomizers play critical role in modern cryptographic systems the randomizers project focused on two popular commercial software randomizers open ssls randomizer and devrandom the dsp students researched the quality of these randomizers by measuring entropy and by considering cryptanalytic attacks eg forward security the students confirmed an outside attack on devrandom but they also showed that this attack is not as strong as the outside paper claimed they found obvious weaknesses in open ssls randomizer finally the students examined mixing component consisting of shift register with contribution from an entropy source modeled as bernoullip bits they determined theoretical bound on the number of register steps needed to reach full entropy given p and the jolynomial driving the shift register this project was

the automated analysis effort using the tool polyspace for ada to analyze the code polyspace for ada employs abstract interpretation to analyze code for variety of errors such as uninitialized variables integer overflow et cetera the initial automated analysis identified some nonstandard software features requiring more extensive examination then teamed withh r213 to assist with the analysis and provide results to 1543 as noted by mr the automated code analysis discoveries provided valuable results and complemented parallel 154 manual code analysis effort by highlighting several items undiscovered by the manual analysis team tsrel analyzing and debugging software code on fielded systems is timeconsuming expensive operation using automated techniques to identify coding abnormalities and bugs in system software prior to fielding reduces the overall cost of fixing software errors by an order of magnitude and significantly increased the quality of the deployed software

ufouo r21 is approaching two significant milestones in key management modeling kmm research first the researchers appear to have found proof and analysis technology that is robust enough to do meaningful formal analysis of real key management systems kmm is now making use of the cryptographic protocol shapes analyzer cpsa developed under contract to r213 cpsa was designed to analyze cryptographic protocols so kmm is now expressing key management systems as highlevel protocols in order to apply cpsa the kmm researchers have been working with mitre and changes to cpsa have already been made to enable it to be applied to kmm more directly crel additionally kmm is being used for the first time to model realworld key management system the united kingdom uk is designing new key management architecture as part of its secure management infrastructure smi effort the initial uk architecture is simple enough to make it good candidate for modeling while still allowing analysis to be accomplished on real system furthermore the uk has its own project to produce formal specification of the key management architecture in z which will provide invaluable input to kmm draft model is currently under development and if sufficient progress is achieved r21 will be presenting the results at the 5eyes key management strategy group kmsg in ottawa in october 2008 ufouo poc u ia engineering exchange ufouo for general information on r22 ia engineering researchs capabilities and u the research journey from passion to prototype ufouo as noted in the niarl directors introduction research integration r223 is the niarl focus area responsible for taking ia discoveries into the research prototype and demonstration stage along the way the team explores and addresses critical assurance challenges facing our current information infrastructure as well as those emerging against our future systems ufouo to explore the goals of research integration lets follow some distinct research efforts from their origins toward the integrated prototype and demonstration stage for this example well use wellunderstood assurance problem given our current operational top sec retc mintre l to usa aus can gbr nzl20320108 top secretcomintrel to usa aus can gbr nzl20320108 environment of multiple networks at various security levels namely the need for users to access multiple systems also known as domains in secure way ufouo the central purpose of most research is to explore whats next instead of known desired endstate this process often begins with question such as are there better approaches to secure software many ideas are then tested to try to find the answer that particular question remains central to r213 high confidence software and systems hcss focus area research into how formal methods and mathematical proofs could ensure the correctness of software design in this example the hcss team explored possible solutions and eventually developed smallscale javabased proofofconcept ufouo meanwhile in other areas of niarl another question was being asked within the authentication team how can commercial smart card technologies be leveraged to provide assured identity for access to sensitive systems over the years smart cards and smart card chipsets rapidly progressed from their origins storing monetary value for european pay phones to then becoming unique identifiers for mobile phones and ultimately finding use as personal identification and even dod user authentication for unclassified systems as the technology evolved ia research explored approaches to leverage these technologies toward our goals but that sparked other questions such as what do we do about software from unknown or risky sources ufouo the aha moment came from convergence of these two problem sets courtesy of the java card standard for smart cards could formal methods lead to proven javabased operating system and provide assurance for commerciallybased smart cards in partnership with hcss research integration took the formal methods proofofconcept approach and applied it to the realworld smart card problem the lofty goal assured and unclassified multidomain tokens for community identity and authentication ufouo the resulting tokens assurance software research within research integration just completed the prototype of functional and mathematically proven java card operating system in addition these software assurance techniques were expanded to develop tools to create assured applets to run on the cards we will also soon complete some advanced hardware prototypes featuring physical protection concepts which will further demonstrate the integrated potential for how to provide strong authentication for access to critical systems ufouo to extend the concept research integration will leverage additional niarl exploration into yet another pressing ia research question how can virtualization technologies provide the foundation for future trusted computing platforms in partnership with fellow focus areas research integration is prototyping early versions of these approaches to investigate how they could enable assured information sharing authentication and access control as well as mobility for users in this way the initial breakthroughs of software assurance secure tokens and platform trust could start to create answers to real operational questions such as how can we transform the way user identity is protected to enable crosscommunity collaboration top sec retc mintre l to usa aus can gbr nzl20320108 top secretcomintrel to usa aus can gbr nzl20320108 ufouo so while passion for ia discovery is not unique to research integration our objective is to put these advanced technologies into form that highlights their potential to address significant assurance questions matter the origin the potential technology solutions that emerge from ia research are designed for significant breakthrough however particular innovation in and of itself provides limited benefit unless it can advance the science solve problem and ultimately reach customers the aim of the r223 research integration team is to reach those customers and
