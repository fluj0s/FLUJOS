6404c28 shspec18 wisdom as an auditor australia is in only one difficulty they have yet to follow an instruction or order scientology is under investigation by the australian government which should beware because when you cut theta comm line you will get an explosion this is because the secret of power is that truth is on theta line power is truth you can extend untruth in certain direction and derive power from it for certain time but what you are really deriving power from is the amount of truth in the situation censorship is cutting of theta line so is failure of the mail interruptions etc government ever survives war you get new regime at least the government that caused or allowed the war cuts the natural beingtobeing comm line and gets thrown out as result the violence of the war is secondary in effect to this the result of cutting the natural thetaline between people the effect of this is obscured because the same being or state may still be there the war itself is temporary the real effects of the war last much longer when the violence recoils upon those who started it this is the mechanism that gives people their almost pathetic belief in retribution you have to cut or interfere with flow before you get much of an explosion as result of flow the cutter of the arc will explode sooner or later the whole auditing cycle is based on this and this is the mechanism that causes the arc break that results from cut comm line this can happen in auditing with rough auditing comm cycle cut theta line in session gives rise to an arc break it is always the auditor who started it and he usually started it much earlier than he would have thought the result is that you get dirty needle then stuck ta then an arc break maybe 1 12 hours after the first auditor mistake if the auditor doesnt realize what he has done he is confused and mystified about where this explosion came from that is why the auditor should tape his sessions and find the point where he cut the pcs comm line cut arc line is similar to cut itsa line the comm lag can be an hour which makes it hard to spot the first minor mistake is the starting point which permits further mistakes pc loss of arc etc the auditor can see it coming before the arc break hits his error there is to ignore it and hope it will go away this is the black panther mechanism you can make lot of mistakes but never be dishonest about your mistakes or you become unreal to others the mistake should be handled when the first signs of it show up in looking for the point of cut comm you can find all sorts of bypassed charge you could take someone and treat this as frontrank auditing problem by running when has your arc been cut this cant be run as the only process since it is an outofarc process you could knock pc to smithereens with process like look around here and tell something you could go out of arc with anything similar to that will do someone in because it cuts his comm line right and left look around here and tell something you dont have to have would be killer too the way the psychologist gets in trouble is in not knowing this datum nor the datum that thetan never gives up thetan never gives up he says he does and that fools people but he never really does the way to handle revolutionary is to channel his revolution slightly not to stop him in his tracks with force people get fooled because the guy will say he has given up but this is window dressing if you see nation that cant produce you know that it is composed of people who are unwilling to do or support what they are being required to do or support cf castro there can be communication but if there is reality or affinity and arc returned from people to government you would only get shadow of return flow from the people you can make tremendous number of mistakes but dont be dishonest about them that breeds unreality selfimmolation isnt the answer either complete ignorance results in great bravery and lots of opinions system of education based on noninspection like that of scholasticism results in something like the dark ages it cuts the arc of knowledge part of being wise individual is being able to perceive when and where ones arc is being cut this would be persons ability to exercise wisdom when there is problem with group wisdom consists of discovering what what r and what c is being cut between what terminals you could locate the problem in the group by finding the area of maximal confusion eg the area of maximal number of dispatches and minimal production there must be two terminals where one is trying to flow arc and the other is trying to cut it or both are trying to flow some arc and also cutting it get the terminals involved and find what is being cut by which it could be both locate the cut the cut r and the cut c then unblock the arc all ptps are suspended and nondelivered communications you cant run out ptp by running undelivered communications because the person with the ptp went ahead and solved it which stuck it you cant solve the problem for him and have any beneficial result solving others problems doesnt work witness the poor results obtained in marital counselling give someone hand sure so how do you unravel messedup being you have to find what his arc for his environment is you will find that his c is to nobody it is at people his r is continually changing and full of doubt so it is shot and his is tossup between his hating everybody andor their hating him oneshot very limited process you could use to alter it is what communication have you been unable to deliver this is not repetitive question and it should not refer to the past because the guy wants to do it right now if you keep trying c without r and you spin in because of the incomplete cycle of communication this could have something to do with people getting spun in by prayer they cant locate the terminal god jc virgin mary saints etc so all the communications go undelivered how does q and failure to complete cycle of action tie in with cutting arc an incomplete cycle of action causes an undelivered communication which involves cut theta line thus it is inevitable that you will blow up as his auditor i have two different frames of reference by which to look at an auditors auditing one is teaching him how to do it and whether he is doing it the way he should be doing it and the other is what did he do that is making him do it wrong ie 1 what is he doing wrong 2 what is happening in the session that throws him off so that he errs under the second heading i always assume he knows perfectly how to do it but that something is disturbing him i start looking for something that has gone adrift in his auditing i dont immediately then go into the subject of dressing him up on the subject of drills you have to have two frames of reference critique of his ability to handle preclears and critique of his ability to handle drills if he knows how to do the drill he has fouled up on handling pc it could be as corny as giving the pc an undelivered communication with an rfactor that says we wont cover what we were on last time because we have finished that when the pc had more to say an overt act is the other side of the coin from the undelivered communication it is communication that one didnt want to deliver but did deliver what saves your bacon in auditing is that the overt act is worse than the undelivered communication in terms of aberrative value because you have now perverted the theta line by causing it to deliver harm this really mucks up thetaline our materials are not dramatization of parts of the bank luckily lrh has gone through moments of fear that such things as the tone scale were based on implants or gpms they are not we understand the situation that we are looking at so well that we sometimes err by injecting more into things than are there all the other data about problems are true but problem is still basically an undelivered communication an overt act actually withhold is not problem it is withdrawal from putting out an arc line because you know that you will abuse it it is selfdiscipline to prevent abuse of arc the basic withhold is dont cause harm this is more fundamental than gpms it is complex reason for undelivered communication ow is an undelivered communication the thetan delivered it far too well so he had better not deliver any other comm along that line and he better not have delivered that one look at person with lot of ptps you could say the following about him 1 he is having an awful time for whatever reason because 2 he is braking himself because he might communicate and therefore he is withholding because these are all rationales basically 1 he is in that state 2 he is there because he hasnt delivered communication the arc break process depends on regretted communication the only way you can run an outofarc process is to make it an alternate process with positive side it is then barely workable it doesnt necessarily run well the only difficulties in this universe or out of it are based on these factors what comm arent you delivering because you have delivered lousy comm you may have to approach it through and r but you want to increase c
