wastewater treatment solid waste processing largescale tourism development largescale power transmission largescale reclamation large scale agriculture projects with major impacts on people or serious socioeconomic concerns and projects that are near sensitive locations 7 the environmental assessment is the main tool opic uses to evaluate the environmental impact of project and to improve the project by pr eventing minimizing mitigating remediation or compensating for any adverse impact as condition of opic support the process of environmental assessment involves identifying any potential adverse environmental effects assessing these effects and comparing them with the potential impact of alternative approaches designing and implementing measures and plans to avoid minimize or compensate for adverse effects and designing and implementing associ ated management and monitoring measures these assessments include environmental impact assessments environmental management and monitoring plans initial environmental audits environmental remediation plans and environmental impact statements as dire cted by statute and executive order 12114 8 an environmental impact assessment is comprehensive assessment of the diverse impact project has on nature and ecology it includes detailed description of the preexisting conditions all project activities that have poten tial environmental impact and the net effect of the project 9 an initial environmental audit is designed to identify preexisting adverse environmental health or safety conditions at facility or site on which industrial activity previously occurred that could affect the future impact of projectenvironmental assessment category b projects are those that are not classified in any other category category c projects are those projects that are expected to have minimal or adverse environmental impact category d projects are comprised of financial intermediaries that make investments in or are providing financing to certifiable projects or enterprises category projects include smallscale standalone business ventures that have demonstrable envi ronmentally beneficial impact ca tegory f projects are comprised of those projects that opic will not support due to us statutory restrictions or determination that the project will have major or unreasonable adverse impact on the environment health or sa fety as set forth in opics authorizing statutes in the next step opic requires applicants with projects classified as category projects to submit an environmental assessment7 principally

result in significant degradation of national parks or similar protected areas in addition to complying with the guidelines set out by the world bank all projects submitted to opic must meet host
