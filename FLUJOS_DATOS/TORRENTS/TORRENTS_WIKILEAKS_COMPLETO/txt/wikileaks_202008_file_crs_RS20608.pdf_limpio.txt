specialist in macroeconomics government and finance division summary the pace of longterm growth is the bulwark of rising living standard and even small rises in this trend will generate large gains in material wellbeing from one generation to the next the pace of economic growth also has important implications for tax revenues and outla ys for pension funding since 1995 the us economy has experienced strong acceleration of economic growth propelled by resurgence of productivity growth is this the beginning of new era for economic growth has the computer and communications revolution begun to pay productivity dividends economic theory and evidence do not suggest that longterm growth is likely to show great degree of variabilit although some increase is possible detailed analysis of recent us productivity growth gives an uncertain picture of whether current growth shows the degree of dispersion across sectors of the economy to propel the economy at far faster longterm pace this product will not be updated introduction the pace of us economic growth accelerated over the period between 1996 and 1999 jumping to an average annual rate of 43 from the 31 average annual rate recorded over the 1992 to 1996 period this acceleration has happe ned without any apparent overheating of the economy coming late in an economic expansion and occurring without generating upward pressure on inflation the bulk of this acceleration is explained by surge in productivity growth this is unusual for productivity typically starts out strong in the early years of an economic expansion and steadily settles down as the expansion proceeds output per hour over the last 3 years has been rising at over 30 annual pace well above the 15 to 20 pace thought typical at this mature stage of the economic expansion some would argue that the jump in the rate of productivity growth is not transitory event but rather the early evidence of permanent upward shift of the economys long term growth rate the likely cause is thought to be the computer and communications revolution now beginning to bear productive fruit if this is so it would be substantial milestone for the us economy reversing the sizable slowdown in productivity advancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20608crs2 and the rate of longterm growth that has been characteristic of the us economy since the early 1970s and presaging substantial increase in the speed of advancement of our national living standard the pace of longterm growth is the bulwark of rising living standard and even small rises in this trend will generate large gains in material wellbeing from one generation to the next for example since 1973 the growth rate of per capita gdp has averaged 18 at that rate the level of per capita income doubles every 39 years increase that rate only onehalf percentage point to 23 and the level of per capita gdp doubles every 31 years boost the trend growth rate full percentage point to 28 and the level of per capita income doubles every 25 years looked at from different perspective the slowdown in economic growth that began in the early 1970s has reduced real income per person in us by nearly 20 relative to what it would have been if growth had proceeded at the pre1970s pace yet raising the longterm growth rate full or even half percentage point may be difficult task economic history does not give much reason to be optimistic about achieving that degree of change evidence reveals that the us and most other industrial nations have not sustained longterm growth rates of real per capita gdp nearly as high as 30 nor in many cases including that of the us has the trend growth rate revealed sizable variation moderate fluctuations have occurred but their precise cause is often unclear and their duration is uncertain it may be that the rapid growth of the early postwar decades was an aberration and the slower rate of longterm growth since the early 1970s historically more normal pace if so substantial longterm acceleration is unlikely this report will examine the issue of whether the us economy in the late 1990s shifted up to faster longterm rate of growth as first step we will briefly review what economic theory tells us about the determinants of longterm growth next the historical record of us growth is considered finally based on what theory and evidence suggest we will assess the likelihoo d that the us economy has entered into phase of substantially faster longterm growth what determines the pace of longterm economic growth economic growth must by definition result from either or both of two general economic events first increased inputs specifically more capital applied or more labor employed allows nation to increase its level of economic output such accumulation has most often been through the augmenting of the stocks of capital ie plant and equipment and human capital ie education and training relative to the labor input ie the number of available workers this process is often called capital deepening the second path to increased output is through an improvement in the efficiency with which productive inputs are used that is finding better ways to use given stock of resources so as to raise the output per unit of input efficiency improvement allows output to rise without any change in the quantity of inputs and certainly capital deepening and efficiency improvement can work together to raise the level of output economic analysis and evidence indicates however that the accumulation of inputs alone through capital deepening cannot generate sustained rate of economic growth the limiting factor is diminishing returns process of steadily raising the level of the capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20608crs3 1 see denison edward the interruption of economic growth economic journal march 1993 and jones op cit p 42 2 for full development of these ideas see jones charles i introduction to economic growth new york ww norton 1997 pp 71113 and romer paul endogenous technological change journal of political economy 98 october 1992 71102input will for an intermediate time period raise the level of output and boost the economys growth rate but the inevitable onset of diminishing returns dictates that each successive increase in the level of input generates proportionately smaller increase in the level of output until at some point further increase in output occurs and the growth rate falls to zero capital deepening can generate economic growth over the mediumterm but not the longterm mainstream theories of economic growth indicate that the engine of longterm growth for mature economies is the steady improvement in the efficiency with which productive inputs are used better ideas more advanced techniques new products all the things we lump under the heading of technological change in effect push off the onset of diminishing returns to the process of capital deepening and maintain positive longterm growth rate sustained rate of efficiency improvement assures sustained rate of longterm growth faster rate of efficiency improvement allows faster rate of longterm growth the great importance of efficiency improvement to the process of economic growth has been well established by socalled growth accounting studies such studies endeavor to sort out the relative contribution of the inputs used in the productive process including efficiency improvement to the generation of the level of output depending on the time period examined efficiency improvement accounted for 75 to 90 of the increase in per capita output in the us and other advanced economies1 question that arises is what determines the rate of efficiency improvement this has been subject of much interest in recent research into the proce ss of economic growth in the framework of the mainstream model of economic growth the development of technological change and the generation of efficiency improvement are taken as an external force operating outside the economic system moving more or less as random process over time falling on the economic system like manna from heaven recent theoretical research on determinants of economic growth has tried to connect the accumulatio n of productive knowledge to purposeful economic behavior in this framework productive knowledge is modeled as an endogenous force itself the result of economic decisions and actions of individuals responding to market forces new productive ideas arise because it is profitable to create them better mouse trap does not fall from heaven but gets invented because people will pay premium for more efficient way to catch mice2 new thinking about the process of economic growth has improved our conception of the form and dimensions of an infrastructure for the production of efficiency improvement this infrastructure includes such things as population size commitment of resources to education and rd and institutions governing enforcement of property rights eg patent laws in its most plausible form however this model presents idea creation as production process also subject to diminishing returns which leads to anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20608crs4 3 jones charles i introduction to economic growth new york ww norton 1997 p 13 provides estimate of growth rate over 1870 1994 intervalinvariant pace for an economys rate of longrun growth in this framework it is possible to temporarily accelerate the rate of efficiency improvement and the nearterm rate of growth of an economy this acceleration however is toward technological frontier the expansion of which is at an exogenously determined pace once at the frontier an economys longrun grow th rate will as in the mainstream model settle back to the exogenously determined pace the us with large and well established growth infrastructure is very likely on that frontier new ideas will periodically emerge that raise efficiency but many observers believe it unlikely that there will be permanent accelerations of the longterm growth rate the salient message of current accepted theories of economic growth is that the longterm rate of growth will largely be determined by the rate of improvement in productive efficiency further for mature industrial economies such as the us such efficiency improvement are believed to emerge at relatively constant rate that is substantially unrelated to economic forces this does not preclude some modest degree of fluctuation in the rate of efficiency improvement and the rate of economic growth over the mediumterm temporary accelerations and decelerations are possible history of us longterm growth and efficiency improvement in this section we will examine what have been the historical realities of growth for the us over the longrun table 1 presents data on longterm economic growth rates dating from 1870 through 1994 measured by annual average rates of change for real inflation adjust ed gdp per capita per capita gdp is more telling gauge of improvement in economic welfare than simple rate of change in real gdp this period reaches far enough back in time so as to encompass some of the early decades of industrial development and vigorous economic expansion these data are also expressed for subintervals to help reveal any degree of mediumterm variability in the us growth rate table 1

average annual rate of 18 between 1870 and 1994 what cannot be gleaned from the table is that this growth rate has shown substantial constancy over this 124year period with most deviations up and down explained by the swings of the business cycle some deviation beyond business cycle effects has occurred however table 1 also presents growth rates forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20608crs5 recent shorter time periods in the postwwii era 19481994 the growth rate of per capita gdp does accelerate to an average annual rate of about 21 this 46year sub period itself seems to be divided into two very distinct periods for the 25years from 1948 to 1973 the growth rate jumped significantly to 25 average annual pace but for the 21 years from 1973 to 1994 the economys average annual growth rate fell back to 18 average annual pace clearly based on the experience of the early postwar period the economys growth rate can rise above its longrun trend for substantial period of time the 1948 to 1973 experience would suggest mediumterm acceleration of as much as 07 percentage points above the 18 longterm trend rate critical question raised by these data is whether the exuberant growth performance of the early postwar years established new norm against which to measure subsequent lackluster growth performance or at least the degree of mediumterm acceleration of growth that is periodically possible on the other hand it is also credible to see the rapid growth of the early postwar period as an aberration and the slower longer term trends as more realistic benchmark against which to assess the prospects for long term growth in the us economy evidence from changes in efficiency improvement the discussion above was about growth rates for per capita gdp while this is very telling measure of nations ability to advance its material wellbeing it is not an exact corresp ondent to improved efficiency the force that economic theory says is the dominant and enduring wellspring for longterm growth efficiency improvement is difficult to gauge however total factor productivity tfp is the measure used to approximate the rate of improvement in economywide efficiency tfp is measured by first accounting for the separate contributions to increased output of increases in the input of capital and labor any increase in output over and above what is attributable to increased factor input is called tfp and can be used particularly over long periods of time as proxy measure of improved efficiency table 2 presents estimates of tfp for the us over selected time intervals from 1860 through 1999 one sees there pattern of moderate paced improvement subject to some variation significant acceleration of the rate of tfp growth occurred during the 60 year period between 1913 to 1972 this of course was the era when remarkable abundance of majo r inventions were fully integrated into the us economy these inventions included electric lights electric motors the internal combustion engine the airplane the telephone the superhighway and variety of home appliances it is not surprising that the confluence of so many major innovations induced sizable and long lived increase in the rate of growth of tfp in the united states it is also plausible that the deceleration of tfp growth in the 19721995 period is windin g down from this unique period of fast paced inventiveness to more normal cadence we can also see in table 2 that the reacceleration of tfp growth in the short 1995 to 1999 period has been large exceeding the fast pace of the 19131972

whether the experience of these recent 4 years is the harbinger of new era of rapid efficiency growth and accelerated growth of per capita gdp professor robert gordon of northwestern university views this prospect with considerable skepticism5 his analysis of the productivity data for the 19951999 period shows that the productivity growth is very localized and very likely lacking in the propelling effect of the more pervasive productivity impacts of the 19131972 period gordon observes that recent productivity increases are heavily concentrated in the production of computer hardware and telecommunications equipment with significant spillovers into other parts of the durable manufacturing sector this impact affects only about 12 of the economy the remaining 88 shows increase in the pace of tfp growth other recent studi have found somewhat broader spread of recent productivity growth to other industries beyond the durable manufacturing sector6 however because these studies did not adjust for the effects of the business cycle it seems likely that some or all of the effects they found are transitory even in these more optimistic studies the results still do not show the degree of economywide productivity impact that was true for the invention rich 19131972 period particularly telling is the lack of tfp improvement in the services sector where computer and telecommunications equipment investments have been the most intensive conclusion substantial amount of capital deepening occurred in the us economy during the 1990s and this has doubt induced at least temporary acceleration of economic growth whether the economy has entered into an extended era of faster longterm economic growth induced by sustained increase in the pace of efficiency improvement is more problematic it is difficult to glean trend from only 4 years of data it is certainly possible that the longterm rate of growth may rise above the pace of the seemingly slow 19731995 period but there remains considerable reason to doubt that the pace of growth will exceed or even rival the fast growth of the 19131972 period
