been rising at least since the mid1990s increased sharply in 2001 and have risen fu rther since then although not as rapidly us domestic exports of fiber yarn and fabric to atpdea countries also increased markedly between 2002 and 2003 but less rapidly than exports to cbtpa countries with each of the major categor ies registering sharp gains and such exports rose again in 2004 however us exports of fiber yarn and fabric to atpdea countries for the most part did not reattain their leve ls of the late 1990s us domestic exports of the items in stion to agoa countries are the lowest by

of textiles to the designated regions congress has eased trade terms on variety of products from andean caribbean nd subsaharan region nations especially on textile s and apparel in moves to stimulate economic growth in poorer regions of the world it is reasona ble to expect that the textile and apparel industries would be among the first to grow rapidly in these regions given the large role usually played by xtiles and apparel in early industrial development to provide markets for us manufacturers of yarn and fabrics the trade preference programs for the most part require usmad yarn andor fabric as inputs for textile and apparel end products for them to qualify for trade preference this report examines the levels of u s yarn fiber and fabric exports to countries covered by us

preference regi ons covered by this report cbtpa countries as group constitute the largest ma rket by far for us fiber yarn and fabric with atpdea countries second and agoa countries third table 1 consequently trends in exports to the three regions combined are dominated by trends in exports to cbtpa countries so before presenting recent developments it may be useful to note that in the cases of two of the three trade preference regions agoa and atpdea us exports of fiber yarn and fabric were higher in the late 1990s than they have become at leas t so far since the trade preferences applicable to textile s were liberalized in the early 2000s table 1 us domestic exports of fiber yarn and fabric to beneficiary countries of the african growth and opportunity act andean trade

than doubled and the latter nearly triple d between 2000 and 2001 between 2001 and 2004 the former rose 78 and the latter n early tripled again the former accounted for more than three quarters of us expor ts of cotton fiber yarn and fabric to cbtpa countries in 2004 tailed data not shown in table 6 indicate large shift in exports to cbtpa countries from undyed to dyed knitted or crocheted fabrics in 2002 probably reflecting newly acted statutory requirements us exports to atpdea countries of cotton knitted and crocheted fabrics increased sharply in 2002 while exports of cotton fiber yarn and woven fabrics to the atpdea region did so in 2003 but the apparent volatility of this export category series makes it unclear if the high level in 2004 is part of rising trend other detailed data not included in table 6 indicate that among exports of knitted or crocheted fabrics to atpdea countries there was shift to pile fabrics in 2002 possibly responding to the inclusion of andean handloomed handmade and folklore products as eligible for duty free entry into the united states and possibly is reflected in much higher level of us imports of carpets and rugs from andean countries in 2004 us exports of cotton fiber yarn and fabrics to the agoa region are almost exclusively in the form of fiber yarn and woven fabrics the vel of exports of this category in 2003 and 2004 is significantly higher than in 2000 through 2002 suggesting response to the liberalizati on of trade preferences to that regionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32895crs7 however here too it is unclear if the in creased level in 2003 and 2004 is part of rising trend given the high level of expor ts of fiber yarn and woven fabrics to agoa countries in 1996 relative to later yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32895 crs8 table 6
