from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to jtouarizonaedueysteinjansengeouibnotcrowleydukeedu subject thoughts and figure for mwp box date mon jul 18 171206 2005 dear peck eystein and tom at this point we thought it was important to review where we think we are with the mwp figure first we have objection to figure our only concerns have been that we should 1 be clear what we wish this figure to illustrate in the specific context of the mwp box note that this is very different from trying to produce figure in such way as to bias what it says i am not suggesting that we are but we have to guard against any later charge that we did this we say this because there are intonations in some of pecks previous messages that he wishes to nail the mwp ie this could be interpreted as trying to say there was such thing and 2 agree that we have done this in the best way the truth is that there is period of relative warmth around the end of the 1st and start of the 2nd millennium ce but that there are much fewer data to base this conclusion on and hence the uncertainty around even our multiple calibrated multiproxy reconstructions are wide the geographical spread of data also impart northern and land bias in our early proxy data my understanding of toms rationale with the figure is that we should show how because the timing of maximum pre20th century warmth is different in different records the magnitude of the warmest period for the hemisphere or globe as whole is less than the recently observed warmth the reconstructions we plot in chapter 6 already express the mean hemispheric warmth after various selection and scaling of data and so the additional information that the mwp box figure should show must relate to the scatter of the proxy data there seems to be consensus that this is best done by showing individual records and we are happy to agree what we worry very much about however is that we should not produce figure that then conflicts with the picture of proxy evidence for hemispheric mean warmth as wholeshown in the main chapter figure by showing composite as tom has done and scaling against another 3090degrees n temperature record this is just what is done as we promised tim has produced similar figure using the same series plus few extras but omitting the composite mean and the scaling against instrumental temperatures the idea was to include as many of the original input series to the various reconstructions as we could though avoiding conflicting use of different versions of the same data the precise selection of records will have to be agreed and presumably based on some clear objective criteria that we would need to justify this will not be straight forward this along with toms plot forwarded by peck is in the attachment we would like to get your opinion now and especially toms on the points regarding the composite and scaling we would be in favour of just showing the series but do they make the point and emphasise the message of the text in the box or does the scatter of the various series as plotted dilute the message about the strength of 20th century mean warming note the apparently greater scatter in the 20th century in our figure than in toms can you all chip in here please best wishes keith and tim ps we agreed in beijing that we should definitely ask tom to be ca professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784
