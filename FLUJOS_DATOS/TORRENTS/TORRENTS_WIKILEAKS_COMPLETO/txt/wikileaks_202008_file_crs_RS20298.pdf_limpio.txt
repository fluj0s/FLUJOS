vehicles minivans and light trucks an overview of fuel economy and emissions standards brent d yacobucci specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division summary most sport utility vehicles minivans and pi ckups are classified as light trucks and thus are regulated less stringently than passenger cars under two major laws the energy policy and conservation act for fuel economy standards and the clean air act for emissions standards these differen ces came about because at the time the laws were passed light trucks were used differe ntly and because they represented much smaller share of the automobile market ov er the past decade however these vehicles have dramatically increased their share of the new automobile market therefore the share of total fuel consumpti on and emissions attributable to these vehicles has steadily increased in response to this trend the nvironmental protection agency has ruled that by model year 2009 emissions from all light tr ucks and passenger car s will be regulated equally also in april 2003 th department of transportati on finalized more stringent fuel economy standards for light trucks st arting in my2005 this report discusses the discrepancy between emissions and fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks how that discrepancy is changing and legislative activity related to these issues this report will be update d as events warrant introduction sport utility vehicles and other light trucks are regulated through two laws that affect their fuel use and emissions the energy policy and conserva tion act of 1975 epca1 and the clean air act caa2 epca first set fuel economy standards for the 1977 model year my1977 since then all light tr ucks including most sport utility vehicles suvs and all minivans have been held to less stringent fuel economy standards than passenger cars furthermore since my1975 mo st light trucks have faced less stringent emissions standards under clean air act regu lations the differences in standardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20298crs2 3 heavierduty uses generally require greater ve hicle weight which tends to increase emissions and decrease fuel economy 4 automotive news

weight of the vehicle with all standard equi pment and the fuel tank at nominal capacityreflected the situation prevalent at the time these laws were enacted first light trucks were mainly used as commercial and agricultural work vehicles3 second they were relatively small portion of the us automobile market since then conditions have changed signifi cantly today light trucks are larger portion of the total vehicle population and travel more annual vehicle miles for example in 1980 light trucks composed 199 of the us new automobile market4 by 2001 this figure had increased to 508 suvs alone accounted for 231 of the new vehicle market in 1999 while minivans accounted for 585 however comparison of market share underestimates this growth and its conse quences while the number of passenger cars sold each year in the united states has decreased somewhat since 1980 the number of light trucks sold has more than tripled from 22 million in 1980 to 87 million in 2001 in 2001 suv sales alone 40 million nearly doubled total light truck sales for 1980 as result the total fuel usage and emissions attributable to these vehicles has increased because of the increased emissions nd consumption from light trucks the environmental protection agency epa s ruled that by my2009 all light vehicles including all passenger cars and suvs and most vans nd pickups all but the very largest vehicles will be held to the same emissions standards further the department of transportations nationa l highway traffic safety administration nhtsa will increase light truck fuel economy starting in my2005 definition of light truck for the purposes of fuel economy standard s nhtsa defines light truck as any truck or truck derivative with gro ss vehicle weight rating gvwr of 8500 pounds or less and vehicle curb weight vcw of 6000 pounds or less6 49 cfr 523 suvs and minivans are usually built on truck chassis or have other trucklike characteristics eg 4 wheel drive andor flat loading areas and are therefore classified as light trucks epa uses the same basic definition of light truck under the current tier 1 emissions standards however distincti on is made between di fferent vehicle types lightduty truck 1 through 4 based on weight and payload finally some suvs and pickups are so large greater than 8500 lbs gvwr that they do not qualify as light trucks under the cu rrent standards thes include the largest fullsized pickups passenger vans and suvs however epa recently added the classification mediumduty pa ssenger vehicle to include heavy passenger vehicles passenger vans and suvs up to 10000 gvwr starting in my2004 heavy pickups and cargo vans will not be affected since their main function is transporting cargo as opposedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20298crs3 7 environmental

average fuel economy of all vehicles of given class that manufacturer sells in model year must be equal to or greater than the standard these standards we re first enacted in response to the desire to reduce petroleum consumption and promote ener gy security after the arab oil embargo the current law sets the cafe standard fo r passenger cars at 275 miles per gallon mpg furthermore this law gives nhtsa the authority to define other classes of vehicles and set fuel economy standards for those vehicl currently the average fuel economy of light trucks as they are defined above is regulated at 207 mpg 49 cfr 533 fuel economy standards for light trucks were steadily tightened through the 1980s and early 1990s and were comple tely standardized for all light truck subclasses in my1996 passenger car st andards have remained unchanged since my1990 nhtsa has the regulatory authority to set cafe standa rds for given model year taking into account technological feasibility economic practicability other vehicle standards and the need to conserve energy between fy1996 and fy2001 however congress expressly prohibited nhtsa from using any funds to change cafe standards8 for fy2001 the senate agreed to accept this cafe language only if nhtsa along with the national academy of sciences was permitted to conduc t study of fuel economy and recommend appropriate cafe standards p l 1063 46 the panel concluded that light truck fuel economy can be increased without significant cost increases and without harming the auto i ndustry if given significant lead time9 the national energy polic report produced by the bush administration recommended that nhtsa review and provide recommendations on increasing cafe standards taking into account the nas study10 new light truck cafe standards on april 1 2003 nhtsa finalized higher cafe standards for light trucks starting in my200511 the new standards would be set at 210 mpg for my 2005 216 mpg for my2006 and 222 mpg for my2007 total increase of 15 mpg in its final rule nhtsa predicts that the new standards will save 36 billion gallons of gasoline over the life of the vehicles covered while nhtsa concluded that the average cost would be

projections for efficiency improvements may not be realized especially if the upward trend in vehicle size and weight continues also in public comments on the rulemaking environmental defense and the union of concerned scientists claimed that nhtsa failed to set the maximum achievable standard and that the standa rds could be feasibly set in the range of 238 to 244 mpg by my2007 they claimed that nhtsa made cons ervative assumptions in developing the proposal and ignored some effi cient technologies altogether13 in addition to the new light truck st andards on december 29 2003 nhtsa issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking seeking feedback on possible ways to amend the cafe system options under considerati on include attributeba sed standards eg weight volume as opposed to one standard fo r light trucks and another for cars new sub classes for light trucks and standards requiring minimum percentage increase for all vehicles other issues even though the cafe provisions in epca were not enacted for the purpose of achieving environmental go als some environmentalists argue that increased fuel economy w ould promote better air quality reduce greenhouse gas emissions limit dependence on foreign oil and lower consumer expenditures at the pump meanwhile us automobile industry spokesp ersons argue that cafe standards have little or effect on oil imports promote mo re consumption through lower annual fuel costs and give an advantage to foreign manufacturers which pr oduce smaller vehicles in addition since epca only addresses the need to conserve energy environmental justifications for tougher st andards have been challenged by opponents moreover some consumer groups argue that cafe standards l ead to decreased vehicle safety because common method for reducing fuel consum ption is to reduce vehicle weight congressional concerns and activity cafe standards have been contentious issue in congressional debates this is especially true as they relate to greenhouse gas emissions and the potential for global warming as well as the desire to promote energy security the most significant piece of caferelated legislation in the 108th congress was hr 6 the omnibus energy bill the conference report on hr 6 hrept 108375 would not have changed fuel economy standards but would have authorized 2 million annually for fy 2004 through fy2008 for nhtsa to conduct cafe rulemakings in addition the conf erence report would have required nhtsa to add safety and the effects on the us auto i ndustry to the list of factors it must consider the report was issued on november 17 2003 the h ouse approved the report on november 18 on november 21 cloture motion on the bill failed in the senate in addition to the energy bill few st andalone proposals on cafe

would also have amended the definition of light truck to incl ude all vehicles up to 10000 pounds gross weight both bills were referred to committee emissions standards before 1975 all light trucks we re classified by epa as light duty vehicles ie passenger cars however in case brought by international harvester the us court of appeals concluded that light trucks s hould be classified differently due to the agricultural and commercial nature of their use14 therefore light trucks were given their own classification and have faced less stringent emissions standards since my1975 under the caa tier 1 standards light trucks were allowed to emit higher levels of pollution with each heavier weight class furthermore tier 1 standards for light trucks were generally less stringent than those for passenger cars only trucks in the lightest class meet the same standards as passenger cars most s uvs and pickups and all vans were permitted to mit 29 to 47 more carbon monoxid co and 75 to 175 more nitrogen oxides nox than passenger cars 40 cfr 86 tier 2 standards the clean air act gives epa the authority to set standards for my2004 and beyond in order to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards naaqs however epa may onl tighten emissions standards if the technology to do so is available and coste ffective on february 10 2000 epa finalized new standards for passenger cars and light trucks15 under the new tier 2 standards all light trucks and pa ssenger cars as well as medium duty suvs and passenger vans will be held to the same missions standards by my200916 three primary factors influenced epas decision use patterns market share and technology first according to epa today these vehicles are used like passenger cars and there are more annual mile s traveled as result17 since these vehicles travel more miles per year emissions attri butable to the average vehicl have increased second as was stated above there are simply more light trucks on the road today because of the increased number of these vehicles the cont ribution of the emissi ons from these vehicles to vehicular air pollution has similarly increased finally epa chose to set such stringent standards for light trucks becau new emissions control tec hnology is available to permit cuts in emissions without decreasing weight or power and without generating excessive costs for automobile ma nufacturers or consumers as in many cases over the past thirty years epa is following the lead of california which has the most stringent automobile emissions standards in the country inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20298crs6 18 caa allows states to adopt ca lifornia emissions standards in lieu of the federal standards in the absence of action by epa number of states planned to adopt the california standards auto manufacturers not wanting to face multiple standa rds have been generally supportive of tier 2 19 fore more information see crs report rs20163 sulfur in gasoline 20

federal register 3511235119 june 30 1999november 1998 california ruled that beginning in my 2004 all light trucks must meet the same emissions sta ndards as passenger cars18 issues the tier 2 standards have raised three major issues among vehicle manufacturers oil refiners and environmentalists first because the heaviest vehicles are exempt from the tier 1 emissions standards since they are not considered light trucks some environmental groups were concerned that automobile manufacturers would be motivat ed to bulk up their heavier light trucks placing them in the heavy truck class to avoid improving their emissions therefore epa added the class of med iumduty passenger vehicles to include these vehicles second with existing technology emissi ons reductions are pendent on reductions in the sulfur content of gasoline19 therefore epa also promulgated more stringent limits on gasoline sulfur content oil refiners ac knowledged that sulfur does affect emission controls but claimed that their input was ignor ed in the rulemaking process and that the timeline for the rule will greatly increase th cost of gasoline and will push smaller refiners out of the market20 furthermore they argue th at emissions reductions could be achieved with considerably smaller cuts in the sulfur level21 conversely automobile manufacturers have argued th at emissions reductions are unattainable without sulfur reductions and have ex pressed support for even greater reductions third the oil refining industry has questione d whether epas justification of the tier 2 standards relies on the revised naaqs for ozone and particulate matter which epa promulgated in july 199722 these revised standards we re remanded to epa for further consideration by the us court of appeals in may 199923 in june 1999 to deter potential legal challenges to the tier 2 standards epa issued notice that justifies the tier 2 standards under the previous naaqs st andards for ozone nd particulate matter which still apply to states that have not yet achieved attainment24 congressional concerns and activity legislation was introduced in the 108th congress on emissions but vehicle emissions standards are matter of congressional oversight
