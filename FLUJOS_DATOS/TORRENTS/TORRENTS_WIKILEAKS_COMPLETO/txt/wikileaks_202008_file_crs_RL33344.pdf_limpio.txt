relief and recovery by eugene boyd fy2007 budget issues budget pressures the presidents fy2007 request highlights growing pressures within the hud budget between th discretionary programs that require appropriations and the resc issions and offsetting coll ections and receipts that subsidize or offset the cost of t hose appropriations as can be seen in table 2 while the presidents overa ll funding request is slight increase over the previous year 16 the amount of appropriations re quested is actually slight decrease less than 1 this seeming contradiction results from the reality that the amount of offsetting collections and receipts has b een decreasing as the federal housing administrations mortgage insurance prog rams have produced smaller amount in offsetting receipts from fy2006 to fy2007 under the presidents budget1 the amounts of offse tting r eceipts will drop by more than billion dollars from more than 16 billion to about 650 million for an expanded discussion see federal housing administration fha and table 16 with less available to offset the cost of the budget higher appropriations are requi red to maintain the same funding level at the same time many programs such as the section 8 voucher program require increased appropriations to maintain current service levels also the president has set goal of restraining dom estic discretionary spending increases to at or below the rate of in flation and has encouraged th executive branch secretaries to examine programs to ensure that they are using taxpayer dollars wisely huds fy2007 budget summary states that the budget intends to use taxpayer money more wisely and reform programs in need of repair the combination of these factors has led to proposals for flat funding or cuts for many hud programs table 2

history of the prog ram and the funding for virtually all of them expires every year if family is using voucher to lease an apartment but funding is not sufficient to renew it then the family will lose its assistance and likely lose its current housing prior to fy2004 hud funded phas based on the number of vouchers they were using and the cost of those vouchers if costs went up or phas were able to use more of their vouchers they receive d additional funds to cover those costs since fy2004 cong ress has moved away from funding phas based on their actual costs and now provi des agencies with pro rata share of renewal funding based on what they received in the prior year this formula change has provoked much controversy among wincome housing advocates and pha advocacy groups who argue that it does not reflect agencies act ual needs and results in some agencies receiving less funding than they need to maintain their programs and others receiving more than they can use under the current law for more information see crs report rl33929 recent changes to section 8 housing voucher renewal funding by maggie mccarty the administrations budget documents state that hud supports the

firsttime rene wal of tenantprot ection vouchers the amounts would then be reduced proportionally to fit within th amount appropriated agencies participating in the moving to work demonstration w ould be funded based on their contracts but their budgets would be subject to proration the presidents budget request would have removed cl ause included in the fy2006 appropriations law requiring that the entire amount of f unding for renewals be obligated up front it also would have lif ted the ban on overleasing2 that congress enacted in fy2003 presumably lifting this ban would permit agencies with decreased costs to more fully utilize their funding the remaining 100 million would have been used by the secretary to provide onetime adjustments to agency budgets for increased portability costs or additional rental subsidies in response to unforeseen exigencies in fy2006 congress provided the secretary with 45 million setaside to adjust agencies budgets under number of circumstances including cost increases due to portability the housepassed bill provided 70 million more than the president requested for voucher renewals and woul d have distributed the funds following the presidents request including the 100 million setas ide the additional 70 million was not included in the bill reported by the appropriations committee but was added in floor amendment and its cost was ffset by 100

significant decrease in funding due to the formula change the prohibition on overleasing was continued administrative fees prior to fy2004 phas were paid fixed fee per voucher administered beginning in fy 2004 at congresss direction hud changed the way it distributed administrative fees providing agencies with prorata share of the amount appropriated fo r administrative fees based on what they had received in the previous year the change was designed to contain the cost of administrative fees which were estimated to have grow n to account for 10 of the cost of voucher for fy2007 the administration requested 13 billion for administrative fees 30 million of which would have been available to the s ecretary to use for special purposes the request represents 4 increase over the amount provided in fy2006 however since more would have b een set aside for special fees in fy2007 only 10 million was set aside in fy2006 th base administrative fees would have only increased by 2 the housepassed version of the hud funding bill would have cut administrative fees by 8 from the fy2006 enacted level providing just over 11 billion like the presidents request th house bill would have set aside 30 million for the secretary to distribut for special fees with th setaside the base amount for administrative fees to be allocated acr oss agencies would have been reduced by almost 10 the senate appropriations committeepassed version of the bill would have provided just under 13 billion for administra tive fees the funds would have been allocated to phas based on the formula that was in effect prior to fy2004 and prorated to fit within the amount ppropriated of the amount 30 million would have been set aside for the secretary to allocate to phas needing extra funds to administer their programs under the senate bill base administrative fees would have been increased about 1 over the fy2006 level the fy2007 yearlong cr did not specify an amount for administrative fees presumably they will be funded at the fy2006 enacted level 1238 million with 10 llion set aside for special fees this am ount is 43 million below the presidents fy2007 request the fy 2007

announced new policy in which tenant protection vouc hers will be issued to replace only those units that were under lease at the time they were demolished or disposed rather than all units while th is policy has been adopted administratively the president requested that the fy2007 appr opriations language specify that tenant protection vouchers be proved only for units under lease the house bill adopted the presidents requested funding level and language for tena nt protection vouchers the senate committeepassed bill would have funded tenant protection vouchers at the presidents requested level however it did not contain the language limiting them to units under lease as requested by the president the cr did not specify an amount fo r tenant protection vouchers so presumably they will be funded at the fy2006 level 178 million this amount is 29 million more than the president re quested the fy2007 supplemental funding bill hr 2206 proposes to amend the cr to specify that tenant protection vouchers be funded at 149 million incremental vouchers congress has not funde d any new vouchers called incremental vouchers since fy2002 outside of tenant protection vouchers the senate

in fy2005 some advocates contend that the fi nal proration would be even lower than the presidents estimate because of factors such as increasing utility costs4 because of the proration some agencies that will qualify for an increase under the new formula may face d ecrease from their prior years funding and those facing decrease will likely face an even deeper reduction the presidents budget also

of development furthermore the department argues that the program has largely met its goal of eliminating the worst public housing for fy2007 as in fy2006 the president asked congress to provide new
