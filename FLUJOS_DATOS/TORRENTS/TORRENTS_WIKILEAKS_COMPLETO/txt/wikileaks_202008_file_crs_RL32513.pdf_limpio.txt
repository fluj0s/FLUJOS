variety of auxiliary and support ships 2 well deck is large garagelike space in the stern of the ship it can be flooded with water so that landing craft can leave or return to the ship access to the well deck is protected by large stern gate th at is somewhat like garage door 3 to enhance their survivability in battle their ability to absorb damage from enemy weapons us navy ships are built with features such as extensive interior compartmentalization and increased armor prot ection of certain critical interior spaces 4 battle force ships are ships that are readily deployable overseas and which contribute to the overseas combat capability of the navy they include both active duty and naval reserve force combat ships as well navy and military sealift commandoperated auxiliaries such as oilers ammunition ship s dry cargo ships and multiproduct resupply ships that transport supplies from shor to navy combat ships operating at seaissue could affect navy and marine corps capabilities navy and marine corps funding requirements and the shipbuilding industrial base background current amphibious and maritime prepositioning ships amphibious ships amphibious ships are one of four principal categories of combat ships that traditionally have helped define the size and structure of the us navy the other three are aircraft carriers surface combatants eg cruisers destroyers frigates and littoral combat ships and submarines1 the primary function of amphibious ship s is to transport marines and their equipment to distant operating areas and enable marines to conduct expeditionary operations ashore in those areas amphibious ships have berthing spaces for marines flight decks and hangar decks fo r their helicopters and verticalshort take off and landing vstol fixedwing airc raft well decks for storing and launching their landing craft2 and storage space for their wheeled vehicles their other combat equipment and their supplies although amphibious ships are designed to support marine landings against opposing military for ces they can also be used for marine landings in socalled permissive or benign situations where there are opposing forces us amphibious ships are navy ships oper ated by navy crews with the marines as passengers they are built to survivability standards similar to those of other us navy combat ships3 and are included in the total number of battle force ships in the navy which is the commonly cited figure for the total number of ships in the fleet4 amphibious ships are procured in the navys shipbuilding budget known as theshipbuilding and conversion navy scn appropriation account designations of amphibious ship classes start with the letter l as in amphibious landing todays amphibious ships can be divided into two main groups the socalled bigdeck amphibious assault ships signated lha and lhd which look like mediumsized aircraft carriers and the smaller but still sizeable lsd and lpdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32513crs3 5 lha can be translated as landing ship helic optercapable assault lhd can be translated as landing ship helicoptercapable well deck lsd can be translated as landing ship well deck lpd can be translated as landing shi p helicopter platform well deck whether noted in the designation or not all these ships have well decks 6 for comparison nimitzclass nuclearpower ed aircraft carrier displaces about 100000 tons and cruiser or destro yer displaces about 9000 tons 7 the navy also operates two blue ridge lcc19 class command ships as their designation suggests these ships were orig inally built as amphibious command ships in recent years they have evolved into genera l fleet command ships some listings of us navy ships include the two lccs as amphibious ships while others list them in separate category of command ships along with one other fleet command ship the coronado agf11 which is converted lpdtype amphibious ships5 the lhas and lhds have large flight decks and hangar decks for embarking and operating numer ous helicopters and vstol fixedwing aircraft while the lsds and lpds have mu ch smaller flight decks and hangar decks for embarking and operating sm aller numbers of helicopter s the lhas and lhds as bigger ships in general can embark more marines and equipment than the lsds and lpds as of the end of fy2006 the navy included 33 amphibious ships 7 wasp lhd1 class ships commissioned between 1989 and 2001 each displacing about 40500 tons6 4 tarawa lha1 class ships commissioned between 1976 and 1980 each displacing

about 26000 tons and 9 austin lpd4 class ships commissioned between 1965 and 1971 each displacing about 17000 tons7 the navy organizes its amphibious ships into expeditionary strike groups esgs each esg notionally includes one lha or lhd one lsd and one lpd the amphibious ships in an esg together can embark marine expeditionary unit meu consisting of about 2200 marines thei r aircraft their landing craft their combat equipment and about 15 days wort h of supplies each esg also notionally includes three surface combatants some or all armed with tomahawk cruise missiles one submarine and perhaps one or more p3 longrange landbased maritime patrol aircraft esgs are designed to be independently deployable strike capable naval formations but they can also operate in conjuncti on with carrier strike groups csgs to form larger naval task fo rces on average two or perhaps three esgs might be forwarddeployed at any given timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32513crs4 8 the maritime prepositioning ships serving the other military services are located principally at diego garciamaritime prepositioning ships todays maritime prepositioning ships are large military cargo ships that are loaded with combat equipment and supplies and forwardlocated to sea areas that are close to potential us military operating zones they are essentially forwardlocated floa ting warehouses most have rollonroll off roro capability which means that they are equipped with ramps that permit wheeled or tracked vehicles to quickly roll on or off the ship when the ship is at pier total of 36 us prepositioning ships controlled by the military sealift command msc store equipment and supp lies for various parts of dod the 16 ships used primarily for storing marine corps equipment and supplies are called maritime prepositioning force mpf ships the 10 ships used primarily for storing equipment and supplies for the army are called the combat prepositioning force the remaining 10 ships used primarily for storing equipment and supplies for the air force navy and defense logistics agency are called logistics prepositioning ships this report focuses on the 16 mpf ships the 16ship mpf fleet is organized into three squadrons of five or six ships each each squadron stores enough combat equipment and supplies to equip and support meb for period of 30 days one squadron is normally forwardlocated in the atlantic or mediterranean one is normally forwardlocated in the indian ocean at diego garcia and one is normally forwardlocated in the western pacific at guam and saipan8 todays mpf ships are designed to suppor t marine landings at friendly ports or ports that marines or other u s or friendly forces have previously seized by force under the basic mpf concept of operations the mpf ships would steam into such port while marines would be flown into nearby friendly or seized airbase the marines would then travel to the port he lp unload the mpf ships unpack and marry up with their equipment and supplies and begin conducting their operations ashore mpf operations can be used to reinforce an initial marine presence ashore that was created by marine landing against opposing forces or to establish an initial marine presence ashore in permissive or benign landing environment the mpf concept permits mebsized marine force to be established in distant operating area more quickly than w ould be possible if the mebs equipment and supplies had to be transported all the way from the united states unlike prepositioning of equipmen t and supplies on the soil of foreign countries maritime prepositioning in international waters does not require permanent host nation access the mpf concept also provides degree of intertheater operational flexibility since an mpf squadron can be moved from one theater eg the mediterranean to an adjoining theater eg the indian ocean relatively quickly if needed to respond to contingency dod used the mediterra nean and western pacific mpf squadrons to supplement the indian ocean mpf squadron in the 1991 gulf war operation desert storm and the more recent iraq war operation iraqi freedomhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32513crs5 9 in contrast to navy auxiliaries that are count ed as battle force ships because they transport supplies from land to navy ships operating at sea mpf ships like most other dod sealift ships transport supplies from one land mass to nother primarily for the benefit of service in this case the marine corps other than the navytodays mpf ships are dod sealift ships operated with civilian crews they are built to survivability standards similar to those of commercial cargo ships which are lower than those of us navy combat ships they are not included in the total number of battle force ships in the navy9 todays mpf ships are designated taks the t means the ships are operated by the msc the means auxiliary and the k means cargo the mpf fleet was established in the mid1980s it includes 13 ships

ogram so as to increase the storage capacity of the mpf fleet in accordance with lessons learned during the 1991 gulf war one mpfe ship was added to each squadron the 13 earlier mpf ships which each displace between about 44000 and 49000 tons are owned and operated by pr ivate companies under 25year charters ie leases to msc the three more recently added mpfe ships which each displace between about 50000 and 55000 tons are owned by the us government and are operated by private co mpanies under contract to msc since fy1993 newconstruction dod sealift ships similar to the mpf ships have been

ships and 3 mobile landing platform mlp ships sea basing concept the concept in general the navy and marine corps are proposing to implement new concept of operations fo r staging forces at sea and conducting expeditionary operations ashore with little or reliance on nearby land bases the concept is called enhanced networked sea basing or sea basing for short under the traditional concept of ope rations for conducting expeditionary operations ashore the navy and marine corps would establish base ashore and then use that base to conduct operations ag ainst the desired ashore objective under sea basing the navy and marine co rps would launch direct and support expeditionary operations directly from base at sea with little or reliance on nearby land base13 key rationale for the sea basing concept is that in the future fixed land bases ashore will become vulnerable to enemy att ack from weapons such as cruise missiles or shortrange ballistic missiles launching the operation directly from base at sea advocates of sea basing argue will enhance the survivability of the attacking navy marine corps force by putting the base out of the range of shorterrange enemy weapons and targeting sensors and by permitting the sea to be used as medium of maneuver for evading detection and targe ting by longerrange enemy weapons and sensors second rationale for sea basing is that by eliminating the nearby base ashore the logistical middleman sea basing will permit the marine corps to initiate and maintain higher pace of operations against the desired objective thus enhancing the effectiveness of the operation third rationa for sea basing is that it could permit the marine force once the operation is completed to reconstitute and redeploy that is get back aboard ship and be ready for conducting another operation somewhere else more quickly than under the traditional concept of operations the sea base being referred to is not single ship but rather collection of ships

the war on terror gfs offers means to increase regional maritime security through the cooperative efforts of joint interagency and multinational partners as well as nongovernmental organizations like all sea bases the composition of gfs depends on combatant commander requirements the operating environment and the mission from its sea base each gfs would serve as selfcontained headquarters for regional operations with the capacity to repair and service all ships small craft and aircraft assigned additionally the gfs might provide classroom space limited dical facilities an information

procurement began followon ships in the class were estimated to cost roughly 750 million each estimated procurement costs for the followon ships subsequently grew to figures between about 1200 million and about 1500 million the navy estimates the procurement cost of the ninth ship at 17983 million relatively small portion of the cost growth in the program since its inception is attributable to the decision to reduce the programs sustaining procurement rate from two ships per year to one ship per year most of the programs cost growth is attributable to other causes31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32513crs16 31 continued 7681million in increased costs for the program or about 112 of the increased costs caused by all factors the other factors leading to increased

navy previously accepted delivery of ship with one million or more hour s of shipyard construction work remaining to be done and if so when funding additional ships in fy2008 potential key issue for congress in marking up the navys proposed fy2008 budget is whether to procure an additi onal lpd17 andor one or two modified takes in fy2008 as discussed earlier th additional lpd17 is not currently in the navys shipbuilding plan and the two modified takes are currently in the plan for procurement in fy2009 and fy2010 supporters of procuring an additional lpd17 in fy2008 could argue that this is the top item on the navys fy2008 upl and that building this ship would give the navy force of ten lpd17s as ca lled for in the navys 313ship plan supporters could argue that if congress d ecides that it has the funding available in fy2008 but perhaps not in future year to procure an additional lpd17 it should procure the ship in fy2008 even if the shipyard is not able to start work on it righthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32513crs21 away because the shipyard will eventually be able to build it and because what will matter more in the long run is the presence of this additional ship in the force structure not the fact that it t ook longer than average to build opponents of procuring an additional lpd17 in fy2008 could argue that unless the navys budget top line were increased the 1700 million or so needed to procure the ship might have to come from other fy2008 navy programs disrupting these other programs and possibly creating operational risks for the navy in other areas opponents could argue that the shipyard that would build this ship the avondale yard near new orleans that forms part of ngss would not be able to start work right away on an additional lpd17 procured in fy2008 due to disruption of the yards workforce and work schedule caused by hurricane katrina consequently opponents could argue proc uring this ship in fy2008 would amount to booking but not immediately building ship such an action they could argue would tie up 1700 million in budget authority that would not result in immediate obligations and expenditures supporters of procuring one or two modified takes in fy2008 could argue that this is the second item on the navy s fy2008 upl and that accelerating these two ships from fy2009 and fy2010 where they are currently planned into fy2008 could release funding in the navys fy2009 and fy2010 budgets for additional ships or other programs supporters could argue that funding one or both of these takes in fy2008 in addition to the regular take for navy use that is requested in the navys fy2008 budget could improve economie s of scale for these ships reducing their costs opponents of procuring one or two m odified takes in fy2008 could argue that unless the navys budget top line were increased the 1200 million or so needed to procure the ship might have to come from other fy2008 navy programs disrupting these other programs and possi bly creating operational risks for the navy in other areas opponents could argue that the 1200 million cost listed in the fy2008 upl for these two ships suggests that procuring one or two modified takes in addition to the regular take being procured in fy2008 will not significantly reduce their cost estimated cost of two takes in fy2008 upl as mentioned above the navys fy2008 up l includes as its second item two modified takes for the mpff squadron at an estimated combined procurement cost of about 1200 million implying unit procurement cost of about 600 million per ship the regular take that th navy wants to procure in fy2008 has an estimated procurement cost of 4561 million the difference in unit procurement cost between the regular take and the two modified takes raises potential oversight question for congress why does the navy estimate that the two modified takes in the navys fy2008 upl would be approximately onethird more expensive to procure than the regular take that the navy wants to procure in fy2008 at may 3 2007 markup meeting of the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee the representative

estimate 33 ships would be needed to ensure 30 are always available mullen said now thats how weve done it historically mullen said but the navys shipbuilding plan maintains only 30 amphibious vessels from fiscal year 2015 onward which s sparked complaints from conway mullen told senators he has committed to providing the marine corps with the lift capability it needs but he seemed to suggest alternatives to buying more amphibious ships weve got to look at how were going to fight in the future and specifically how were going to move this 20 ie marine expeditionary brigades into the fight mullen said g conway and i have agreed to figure out way together to make that work the fixes could include achieving high er availability rate for ships some of which would depend on the warning time involved in particular situations mullen saidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32513crs24 42 christopher j castelli conway and mullen seek to resolve debate on future fleet inside the navy may 7 2007the admiral also said new maritime prepositioning ships mpff vessels designed to form sea bases could help move marines to the fight in the future but mpff has been contentious subject the marine corps has argued civilianmanned unarmed mpff ships cannot provide the forcibleentry capability associated with amphibious warships sorting through these issues will not be easy but the outcome will have very important implications for plans to build sea bases with mpff ships mullen said the cost of the mpff squadron which mullen called significant has been source of tension with the marine corps because the navy argues it cannot afford to develop mpff ships wit hout buying fewer traditional amphibious ships which carry marine forces further unlike amphibious warships the mpff squadrons amphibious vessels will lack active selfdefense systems and will not be operated by navy sailors conway has publicly argued mpff vessels will not provide forcibleentry capabilities and should not be considered part of the traditional amphibious fighting force known as the assault echelon further officials have discussed the idea of having the bigdeck amphibious ships associated with mpff sail with other amphibious ships in the expeditionary strike force and not with the unarmed civilianmanned ships vice adm jonathan greenert deputy chief of naval operations for integration of capabilities and resources acknowledged this discussion late last month but did not say how the navy views the idea its an option he told inside the navy on april 24 following congressional hearing greenert declined to predic t the outcome of the talks i cant tell you how its going to come out because were having the debate he said and its more of discussion than debate debate would imply that theres only two ways to solve this were sitting down and going through the capabilities in the aggregate42 potential oversight questions fo r congress include the following what are the potential operational

goals perhaps reflecting the apparent disagreement between the navy and marine corps regarding the required size of the amphibious force the navy has suggested that it might change its required numbers of amphibious and mpff ships the navys february 2007 report on the 30year fy2008fy2037 shipbuilding plan stated future combat operations may require us to revisit many of the decisions reflected in this report including those associated with amphibious lift as the navy embarks on production of the maritime prepositioning force in this fydp the navy will continue to analyze the u tility of these ships in terms of their contribution to and ability to substitute for the assault echelon forces in the navys future battleforce inventory the current force represents the best balance between these forces available today however changing world events and resulting operational risk associated w ith the various force structure elements that make up these two components of over all lift will be analyz ed to ensure the navy is not taking excessive risk in lift capability and capacity while there needs to be balance between expeditionary and prepositioning ships for meeting the overall lift requirement future reports may adjust the level of support in one or both of these soluti ons any adjustments made in these capabilities will have to be accommodated in light of the resources available and could require the navy to commit additiona l funding to this effort in order to support the overall balance of our shipbuilding program43 potential oversight questions fo r congress include the following when might the navy know whether it wants to change its required numbers of amphibious andor mpff ships how might these numbers change how much confidence can congress have in the stability of the navys current stated requireme nts for amphibious and mpff ships should congress take actions to he dge against the possibility of the navy changing its requirements for

augu st 30 2006 the navy jag provided memorandum on september 19 2006 confirming that there are legal objections to developing the two options defined the one option is to initially designate the aviation big decks as naval auxiliaries usns manned with 100 civilian crew but develop the capability to timely and seamlessly convert them to warships uss in order to employ them during an international armed conflict the other option is to design ate the big decks as warships uss upon initial commissioning and man them with mixed militarycivilian crews regardless of option when operating as warship the platforms w ill need navy commanding officer and selected nior staff this requirement may be met by mariners who are in the navy reserve ship crew not engaged in warfighting functions may remain civilian mariners performing propulsion ship auxiliaries and housekeeping type operations with both options the other ships in the squadron due to their roles and logistics

the mpff squadron when do the navy and marine corps anticipate making decision on the manning strategy for these ships clarity of sea basing concept the february 2007 report to congress on the mpff program refers to sea basing as an emerging concept45 some observers have expressed concern about lack of clarity regarding the meaning of sea basing and consequently about what kinds of shipbuilding and other programs ar needed to implement it for example robert work naval analyst at the center for strategic and budgetary assessments csba an independent defensepolicy research institute states the following in lengthy report on sea basing released in november 2006 seabasing is new defense buzzword of growing importance and prominence in both joint and naval ci rcles unfortunately despite the increasingly common use of the term by both joint and naval planners alike therehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32513crs27 46 robert work thinking about seabasi ng all ahead slow washington csba 2006 pp iiivstill remains much mystery and misunderstanding about this important new concept indeed one of the key problems that has hindered meaningful debate and discussion about seabasing and especially the priorities revealed in its associated plans and programs is th at its contemporary definition and the important ideas that support it are poorly understood except among the relatively small group of officers and planners w ho have been intimately involved with their development to make matters worse since its grand unveiling by the department of the navy don in 2002 the concepts definition has constantly changed for example in august 2005 the seabasing jo int integrating concept jic defined seabasing as the rapid deploy ment assembly command projection reconstitution and reemployment of joint combat power from the sea while providing continuous support sustainm ent and force protection to select expeditionary joint forces without re liance on land bases within the joint operations area joa these capabilities expand operational maneuver options and facilitate assured access and entry from the sea however in the very month the seabasing jic was published the dod dictionary of military and associated terms amended through au gust 31 2005 defined seabasing as in amphibious operations technique of basing certain landing force support functions aboard ship which decreases s horebased presence moreover as is explained in this report both of these definitions and others like them are unduly restrictive incomplete confusing or all of these things partly as result there remains much uncertainty over exactly what seabasing is and over the current prog rammatic and budgetary direction of joint seabasing programs the current definition for seabasing nd the direction of its programs are narrowly focused on one thing revitalizing the dons seabased operational maneuver and seabased expeditionary powerprojection capabilities which were allowed atrophy during the cold war the list of seabasing functions is much longer only if all of these seabas ing functions are understood and compared can rational prioritization of planned seabasing improvements occur although seabasing concept developm ent within both the department of the navy and the department of defense dod is focused on seabased operational maneuver and expeditionary powerprojection capabilities its disjointed development since the end of the cold war has only served to confuse an urgently needed open debate and discussion about the future of naval maneuver in general and amphibious opera tions in particular and the best mix of platforms to support both central to this debate is whether or not future forcible entry operations from the sea should be conducted from amphibious warships or commercialstandard mpff ships or combination of both and whether or not these operations shoul d emphasize surface maneuver aerial maneuver or combination of the two the current understanding of both these issues need to be thoroug hly questioned and reviewed46 january 8 2008 defense trad press article stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32513crs28 47 geoff fein navy marine corps gain ing better

to afford navy ship construc tion costs in recent years have risen more quickly than some anticipated several recent navy ships procured in recent years have turned out to be more expensive to build than the navy originally projected48 cbo believes the navy is currently underestimating the procurement cost of proposed ships49 in addition as previously discussed fu lly implementing the sea basing

concerns about the navys potential ability to afford desired numbers of both mpff ships and ships for the regular amphibious force54 july 2007 cbo study compared the potential costs and capabilities of eight alternatives for deploying andor sust aining ground combat forces the navys proposed mpff squadron referred to in the cbo report as alternative e1 and seven other approaches the report states five of the alternatives would include some form of base at sea the other three would deliver forces and supplies by ai rcraft to examine the potential benefits of new technologies four of the alte rnatives would develop new systems rotorcraft able to carry greater payload of passengers and cargo and with longer range than existing rotorcraft and large airships with greater payloads than conventional aircraft the eight alternatives are grouped into two sets of four the first group of four alternatives e1 through e4 coul d both employ one brigade and sustain two brigades the second group of four lternatives s1 through s4 could only sustain two brigades that were already in place although the alternatives are generally structured to employ andor sustain ground forces that are similar in size their specific capabilities would vary considerably cbos analysis of those alternatives points to several general conclusions the planned mpff would provide capability similar to todays amphibious task forces but with improved responsiveness mebsized force could be ready one to two weeks earlier for conflict in the persian gulf or indian ocean region and with much smaller logistics presence required ashore alternative systems could provide lesser but still substantial improvements in capability at significantly lower cost than that of the mpff for example although

solving the access denial problem56 in his november 2006 report on sea basing work states that seabasing programs are being conceived of and pursued long before the full range of desired and possible joint seabasing capabilities have been adequately explored and debated the end result current seabasing plans ar rather narrowly focused on two rather limited capabilities landing single brigade on hostile shore in 11 to 17 days from the go order and thereafter prov iding seabased logistical support for two early entry brigades until followon joint forces arrive it is true that these two key capabilities reflect the top level requirements identified in the aforementioned seabasin g jic however these two capabilities reflect view of seabasing that rests upon questionable assumptions and analysis57 potential oversight questions potential oversight and policy questions for congress include the following if the procurement costs of th newconstruction ships in the proposed mpff squadron turn out to be higher than the navy estimates how might this affect the affordability of the sea basing concept when does dod intend to present to congress an estimate of the potential total cost to fully implement all aspects of the sea basing concept how does the current absence of such an estimate affect congresss ability to assess the potential affordability of sea basing or its potential cost effectiveness compared to potential alternativeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32513crs32 for conducting future expeditionary operations ashore or compared to programs for meeting other defense priorities what is the potential applicability of the capability to be provided by the mpff squadron to the gwot or to other pot ential conflict or nonconflict scenarios would an ability to employ one surface marine battalion and one vertical marine battalion from sea base in period of 8 to 10 hours be worth the cost to field this capability what are the potential costs and merits of lternatives to

risk the chief of naval operations has identified procurement of tenth lpd17 ship in 2008 as the navys top unfunded priority the committee is aware that construc tion for tenth lpd17 ship would not commence until fiscal year 2009 but delaying procurement beyond 2009 would cause significant cost growth and jeopardize industrial base stability byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32513crs38 introducing production breaks in the progra m therefore the committee directs the secretary of the navy to submit report not later than november 1 2007 that outlines the funding required for smart buy of lpd26 maintaining continuous uninterrupted production at critical ve ndors and shipbuilders facilities page 134 regarding mpff ships particularly the lhar and the national defense sealift fund ndsf the report states the fiscal year 2008 budget request included 966 m illion within the national defense sealift fund ndsf for various research and development activities including 678 million for the maritime prepositioning force future mpff this amount incl udes 49 million for amphibious assault replacement ships which are to be assign ed to the mpff designated mpff lhar the navys concept for mpff operations indicates that these ships will be multimission vessels capable of aflo at prepositioning sea basing operations in support of amphibious assault and routine operations in support of lesser contingencies mpff ships are planned to be operated by military sealift command crew however the mpff c oncept of operations differs sharply from current maritime prepositioning ships as result of the mpff contribution to the navys sea basing capability the mpff role to embark and ploy marines ashore while sustaining expeditionary warfare operations potentially exposes these ships and embarked marines to hostile fire the navy plans to protect the mpff ships through employment of the naval sea shield and therefore the navy does not plan to outfit mpff ships with self defens features the committee has expressed concern regarding the navys mpff survivability concept and in particular the navys proposal to eliminate the self defense features for the mpff lhar the restoration of the ships combat system would allow the mpff lhar to fill current shortfalls to the navys forcible entry lift capability the committee is aware that the department of the navy is continuing to review the military features for the mpff and that the navy expects to present the program plan to the joint require ments oversight council jroc later in fiscal year 2007 accordingly the committ ee directs the secretary of defense to submit report to the congressional defense committees within 30 days of the jroc mpff decision outlining the findings of the jroc the report shall include detailed vulnerability assessment of mpff for major combat operations the committee has been advised by the navy that the department of the navy will need to rephase into fiscal year 2009 certain mpff research and development efforts therefore the committee recommends decrease of 300 million for mpff research and development furthermore the committee does not agree with funding development nd procurement for amphibious assault ships within the ndsf this ship type is specifically not incl uded within the scope of sealift vessels eligible for ndsf defined within section 2218 of title 10 united states code therefore the committee recommends decrease of 49 million in pe 48042n and corresponding increase of 49 milli on in pe 64567n for mpff lharhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32513crs39 the committee recommends total authorization of 329 m illion in pe 48042n for mpff page 429 conference the conference report hrept 110477 of december 6 2007 on hr 1585 states the senate report srept 11077

the shipbuilding program by increasing the throughput of ships with proven design and construction processes ther efore funding is being added to the request for an additional lpd17 amphibious transport dock ship three additional take dry cargoammunition ships which will buy out the requirement for the maritime prepositioned force future and advance procurement for virginia class attack submarine page 227 regarding the lpd17 program the report stated the request includes 1398922000 for the procurement of the ninth san antonio class lpd17 amphi bious transport dock ship this ship is the final lpd17 class ship that the navy has in the budget the committee notes that the 313 ship fleet that the navy has stated as goal requires ten san antonio class ships and that this tenth ship was th highest priority listed on the navys unfunded priority list in an effort to achieve stability in the navys shipbuilding program by increasing throughput and helping the navy meet its stated requirement for lpd17 class ships the committee provides an additional 1700000000 for the procurement of tent h san antonio cl ass amphibious transport dock ship page 228 regarding the take program

for the acquisition of the eleventh lewis and clark class take dry cargoammunition ship in an effort to provide stability to the navys shipbuilding pr ogram by increasing throughput the committee provides 1866110000 for the proc urement of 3 additional take ships which is 1410000000 above the request in addition to providing stability this effort satisfies the second highest priority on the navys unfunded priority list this increa will allow the navy to buy out the take requirement for the maritime prepositioned force future while at the same time promoting stability to the construction yard and subvendors and achieving volume efficiencies page 390 senate the senate appropr iations committee in its report srept 110155 of september 14 2007 on hr 3222 reco mmended approving th navys request for fy2008 procurement funding for the lpd17 and lha6 programs the committees report states the committee fully supports the cnos chief of naval operations goal of 313 ship navy as minimum requirement for the nation the committee however has serious concerns with the navys ability to deliver on the current shipbuilding program of record the na vys track record for building ships on time and on budget has not been good the government accountability office gao has recently pointed out that the ships under construction at the beginning of the current fiscal year have experienced cumulative cost growth of almosthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32513crs41 5000000000 above their original budgets si gnificant cost growth schedule delay or both have occurred in the lpd17 program littoral combat ship lcs program the take program as well as the nextgeneration destroyer and aircraft carrier programs while supportive of additional funding for shipbuilding the committee is very c oncerned that accelerating any of the current shipbuilding programs is unexecuta ble and would have the effect of just banking funds naval shipbuilding has been plagued with too frequent design changes requirements creep poor cost estimating and poor government performance in program management and contractor ov ersight under staffing of critical government oversight functions has also been major problem for the navy the committee believes that the acquisition changes proposed by current navy leadership is movement in the right direction however the committee would like to see some positive results in cost schedule and performance of the current program of record before supporting sign ificant increases to the shipbuilding account page 133 conference the conference report hr ept 110434
