were 8153 billion including regular and supplemental spending the mission area with the largest gross outlays 413 billion or 50 of spending was for food and nutrition programs primarily the food stamp program the costliest single usda program various child nutrition programs and the supplemental nutrition program for women in fants and children wic the second largest mission area in rms of total

acrosstheboard rescission applied to all discretionary programs funded in the fy2003 consolidated appropriations act pl 1087 except for the wic program which was specifically exempted source house appropriations committee key distinction between mandatory nd discretionary spending involves how these two categories of spending are tr eated in the budget process congress generally controls spending on mandatory programs by setting rules for eligibility benefit formulas and other parameters rather than pproving specific dollar amounts for these programs each year eligibility fo r mandatory programs is usually written into authorizing law and any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law spending for

most spending for usdas mandatory ag riculture and cons ervation programs was authorized by the 2002 farm bill p l 107171 and is funded through usdas commodity credit corporation ccc the ccc is wholly owned government corporation it has the legal authority to borrow up to 30 billion at any one time from the us treasury these borrowed funds are used to finance spending for ongoing programs such as farm commod ity price and income support activities and various conservation trade and rural development programs the ccc has also been the funding source for large portion of emergency supplemental spending over the years particularly for adhoc farm di saster payments and direct market loss payments to growers of various commoditie s which have been provided in response to low farm commodity prices the ccc must eventually repay the funds it borrows from the treasury because the ccc never earns more than it spends its losses must be replenished periodically through cong ressional appropriati on so that its 30 billion borrowing authority debt limit is not depleted which would render the corporation unable to function congress generally provides th is infusion through the regular annual usda appropriation law because of th degree of difficulty in estimating its funding needs which is complicated by crop and weather conditions and other uncontrollable variables the ccc in recent years has received current indefinite appropriation which in ffect allows the ccc to receive such sums as are necessary during the fiscal year for previ ous years losses and current years losses as in past years the administration reque sted an indefinite appropriation for the ccc for fy2004 which the administration estimated at 17275 billion compared with an estimated indefi nite

requires the secretary of agriculture to more diligently support the farm price of milk at the farm billmandated support price of 990 per hundredweight cwt under th dairy price support program usda indirectly supports the farm price of milk by standing ready to purchase surplus cheese butter and nonfat dry milk from pro cessors at price that should allow the processors to pay at leas t the support pr ice to farmers for the milk used in the manufacturing of those products supporters of this provision argued that the government purchase prices for surplus da iry products are set too low by usda to support the farm price of milk at 990 per cw t late in 2002 and in early in 2003 the market price of farm milk used for cheese fell below th 990 support price for eight consecutive months usda officials say they are evaluating the situation and point out that the authorizing statute for the dairy price support program pl 107171 the 2002 farm bill requires usda to set dairy purchase prices so that the annual farm milk price on average is supported at 990 not the monthly price for more information on the dairy price support program see crs issue brief ib97011 dairy policy issues crop insurance the federal crop insurance program is administered by usdas risk management agency rma it offers basically free catastrophic insurance to producers who grow an insurable crop pr oducers who opt for this coverage have the opportunity to purchase additional insura nce coverage at subsidized rate most policies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insurance companies that have their program sses reinsured by usda the annual agriculture appropriations bill makes two separate appropriations for the federal crop insurance program it provi des discretionary funding fo r the salaries and expenses of the rma it also provides such sums as are necessary for the federal crop insurance fund which funds all other expens of the program including premium subsidies indemnity payments and re imbursements to the private insurance companies annual spending on the crop insu rance program is difficult to predict in advance and is dependent on weather and crop growing conditions and farmer participation rates the administration had estimated that the mandatoryfunded federal crop insurance fund would require an fy 2004 appropriation of 3368 billion compared with an estimated fy2003 appr opriation of 2886 billion as is customary the final consolidated appropriations act pl 108 199 concurs with the administrations estimate and provides such sums as may be n ecessary for the fund legislative enhancements pl 106224 made to th crop insurance program in 2000 greatly increased the federal subsidy of insuran ce premiums the increased subsidy coupled with large program losses associated with the extended drought in various parts of the country have contributed to incr eased program costs in recent years httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31801crs8 note the fy2004

rma the final fy2004 level is just 87000 below the original housepassed leve l 698 million below the administrations request but up 126 million from the fy2003 enacted level of 7025 million the administration had requested nearly 12 increase for fy2004 mainly to cover proposed information technology initiatives within rma the administration request also had cont ained legislative proposal to limit the amount of subsidy that accrues to the priv ate insurance companies participating in the program the house and senatepassed versions of the bill as well as the final act do not concur with the administrati on proposal the administration maintains that the increased farmer participation in the program following the 2000 legislative enhancements has resulted in windfall profits for the private insurance companies hence the fy2004 budget request containe d proposal to cap the reimbursement that the private companies receive from the federal government for their delivery expenses at 20 of premium for fy2004 and subsequent years instead of the current cap of 245 according to congressiona l budget office estimates enactment of this proposal would have saved 81 milli on in fy2004 in report language the senate appropriations committee stated that the pr oposed reimbursement limitation would force some private companies out of business and that the reimbursement rate should be negotiated in the standard re insurance agreement between the private companies and the federal government rather than through legislative mandate separately the agricultural risk protection act of

million of the funds be used for sharing in the cost of producers conservation practices as prescribed in the law and 2 million for certification of organi c growers in the states in fy2003 the

created funding shortfall congress attempted to address these funding concerns in th 2002 farm bill pl 107171 however in late 2002 the office of management and budget supported by department of justice opinion ruled that the farm bill did not remove the ccc cap and the administration would have to continue to limit mandatory technical assistance funding through the ccc the administration

of the mandatory conservation programs author ized at total of 12 billion plus the conservation reserve program mandatory program authorized in acres rather than dollars congress rejected this proposal and specifi cally prohibited the use of discretionary funds funds from the conservation operations account to implement any mandatory conservation programs this prohibition co mbined with retention of the cap on ccc funds meant that some of the mandatory programs were significant donor programs by funding techni cal assistance for other prog rams thereby leaving less money available to implement their activities usda estimated that four programs were donor programs with the largest donations being made from the eqip 1079 million and the farmland prot ection program 276 million the administration again proposed new discretionary techni cal assistance line item for fy2004 and congress again rejected it pl 108199 includes provision within each of the five discretionary account s
