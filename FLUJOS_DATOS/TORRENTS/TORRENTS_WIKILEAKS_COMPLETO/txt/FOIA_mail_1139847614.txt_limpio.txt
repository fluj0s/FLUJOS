dear all here is the data from the climber3alpha simulations i know they are too late but perhaps there is still way to include them the structure of the files is the same as evas the file names correspond to the ones you gave in the simulation protocol cheers anders fortunat joos wrote dear all please find attached an update of the simulation protocol and input data description kasper plattner pointed out that i forgot the obvious we need of course control run to correct for potential model drift the readme file has been modified accordingly adding brief description on how the control should be done i am looking forward to any additional comments hope everything is clear kasper is currently working to perform the simulation with the bern25cc regards fortunat fortunat joos wrote dear all i have now compiled the input data set and written protocol how to perform the runs it seems to that it would make sense if we perform the simulations first with the bern model and with the climber 2 model we can then still decide if we need climber 3 please let know if there are any questions i could also provide files where the radiative forcing of solar volcanoes and nonco2anthropogenic has been added together with best wishes fortunat jonathan overpeck wrote dear eva and fortunat thanks for working on getting things moving it seems that the detailed forcing recommendations laid out below by fortunat build nicely on what eva first suggested and that going with the forcing series suggested below by foortunat and the 6 simulations is going to be just right for the ipcc ar4 chap 6 needs does everyone agree thanks fortunat for preparingsharing the standard forcing series best peck dear eva we are working on the forcing series and they should be ready by the end of the week stefan assured us that you can run this within few hours what we are preparing are the following series of radiative forcing in wm2 rf from atmospheric constituents wellmixed ghgs co2 ch4 n2o many halocarbons tropo and strato ozone various anthropogenic aerosols as used in the bern cc tar version and the tar see joos et gbc 2001 pdf is on my homepage and tar appendix b volcanic from crowley sci 2000 c solar based on lean and bard et for the solar we will prepare 3 combinations c1 original serie from lean 2005 provided to you already c2 bard et be10 record linearly scaled to match the maunder minimum average of leanar4 c3 bard et be10 scaled to mm reduction of 025 permil ie the low case in the bard et tellus publication corresponding to the lean et 1995 scaling for the rf by atmospheric components two cases are foreseen a1 standard case with reconstructed evolution over past 1150 years a2 rf kept at 1765 value after 1765 ie simulation with natural forcings only this will yield in total 6 simulations 3 over the full length from 850 ad to 2000 and 3 brachoff simulatons from 1765 with natural only forcing an important point in ipcc is that things are published consistent among chapters and it helps if approaches are tracable to earlier accepted and approved ipcc work the arguments for these series are as follows considering as many components relevant for rf as possible more than just co2 the series are fully compatible with tar and that the setup is tracable to the tar for the industrial era increase the same series will be used in the projection chapter 10 for the sres calculation b volcanic widely cited record c solar c1 and c3 are published series c2 follows the same approach and spirit as used to derive c3 ie scaling the be10 serie linearly with given maunder minimum reduction the impact of the 11yr solar cycle can be looked at in the original leanar4 serie i hope this help with kind regards fortunat eva bauer wrote dear jonathan dear fortunat happy new year stefan anders and just have discussed how to set up our climber23alpha runs to produce something useful for the ipcc wgi chapter 6 this chapter appears to touch the impact on the nh temperature related to low and high solar forcing for reasonable comparison we think two 1000year simulations differing only by low and high solar forcing conducted with both climber models would be ideal to do so we would have to extend the solar forcing time series based on lean grl 2000 and on wang et 2005 distributed in previous emails back to the year 1000 this would require some splicing as was done for instance by crowley im thinking of some scaling applied to series of crowley say the data called be10lean splice in science 2000 such that the amplitude of the solar variability from the 11year cycle is conserved after 1720 i have to check but it appears that the variation in the tsi due to the 11year cycle contained in the crowley series agrees perfectly with the 11yrcycle data in the file based on lean 2000 before starting such an exercise i like to ask you what you think about we would be happy to receive your response quite soon to be able to finish the calculations with our slow model in time for the ipcc report could you please also comment on the other forcings we should include namely the volcanic forcing and the co2 forcing for the present study we suggest to use the forcing as in bauer et 2000 but omitting the landuse this means using the volcanic forcing from crowley 2000 and the co2 forcing based on etheridge et 1996 and keeling and whorf 1996 if you wish we can distribute these data series also thinking beyond the ipcc study the model results may become interesting enough to be discussed in 3model comparison study

httpwwwclimateunibechjoos last millennium simulations for ipcc ar4 wg1 chap 6 f joos joosclimateunibech 18 januar 2006 overview total of 7 simulations is planned control simulation without any forcing two millenniumlong simulations with solar forcing following bard et with maunder minimum reduction of 008 and 025 percent in total irradiance and volcanic and anthropogenic forcing included simulation from 1610 to 1998 with solar forcing from wang et 2005 and volcanic and anthropogenic forcing included three simulations from 1765 to 1998 with only solar and volcanic forcing included but anthropogenic forcings these are branches from the above three simulation range of input data files have been prepeared each contains header with additional descriptions of the data solar irradiance has been taken from bard et tellus 1999 and from wang lean shirley jap 2005 it is estimated that the maunder minimum irradiance is reduce by 008 percent relative to today and that the present irradiance is 1366 wm2 from the wang et data case with maunder minimum reduction of 008 percent is calculated from the bard et data by scaling the original bard series appropriately the original bard series are offset by 13 wm2 in irradiance to bring them to present irradiance of 1366 wm2 for this excercise we will utilize maunder minimum reduction in irradiance relative to today of 008 percent and of 025 percent other cases with high mm reduction are included in the files irradiance has been converted to radiative forcing rf irr1366407 volcanic forcing is from crowley science 2000 with
