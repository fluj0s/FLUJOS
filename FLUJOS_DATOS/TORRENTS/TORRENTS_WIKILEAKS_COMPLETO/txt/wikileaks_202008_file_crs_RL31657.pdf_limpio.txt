passed different versions of expanded mental health parity legislation s 558 and hr 1424 these bills have always been strongly supported by advocates for the mentally ill and have had broad bipartisan support in congress although employers and health insurance groups opposed the legislation in the past because of concern that it would drive up costs the provisions in s 558 now have their support expanded parity legislation was introduced in the 107 th 108th and 109th congresses but each time it failed to pass private health insurers often provide less coverage for mental illnesses than for other medical conditions historically health plans have imposed lower annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health coverage limited treatment of mental health illnesses by covering fewer hospital days and outpatient office visits and increased cost sharing for mental health care by raising deductibles and copayments the lack of parity ie equivalence in part reflects insurers concerns that mental disorders are difficult to diagnose and that mental health care is expensive and often ineffective however the 1999 surge on generals report on mental health concluded that mental illnesses are largely biologically based disorders like many other medical conditions it found that effective treatments exist for most mental disorders differences in insurance coverage of mental illnesses and other medical conditions are also the result of economic factors studies indicate that demand response of mental health patients to reduced cost sharing is approximately twice as large as that observed in general medical care partly as consequence insurers impose higher cost sharing for mental health insurers have also restricted mental health coverage to protect themselves against adverse selection ie the tendency for plans with generous mental health coverage to attract patients with mental illnesses that are costly to treat health plans frequently subcontract management of the mental health component of their benefits to specialized managed behavioral health care organizations mbhos recent studies have shown that there is significant increase in mental health costs to the insurer when parity is implemented in the context of managed care despite this finding introduction of managed behavioral health care and passage of state parity laws mental health coverage continues to be subject to more limitations and higher cost sharing than coverage of other illnesses some analysts argue that parity alone is not sufficient to guarantee equal access to quality care and equal financial protection for people with mental disorders twentyeight states have laws that mandate fullparity mental health coverage though these laws do not apply to selfinsured group plans in 1996 congress enacted the mental health parity act mhpa which is more limited in scope and does not compel insurers to provide fullparity coverage for group plans that choose to offer mental health benefits the mhpa requires parity only for annual and lifetime dollar limits on coverage group plans may still impose more restrictive treatment limitations and cost sharing requirements on their mental health coverage on june 17 2008 the president signed into law pl 110245 the extension of mhpa through 2008

congress there is renewed push to expand existing federal mental health parity law legislation introduced in the house hr 1424 by representatives kennedy and ramstad and in the senate s 558 by senators domenici and kennedy have passed in the respective chambers on march 5 2008 the house passed hr 1424 by roll call vote1 on september 18 2007 the senate passed s 558 with an amendment by voice vote the congressional budget office cbo scored s 558 and hr 1424 and estimated that if enacted both bills would increase health insurance premiums by 04 2 on april 29 2002 in speech on mental health care during which he announced the formation of the new freedom commission on mental health president bush urged congress to enact legislation that would provide full parity in the health insurance coverage of mental and physical illnesses the president identified unfair treatment limitations placed on mental health benefits as major barrier to mental health care historically private health insurers have provided less coverage of mental illnesses compared to other medical conditions for example health plans have imposed lower annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health coverage limited treatment of mental health illnesses by covering fewer hospital days and outpatient office visits and increased cost sharing for mental health care serv ices under full parity plan must use the same treatment limitations and financial requirements in its mental health coverage as it does in its medical and surgical coverage 3 the new freedom commission endorsed mental health parity in its final report issued on july 22 2003 the commission strongly supports the presidents call for federal legislation to provide full parity between insurance coverage for mental health care and physical health care the report said in reference to the presidents april 2002 address4 in 1996 congress enacted the mental health parity act mhpa which established new federal standards for mental health coverage offered by group health plans however the mhpa is limited in scope and does not compel health plans to offer fullparity mental health coverage it requires group health plans that choose to provide mental health benefits to adopt the same annual and lifetime dollar limits on their coverage of mental and physical illnesses plans may still impose more restrictive treatment limitations or cost sharing requirements on their mental health coverage lawmakers recently reauthorized the mhpa through december 31 2008 senators domenici and wellstone introduced fullparity legislation s 543 in the 107 th congress the measure saw some action but failed to pass the legislation s 486 was reintroduced at the beginning of the 108th congress by senators domenici and kennedy

legislative action was taken on either bill in the 109th congress the mhpa was introduc ed in the house hr 1402 by representatives kennedy and ramstad legislative action was taken on this bill and corresponding legislation was introduced in the senate for an analysis of the legislative history of federal parity legislation see crs report rl33820 the mental health parity act legislative history by ramya sundararaman and c stephen redhead patient advocacy groups and health care provider organizations that support mental health parity argue that there is longer any scientific justification for discrimination in mental health coverage which they believe only reinforces the stigma that many in society attach to mental illness their efforts to combat discrimination received boost with the release of the 1999 surgeon generals report on mental health5 the report reviewed the extensive scientific literature on mental health and concluded that mental illnesses were largely biologically based disorders like many other medical conditions it so found that the efficacy of mental health treatments is well documented and that effective treatments exist for most mental disorders proponents of mental health parity highlight the high costs to society of untreated and undertreated mental illness the substance abuse and mental health services administration estimated that the direct treatment costs of mental illness in 2001 totaled 85 billion6 this does not include the economic costs of lost productivity due to illness lifetime lost productivity and other indirect costs 7 employer and health insurance associations oppose parity legislation because of concerns that it will drive up costs parity supporters refute those claims pointing to recent studies that indicate that full parity can be implemented without subs tantial cost increases within the context of comprehensively managed behavioral health care twentyeight states have passed laws mandating fullparity mental health coverage except wyoming all other states have enacted legislation that requires health plans to provide certain specified mental health benefits but not necessarily full parity however employers who have selfinsured plans ie the employers pay physicians and hospitals directly are not bound by state insurance regulations this report briefly summarizes the economic forces that help explain the persistent limitations on mental health coverage in conventional feeforservice indemnity health plans it also discusses issues relating to the feasibility of parity under managed care in the past decade managed care has transformed the delivery of mental health care services employers and health plans now frequently contract out administration of their mental health benefits to specialty managed behavioral health care organizations the report then reviews state mental health parity legislation and compares the senate and house versions of the latest fullparity legislation s 558 and hr 1424 in the 110 th congress it concludes with discussion of some of the key issues in the ongoing congressional debate on mental health parity and discusses why parity may not be 5 us dept

institutions that provided medical treatment room and board and vocational activities for individuals with severe psychiatric disorders in the 1960s the role of state governments in mental health began to diminish as alternative forms of outpatient and communitybased care gradually replaced institutional care the mental health system over time started to resemble the general health care system financed by combination of private and public insurance however private insurance coverage for mental health care longer included some of the nonmedical services provided by state institutions such as accommodation and em ployment in addition mental health coverage tended to be more restrictive than the coverage for physical illnesses and surgery and include higher level of cost sharing the lack of parity in insurance coverage in part reflected insurers concerns that the costs of mental health care were high and unpredictable insurers argued that mental disorders were difficult to define and that treatments involving longterm intensive psychotherapy and extended hospital stays were expensive and often ineffective although stigma has played and continues to play an important role in the mental health care debate differences in insurance coverage of mental illnesses and other medical conditions are also the result of important economic factors studies of indemnity insurance have found that the moral hazard problem is more pronounced for mental health care than it is for general medical care moral hazard refers to the tendency for patients to demand more services as the price they pay for those services declines while health insurance in general creates incentives for overuse by insulating patients from the total costs of care research shows that the demand response to reduced cost sharing in mental health care is approximately twice as large as that observed in general medical care 9 the result has been for insurers to impose higher cost sharing for mental health care insurers have also restricted their mental health coverage to protect themselves from adverse selection adverse selection refers to the tendency for health plans with generous coverage provisions to attract sick ie highcost enrollees the evidence suggests that adverse selection may be an especially powerful force in mental health care studies indicate that individuals with mental illness select health plans that offer more generous mental health coverage 10 such 8 for detailed discussion of the economics of mental health see richard g frank and thomas g mcguire economics and mental health in

reduce their attractiveness to users of mental health care while competition among plans to avoid enrolling highrisk individuals may represent good strategy for an individual plan health economists argue that it is wasteful and inefficient for the health insurance system as whole competition among indemnity insurance plans is seen as an important factor in reducing the level of coverage for mental health care during the 1970s and 1980s this argument was used to justify federal and state mandated benefit laws that required insurers to cover minimum levels of mental health care see below some health economists claim that parity can improve the efficiency of insurance markets by reducing wasteful forms of competition that are the result of adverse selection these commenters note that requiring parity for mental health benefits establishes uniform floor of mental health coverage across all plans supporters of parity maintain that studie s show that implementing parity through managed mental health care will not lead to significant increase in costs to the insurers

mental health care has been fueled by changes in the scientific understanding of mental illness and the rapid increase in managed behavioral health care ie mental health and substance abuse treatment recently revised estimates suggest that about 15 of the adult us population approximately 30 million individuals are affected by clinically significant mental disorder in any given year 11 clinicians are often able to diagnose mental illness with precision and effective treatments now exist for many psychiatric conditions some studies show that the effectiveness of treatments for major mental disorders which typically involve combination of medication and psychotherapy often match or exceed the effectiveness of common treatments for physical illness12 as noted earlier proponents of parity argue that untreated and undertreated mental illness has major impact on the economy and costs employers tens of billions of dollars annually in lost productivity health plans frequently subcontract or carve out to managed behavioral health care organizations mbhos the management of the ntal health and substance abuse component of their benefits package over the past few year s behavioral carveouts have become central to the delivery and payment of mental health care13 nearly threequarters of americans with health insurance are covered by managed health benefits samhsa has published

are provided whereas conventional feeforservice insurance controls the demand for services primarily through cost sharing eg deductibles copayments and treatment limitations mbhos influence the treatment decisions of mental health care prov iders through variety of techniques including financial incentives greater emphasis on preventive medicine development of treatment protocols and prior authorization of certain services cost sharing and coverage limits assume less importance under managed care which seeks to control moral hazard by internal rationing methods rather than having to rely on demandside cost sharing the introduction of managed mental health care can reduce spending and in some cases increase plan usage for example pacific bell lowered it s mental health expenditures by 13 when it implemented managed behavioral health care in the early 1990s 15 the cost reduction was not attributable to decreased initial access to care the number of persons using any mental health care actually increased following the change instead the cost reduction was the result of fewer outpatient sessions per patient reduced likelihood of inpatient admission reduction in the length of stay for those admitted as inpatients and significantly lower costs per unit of service delivered massachusetts saw 25 decline in behavioral health care costs for state employees as result of introducing managed care in 199316 studies also suggest that mbhos are able to control the costs associated with mental health parity in 1996 estimates of the cost of implementing full parity ranged as high as 11 of the total health care premium which led congress to limit paritylevel benefits in the mhpa but those estimates did not adequately reflect the impact of managed care and increased use of psychotropic drugs and shortterm psychotherapeutics on controlling costs more recent studies in states that have enacted fullparity laws for mental health coverage provided by managed care plans found that premium increases have been modest 17 magellan health services the nations largest mbho covering nearly 70 million individuals reported that it had yet to see premium cost increase of more than 1 as result of im plementing state mental health parity legislation at 2001 robert wood johnson foundation workshop on the costs of mental health parity actuaries economists and government officials discussed the assumptions and methods used in calculating parity cost estimates there was broad agreement among the workshop participants that the baseline level of mental health spending has decreased significantly as result of changes in clinical practice eg use of psychotropic drugs and shortterm psychotherapies and the growth of managed care baseline mental health spending is often represented by the share of the total health insurance premium spent on mental health services without parity changes in premium costs that result from parity are then expressed as percentage change in baseline workshop participants were also in agreement that managed care has had an important affect on the impact of parity laws managed care plans have responded to the expansion of benefits under parity by tightening their internal controls on the use of mental health services so as to dampen any increase in demand and premiums 18 15 william goldman et costs and use of mental

in the 1970s more than dozen states enacted laws requiring health plans operating within the state to offer specific set of mental health benefits while these mandatedbenefit laws increased coverage they had important limitations they seldom provided catastrophic coverage against the financial risk of severe mental illness and they did not apply to selfinsured employers which are exempt from state regulation under the employee retirem ent income security act erisa in 1991 texas and north carolina became the first states to enact mental health parity legislation both state laws were limited in their scope and applied only to insurers that covered state and local government employees by 1996 when federal parity legislation was enacted see below total of seven states had passed laws that required certain specified stateregulated health plans to provide fullparity mental health coverage since then more than dozen other states have passed similar legislation bringing to 28 the total number of states that now mandate mental health coverage with full parity state laws that mandate fullparity mental health benefits vary in the types of health plans covered and also in the types of mental illnesses they cover in 15 states the laws apply both to group health plans and to the individual health insurance market whereas in another 9 of these states they apply only to group plans in the rema ining four states the laws apply only to state employee plans in 12 of the states with full parity laws the laws apply to the treatment of all the conditions listed in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders fourth edition dsmiv 20 the other parity laws restrict coverage to specified serious or biologically based mental illness eg schizophrenia depression bipolar disorder about onethird of the state parity laws exempt small employers typically those with 50 or fewer employees in addition to the 28 states that have enacted full parity legislation 6 states have passed laws mandating certain minimum level of mental health benefits but not full parity fourteen other states have passed socalled mandated offering laws under which covered plans that choose to offer mental health coverage must provide specified minimum level of benefits the bills currently introduced in the house and senate are mandated offering laws see appendix b for summary of state parity laws new jersey which in 1999 enacted full parity law that covers both group plans and the individual market recently passed legislation that requires individual carriers to offer policy with minimum mandated mental health benefits those benefits include coverage for 90 days of inpatient treatment with 500 copayment per inpatient stay and 30 days of outpatient treatment with 30 coinsurance the new law does not replace the existing full parity mandate but is intended to provide individuals with less expensive alternative to policy with fullparity coverage the aim of the law is to allow individuals who might otherwise not be able to afford continued httpwwwrwjforgpublicationspublicationspdfsparity_reportpdf 19 information on state mental health parity laws is based on data compiled

mental health parity act mhpa amended erisa and the public health service act phs act and established new federal standards for mental health coverage offered by group health plans most of which are employment based 21 identical provisions were later added to the internal revenue code irc by the taxpayer relief act of 199722 the mhpa is not fullparity law it requires equivalence in only one area catastrophic coverage the mhpa prohibits group plans from imposing annual and lifetime dollar limits on mental health coverage that are more restrictive than those imposed on medical and surgical coverage group plans may still impose more restrictive treatment limitations or cost sharing requirements on their mental health coverage compared to their medical and surgical coverage the mhpa includes several other important limitations group plans that choose not to provide mental health benefits are not required to add them and employers with 50 or fewer employees are exempt from the law in addition employers that experience an increase in claims costs of at least 1 as result of mhpa compliance can apply to the department of labor for an exemption the mhpa standards apply to privatesector em ployersponsored group health plans including fully insured and selfinsured plans but not to the individual nongroup health insurance market they also apply to the federal employees health benefits program and to some state and local government health plans under provisions included in the 1997 balanced budget act pl 105 33 medicaid managed care plans and state childrens health insurance programs also have to comply with the requirements of the mhpa 23 the mhpa does not apply to medicare in 1999 the general accounting office gao reviewed the extent to which employers were complying with the mhpa and how th ey had revised their health plans24 gao surveyed 863 employers in 26 states without full parity laws while 86 of the employers reported compliance with the mhpa majority of these plans 87 re stricted their mental health coverage in other ways for example about twothirds of mhpacompliant plans covered fewer outpatient visits and hospital days for mental health treatment than for other medical treatment surveys by the labor department and the centers for medicare medicaid services found similar results many plans that had to increase annual and life time dollar limits to comply with the mhpa reportedly introduced other more restrictive mental health design features to mitigate the financial impact of the laws more generous dollar limits despite concerns about the mhpa s effect on claims costs only 3 of employers surveyed by gao reported that their costs had increased and less than 1 of surveyed employers dropped their mental health coverage

mhpas increased dollar limits however because many plans took steps to counter increases in claims costs by restricting mental health coverage in other ways though limited in its scope the mhpa

section 4980d of the code the taxes are payable to the us treasury in general the excise taxes are 100 per day of noncompliance for every qualified beneficiary when violations are discovered after notice of examination the minimum tax is 2500 or 15000 if violations are more than minimus the minimum tax does not apply to church plans when violations are due to reasonable cause and not willful

and not willful neglect the secretary of the treasury may waive part or all of the tax if payment would be excessive relative to the failure involved taxes apply if failures were not discovered when

outside fehbp that did not mandate parity concluded that implementation of parity in insurance benefits for mental health and substance abuse when coupled with management of care resulted in little or significant adverse impact on access spending or quality while providing users of behavioral health care with improved financial protection in most instances26 the researchers analyzed plan benefits data for seven fehb plans both before 1999 and 2000 and after 2001 and 2002 the introduction of parity changes in access utilization and cost were compared to changes over the same time period in matched set of nonfehb comparison plans mostly large selfinsured employers the analysis indicated that the observed increase in the rate of use of mental health and substance abuse services in fehb

only those treatment services that are medically necessary finally the bills require gao within two years to evaluate the impact of the new federal parity standards on access to insurance coverage and on insurance costs there are two key differences between the house and senate parity bills the first difference is that the senate version would allow insurance companies to determine which mental illnesses they cover whereas the house version would require coverage for all mental illnesses see discussion below the second key difference is that the senate version does not explicitly address preemption of state mental health parity laws whereas the house version explicitly states that it does not preempt state mental health parity laws for an analysis of the differences between the house and senate parity bills see appendix unlike previous versions of expanded parity legislation the house and senate versions in the 110 th congress include parity for substance abuse treatment services

federal fullparity legislation has staunch support among patient advocates and mental health provider organizations who see it as an important step in eliminating what they characterize as inappropriate discrimination in private health insurance coverage of mental illness but groups representing employers and the health insurance industry strongly oppose the legislation on the grounds that it will add significantly to the dramatically rising costs of health care they argue that employers cannot afford to spend more money on health insurance coverage for their employees in the current economic climate they contend that parity costs would likely take the form of increased cost sharing for all covered benefits reductions in other health care coverage andor the elimination of health coverage entirely which would lead to an increase in the number of uninsured proponents of parity legislation counter that full parity does not significantly increase costs under managed care they argue that parity can in fact reduce costs to employers by improving productivity and reducing absenteeism furthermore they claim that fullparity coverage lowers overall health care expenditures by eliminating the need for medical care and emergency room visits that result if mental illnesses are left untreated some large employers have reported that parity in mental health benefits has had net positive financial impact as an example they cite delta airlines delta increased mental health benefits for its 69000 employees in 1994 when it switched to managed care use of mental health services increased but costs remained flat spending in other areas of health care declined and employees missed less work 31 31 grazier k pollack h viewing employerbased behavioral health services

broad definition of mental illness in hr 1424 they believe that federal parity legislation should cover only serious mental illnesses or illnesses that have been shown to be related to the biological functioning of the brain eg schizophrenia bipolar disorder as do ma ny state laws s 558 which covers only mental illnesses that are specifically included by the health plan has the support of employers and health insurers critics of hr 1424 claim that extending coverage to all the mental disorders listed in the dsmiv opens the door to dubious complaints of less serious problems by the worried well they object to providing coverage for many of the conditions that are classified as mental disorders in the dsmiv eg academic skills disorders sexual desire disorders because they are not seen as medically significant parity supporters view opposition to providing coverage of all dsmiv disorders as stemming in part from stigma and the mistaken belief that mental illness does not have physiological basis they claim that restricting mental health coverage to few specified psychiatric conditions is different than having medical benefits that cover only serious physical disease such as cancer and heart disease they argue that covering all the dsmiv disorders is unlikely to lead to abuse or inflated costs for two reasons first hr 1424 does not prevent plans from managing mental health benefits through such practices as utilization review preauthorization the application of medical necessity and other appropriateness criteria and through the use of provider networks second the dsmiv establishes threshold for diagnosis by requiring evidence of clinically significant impairment or distress any claims for treatment of patient with mental health condition that was not serious enough to meet that threshold could be excluded on the basis of medical necessity advocates of mental health parity also assert that restricting coverage to few major mental illnesses is pennywise and poundfoolish they point out that milder forms of emotional illness often worsen into more serious psychiatric disorders if left untreated

inpatient day limit the proportion of covered workers subject to annual mental health day and visit limits appears to have increased over the past few years in contrast the survey found only 22 of covered workers had higher cost sharing ie copayment or coinsurance for mental health benefits this suggests that health plans are relying less on higher cost sharing as means of limiting the use of mental health services the 2002 kffhret survey data indicate that about onethird of workers with employer sponsored health insurance receive their mental health care through carveouts surprisingly the investigators found relatively little difference in the nominal mental health benefits ie the treatment limitations and cost sharing requirements spelled out in the insurance contract under carveouts versus integrated health plans carveouts and integrated plans had similar limitations on the number of inpatient days and outpatient visits there was also significant difference in the percentage of covered workers with higher cost sharing for outpatient mental health services in carveouts compared to integrated plans given that mbhos incorporate supplyside utilizati on controls rather than relying solely on cost sharing and benefit limits to lower demand one might expect them to expand mental health benefits while maintaining control over costs but the kffhret survey data indicate that carve outs continue to impose special limits and substantial cost sharing on mental health some researchers hypothesize that lack of employer ed ucation about the cost advantages of behavioral mental health care management minimal risk sharing under many carveout contracts or singleminded focus on cost containment could explain why mental health benefit limitations persist lingering concerns about adverse selection could also play role in the persistence of benefit limits overall the 2002 kffhret survey findings suggest th at mental health parity may be difficult to establish without broader ie federal parity laws state parity laws have limited impact because they do not cover selfinsured plans erisa exempts selfinsured plans from state regulation about 52 of covered workers are in

analysts often argue that parity laws are an important step in improving the efficiency and fairness of insurance coverage for mental illness but many are concerned that parity in nominal benefits for mental health care by itself is not sufficient to guarantee equal access to highquality care and equal levels of financial protection for people with mental disorders for one thing many mental health services do not have any counterpart in general medical care and are therefore unaffected by parity legislation because they do not have to be included in covered benefits private insurance usually does not cover dayhospital care psychosocial rehabilitation or residential treatment programs all of which are seen as effective continued 22 2003 pp 127137 the 2002 kffhret survey sampled 2014

cover supervised housing or employment for patients with chronic mental health conditions proponents of parity maintain that taking broader view of access to quality mental health care means encompassing variety of socialwelfare services advocates for the mentally ill worry that behavioral health carveouts may not provide patients with all the appropriate and medically necessary care while managed behavioral health care has proved effective at controlling the costs of full parity patient advocates are concerned about management decisions that may result in across theboard reductions in treatment without regard to clinical circumstances mbhos are under pressure to contain costs the internal management processes that they use to ration treatment are difficult to regulate even under federal and state parity laws mbhos still retain wide latitude to manage coverage and control access to mental health care in order to achieve costcontrol goals managed care contacts with their complex internal rationing devices are more remote fro m regulation than the traditional feeforservice contracts mbhos maintain that by lowering costs and offering paritylevel benefits patients have greater access to treatment at an earlier point in the development of their illness this in turn they hold results in less suffering and lower costs associated with that treatment moreover they point to studies that have shown that early effective treatment of mental illness leads to lower medical costs generally lower disability costs and less absenteeism in the workplace but critics of behavioral carveouts contend that the managed ca re tools employed by mbhos are widening the gap between plans nominal benefits and the care actually received by patients in contrast to using primary care physician as the gatekeeper to more specialized care which is model commonly employed in managed care mbhos use larger range of techniques to manage mental health care eg concurrent utilization review by clinical care managers and use different mix of providers and services 35 the american psychiatric association and th american medical association ama have criticized carveouts as discriminatory because they separate behavioral health care from mainstream health care rather than integrating the two thus reinforcing the notion that behavioral health is somehow different from other medical conditions results of the 19961998 health care for communities hcc national survey relate to analysts concerns about the impact of parity on access to quality mental health care the hcc survey concluded that state parity laws have had discernible impact on the overall use of mental health services the survey suggested that utilization of mental health care was higher in parity states than in states without such laws hcc researchers said their survey supports the view that the insurance market has responded to parity laws by increasing the management of care in order to control costs they analyzed the selfreported unmet needs among respondents seeking treatment for mental health and substance abuse problems when unmet needs was defined as delays in receiving treatment or receiving ss treatment than desired significantly more respondents in managed care reported unmet needs than those enrolled in indemnity insurance however when unmet needs was defined as obtaining care those in managed care reported 35 recent articles on the history and development of parity legislation and the impact of managed behavioral health care include i kevin d hennessy and howard h

largest health insurerskaisercommunity health plan kaiserchp and blue cross blue shield of vermont bcbsvtwhich together covered nearly 80 of vermonts privately insured population at the time the parity law was implemented vermonts parity law one of the nations most comprehensive covers both mental health and substance abuse treatment services as result of the law both plans made changes to their management of mental health and substance abuse mhsa services managed care was an important factor in controlling costs following implementation of parity before the parity law took effect bcbsvt provided mhsa services mainly through indemnity contracts after parity most bcbsvt members received those services through managed care carveout and reported decline both in the likelihood of obtaining mental health treatment and in the average number of outpatient visits kaiserchp which had managed care prior to the parity law increased the use of partial hospitalization treatment and group therapy and reduced the use of inpatient treatment overall mhsa spending fell by 818 after parity was implemented despite lower consumer outofpocket costs and higher limits on the use of mhsa
