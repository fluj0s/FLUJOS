adequate resources exist to respond to catastrophe the directive sets forth the following specific task the national preparedness goal will estab lish measurable readiness priorities and targets that appropriately balance the pot ential threat and magnitude of terrorist attacks major disasters and other emergencies with the resources required to prevent respond to and recover from them it will also include readiness metrics and elements that support th national preparedness goal including standards for preparedness assessments and strategies and system for assessing the nations overall preparedness to respond to major events especially those involving acts of terrorism8 dhs has issued several versions of dr aft preparedness goals in accordance with the statutory mandate in the fy2005 and fy2006 dhs appropriations acts as well as hspd8 the most recent issued in december 2005 supersedes its predecessors the national preparedness goal aims at engaging federal non federal nongove rnmental entities and the public in efforts to enhance their capability for preventing responding to and recovering from attacks disasters and emergencies uses and supports the national response plan and the national incident management system nims and the national infrastructure protection plan incorporates an allhazards risk based approach that encourages officials to strengthen capabilities and establishes national priorities in emergency preparedness and seeks to clarify the roles and responsibilities of federal and non federal entities9 the document emphasized that

critics assert that states and urban areas have prepared these documents without necessary federal guidance for example study released by the government accountability office gao concluded that the

the guidance particularly through the use of the assessment metrics is intended to ensure that preparedness resources are used effectively and that better understanding is developed of the emergency preparedness capabilities at all levels of government the assessment process set forth in the guidance comprises the following four elements compliance assessment checklist of whether federal and nonfederal entities have accomplis hed specified requirements capability assessment initially based on sampling of states and substate regions needs assessment the identification of resource needs based on capability assessments and performance assessment measured through afteraction reports and documentation of performance in exercises and emergencies possible oversight issues as the guidance

extent have state and local officials been part of the guidance development process issue as dhs continues to conduct capability reviews and develop the guidance to what extent will states and urban areas have opportunities to provide input before they are expected to adjust their plans following changes in the guidance planning scenarios dhs developed 15 scenario s to assess the emergency response and preparedness capab ilities of state local and tr ibal governments the scenarios were not developed to identify events that may occur instead they are intended to facilitate efforts by all government agencies to assess the full range of needs that might be manifested were similar events actually to occur some of the scenarios include nuclear detonation biological attack chemical attack

and generally require capabilities for which the nation is currently the least prepared15 the scenarios depict events that might require federal i nvolvement and coordi nation such events are referred to as incidents of national significance possible oversight issues some have questione d whether the emphasis by dhs on terrorist attacks indicates that the npg the guidance and planning scenarios are disproportionately oriented toward terrorist attacks and away from the more frequently occurring catastrophes natura l disasters some might argue that the terrorism focus of the dhs preparedness guidance and its associated grant programs constitute shift from the allhazards approach issue is there conflict between terrorismfocused preparedness guidance and grants with allhazar ds planning is allhazards planning dominated by terrorism concerns issue should federal preparedne ss guidance and assistance programs be refocused to place greater emphasis on an allhazards approach issue if state or an urban area focuses its hsgp application on all hazards will it receive less funding even if the state or urban area has greater terrorism risk than other states or urban areas universal task

security assistance dhs required recipients to report expenditures for homeland security equipment plans training or ex ercises those expenditure reports are longer required some critics could argue that this absence of information on state and urban area expenditures might result in dhs being incompletely apprised of state and local homeland security activities and such lack of information would impede the departments determina tion of whether the nations homeland security needs were being met effectively and fficiently for example gaos director of homeland security and justice issues william jenkins jr made the following statement before californias little hoover commission27 in the last several years the federal government has awarded some 11 billion in grants to federal state and local authorities to improve emergency preparedness response and recovery capabilities what is remarkable about the whole area of emergency preparedness and homeland security is how little we know about how

29 us department of homeland secur ity office for grants and training fy2006 hsgp fact sheet risk analysis washington may 2006 p 2 30 ibidon the other hand one could argue that with all the other information that it requires dhs does not need to know specific state and urban area expenditures issue do the present state and urban area reporting and application requirements provide sufficiently comprehensive information to ensure that federal homeland security assistance is used in manner that contributes to homeland security issue what are the advantages and di sadvantages of requiring states and urban areas to submit detailed list of homeland security expenditures allocation methods in fy2006 dhs allocated the discretiona ry portions of shsgp and letpp grants and all uasi grants on the basis of two factors risk and effectiveness risk dhs defines risk as f unction of three variables threat the likelihood of type of attack that might be attempted vulnerability the likelihood that terrorist would succeed with particular type of attack and consequence the potential impact of particular attack29 dhs calculates two kinds of risk assetbased risk which uses threat values derived from the us intelligence communitys assessment of threats to specific critical infrastructure and geographicbased risk which uses values based on inherent risks associated with geographic areas taking into account such factors as international borders terrorism reports and investigations and population density dhs describes its approach to assetbased risk as follows the assetbased approach uses strategi c threat estimates from the intelligence community of an adversarys intent and capability to attack different types of assets such as chemical plants stadiums and commercial airports using different attack methods dhs analyzes the vulnerability of each asset type relative to each attack method to determine the form of attack most likely to be successful additionally dhs estimates the consequences that successful attacks would have on each asset type including human health economic strategic mission and psychological impacts this analysis yields relative risk estimate for each asset type which dhs applies to given geographic area based on the number of each asset type present within that area30httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33583crs12 31 ibidthe department explains its complementary geographicbased risk calculations as follows the geographicbased approach allows dhs to consider general characteristics of geographic area mostly independent of the assets that exist within that area first dhs evaluates reported threats law enforcement activity using federal bureau of investigation and immigration and customs enforcement terrorism case data and suspicious incidents re ported during the evaluation period next dhs considers vulnerability factors for each geographic area such as the areas proximity to international borders lastly dhs estimates the potential consequences of an attack on that area including human health eg popul ation population density transient populations economy eg percentage of gross domestic product total agriculture sales international cargo value strategic mission eg defense industrial base and psychological impacts31 table 2 below presents state and urban area assets that dhs considered in the risk model for its

issue who should identify the risk nd effectiveness factors to be considered dhs has adopted allocation methodologie s as explained above and they may be the most appropriate dhs has opted to use two categories for risk factors asset types and geographic attributes see tables 2 and 3 there are other approaches and factors examples of risk factor s could include threats homeland security capabilities population critical infrastructure assets and transpor tation assets in order to accurately assess the risk factors one would need to evaluate the threats to the population critical infrastructure trans portation and the like and determine the consequences of threats additionally ffectiveness factors such as the homeland security capabilities to prevent respond to and recover from terrorist attacks and natural and technical disaster s would need to be assessed the methods of threat and vulnerability assessment suggest variety of factors that might be used in devising riskbased funding approaches for alloca ting homeland security assistance to states and urban areas the dhs inspector generals report on th nadb states that ips data request to states generated an abundance of unusual or outofplace assets whose criticality is not readily apparent40 examples of outofplace assets cited include psychiatry behavioral clinic an ice cream parlor sears auto center and

2002 australasian evaluation society conference nov 2002 wollongong australiaand pork festival41 additionally the report identifies inconsistencies when comparing statebystate asset totals42 the dhs inspector general states several of dhs protection programs u tilize information fro m the nadb to help allocate resources however in light of the variation in reporting between various sectors and states as well as the lack of detailed information on sites we are not confident that the nadb can yet support effective grant decision making43 issue what risk and effectiveness factors are most appropriate issue how did dhs determine what asset types and geographic attributes to use and how are these weighted in states or an urban areas risk assessment issue what weight did dhs give to nadb assets and what other sources did dhs use in determining asset risks in considering risk and effectiveness fact ors question arises of what criteria to use when assessing potential riskbased formula variables risk factors include threats the entity threatened and the consequences of the threat to the specified entity the agreement of potential risk and need factors is usually considered against the following criteria 44 validity do the factors serve as measures or indicators of threats the vulnerability of the potential target or potential consequence if catastrophe strikes the target for example does higher population density indicate gr eater vulnerability to an attack involving weapon of mass destructi on what attributes associated with densely populated areas eg numbers of law enforcement personnel on duty the presence of sensors cameras and other technology could reduce the validity of the factor relevance what is the relationship between the factors and the identified items or characteristics is the relationship straightforward or is it murky for example the total number of vehicles traveling through mid city tunnel would probably not be pertinent to consideration of the risk of hazardous material accident the number of commerc ial trucks carrying hazardous material however woul d be more relevanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33583crs19 45 george foresman under secretary for pr eparedness us department of homeland security statement before the house committee on government reform regional insecurity dhs grants to the national capital region june 15 2006 reliability the quality of the source of the information used in risk assessment process is rele vant for example population data from the us census bureau are ge nerally regarded as reliable and are used in variety of formulas for allocating aid grants timeliness the currency of the data affects the quality of the discussion on potential risks for example daily intelligence reports that provide information on curre nt terrorist threats would be considered more timely than monthly or quarterly reports availability if the validity of risk factor is to be widely accepted data used in formula as variable may need to be readily and publicly available intelligence information that has been classified by the federal governme nt and not shared with state and local officials would fail to satisfy this criterion additionally dhs requires states and urba n areas to identify first responder and emergency management capability enhancement and sustainment needs in the program and capabil ity enhancement plan the plan is part of their hsgp applications as noted earlier states and urban areas are required to submit investment justifications that detail how federal assistance would address identified homeland security needs and how the assi stance would address state and urban area counterterrorismrelated capabilities the investment justifications are then evaluated through peer review process administered by booz allen hamilton45 the peer review process the justificati ons and the identified effectiveness are not publically available additionally the ffectiveness factors are not identified by dhs instead states and urban areas are re quired to determine their individual needs and display how federal assistance would meet the needs dhs also has to rely on information from other agencies such as th federal bureau of investigation fbi and may not be able validate or confirm the information us ed in their state and urban area risk assessments issue how should the risk and effec tiveness factors be evaluated issue is dhs able to validate and confirm the reliability of asset types and geographic attributes it receives from other federal entities dhs has elected not to use 100 ri skbased formula for allocating the remainder of shsgp and l etpp total appropria tions and not to use 100 risk based allocation for uasi instead dhs has developed two part approach to

purely riskbased allocation of homeland security funding in this view point by coupling effectiveness with risk dhs may be providing funding to states nd urban areas that do not have high risk of
