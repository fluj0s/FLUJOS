tatro the court examined the regulations on medical services which stated that medical services referred only t services that must be performed by medical doctor and could n ot be performed by school health services finding the regulations reasonable interpretation of the statute th court held that clea n intermittent catherization cic service that is usually performed by nurse was not excluded the court stated by limiting the medical services exclusion t the services of physician or hospital both far more expensive the secretary has given permissible construction to the provision at 892893 the courts of appeals which ve decided cases since tatro have not always applied the bright line distinction between medical doctors and other service providers several have used other factors such as the nature and extent of the services and it was to resolve2 this issue that the supreme court granted certiorari in cedar rapids cedar rapids community school district v garret f majority opinion

ordered that the services be provided the district court upheld the aljs ruling and granted summar judgment the court of app eals affirmed and the school district appealed to the supreme court the supreme court in majority opinion written by justice stevens held tha t idea requires stat receiving funds under the statute to provide garret f ventilator dependent student with certain nursing services during school hours in arriving at its conclusion the majority found that ideas statutory definition f related services the tatro decision and the overall statutory scheme all support it s interpretation slip op at 6 the court noted that the school district had argued that the combined and continuous character of the required care eliminated the need to provid such care the school district proposed test where the outcome in particular cas would depend on series of factors such as whether the care was continuous r intermittent whether exist ing school health personnel can provide the service the cost of the service and the potential consequences if the service is not properly performed rejecting this test justice stevens observed that it was not supported by any

of legal authority and that there was indication concerning why these factor s made one service more medical than another the supreme court also dealt specifically with the concerns the school district raised regarding the financial cost of the provision of these services although justice stevens noted that the school district may have legitimate financial concerns the solutio n proposed was seen as judicial lawmaking without any guidance from congress and solution that would not comport with the purposes of idea slip op at 11 although idea was not seen as requiring schools to maximize the pote ntial of disabled students and the potential financial burdens may be relevant to interpreting idea the overarchin g purpose of idea was seen as to open the door of public education

access is attained slip op at 12 dissenting opinion justice thomas wrote dissenting opinion that was joined by justice kenned arguing that the court should not adhere to its previous d ecision in tatro and even if it did the dissent argued that the majoritys opinion expanded on tatro and ignore d constitutionally mandated rules of const ruction applicable to legislation enacted pursuant to congress spending power more specifically the dissent argued that the department of educations regulations were not entitled to deference si nce the statute was clear more importantly in the dissents view was the fact that the majority focused on the provider of the services rather than the servic themselves this was seen as contrary to correct statutory interpretation of idea from constitutional perspective the dissent observed that when congress places conditions upon the receipt of federal funds it must do s unambiguously and that the majority turns this spending clause p resumption on its
