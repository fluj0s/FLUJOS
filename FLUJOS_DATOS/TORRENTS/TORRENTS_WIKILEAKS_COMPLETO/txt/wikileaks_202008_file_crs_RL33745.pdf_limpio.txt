this report is what should be the role of seabased systems in us ballistic missile defense and are dods programs for seabased bmd capabilities appropriately structured and funded the aegis bmd system in its current configuration is intended to track ballistic missiles of all ranges including intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms and to intercept shorterranged ballistic missiles the current c onfiguration is not intended to intercept icbms future versions of the aegis bmd system are to include faster interceptor designed to intercept certain icbms the aegis bmd system has achieved 14 successful exoatmospheric intercepts in 18 attempts this total includes one successful intercept and one unsuccessful intercept by japanese aegis ships in tw japanese test flights the aegis bmd system has also achieved 2 successful endoa tmospheric intercepts in 2 attempts for combined total of 16 successful exo and endoatmospheric intercepts in 20 attempts the aegis bmd system was so temporarily

defense background and issues for congress introduction as part of its effort to develop global ballistic missile defense bmd system the department of defense dod has m odified three navy cruisers and 15 navy destroyers for bmd operations and has deployed large bmd radar the sea based xband radar sbx on modified floating oil platform in august 2008 it was reported that the navy has decide d to increase the number of bmdcapable destroyers from 15 to at least 621 the eventual role of seabased systems in the worldwide us bmd architecture has not been determined the overall issue for congress discussed in this report is what should be the role of seabased systems in us ballistic missile fense and are dods programs for seabased bmd capabilities ppropriately structured nd funded decisions that congress reaches on this issue could affect us bmd capabilities and funding requirements the size capabilities and operational patterns of the navy and the other services and the sh ipbuilding industrial base background rationale for seabased bmd systems dods overall bmd plan includes ground based seabased airborne and spacebased systems each of which have potential strengths and limitations dod believes that combination of these systems will provide more capable bmd architecture for discussion of the potential strengths and limitations of seabased bmd systems see appendix for discussion of ar ms control considerations relating to seabased bmd systems see appendix b aegis bmd program in general the aegis ballistic missile defense egis bmd program is dods primary seabased

capabilities of the navys aegis ship combat system whic h was originally veloped for defending ships against aircraft antiship cruise missiles ascms surface threats and subsurface threats2 the aegis system was first deployed by the navy in 1983 and has been updated severa l times since the part of the aegis combat system for countering aircraft and ascms is the called the aegis weapon system key components of the aegis weapon system re levant to this discussion include the following the spy1 radar powerful phasedarray multifunction radar that is designed to detect and track multiple targets in flight and to provide midcourse guidance to interceptor missiles suite of computers running th aegis fire control and battle management computer program and the standard missile sm the navys longerranged surfaceto air missile sam so called because it was first developed many years ago as common or standa rd replacement for variety of older navy sams3 the version of the standard missile curre ntly used for airdefense operations is called the sm2 block iv meaning the four th upgrade to the second major version of the standard missile the navy is developing new version of the standard missile for future airdefense operations called the sm6 extended range active missile sm6 eram us navy ships equipped with the ae gis system include ticonderoga cg47 class cruisers and arleigh burke ddg51 class destroyers total of 27 cg47s were procured for the navy between fy 1978 and fy1988 the ships entered service between 1983 and 1994 the first five wh ich were built to an earlier technical standard were judged by the navy to be too expensive to modernize and were removed from service in 20042005 the navy currently plans to modernize the remaining 22 ships and keep them in service to age 35 total of 62 ddg51s were procured for the navy between fy1985 and fy2005 the first entered service in 1991 and the 62nd is scheduled to enter servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs3 4 for more on

an effort that began in the early 1990s terrier is an older navy sam replaced in fleet use by the standard missile although succeeded by the standard missile in fleet use the navy continued to use the terrier missile for development and testing as mentioned in an earlier footnote see secti on on arms control considerations the abm treaty which was in force until 2002 prohibited seabased defenses against strategic ie continuedin 2011 the navy currently plans to modern ize these ships and keep them in service to age 35 or 404 between 2011 when the 62nd ddg51 is to enter service and 2021 when the first of the 22 remaining cg47s reaches ag 35 the navy plans to maintain force of 84 aegis ships 22 cruisers and 62 destroyers the navy has recently begun program for modernizing the 22 cg47s and 62 ddg51s that is intended to ensure that the ships can operate costeffectively throughout their entire 35year expected service lives5 sales of the aegis system to allied countries began in the late 1980s allied countries that now operate are building or are planning to build aegisequipped ships include japan the first foreign buyer with 6 destroyers in service south korea 3 destroyers under construction or pl anned australia 3 destroyers planned spain 4 frigates in service 1 under cons truction and possibly 1 more planned and norway 2 frigates in service and 3 more under construction or planned6 the norwegian frigates are somewhat smaller than the other aegis ships and consequently carry reducedsize version of the aegis system that includes smaller lesspowerful version of the spy1 radar aegis midcourse and seabased terminal programs t h g i s bmd program includes the aegis bmd midc ourse program and the aegis bmd sea based terminal program each of these is discussed below aegis bmd midcourse program program origin the aegis bmd midcourse program was created by the missile defense agency mda in 2002 ea rlier names for the program include the seabased midcourse program the navy theater wide defense program and the seabased upper tier program the program is the successor to earlier seabased bmd development efforts dating back to the early 1990s7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs4 7 continued longrange ballistic missiles navy bmd development activities that took place prior to 2002 were permissible under the abm treaty beca use they were not aimed at developing technologies for countering longrange ballistic missiles 8 jack dorsey navy on front line of missile defense norfolk virginianpilot october 21 2006intended capabilities the aegis bmd midcourse system in its current configuration is designed to detect and track ballistic missiles of any range including icbms and intercept short and mediumrange ballistic missiles srbms and mrbms above the atmosphere i exoatmospherically during their midcourse pha of flight when tracking icbms aegis bmd ships ar to act as sensor platforms providing firecontrolquality tracking data to the overall us bmd architecture the aegis bmd midcourse system in its current configuration is not designed to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms or intercept ballistic missiles inside the atmosphere during either their initial boost phase of flig ht or their final terminal phase of flight in contrast to the current configurati on of the aegis bmd midcourse system the groundbased midcourse bmd pr ogram with interceptors based in alaska and california is designed to intercept ic bms in the midcourse phase of flight discussions comparing the current conf iguration of the aegis bmd midcourse system and the groundbased midcourse prog ram have not always noted this basic difference in the kinds of ballistic missiles they are intended to intercept modification schedule nd initial deployments modifying an aegis ship for midcourse bmd operations i nvolves making two principal changes changing the aegis computer program to permit the spy1 radar to detect and track highflying ballistic missiles and arming the ship with bmd version of the standard missile called the sm3 block 1a ship with the first modification is referred to as having longrange search and track lrst capability ship with both modifications is referred to as an engagecapable ship according to 2006 press report modifying each ship takes about six weeks and costs about 105 million8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs5 9 longerrange ballistic missiles generally fly faster than shorterrange ballistic missiles consequently intercepting longerrange missile generally requires fasterflying interceptor than is required for intercepting shorterrange ballistic missile the sm3 block ia and 1b fly fast enough to inter cept tbms but not fast enough to provide an effective capability for intercepting icbms 10 the first engagecapable installations on tw cruisers were emergency ie preliminary installations nonemergency versions of the system were installed beginning in

it was reported that the navy has decided to expand the scope of the ddg51 modernization program to include the installation of bmd capability so that all ddg51s would eventu ally be bmdcapable and that the navy has not committed to s imilarly expanding the scope of the cg47 modernization program due to fina ncial constraints12 dod plans call for procuring total of 147 sm3 block ia and ib

block development strategy consistent with the approach used for other parts of dods bmd acquisition effort the aegis bmd midcour system is being developed and deployed in increasingly capable versions or blocks these blocks were previously named after their approximate anticipated years of deployment eg blocks 2004 2006 2008 2010 and 2012 under this structure the current version of the aegis system was known as the block 2004 version14 mda has recently restructured the block development structure to move away from dateassociated block na mes and the aegis bmd sy stem consequently is now being developed in two bl ocks called block 20 and block 50 mda states that block 20 includes among other things 71 sm3 block 1 and 1a interceptors of which 38 are to be in inventory by th end of calendar 2008 and that block 50 will increase the number of sm3 interceptors and improve the performance of the aegis bmd weapons system and the sm3 interceptor the sm3 block ib interceptor critical block 50 development effort will have major modifications to include much improved seeker and throttleable divert and attitude cont rol system tdacs when combined with processing upgrades to the aegis bmd weapons system the more capable block ib interceptor will more readily distinguish between threat reentry vehicles and countermeasures the block ib expands the battle space and enables more effective and reliable engagements of more diverse and longerrange ballistic missiles this year we look forward to completing design and testing for the twocolor seeker and tdacs and commencing the element integration of the sm3 block ib missile in 2009 block 50 includes delivery of 23 sm3 block ia interceptors and 53 sm3 block ib interceptors15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs7 16 aegis

the navy developed its own indigenous leap program which flight tested from 19921995 three nonintercept flight tests achieved all primary and secondary objectives of the five planned intercept tests only the second was considered successful intercept however failures were due to various hardware software and launch problems even so the navy determined that it achieved about 82 of its primary objectives 18 of 22 and all of its secondary objectives in these tests crs report rl33240 kinetic energy kill for ballistic missile defense status overview by steven hildrethtest little learn lot development approach the aegis bmd program is employing development approach that the program office characterizes as test little learn lot mda has stated that the test program for aegis bmd has focused on the philosophy of test little learn lot since its inception in the early 1990s with the terrier lightweight exoatmospheric projectile leap project terrier leap included four flight tests between 1992 and 1995 and was successful in demonstrating that leap technology could be integrated into seabased tactical missile for exoatmospheric ballistic missile defense the lessons learned from terrier leap evolved into the aegis leap intercept ali flight demonstration project fdp the goal of which was to utilize the aegis weapons system and standard missile 3 sm3 to hit ballistic missile in the exoatmosphere the ali test objectives were achieved with two successful descent phase interc epts of ballistic missile during flight mission 2 fm2 and fm3 in january 2002 and june 2002 respectively firing an sm3 from the aegis cruiser uss lake erie the transition of ali to an aegis bmd capability commenced with fm4 in november of 2002 with uss lake erie executing the first successful ascent phase intercept of short range ballistic missile srbm by the aegis bmd element16 flight tests from january 2002 through september 2008 the aegis bmd midcourse system has achie ved 14 successful exoatmosp heric intercepts in 18 attempts17 this total includes one successful intercept and one unsuccessful intercept by japanese aegis ships in two japanese test flights for details on all these flight tests see appendix c regarding upcoming tests mda stated in april 2008 that we plan three aegis bmd intercept tests in 2008 and 2009 in 2008 we will demonstrate an intercept of

engagement range of earlier versions of the sm3 and that the net result when coupled with enha nced discrimination capability is more types and ranges of engageable ballistic missile targets with greater probability of kill and large increase in defended footprint or geography predicted the sm3 blk iiiia missile with its full 21inch propulsion stack provides the necessary fly out acceleration

midcourse firecontro l radar designed to support longrange bmd systems its principal functions are to detect and establish precise tracking information on ballistic missiles discriminate missile warheads from decoys and debris provide data for upda ting groundbased interceptors in flight and assess the results of intercept attempts sbx is intended to support more opera tionally realistic testing of the groundbased midcourse system and enhance overall bmd system operational capability sbx is large powerful phasedarray radar operating in the x band part of the radio frequency spectrum that is suitable for tracking missile warheads with high accuracy the radar is mounted on modi fied selfpropelled semisubmersible oilhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs14 39 the platform is 238 feet

2006regarding other potential uses of the sbx march 2006 press report stated boeing missile defense officials refuse to answer questions about whether they are developing techniques to pr oduce highenergy weapon effects from the sbx seabased radar however since large distributedarray devices like the sbx can be focused to deliver larg spikes of energy powerful enough to disable electronic equipment the potential is known to exist and is being fielded on range of us british and australian aircraft45 potential issues for congress technical risk how much technical risk is there in the aegis bmd program one potential oversight issue for congress is how much technical risk there is in the aegis bmd program marc h 2008 government accountability office gao report assessing the technical risks of selected weapon programs stated of the aegis bmd program program officials report all block ia critical technologies are mature our data indicate that one of the technologie s is less mature the solid divert and attitude control system sdacs pulse one has been successfully flight tested since our last report however the zero pulse mode of the missiles third stage rocket motor has not been demonstrated in an operational environment officials also report the missiles design is stable with 100 percent of its drawings released to manufacturing and they do not anticip ate any design changes the block ia missile is in production but officials stat that the contractors processes are not mature enough to collect statistical data instead other means are being used to gauge production readiness technology maturity we reported last year that two of the three technologies critical to the sm3 block ia missile the solid divert and attitude control system sdacs and the third stage rocket motor tsrm were not mature since our last report one of the sdacss pulse modes pulse one which allows the kinetic warhead to divert in order to adjust its aim s flown three times in april june and november 2007 pulse one was used to shift the warheads aim just prior to intercept and all tests resulted in succe ssful intercepts the other pulse mode of the sdacs pulse two is identical in technology and functionality as pulse one but has not been flight tested program officials state that both pulse modes have been successfully tested in four consecu tive ground tests but that it is difficult for the sdacs to use both pulse modes in flight test because the first pulse has provided sufficient divert capability to make the intercept program officials state that an artificiality would have to be built in to the flight test in order to guarantee the use of pulse two additionally program officials consider pulse two to be margin to the system since it is designed to provide additional energy if neededhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs16 after employing pulse one to make the necessary maneuvers to intercept the target in the desired spot for maximu m destruction similarly the zero pulse mode of the tsrm that increases the missiles capability against shorterrange threats has not been flight tested lthough the production design of the trsm attitude control system passed qualification testing in february 2007 and has been integrated into the manufacturing lin the zero pulse mode is not scheduled for flight testing due to range safety limitations design stability program officials reported that the design for the sm3 block ia missiles being produced during block 2006 is stab with 100 percent of its drawings released to manufacturing program offi cials do not anticipate additional design changes production maturity we did not assess the production maturity of the sm3 missiles being procured for block 2006 program officials st ated that the contractors processes are not yet mature enough to statistically track production processes the aegis bmd program continues to use other means to assess progress in production and manufacturing such as tracking rework hour s cost of defects per unit and other defect and test data other program issues the original aegis bmd program go als for block 2006 included delivery of 19 sm3 block ia us missiles last year program officials reduced the goal to 15 since that time delivery goals have been reduced to 12 because the contractor did not have the production capacity to deliver both foreign military sales missiles and us missiles althoug h raytheon reported cost or schedule growth because much of the sm3 block ia contract work was being reported as level of effort it was difficult to assess true performance since it could not be practically measured by discrete earned value techniques according to american national standards institute guidelines adopted by dod only work that does not result in product should be reported as level of effort under earned value management however in august 2007 raytheon reported 73 percent of the contract work as level of effort some of which was identified as possibly unjustified and appearing excessive by team composed of technical and functional experts during 2007 review ce that time program officials report that they were able to implement ear ned value management reporting on future delivery contracts and stated in january 2008 that raytheon had reduced the contract level of effort work to 18 percent agency comments technical comments provided by the program office were incorporated as appropriate in addition program officials stated that they believe the tsrm is mature technology and add that is has been successfully flown in multiple missions in increasingly realistic operational environments program officials consider the zero pulse mode of the third stage rocket motor to be marginal to the system and explain that the capability is difficult to demonstrate in an operational environment due to range safety limitati ons additionally program officials state that all design verification tests for both the sdacs and the tsrm have

equipped for bmd operations the eventual us bmd architecture is to be defined by u s strategic command usstratcom the us military command responsible for s ynchronized dod effects to combat adversary weapons of mass destruction worldwide including integrated missile defense47 in consultation with mda under the evolutionary acquisition approach adopted for the overall us bmd program it likely will be number of years before usstratcom and mda define the eventual bmd architecture until then the absence of an objective architecture might complicate the task of assessing whether the types and numbers of seabased bm d systems being acquired are correct if the role of seabased systems in the eventual us bmd architecture turns out to be greater than what dod has assume d deciding to equip 18 aegis ships with bmd capabilities then additional funding mig ht be needed to expand the scope of the program to include more than 18 ships the issue could also affect the required total number of navy cruisers and destroyers if the role of seabased systems in the eventual us bmd architecture turns out to be greater than what the navy has assumed in calculating its 88ship cruiserdestroyer requirement then the requirement might need to be increased to something more than 88 ships november 5 2007 press report stated the admiral who runs the aegis ballistic missile defense program for the missile defense agency is asking to expand the upgrade effort even before the largescale aegis upgrade planned to start in 2012 the question right now is with 18 ships is that an adequate number im not sure it is said rear adm alan hicks who noted that navy plans call for basing all but two of the bmd ships in th pacific one of the concerns i have today is that if we had to surge for bot h north korean and iranian scenario you would end up taking ships that would be used for defense against north korea you have to augment the two atlantic fl eet ships to do anything in either the persian gulf or mediterranean if there was an iranian threathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs18 48 ben iannotta admiral wants bigger antimissile upgrade navytimescom november 5 2007 bracketed material as in the

adding more bmd ships to handle simultaneous missile threats from north korea and iran mullen agreed to series of discussions as the navy builds its portion of the 2009 white house budget request fifteen of the 18 ships in the current aegis bmd plan are destroyers and so the obvious option is to add more cr uisers right now we have three bmd cruisers hicks said will navy officials make decision to upgrade any more of the cruisers thats what theyll be discussing so far lockheed martin reports it has completed 16 aegis bmd ships with the final two scheduled to be ready by mid2008 hicks said the full contingent must be ready for fielding by early 2009 these ships are stopgap or premodernization measure until navy and pentagon officials decide how to incorporate ballistic missile defense into the massive aegis modernization program sc heduled to start in 2012 at that time all 62 destroyers and 22 cruisers in the aegis fleet will begin rotating into port for 40week computer modernization pr ograms how many of those modernized ships will be equipped to fire missile interc eptors is another topic for talks hicks said48 similarly in speech in latenove mber 2007 rear admiral alan hicks reportedly described the 18 ships as inadequate to meet missile defense needs and said the navy was trying to solve that problem when the aegis production line ends i think there will be 84 ships were looking at 2012 2013 he told itn inside the navy how many of those ships needed to be bmdcapable is decision for the chief of naval operations and the secretary of defense

chief of naval operations for integration of capabilities and resources said combatant commanders cocoms in areas like europe and the pacific would need far more aegis bmd ships to meet continuous coverage needs officials in those locations which watch iran and north korea among other countries increasingly eye the naval systems regional missile defense capabilities the combatant commanders the fleet commanders want more of it they want it all the time mccullough told national defense university foundation breakfast audience that will drive our force structure requirements even higher51 another july 31 2008 press report similarly stated the current navy program to convert 18 cruisers and destroyers to the aegis ballistic missile defense bmd capability which will be completed by the end of this year will have to be expanded to cover roughly 90 ships senior navy officer said yesterday eighteen ships is not enough to provide robust missile defense capability said vice adm barry mccullough deputy chief of naval operations speaking before national defense university breakfast forum at the capitol hill club the real number is somewhere around 90 he said because there are increasing requests for bmd coverage coming from combatant commanders in the european theater the central command theater and the pacific theater therefore it takes lot more ship s than the 18 we have set for upgrade by the end of the calendar year he saidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs20 52 dave ahearn more destroyers cruisers must be converted to advanced aegis bmd admiral says defense daily july 31 2008later responding to question from the audience mccullough said i think we need on the order of 89 or more ships52 as mentioned earlier in august 2008 it wa s reported that the navy has decided to expand the scope of the ddg51 moderniza tion program to include the installation of bmd capability so that all ddg51s would eventually be bmdcapable and that the navy has not committed to similarly expanding the scope of the cg47 modernization program due to financial constraints potential oversight questions for congress include the following how many aegis ships should be equipped for bmd operations in the absence of defined us bmd architecture what was the basis for mdas decision that 18 aegis ships 3 cg47s and 15 ddg51s should be equi pped for bmd operations and what was the basis for the navys reported decision th at at least 65 aegis ships 3 cg47s plus at least 62 ddg51s should be equipped fo r bmd operations what kinds of bmd operations were factored into the navy requirement for maintaining force of at least 88 cruisers and destroyers if bmd operations by navy ships turn out to be more significant than what the navy might have assumed in calculating the 88ship figure will the figure need to be increased and if so by how much role of aegis bmd in european missile defense what should be the role of aegi s bmd in european missile defense another potential oversight issue for cong ress concerns the potential role of the aegis bmd system as partial or complete alternative or supplement to the ground based midcourse defense g md system that the bush administration has proposed to establish in poland and the czech republic russian president vladimir putin opposes groundbased gmd system in eur ope and has suggested that the united states explore certain alternative appr oaches including the use of bmdcapable aegis ships june 21 2007 press report stated the us has been less receptive to the idea of placing missile interceptors in turkey iraq or on aegis ships as mr putin suggested the missile defence agency says turkey and iraq are too close too iran for interceptors to be able to catch an incoming missile from iran but the idea of using aegis ships has more debate duncan hunter the top republican on the house armed services committee recently said mr putins proposal about seabased missile defences was promising although only as an additional capability to groundbased missile interceptors in poland the navys aegis shipbased defensive systems could be based in existing black sea ports either in ukraine russia or turkey said mr

his critics say the iranian threat is far enough in the future to provide the us time gen obering also argues that the us w ould need to deploy tens of ships for the system to be feasible but several people familiar with study prepared by raytheon which is manufacturing missile interceptors for the aegis ships said it concluded that as few as five ships could provide defence against an iranian threat raytheon declined to comment53 november 29 2007 press report stated it would take large number of us navy aegis weapons system ships to shield europe against enemy missiles from the middle east if the united states attempted to use the seabased system to guard europe instead of the groundbased midcourse missile defense gmd system pr oposed for the czech republic and poland that was the assessment yesterday of rear adm alan hicks program director of the aegis ballistic missile defense bmd system at symposium of the george c marshall institute washington think tank held at the national press club certainly by the nearterm capability between now and 2015 thats lot of ships and i wouldnt recommend it he said further those ships wouldnt be stati oned in an ideal location so that the interceptors they would fire to ta ke down enemy weapons would run out of juice in pursuing those threats he added though that the aegis seaba sed system could be deployed as complement to the european gmd system when the ships arent needed for other missions the european gmd system has yet to win final approval from the czechs and poles one key point is that it is not stretch for the gmd system with radar in the czech republic and 10 interceptors in silos in poland to provide 247 protection of europe but it would be difficult to have sufficient number of ships on station on point all the time he said54 july 16 2008 press report stated us navy ships in the mediterranean will provide ballistic missile defense to the czech republic under commitment contained in the agreement to

europeanbased missile defenses and i hear the policy debates on it ive been asked to look at what it would take to fulfill sealaunched interceptor requirements in the baltic area or in the black sea area vice adm bernard sic mccullough said at wednesday breakfast forum on capitol hill the flag officer who serves as deputy chief of naval operations for integration of capabilities and resources was responding to an audience question about what navy ships might do to help defend the czech and polishbased assets mcculloughs response reflects th findings of 2007 navy study service spokesman told global security newswire the review laid out combatant commanders future require ments for seabased ballistic missile defense capabilities an expanded naval presence in waters neighboring eastern europe might be necessary on the basis that the groundbased missile defense assets themselves could become among the first targets in phased enemy attack if an adversary were to damage or destroy the czechbased radar interceptors stationed in neighboring poland might be rendered useless that in turn could provide an opening for subs equent enemy missile strikes against european or perhaps even us targets according to defense experts i think we need on the order of 89 or more bmdcapable ships mccullough said this week expanding aegis ship presence to the baltic or the black seas would drive our force structure requirements even hi gher for this particular capability mccullough saidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs23 56 elaine m grossman us navy eyes rising need to defend czechs poles global security newswire august 1 2008the notion of having to deploy interceptorcarrying ships to defend new landbased missile defense sites strikes some observers as potentially complicated and perhaps somewhat peculiar endeavor its big rube goldberg type of th ing said physicist theodore postol of the massachusetts institute of technology referring to the classic cartoons of absurdly complex machines you have to defend the missile defense sites because if you have capable adversary they will attack your radars if they can thats one of the reasons the safeguard system was dismantled in the 1970s said david wright who codirect s the global security program at the union of concerned scientists in cambri dge mass based in north dakota the early us missile defense system was deactivated in 1976 after operating for less than four months the standard missile interceptors based on aegis ships fly at substantially slower speeds than their groundbased in terceptor counterparts and thus would have questionable capability against russian icbms if based in the baltic or black seas explained post ol professor of science technology and national security policy russia wants to stop the european groundbased interceptors at almost any cost even if it means accepting shipb ased defense system that at some point in the future might be significantly improved he said however the bush administration has rejected the russian proposal and has pushed ahead with its landbasing scheme how putins successor as president dmitry medvedev might now regard the idea of us surface combatants in the baltic and black seas bolstering rather than replacing groundbased missile interceptors in europe has yet to be seen56 an august 13 2008 mda briefing presente d what it stated were highlights of

potential global requirements we need more than that he said nov 28 inventory is inadequate to meet our needs but the admiral acknowledged that aegis sm inventory also must be weighed against theater high altitude area defense and patriot advanced capability missile inventories63 another press report based on the same speech by hicks stated that hicks observed that the military will have 153 short

the fydp and double that you come close to the number of aegis and thaad interceptors he would like obering said specifically he said he would like to roughly double the current production rate how much that equates to across the fydp depends on how much money the defense department allocates to them he said but if they allocate the money that we would recommend to do this it would roughly double the number of missiles across the fydp such an increase would not double the amount of needed money he said because economies of scale and running of production lines would control costs pentagon acquisition executive john young submitted written testimony to the house armed services strategic forces subcommittee yesterday talking about this desire to field additional ballistic

agency mda notes that it plans to replace the unitary warhead on the sm3 block iia missile which the united states is codeveloping with japan with the mkv the committee is concerned that mda has taken this decision without fully consulting with the japanese government and that this decision has the potential to delay the fielding the sm3 block iia missile system that the committee believes is vital

unitary warhead on the sm3 bl ock iia missile with the multiple kill vehicle until after the secretary of defense certifies to congress that 1 the united states and japan have reached an agreement to replace the unitary warhead on the sm3 block iia missile and 2 replacing the unitary warhead on the sm3 block iia missile with the multiple k ill vehicle will not delay the expected deployment date of 2014 2015 for that missile regarding section 224 the conference report states the conferees note that the missile defense agency mda has indicated an interest in replacing the unitary kill vehicle development program which is specified in the agreement with japan with new mkv development program this would have undermined the agreed program of cooperation between the united states and japan on joint development of the sm3 block iia interceptor missile it is important to support the joint development program in accordance with the agreed program of record wh ich currently specifies unitary kill vehicle this provision does not restrict the mda from conducting research development analysis or testing of mkv technologies including those which could be used in the future with the sm3 block

within the administration once the fiscal year 2009 budgets all solidified and get position and then we will go to congress and talk and see what they feel how they feel he said in an interview with inside the navy after his presentation the unitary version of the sm3 missile was priority one but to get an extra kill vehicle or two on top of the sm3 and provide options against more advanced

another potential oversight question fo r congress is whether development of the farterm seabased terminal bmd cap ability should be accelerated supporters of dods seabased termin program could argue that the block 20 seabased terminal capability will provide navy ship s with sufficient degree of terminal defense capability until the anticipated deployment of the farterm capability they could also argue that accelerating deve lopment of the farterm capability could increase development risks or require re ducing funding for other bmd programs or other dod priorities increasing ope rational risks in other areas supporters of accelerating development of the farterm capability could argue that an improved terminaldefense capability could prove useful if not critical in the near term as well as the far term for intercepting missiles such as srbms or ballistic missiles fired along depressed trajectories that do not fly high enough to exit the atmosphere and conse quently cannot be intercepted by the sm3 they could also argue accelerating development of the farterm capability could improve the navys ability to counter chinese tb ms equipped with maneuverable reentry vehicles marvs capable of hitting moving ships at sea72 kinetic energy in terceptor kei if the kinetic energy interceptor kei is developed for landbased bmd operations should it also be based at sea if so what kind of seabased platform should be used another potential issue for congress cerns the kinetic energy interceptor kei new bmd interceptor now in velopment that could be used as ground or seabased bmd interceptor under current dod plans the landbased version of the kei could become available use by the middle of the next decade73 compared to the sm3 the kei would be much larger reportedly 40 inches

conduct midcourse in tercepts in the midcourse intercept role th kei due to its higher burnout velocity would appear capable of providing larger defended footprint and greater capability to intercept icbms than the sm3 block iia june 20 2008 mda briefing on bmd programs indicates that mda anticipates using the kei as seabased midcourse interceptor with an initia l seabased midcourse flight test in 2014 and the missile becoming operationally as seabased mid course interceptor available in 201574 the issue is whether the kei if devel oped should be based at sea and if so what kind of seabased platform should be used basing the kei on ship would require the ship to have missilelaunch tubes that are bigger than those currently installed on navy cruisers stroyers and attack submar ines potential seabased platforms for the kei include but are not necessarily limited to the following ballistic missile submarines which have launch tubes large enough to accommodate the kei surface combatants equipped with newly developed missilelaunch tubes large enough for the kei and noncombat dod ship perhaps based on commercial hull or floating platform supporters of deploying the kei at sea could argue that it could enable navy ships to attempt to intercep t certain missiles during the boos t phase of flight and that in the midcourse intercept role it would pr ovide greater defended footprint and greater capability for intercepting icbms than the sm3 block iia skeptics could argue that in light of other planned bmd capabilities the need for basing the kei at sea for either boostphase or midc ourse intercepts is not clear among supporters of basing the kei at sea supporters of basing it on ballistic missile submarines could argue that submar ines can operate close to enemy coasts in positions suitable for attempting to in tercept missiles durin g their boost phase of flight while remaining undetected and less vulnerable to attack than surface platforms skeptics of basing the kei on ballistic missile submarines could argue that communication links to submarines are not sufficiently fast to support boost phase intercept operations and that launching the kei could give away the submarines location making it pot entially vulnerable to attackhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs33 75 srept 110155 p 268supporters of basing the kei on surf ace combatants equipped with

are excessive to what would be needed for kei platform operating in the middle of the ocean far from potential threats for the purpose of using the kei for midcourse intercepts supporters of noncombat

report srept 110 155 of september 14 2007 on the fy2008 defense appropriations bill hr 3222 stated according to the budget justification materials kei has three objectives 1 to develop midcourse interceptor capable of replacing the current fixed groundbased interceptor gbi when the deployed gbis become obsolete 2 to develop this interceptor so that it could be strategically deployed as an additional midcourse capability with mobile land or seabased launchers and 3 to assume the boost and ascentpha intercept mission within the ballistic missile defense system bmds if the airborne laser abl fails to meet its performance objectives the committee believes that these objectives are premature that existing systems can achie ve the same goals and that the missile is not suitable for navy platforms the committee is concerned that mda is developing kei as replacement for the gbis prematurely since the gbis are still under development the fielded gbis undergo continuous upgrades and retrofits and the gbis still have to undergo significant testing furthe rmore additional midcourse capability can be achieved with upgrading current mobile systems such as theater high altitude area

overview by steven hildrethmanner if not then one option would be to accelerate procurement of some of the later ships in the cgx program78 development and testing of aegis bmd system are there lessons from development and tes ting of the aegis bmd system that can be applied to programs for d eveloping and testing bmd systems the aegis bmd program has achieved fairly high rate of successful intercepts at least some part of this succe ss rate may be due to two factors the configuration of the aegis bmd system that has been tested to date is intended to shoot down shorterrange ballistic missiles in general shorterrange missiles fly at lower speeds than longerranged missiles and interceptors inte nded to shoot down shorterranged ballistic missiles dont need to be as fast as interceptors intended to shoot down longerranged ballistic missiles consequently the closing speeds79 involved in intercepts of shorterranged ballistic missiles are generally lower than t hose for intercepts of longerranged ballistic missiles intercepts i nvolving lower closing speeds can be less difficult to attempt than inte rcepts involving higher closing speeds in bmd tests over more th an 20 years tests of shorterrange kineticenergy bmd systems has gene rally been more successful than tests of longerrange bmd systems80 the aegis bmd system is being developed as an extension of the existing aegis air defense system and can thus benefit from the proven radar software and inter ceptor technology of that system whereas the groundbased midcourse system is being developed essentially as relativ ely new weapon system the potential question is whether these two factors account completely for the high success rates for testing of the aegis bmd program if they do not then one potential issue for congress is whether there is something about the approach adopted for developing and testing the aegis bmd capability that accounts for part of the difference as mentioned earlier the aegis bmd program says it has focused since its inception on the philosophy of test little learn lot it can also be noted that the navy has long history of airdefense missile developmen t programs and has established record of technical discipline rigorousness and excellence in areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs36 such as nuclear propulsion and submarine launched ballistic miss iles potential questions for congress include the following how does the aegis bmd programs compare to other bmd development programs in terms of their approaches for system development and testing are there features of the aegis bmd programs approach that if applied to other us bmd programs could improve the development and test effort s for these other programs cooperation with allies should current us efforts for helping to establish bmd capabilitie s in allied navies be reduced accelerated or maintained at current levels an additional potential issue for congress is whether us efforts for helping to establish bmd capabilities in allied na vies should be reduced accelerated or maintained at current levels potential oversight questions for congress include the following what are the potential military and political advantages and disadvantages of establishing bmd capabilities in allied navies to what degree if any would these capabilities be integrated into the overall us bmd architecture how in terms of technology command and control doctrine and training would such an integration be accomplished if these capabilities are not integrated into the us architecture what kind of coordination mechanisms might be needed to maximize the collective utility of us and allied seabased bmd capabilities or to ensure that they do not work at crosspurposes how might the establishment of bmd capabilities in allied navies affect us requirements for s eabased bmd systems to what degree if any could allied bmd ships perform bmd operations now envisaged for us aegis ships what are the potential implications for regional security of missile proliferation and prolif eration of bmd systems legislative activity for fy2009 fy2009 defense authorizati on bill s 3001pl 110417 house the

the joint capabilities mix study ii which indicated that the combatant commanders require at minimum twice as many sm3 interceptors than the 133 now planned the committee strongly supports efforts to increase production of sm3 in terceptors to counter the threat from short and mediumrange ballistic missiles in accordance with section 223 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 public law 110181 the committee recommends the transfer of 560 million of the funds fro m pe 63892c for advanced procurement of sm3 interceptors to be executed by the missile defense agency furthermore the committee recommends an additional increase of 550 million for sm3 production of this amount 200 million is for fac ility upgrades that will increase the capacity to manufacture 4 or more sm3 missiles per month in fiscal year 2010 and 350 m illion is for longlead procurement of an additional 12 sm3 missiles therefore the committee recommends total increase of 1110 million for

ballistic missiles the committee notes its continuing concern that the missile defense agency is not providing sufficient funds for aegis bmd given the threat posed by short and mediumrange ballistic missiles the committee is concerned that the 133 standard missile3 sm3 interc eptors that are currently planned will be insufficient the committees views ar consistent with the results of the recently completed joint capabilities mix study ii which concluded that combatant commanders require nearly twice as many sm3 interceptors than the 133 now planned elsewhere in this act the committee has increased funding for sm3 productionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs38 the committee also notes its strong support for the united statesjapan cooperative development program which is codeveloping the sm3 block iia missile designed to counter longerrange ballistic missile threats the committee expects the missile defense agency to continue to support the development of the current unitary kill vehi cle for that interceptor the committee recommends an increase of 200 million in pe 63892c for the purchase of additional ballistic missile signal processors furthermore in accordance with section 223 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 public law 110181 the committee recommends the transfer of 560 million for procurement of sm3 interceptors to title 1 procurement the committee therefore recommends total of about 11 billion note 11218 million decrease of 360 million in pe 63892c for aegis bmd pages 255256 senate the senate armed services co mmittee in its report srept 110335 of may 12 2008 on the fy2009 defense au thorization bill s 3001 recommended total of 77 million in the defensewide procurement account for procurement of longleadtime items for sm3 interceptors this total includes the transfer into the defensewide procuremen t account of 57 million that was requested in the defensewide research nd development account and an additional 20 million that was not requested in the proposed fy2009 budget pag 110 line 001a in discussing this recomme ndation the report states the budget request included pr ocurement funds for long lead procurement of standard missile3 sm 3 interceptors for the aegis ballistic missile defense bmd system contrary to the law the budget request included 570 million in research and development rd funds in pe 63892c for long lead procurement of sm3 block ia missiles the committee recommends transferring the requested 570 million in rd funds to new defensewide procurement funding line for procurement of long lead items for sm3 interceptors consistent with the law the committee also recommends an increase of 200 million in the new procurement defensewide line for long lead procurement of an additional 15 sm3 interceptor missiles section 223b of the national defens authorization act for fiscal year 2008 public law 110181 required the depa rtment of defense to request any long lead procurement funding for sm 3 interceptors and thaad fire units 3 and 4 in the fiscal year 2009 budget request using procurement funds rather than rd funds in addition section 223c of that act prohibits the use of fiscal year 2009 rd funds for procurement of long lead items for sm3 interceptors and thaad fire units 3 and 4 the committee is deeply disappointed that the department of defense chose not to comply with the requirements of section 223 of the national defense authorization act for fisc year 2008 public law 110181 and directs the director of the missile fense agency and the under secretary of defense comptroller to jointly provid report to the congressional defense committees by later than october 1 2008 providing detailed explanation of the reasons the department chose not to comply with the law and an explanation of the departments plans to comply with the law httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs39 the committee notes that the joint capabilities mix jcm study conducted by the joint staff concluded that us combatant commanders need about twice as many sm3 and thaad interceptors as currently planned to meet just their minimum operational requirements for defending against the many hundreds of existing short and mediumrange ballistic missiles the committee is deeply disappointed that the missile defense agency mda has not planned or budgeted to acquire more than fraction of the sm3 interceptors needed to meet the warfighters minimum operational needs and that it does not plan to fund additional procurement beyond fiscal year 2010 the committee believes that achieving at least the jcm levels of upper tier interceptors in timely manner should be the highest priority for mda and expects the agency to modify its plans and budgets to meet our combatant commanders current operational needs in section 223 of the john warner national defense authorization act for fiscal ear 2007 public law 109364 congress specified the aegis bmd system and its sm3 interceptor as high priority nearterm program for the department to focus on as the jcm study makes clear the department has failed to do so to address these concerns the committee recommends an increase of 200 million in the new defensewide procurement funding line for long lead procurement of an additional 15 sm3 missiles to start to address the need to meet the requirements identified in the jcm analysis as described elsewhere in this report the committee also recommends increases of 800 million for increasing the production rate of the sm3 missile reducing schedule risk for the sm3 block ib missile and for improving the capability of the aegis bmd system to conduct engagements using offboard sensors known as engage on remote and to engage missiles in the ascent phase of midcourse flight pages 119120 within the defensewide research and development account the report recommends and additional 80 million for the aegis bmd program for aegis bmdsm3 enhancement the report at th is point also notes the abovedescribed transfer of 57 million in funding for procur ement for sm3s from this account to the defensewide procurement account the net result of these two actions is recommended 23million increase to the request for fy2009 research and development funding for the aegis bmd prog ram page 233 line 81 in discussing this recommendation the report states the budget request included 12 billion in pe 63892c for the aegis ballistic missile defense bmd program including 570 million for long lead procurement of standard missile3 sm3 block ia interceptor missiles the committee notes that the aegis bmd system with its sm3 interceptor is the only midcourse defense system currently being deployed to provide defense against short and mediumrange ballistic missile threats to our forwarddeployed forces allies and other friendly nations the aegis bmd system has had an impressive record of successful tests against short and mediumrange targets including multimission test against ballistic missile and an airbreathing threat and multiple target intercept against two ballistic missile targets the sm3 missile is being develope d to have increasing capability with each successive version from block ia to block ib to the block iia version being developed jointly with japan the aegis bmd system and its sm3 interceptor have the potential to provide significant measure of defensive capability in various regions of the wo rld and to increase its capability tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs40 conduct intercepts based on radar tracks from offboard sensors known as engage on remote and to engage missiles early in their midcourse flight including in the ascent phase the committee notes that the joint capabilities mix jcm study conducted by the joint staff concluded that us combatant commanders need about twice as many sm3 and thaad interceptors as currently planned to meet just their minimum operational requirements for defending against the many hundreds of existing short and mediumrange ballistic missiles the committee is deeply disappointed that the missile defense agency mda has not planned or budgeted to acquire more than fraction of the sm3 interceptors needed to meet the warfighters minimum operational needs the committee believes that achieving at least the jcm levels of upper tier interceptors in timely manner should be the highest priority for mda and expects the agency to modify its plans and budgets to meet our combatant commanders current operational needs in section 223 of the john warner nationa l defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007 public law 109364 congress sp ecified the aegis bmd system and its sm3 interceptor as high priority nearterm program for the department of defense to focus on as the jcm study makes clear the department has failed to do so section 223b of the national defens authorization act for fiscal year 2008 public law 110181 requires that any long lead or advance procurement for sm3 block ia missiles in the fiscal year 2009 budget be requested in procurement funds rather than in research and development rd f unds section 223c of that act prohibits th use of fiscal ye ar 2009 rd funds for procurement of long lead items for sm3 block ia missiles the department chose not to comply with the law nd requested rd funds for procuring long lead items for the sm3 missiles this is not acceptable the committee notes that the department is obliged to co mply with the law and expects the department to do so to be consistent with the law and to correct the departments failure to comply with the law the committee recomme nds that all long lead funds for sm 3 missiles be authorized and appropriated in new defensewide procurement line described elsewhere in this repor t accordingly the committee recommends transfer of 570 million from pe 63892c to the new procurement line for long lead procurement of sm3 block ia missiles the committee also recommends an increase of 200 million in that new procurement line for the procurement of long lead items for an additional 15 sm3 interceptors to begin the process of increasing the inventory of sm3 missile s toward the jcm levels the committee notes that mda does not plan any procurement of sm3 block ib missiles after fiscal year 2010 which is inconsiste nt with the jcm study conclusions concerning the need for about twice as many sm3 and t haad missiles as are currently planned the committee expects mda to modify its plans and budgets for the fiscal year 2010 budget submi ssion to address the inventory levels indicated by the jcm study to address these numerous concerns the committee recommends an increase of 800 million in pe 63892c for the following projects 200 million for facilitizing an increase in sm3 production capacity to four missiles per month 200 million to reduce schedule risk for the block ib missile and 400 million for accelerated development of enhanced aegis bmd capability for engage on remote and ascentphase engagement pages 259260httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs41 regarding the mkv the report states the committee also notes that the missile defense agency mda plans to fund two contractor teams with co mpeting technology approaches but does not plan to have competitive selection of the best technology in the future although mda is pursuing development of mkv technologies for longrange midcourse defense interceptors and for the standard missile3 block ii interceptor keeping two contractor ams for the indefinite future is both expensive and possibly unnecessary the committee urges mda to consider competitive selection process to determine which of the two contractor teams has the best technology and to select that am as the only team to fund in the future the committee is also concerned that the consolidation of all kinetic kill vehicle technology development in one ffice may have the unintended effect of removing continued focus on developing or improving existing and planned unitary kinetic kill vehicles such as the unitary kill vehicle planned for the standard missile3 block iia missile being developed jointly by the united states and japan page 262 regarding the february 2008 shootdown of the malfuncti oning satellite the report states the committee notes that the aegis ballistic missile defense bmd system was used in february for onetime mission to intercept and destroy decaying us satellite before it reentered the earths atmosphere this mission which cost more than 900 million used considerable aegis bmd assets and funding the committee is concerned that the aegis bmd program will not be fully reimbursed for its expenses in prep aring for testing for and conducting the mission as well as for restoring the systems components to their normal missile defense configuration and replacing the standard missile3 interceptor used for the mission if the aegis bmd program is not reimbursed for these expenses it would not be able to perform some 900 million worth of planned and budgeted activities that have been approved by congress this would not be acceptable the committee directs the missile defense agency mda and the department of defense to ensure that the aegis bmd program is fully reimbursed for all expenses related to the onetime satellite intercept mission so that all previously planned funded and approved aegis bmd work will proceed without delay the committee directs mda to report to the congressional defense committees by later than october 1 2008 on the status of the full reimbursement of the aegis bmd program page 267 compromise in lieu of conference report there was compromise version of s 3001 that was accompanied by joint explanatory statement section 4 of s 3001 states that the

reco mmended increasing mdas research and development funding request for the aegis bmd program by 70 million including 50 million for aegis bmdsm3 enhancements and 20 million for ba llistic missile defense signal processors the joint explanatory statement also recommended transferring 50 million for sm3 long lead ie sm3 long leadtime items from the aegis bmd line line 81 in the defensewide research and development account to the mda line line 95 in the procurement defensewide account the joint explanatory statement stated we note that the joint integrated ai r and missile defense organization component of the joint staff has conducted number of studies over several years concerning the operational requirements of combatant commanders for upper tier ballistic missile defense these joint capabilities mix jcm studies have consistently concluded that us combatant commanders need about twice as many standard missile3 sm3 and terminal high altitude area defense thaad interceptors as the number planned by the missile defense agency mda just to meet their minimum in ventory requirements to defend against existing levels of short and medium range ballistic missiles we are deeply disappointed that the partment of defense has not planned or budgeted for even this minimum requirement and believe that achieving at least this minimum inventory should be th highest priority for mda we expect the department of defense to budget accordingly starting with the budget submission for fiscal year 2010 we are concerned that there is ade quate requirements process in place for mda to determine the force structure and inventory levels to meet the needs of the combatant commanders this is fundamental shortcoming of the department of defenses approach to ssile defense and one that needs to be resolved we expect the department of defense to establish an adequate requirements process for missile defense force structure and inventory that ensures that the operational requirement s of the regional combatant commanders are fully taken into account in mdas budget and pl anning process fy2009 defense appropriations act hr 2638pl 110329 house the house

million for ballistic signal processo ropen architecture and 40 million for aegis bmd enhancements the act also approves the funding requests for certain seabased missile defense programs but transfers the locations of these items in the budget as follows 571 million for procurement of sm3 block ia missiles is transferred from the aegis bmd line line 81 in the defensewide research and development account to the mda line line 95 in the procurement defensewide account 392 million for targets to be used in aegis bmd tests is transferred from the aegis bmd line line 81 in the

76 in the defensewide research and development account to the sbx line line 91 in the defensewide research and development account the explanatory statement states in order to execute balanced program the missile defense agency mda must continue to field the near term missile defense programs primarily groundbased missile defense gmd aegis ballistic missile defense bmd and theater high area altit ude defense thaad pr ograms funding for fielding these programs however is sacrificed each year to pay for the development of futuristic missile defe nse programs therefore the bill reduceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs44 funding for several of the farterm prog rams such as the multiple kill vehicle the airborne laser and space test bed and provides an additional 120000000 for enhancements to the gmd aegis and thaad programs the mda is directed to provide report to the congressional defense committees by december 1 2008 on how those additional funds will be allocated to the programs the joint capability mix jcm study conducted by the joint staff concluded that us combatant commanders need about twice as many standard missile3 and thaad interceptors as currently planned to meet minimum operational requirements for defending against short and mediumrange ballistic missiles the nidas highest priority should be to achieve the minimum levels of interceptor inventories identified in the jcm study and the department of defense should budget accordingly in its fiscal year 2010 budget submission the explanatory statement also states the missile defense agency mda has renewed its focus and commitment to the target program and must continue this momentum in order to achieve optimal production and deliveries in order to ensure that the program office has the proper oversight of all funding for the targets program the bill transfers the entire request for targets from the individual program elements to the test and target program element the explanatory statement also states management of the kill vehicle for the standard missile3 block ii is being done by the kill vehicle program office instead of the aegis program the aegis program has had long history of success working with the navy to manage the entire development and fielding of the standard missile and any change in management could result in delay to the program therefore the aegis program is directed to manage all current and future standard missile development and upgrades for ballistic missile defense including the kill vehicleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs45 83 the ships potential ability to do this is broadly analogous to how hand casts shadow in candlelit room the closer that the hand ie the navy ship is moved to the candle continuedappendix strengths and limitations of seabased bmd systems potential strengths potential strengths of seabased bmd sy stems compared to other bmd systems include the following advantageous locations at sea seabased systems can conduct bmd operations from locations at sea that are potentially advantageous for bmd operations but inaccessible to groundbased bmd systems base access and freedom of action seabased systems can be operated in forward ie overseas locations in international waters without need for negotiating ba access from other governments and without restrictions from foreign governments on how they might be used visibility seabased systems can operate over the horizon from observers ashore making them potentially less visible and less provocative mobility navy ships with bmd systems can readily move themselves to respond to changing demands for bmd capabilities or to evade detection and targeting by enemy forces and can do so without placing demands on us airlift assets regarding the first of these potential strengths there are at least four ways that location at sea can be advant ageous for us bmd operations the location might lie along ballistic missiles potential flight path which can facilitate tracking and intercepting the attacking missile the location might permit seabased radar to view ballistic missile from different angle than other us bmd sensors which might permit the us bmd system to track the attacking missile more effectively if potential adversarys ballistic missile launchers are relatively close to its coast then us navy ship equipped with bmd interceptors that is operating relatively close to that coast could attempt to defend large downrange territory against potential attack by ballistic missiles fired from those launchers83 one to fourhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs46 83 continued the ballistic missile launcher the larger becomes the hands shadow on the far wall the downrange area that the ship can help defend against ballistic missile attack in bmd parlance the area in shadow is re ferred to as the defended footprint 84 tbms include in ascending order of range shortrange ballistic missiles srbms which generally fly up to about 600 kilometers about 324 nautical miles mediumrange ballistic missiles mrbms which generally fly up to about 1300 kilometers about 702 nm and intermediaterange ballistic missiles irbms which generally fly up to about 5500 kilometers about 2970 nm intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms are longerranged missiles that can fly 10000 kilometers about 5400 nm or more although icbms can be used to attack targets within their own milita ry theater they are not referred to as tbmsnavy ships operating in the sea of japan for example could attempt to defend most or all of japan ag ainst theaterrange ballistic missiles tbms84 fired from north korea if navy ship were equipped with very fast interceptors ie interceptors faster than those the navy is currently deploying and if that ship were deployed to an overseas location relatively close to enemy ballistic missile launchers the ship might be able to attempt to intercept ballistic missiles fired from those launchers during the missiles boost phase of flight the initial phase during which the ballistic missiles rocket engines are burning ballistic missile in the boost phase of flight is relativ ely large hotburning target that might be easier to intercept in part because the missile is flying relatively slowly and is readily seen by radar and the debris from missile intercepted during its boos t phase might be more likely to not fall on or near the intended target of the attacking missile potential limitations potential limitations of seabased bmd systems compared to other bmd systems include the following conflicts with other ship missions using multimission navy cruisers and destroyers for bm d operations might reduce their ability to perform other missions such as airdefense operations against aircraft and antiship cruise missiles ascms landattack operations and antisubmarine warfa re operations for four reasons conducting bmd operations might require ship to operate in location that is unsuitable for performing one or more other missions conducting bmd operations may reduce ships ability to conduct airdefense operations against aircraft and cruise missiles due to limits on ship radar abilities bmd interceptors occupy ship weaponlaunch tubes that might otherwise be used for ai rdefense landattack or anti submarine weaponshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs47 85 for more on the mathematics of navy ship forward deployments see crs report rs21338 navy ship deployments new approaches background and issues for congress by ronald orourke launching bmd interceptor from submarine might give away the submarines loca tion which might make it more difficult for the submarine to perform missions that require stealthy operations and potentially make the submarine more vulnerable to attack costs relative to groundbased systems seabased system might be more expensive to proc ure than an equivalent ground based system due to the potential need to engineer the seabased system to resist the corrosive marine environment resist electromagnetic interference from other powerful shipboard systems and meet shipboard safety re quirements or fit into li mited space aboard ship bmd system on ship or floating platform that is dedicated to bmd operations might be more expensive to operate and support than an equivalent groundbased system due to the maintenance costs associated with operating the ship or platform in the marine environment and the need for crew of some size to operate the ship or platform ship quantities for forward deployments maintaining standing presence of navy bmd ship in location where other navy missions do not require such deployment and where there is nearby us home port can require total commitment of several navy ships due to the mathematics of maintaining navy ship forward deployments85 vulnerability to attack seabased bmd system operating in forward location might be more vulnerable to enemy attack than groundbased system par ticularly groundbased system located in lessforward location defending seabased system against potential attack could require the presence of additional navy ships or other forces rough waters very rough waters

midcourse flight tests conducted since september 2005 including test on august 31 2007 the slide indicates with check mark that the flight test was successful success in this test is also needed to for the total number of successful intercepts to match the reported figureweapon this was the first flight test of all the sm3 block ias upgrades previously demonstrated in ground tests92 press report on the test stated that the hostile air target was an antiship cruise missile the article stated that the scenario for the test called for the aegis ship to come under attack from cruise missile fired by an enemy plane navy plane fired the crui missile target used in the test93 june 22 2007 test mda states that this test was the third intercept involving separa ting target and the first time an aegis bmdequipped destroyer was used to launch the interceptor missile the uss decatur ddg 73 using the operationallycertified aegis ballistic missile defense weapon system bmd 36 and th standard missile3 sm3 block ia missile successfully intercepted the target during its midcourse phase of flight an aegis cruiser uss port roya l cg 73 spanish frigate mÃ©ndez nÃºÃ±ez f104 and mdas terminal high altitude ar ea defens thaad mobile groundbased radar also participated in the flight test uss port royal used the flight test to support devel opment of the new aegis bmd spy1b radar signal processor collecting performance data on its increased target detection and discrimination capabilities mÃ© ndez nÃºÃ±ez stationed off kauai performed longrange surveillance and track operations as training event to assess the future capabilities of the f 100 class the thaad radar tracked the target and exchanged tracking data with the aegis bmd cruiser this event marked the third time that an allied military unit participated in us aegis bmd test with warships from japan and the netherlands participating in earlier tests94 august 31 2007 test mda has publicly noted the occurrence of this

engagement invo lving two ballistic missile targets for the first time the operationally realistic test involved two unitary nonseparating targets meaning that the targets warheads did not separate from their booster rockets at approximately 612 pm hawaii standard time 1112 pm est target was launched from the pacific missile range facility pmrf barking sands kauai hawaii moments later second identical target was launched from the pmrf the uss lake eries aegis bmd weapon system detected and tracked the targets and developed fire control solutions approximately two minutes later the uss lake eries crew fired two sm3 missiles and two minutes later they succ essfully intercepted the targets outside the earths atmosphere mo re than 100 mile s above the pacific ocean and 250 miles northwest of kauai japanese destroyer also participated in the flight test stationed off kauai and equipped with the certified 36 aegis bmd weapon system the guided missile destroyer js kongo performed longrange surveillance and tracking exercises the kongo used the test as training exercise in preparation for the first ballistic missile intercept test by ja panese ship planned for later

defense flight test completedsm3 block ia was launched approximately two minutes later the sm3 failed to intercept the target there is immediate explanation for the failed intercept attempt more information will be available after thorough investigation the js chokai crew perfo rmance was excellent in executing the mission jftm2 was the second time that japanese ship was designated to launch the interceptor missile major milestone in the growing cooperation between japan and the us101 november 21 2008 press report states that an aegis ballistic missile defense bmd test by the japanese destroyer chokai ddg176 ended in failure when the standard missile3 block 1a interceptor lost track of the target miss ile in the final seconds before planned hittokill the chokai and its crew performed well throughout the test and the sm3 also performed flawlessly through its fi rst three stages according to rear adm brad hicks the us navy aegis ballistic missile defense program director he spoke with several reporters in teleconference around midnight et wednesdaythursday after the test in the area of the pacific missile range facility barking sands kauai hawaii this was the second aegis bmd test failure in less than month these latest two failures come as some democrats in congress are poised to cut spending on missile defense programs when they convene next year to consider the missile defense agency budget for the fi scal year ending sept 30 2010 still in the coming money debates next year missile defense advocates will be able to point out that even includi ng the hopper and chokai failures the record for the aegis tests is an overwhelming 16 successful hits demolishing target missiles out of 20 attempts those successes included the first japanese attempt the japanese destroyer kongo ddg173 successfully us ed its sm3 interceptor to kill target missile the difference in tests is that the kongo crew was advised beforehand when the target missile would be launched while the chokai crew wasnt hicks said board will be convened to examine why the latest test failed hicks declined to speculate on why the sm3 interceptor missed the target im confident well find out the root cause of the choikai interceptor failure to score hit he said however he was asked by space missile defense report whether the prior sm3 successes make it unlikely the chokai failure stems from some basic design flaw in all sm3s and whether it is more likely that the chokai sm3 failed because of some flaw or glitch in just that one interceptor hicks said that is likelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33745crs57 102 dave ahearn japanese aegis missile defense test fails but aegis record is 16 hits in 20 tries defense daily november 21 2008 56obviously we believe this is hopefully related to this one interceptor and doesnt reflect any basic design flaw in the sm3 interceptors he said the chokai test failure cost japan 55 million loss he said adding it wasnt cheap in the chokai test the target missile was launched from barking sands and about three minutes later the chokai cr ew had spotted the target the aegis system had developed tracking and hit solution and the sm3 interceptor was launched the first second and third stages of the interceptor performed nominally without problems but then came the fourth stage the nosecone components opened to expose the kill vehicle area and somehow the program to track the target missile failed it lost track hicks said only seconds before the hit would have been achieved if the kill had occurred it would have been about 100 nautical miles roughly 115 statute miles above earth and some 250 miles away from barking sands hicks said it took the interceptor about two minut flight time to reach the near miss with the target missile meanwhile the hamilton was nearby watching the test the hamilton aegis system successfully spotted and tracked the target and developed simulated solution and simulated interceptor launch that if it had been real would have resulted in successful hit on the target hicks said the hamilton didnt cue the chokai however it was st rictly chokais engagement hicks said102
