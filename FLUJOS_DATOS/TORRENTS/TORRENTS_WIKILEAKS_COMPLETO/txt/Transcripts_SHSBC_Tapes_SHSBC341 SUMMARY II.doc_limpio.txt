summary ii scientology 0 lecture given on 25 september 1963 whats the date audience 25th of september twentyfifth sept ad 13 all right well the lectures you have listened to from the 24th of july forward round up as i told you yesterday all phases of scientology and you may not quite grasp that at first glimpse because as you look back over this particular period of time it doesnt seem to you perhaps that theres too much in that period i know you look at your notebook and you get little staggered but nevertheless it didnt look like you hit too many subjects or ideas or something since the 24th of augustpardon july since 24th of july just havent hit too many ideas of types of things and so forth since that time youve covered the itsa line youve covered arc breaks the auditing cycle the versions of r1c youve had the r2h tone scale and so forth and youve had service facsimile and clearing by r3sc and you have had the pcs actual goals on rundown of it and now if we add to that touch assists and the cchs the tone scales various scales all the particularities of the arc triangle the auditors code and code of scientologistyou even had project 80 in that period which is scientology i dont you remember and actually youve got the lot youve got the lot theres lot of hellfire and brimstone can be added to some of these points you see like oh my god if you dont do thisohhhh and you know that sort of thing lot of things can be added along that line undoubtedly theres lot of new ways to dig into service facsimile but youve got roundup youve got roundup and only two things add to this roundup that round out this series well i just want to lay it before you that youre actually looking at the entire span of body of knowledge of scientology and thats quite remarkable thats quite remarkable and what i have to tell you now the first of it is new which is scientology 0 and the other is finding goals which is old r3 and that of course has always been difficult and is much easier now since you can find goals through r3sc relatively simply but these two points are about all that is left out of that entire rundown and these i point out to you are simply particularities now lot of work exists which is thrown into this such as the listing rules dont you see we havent had too much about listing rules but ive told you new type of listing which is by ta and even that has been described but this is summary this is summary of all of the important points and this is the data covered as i have told you just now and since the 24th of july which is very very very important data there are about five tapes from 1962 in the autumn which talk about the theory and formation of the gpmthe pcs actual gpm well these are interesting theyre background theory material and theyre quite interesting the hcobs on how you run r3m2 and that sort of thing are contributive to these things now the whole body of implant gpms and this whole body of knowledge has been examined with great particularity its marvelous training area but the value of an implant gpm is very slight aberrative value is very very slight i think of it now those fellows working in the sun and the big moon of helatrobus1 think of them now sweating there the temperature there was seldom below 85 you see it was real hot and so forth and there they were sweating and keeping the poles greased and bringing thetans in and freezing them up and going through all these ramifications and sweating and miserable about the whole thing you see their consciences rotting away within them you see its terrific overt and these betweenlives blokes you know there they are theyre sweating away you see theyre keeping that running you know and ahaaa and implanting and theyve got traithey wear out trains and trains and trains giving those train goals you know and there they are going on right now here in present time and there they are vast sums of money and so forth and the amount of aberration which it adds to the case is something like drop of water into the atlantic ocean its horrible because they would be so upset if they knew they obviously dont know or they wouldnt keep on sweating at it its fantastic its all for nothing its all for nothing all they did was make the universe look more hostile and they probably color the type of ri which theorand even sometimes the type of goal which the pc postulates they undoubtedly have had an influence in this particular direction but its an influence of significance and not an influence of quantitative action at all now if they disappeared the world would look friendlier and people would have better chance of destimulating you see the present time problem with regard to it wouldnt be so great and they would feel better about it but this ipoint i wish to make is those blokes arent doing it to anybody see theyre just some tiny small assistance the thetan is doing it to him self which of course lot of you during this period of this summer going through these implant gpms and im very glad you did because its highly educational area those that were in and z and if you think youve escaped them totally why those coming up now out of x theyre all set and roaring and so forth and theyre going to probably find on their plate some morning run to forget out of helatrobus series before we let them run any aberrative gpms the poor pc will be sweating there and his tone arm wont be moving much and the auditor will be trying to get those rocket reads and theyll be right back in there pitching again dont you see one of the ways of doing it is to find the pcs own gpm and then find out if there is counterfeit one somewhere on the track and itll run like startled gazelle aberrative value 0 but itll just run fine by the time youve run 3 or 4 of themto be lost or something like thisby the time youve run 3 or 4 youre not going to get any ta action because you will have restimulated of course the pcs own actual gpm to remarkable degree and have to go ahead and run it but its an interesting practice area but i think of it now i think of it nowthe administrative agents the fbi of the big confederation you see and the bureau of implants dont you seeand there they are and theyre all feeling bad about this and they know that its all necessary and has to be hasnt practically any influence it speeds up the dwindling spiral and it makes the universe seem hostile to people but beyond that its aberrative value is nothing one great big crashing ri has more value than the entirety of all of the implant series but its good thing for you to know what this universe is like and if you really want to know what it is like and that sort of thing this is an exploratory area what has been done what people are devoted and dedicated to in keeping other people aberrated that sort of thing and its quite interesting as review and you should consider quite valuable any experience youve had in running an implant gpm because you wont ever have any trouble with an actual gpm actual gpms are far sloppier and nowhere near as neat and theyre not preordained at all and youre off into the blue and youre having to use judgment as you go along the line on these things and you can make more mistakes in less units of time than in any other field of superhuman endeavor now that sphere and area is one that cannot be skimped and we mustnt skimp the technology of how you run an actual gpm you mustnt skimp that it looks kind of sloppy so you tend sometimes to do it kind of sloppily and one mistake in that aberrative stuff is of much greater value than having gonethe pcs having gone through the whole of the helatrobus implants so thats nothingthats nothing to toss around lightly but that technologythat technology all exists and its in the bulletins on listing and so forth and the only thing modern of that has been covered since the 24th of july and that is you list by ta now i want to cover rapidly here theres actually three subjects ive got to cover more about handling thistodays lecture and tomorrowsmore about handling these programing these things and so forth in actual gpms want to tell you right nowhaving gotten your goals all restimulatedi want to tell you right now about scientology 0 and this is just very brief brief brief coverage well have much better coverage on this subject but the essentials of this are of great interest to you every level of scientology contains in vignette all levels of scientology its nicely built little schema reg was busy pointing this out to he said each one of them contains all the levels thats right level ii contains all levels of scientology level iii contains all levels of scientology what do you mean by all levels of scientology well levels of scientology each one have its own designation and these perhaps could be better defined and the material could be better released to you but let give you just rapid coverage and i dont say that these definitions particularly hold good because im just talking to you for your understanding not for your memorization and thats simply this scientology 0 of course would be the big question mark this is the problems and confusions and wrongnesses zones of chaos of existencethe identification of those zones of chaos now lets take 3rd dynamic example healing has in it the medical profession all right they apparently got it all wrapped up theyre marvelous solution arent they now youve got to identify the chaos identify the falsity identify the upset people walking around all over the place and they think mental healing is all solved they think healing is all solved they dont know that if youve got lumbosis you havent got prayer see they dont know any of the true data concerning this what is the situation now at scientology 0 you point out this interesting thing you point out the fact that these are unsolved areas or there are pretensional solutions in them this is survey area and delightful area to work in in fact newspapers and so forth work in practically other area because all you have to do is find falsities and wrongnesses and thats it all right now how do you use this bunch of people come inpe class and youre talking to these people and theyre sitting down there and they think something is all wrapped up well at the level of scientology 0 and everything always starts at scientology 0is you say well that you seetheyits religion and god see lets say that you unfortunately got into this particular zone and area and so forth let give you very flagrant example you would not use see and that is the churchlets put it in its crudest formthe church does not have the human spirit all wrapped up thats an interestingan interesting approach you see but lets say you have there this bloke hes sitting there and although he doesnt believe in religion he believes the spirit is all wrapped up in other words mans going to go to heaven or hes going to go to hell and thats it and the vicar knows best see hes got that thats all packaged its all put away and its some mad zone of confusion that would hum out at him like flock of bumblebees if he ever really lifted the cover on it dont you see well the least you can do is warn him that if he lifts the cover on it hes going to be hit in the face with lot of bumblebees somebody made horrible mistake over at the fcdc the other day by mentioning between lives during the church service and learned immediately that he should have kept his mouth very shut and was around at alooking kind of scarletfaced afterwards and so forth well he at least knew he had made the mistake but in actual fact how much of mistake had he made well he had only made this mistake he had opened up too much scientology 0 too fast thats the only mistake he had made see so its case of degree its just case of degree of what you reveal or point out and this is something this is powerful subject its level of the operation of an aberrated world an aberrated universe see thats the level of spotting well now if you stand up there and you say to the people oh everything is all bad its all bad over there and its all bad over there and its terrible and everything is going to pieces oh yeah andand everything is bad everyplace and there isnt anybody good anyplace and there are nonothing but just false situations and everything else theyd say hes nuts see so this is just level of degree he might be making sense i mean it might be perfectly factual but thats too much scientology 0 see thats something like tying the cough medicine down somebodys throat and its the wrong presentation see too exaggerated insufficiently definitive obviously opinionated rfactor poor not convincing presentation dont you see i mean all of these things are wrong with it now compare it with thislets take typically british approach to this situationgovernment might not be the perfect answer see that might be toolittle dose all right what you wantwhat you want herein scientology 0 you merely want the people to become aware of the fact of what the problem is now this is an interesting level to work in because it doesnt have any tone arm action in it and thats why you can easily overdo it the only way you could get any tone arm action in it at all would simply be to talk about false solutions you might get some tone arm action in it if you talked about some false solutions but if you say theres nothing but problems problems problems problems problems youve got tone arm action at all on your audience or anybody else see so you shouldnt infer that there are solutions and only problems now im just trying to give you the fact that people dont try to resolve anything or do anything if they think its all wrapped up and youll find out that the complacency of the world is one of the basic things which keeps it gorgeously aberrated the complacency is marvelous the government has got it all wrapped up but the fda all of sudden decreed that everybody had to take two quarts of fire extinguisher fluid day to wash out the vitamins which poisoned them theyd say well yes well they know what theyre doing and so forth and you see the fact that bureau has said it or something like that immediately decrees there must have been some sense to it this is this terrific reasonability factor that drives us around the bend you see and if they want 95 percent of your pay dont you see in tax well there must be some good reason for it dont you see and so on and you might say the last stable datum that anybody can get in is toleration of the terrible condition see and they say it is reasonable or there must be reason for it dont you see so therefore in some fashion it is all right and that keeps it off their back as problem but you being more adventurous characters are always lifting the lids off of things you see and you say well maybe that isnt quite all right dont you see and you look inside this thing and you dont only find that it is not all right dont you see you find out that theres an awful swindle connected with this thing of some kind or another well its all right to discover all that but scientology i is getting off these solutions and falsenesses see so youre really not involved in scientology 0 with running the false solutions dont you see youve got little borderline there and you put an itsa line in but remember youre going over toward scientology i slightly now its simplyits simply the level of existing chaos and you say heres typical scientology 0 question is your family hard to live with do you find your home noisy yeah typical are you worried about your job is there any part of life about which you have anxiety see these are simply these are simply questions which awake person to the possibility that his life might be better and it all carries with it the possibility that the condition can be improved and that is its sole and total therapeutic action hope you say there are these problems bong bong bong bong bong and maybe something can be done about them so its entire therapy level is this faint hope maybe we wont always have government thats its therapy level and you find out this is quite workable its quite workable this is the lowest level of processing is giving somebody some hope lowest level there is and that goes along with the fact that you say there is problemso lets now summate this level seethere is problem is its strongest statement and the strongest process that is applied to it is maybe something can be done about it see its just that view of scientology 0 is simply the world as it exists and if we had level of scientology that paid any attention whatsoever to the existence or the isness of existence you see that is the conditions and problems which exist in the society we would have area to study society just as itself and we would keep on simply trying to resolve society all the time we wouldnt ever look at society and therefore to that degree were moved off from society so this is the legitimate level of inspection at this level we can notice somewhat dispassionately that the greengrocer every morning at 932 rushes out of his shop and throws rocks at the small boys and rushes back into his shop again the therapy is in that particular character we hope the rocks didnt hit the small boys you see and we hope he isnt too disturbed and we hope he will be happier about things someday you got the level but you still could stand there and watch him rush out and throw rocks at the small boys and watch the small boys and he goes back into his shop at 932 every morning see we dont go around and say to him well why dont you make friends with them or communicate with them seehahahahahascientology i called 0 because you dont do anything at this stage theres nothing now lot of this goes long way we say all the levels of scientology are contained in each level of scientology do you realize that in order to find service facsimile you have to ask the fellow what problems he has or what hes worried about this always comes into it slightly doesnt it so little of this goes long ways and this is an assessment of problems or something like that well thats the scientology 0 aspect of the ease in this particular case however we arent limited on the therapy angle because it appears in another one but we still have to have an hfactor in sessions remember you know you can knock your pc in the head your tone arms falling off the pin see your tone arms going zing zing zing its falling off the pin and so forth you sit there you sit there and hes going on listing see hes going on and hes listing and hes listing and he looks at your face and you and he says well am i getting any place isis the tone arm actioni meani mean is it increasing or anything is happening or we still getting lot of rocket reads what and he goes uhhhh you see the hfactor is still there at upper levels of scientology you say youre doing all right see and if you arent ill fix it up so you are little hope involved in this situation you see that keeps up his confidence so that he will tackle it and so even your hfactors in there now if you said to everybody on pe course everythings bad all over everyplace everything is all bad in fact theres place anybody can find where anything is good you immediately would have gone wild with your scientology 0 because you see you would have omitted the process and the process is simply even if you said everything is all bad everyplace you say but maybe it the faintest thing you could say well maybe itll turn out all right you see or maybe if everybody got busy they could do something about it or maybe if we studied this thing enough and learned something about it it wouldnt have to be that way dont you see thats the least statement you could make and even though youre then talking about entheta conditions youve still got theta line going along with it see you say well maybe we could even ease these things or get rid of them or something like that now youll find that this is very acceptable on public level if you dont overwhelm them and if you apply just small amount of hope and dont get too enthusiastic about the amount of hope and dont promise them the moon with fence around it because that isnt necessary at all as matter of fact its not acceptable within their rfactor you give them something on this orderyou give them something on this order this fellow hes come in and hes all gimped up one way or the other he has pretzel for spinal chord there he is and we say well soandso and soandso and soandso well your trouble we could say to him your troublepossibly that youre disturbed about something and you let him put in some scientology 0 on it so it works the other way too he says hey youre damned right im disturbed about something my spine you know im in pain agony all the time well there isnt any sense in selling him up too high because youll give him too high hill to climb on his reality factor you hear about it he cant sleep at night and he cant this and he cant that and he cant something or other dont you see and all this is impossible and this is agonizing and so forth and pick out one of these minor minor minor minor minor things that he is giving you and say well theres possibly some poss because he wont believe you on any of the strong ones and you say well maybe we can fix you up so you can sleep better at night this becomes very acceptable now hes got goal he goes aheadhe doesnt expect you to unpretzelize his spine but hell move ahead on this and you some degree have slightly bypassed the hidden standard dont you see youve given him new little standard if hes winning any hell sleep bit better at night see something like that something you think you might possibly make out of this wrong approach oh well well have you walking 6 foot 6 and looking 16 years of age and all the girls whistling at you as you go down the street thats not acceptable first place thats too much he has already learned to live with it its already part of his service facsimile it has some method of making people wrong you try to go headon with him and take it away from him directly or say you are going to he isnt going to release it man all hes going to do is make you wrong so what youve got to do as far as thats concerned remember youre just working at scientology 0 not at your processing levels you see is he tells you this and that and the other thing well you just pick out the tiniest little one that slid in any way whatsoever and put some hope in on it see like what are we going to do about the government well maybe we could fix it up so there are fewer politicians talk on tv got the idea and you know somebody wouldsomebodythey got enoughthey can face that see its gradient of confront is what youre working with this guy could face perhaps giving up enough of his service facsimile you see to sleeping little bit better at night because he didnt intend to have his rest disturbed too he just wants to get even with people in the daytime but youre giving him little bit to confront and maybe these people on government you say well maybe we could get the people tomaybe get the politicians to talk less you see on tv and by george you know you could probably organize quite an association and quite society you could probably have people without saying two questions of it or anything else or doing anything odd about the association at all but just going out and working like beavers and writing letters to people and visiting their parliamentary representatives well theyd have marvelous time and so forth and all they want to do is limit the amount of time which politician can talk on the air now theres an adjudication between this is how much is too little and how much is too much and that is piece of judgment that has got to be made and person who is working at scientology 0and remember you work at it every time you talk to pc about what youre going to dowhile youre working at this thats the judgment that you must go not too much not too little acceptable and confrontable by the person whats confrontable now youre talking to pe course youre talking to pe course now this is the study of confusion now the practical aspect if you ever gave anybody drill on scientology 0 wouldyou would have long sheet of beautiful confusions that have to do with the immediate family or neighborhood or the immediate dynamics of the individual and youd simply have him pick out which one of these confusions it was probable that the people he was talking to could confront see which one of these confusions could they confront and you could train him up see to this degree you could have drill you see and you eventually wouldnt get somebody dashing out saying its bad all over the place and were going to shoot everybody tomorrow dont you see as the immediate indicated confront we want you to go and shoot everybody tomorrow you see well even though he has an audience that possibly under different case levels and so forth might have been perfectly willing at one time or another to have shot everybody tomorrow on problem of the magnitude they are facing today he is not at that moment talking to an audience t at is going to go out and go down to the arms store and get the police permit and shoot everybody tomorrow see theyre not going to do it all right but they are going to do something and this then you always make as an assumption that there is always something that you can get to be confronted on any dynamic always something you can get to be confronted on any dynamic it mustnt be too much and it mustnt be too little let give youthis would be an absolute perfect formula for social workergoing around and the babies are falling downstairs in the tenement and everybodys crying and screaming and there are three fights going on on two landings and flatiron comes sailing down through the area way you see aimed at the maintenance man or the janitor you know and mrs oleary has an awful lot of problems and her problems shes firing off at this social worker and its this and its that and its this and its that and so forth and if the social worker saysmrs olearys husband gets drunk all the time and never brings home any pay and furniture all gets stolenits always being broken upand the rents behind and so forth and theres all these things see whats the social worker trying to do well the social worker always has to ask himself this questionthe auditor always has to ask himself this questionthe pe lecturer always has to ask himself this question what is he trying to do well if hes trying to make somebody happier in his environment or trying to get some action in some particular direction or something like that then he uses and adjudicates his actionshe uses these formulas and he adjudicates his action along in these formulas he gets something done that can be confronted by the person he is trying to get to do it this is all so elementary it sounds like youre talking kindergarten but actually theres little bit of something interesting here this is an undercut of such fantastic numbers of problems that although it sounds very simple and innocuous it has fantastic workability so he says to mrs oleary and so forth the social worker says to mrs oleary she says and you cant do this and you cant do that and cant keep the place clean about the only thing you know just cant keep the place clean at all and he notices that mrs oleary has emptied an ashtray for his cigarette see as shes standing there talking to him and so forth and he says ill tell you what i would do id start in on this thing little bit at time and id get the place cleaned up now why dont you keep the ashtrays emptied although she might even fly back in his face see at first glance you look around here what could she do hes not processing her because its sort of onecommand situation well she might be able to keep the ashtrays empty you will be surprised she might even natter at him little bit and when he leaves why shell go around and empty the ashtrays and all of sudden fantastic resurgence of hope may occur in that woman see the trick is there is something to be done about itthats one level of hopethat you can dois the other level naturally it applies in all processing too pcs in trouble its always marvelous thing to sit back and ask find out what the pc can tell you about it youd be surprised how often this works to pull pc completely out of the doldrums pc can confront doing something hes climbing too high hill every once in while pc says to you im climbing too high hill well theres point where you make him climb that hill anyway and another point where you dont force him to climb that hill because youll wind up in trouble if you do particularly in routine 4 processes you actually mustnt force the pc forward you mustnt force the pc forward the pcs nattering find out what the arc break is about before you proceed and if the pc is actually having hard time doing well just take it easy and see if the pc cant do it anyway and youll be surprised if the pc is not pressed or pushed how the pc will climb that hill anyhow all right well this is difference here this is an oddity here im throwing this in as showing you that it does fit at lowerupper levels we left mrs oleary emptying the ashtrays first doggone thing you know shes liable to be getting highfalutin ideas she can do something about stopping her husband from drinking and coming home she starts to get the idea something can be done about it this isnt the experience of the average social worker now to show you how missing this technology is these people are quote trained in social work unquote with an exclamation point on the quotes because they only complain to you about one thing and if you talk to social workers theyll just complain to you about the fact they cant get anybody to do anything about anything and for lack of this piece of information you get total socialism and total indigence in society and thats how big the datum is that sits at the bottom of it because nobody ever gives anybody anything they can do nobody ever adjudicates the problems involved in the situation and then does something about those problems that can have something done about them and that somebody can confront to do something about them see so as net result social worker goes down scale on toboggan because he never gives anybody anything they can do now here and there there may be some screaming genius of social worker who is not bound by those rules or who has stumbled onto this data and utilizes it one way or the other but such person is of course vastly in the minority because the social worker at large is terribly unsuccessful fantastically so always giving people now what you want to do mrs oleary is clean this whole place up scrub it down from top to bottom after all weve given you soap and get your children there and get them cleaned up and put in those nice new pinafores that we have had sent down to you now ill have talk with your husband concerning his drinking and right at that point the social worker haseven if the womaneven if mrs oleary would have cleaned up the whole place even if she would have put the children in the clean clothes at this point she and the social worker part company violently because the social worker has told mrs oleary something that mrs oleary knows by experience cannot be done nobody can talk to her husband about his drinking she couldnt even conceive the united states army with fixed bayonets in little rock charge doing anything about mr olearys drinking see she knows this and youve just run headon you know crrrash see into stable datum now dont get peeved for instance at the better business bureau socalled its swindling organization that uses blackmail to procure contributions for fear that they might say your business is bad it operates in the united states its quite racket mostly their bureaus are run by people with criminal records but anyhowtheyre the primary authority on how bad scientology is in the united states see all right now these boysthese boys because theyre fed this by these two jerks at the ama see all right great but these two birds up there feed them data and then they put this data out but they dont put it out to be mean they actually put it out because they believe it because they dont think anything can be done about anything first one they dont know any problems exist and two if they did they didntwouldnt think anything could be done about them anyway now if you just accept it even at level of the better business bureau whose questions you see onewell their ethics and intentions are probably open to serious question you probably could even sweep them aside if you used this particular type of approach and this data and kept your head on while you were doing it just used this see because the better business bureau says that nothing can be cured and you could probably sweep this away by getting the better business bureau to agree that people could be made more comfortable i mean if you were talking to them and arguing with them your scientology 0 then would consist of the fact of there are lot of people who are uncomfortable your level of problem that they could confront see they couldnt confront the problem that people are sick and dying and being cut to ribbons on operating tables and the blood spattering all over the wall you know because this is pretty gaudy picture see of what theyre supporting they wouldnt be able to confront any part of it so they dont consider its problem because they dont see it you see youve got to snap them out of their service fac just to this degree to give them problem they could confront now everybody is dishonest everyplace that just plays right into the hands of their service facsimile dont you see you could probably get them to agree that there are quite few people around who are uncomfortable and by talking to somebody in friendly fashion could be made more comfortable oh theyd buy that theyd say you were great the ama wouldnt even be able to convince them now that you were doing wrong why they can agree that people are not comfortable and they could agree that friendly person visiting them could make them more comfortable they could agree to this see well that would be your scientology 0 in all levels there is the study of the problem discoverydiscovery of the general problem from your viewpoint then the discovery of the area the problem that can be confronted by the person you are talking to and then finding some part of that problem or doingness in that problem that that person could face up to and execute and all this is done in an atmosphere of hope and you have your scientology 0 if you could do that uniformly to everybody that walked up to you youd have so many pcs you wouldnt know which end you were standing on guy comes out here and he says i have an awful lot of trouble with my business secretarys always drunk and the workers arent working and so forth and they came in and they opened the cash drawer and the police are always walking through the place in their muddy boots andand so forth sososososo hes just talkingyoure just listening to some kind of circuit and you say all right now i heard that now whats really wrong here see you can put the itsa line in just as well as he can you dont even have to do an assessment of scientology 0 you seewhats wrong here it doesnt matter whether you put in the problem or you get the problem from him see we dont care which and youll find out this works in rin r3sc itsyou cant give somebody goals but you can sure tell somebody what his service fac might be bordered upon and run it with considerable tone arm action sometime for instance youve been doing lists you look over somebodys old lists and you find out that every time he hits the subject of women you notice thatbad women good women and so forththis gives you tone arm action see just that little period there you know you get little blowdown and tone arm action and so forth just say well were going to run women see you didnt do any assessment thats trick some of you characters lost out on last week by the way you were busy busy busy busy busy trying to find something wrong with the pc that you could pin service facsimile on and after you had done two or three dozen pages of lists on problems of course you didnt have any tone arm action so you see this has broad application over into that sphere because you didnt have anythingany business doing that with anybody who was getting tone arm action anyhow see you didnt have any business doing that with somebody well you didnt have any business listening to any problems and cutting his itsa line on listing and all this kind of bunk this was the time for you to put the small crank in through the temple and wind it few times and have the little bell go whirrping you see and say you know every time this guy has present time problem you knowyouve been auditing this pc maybe only few daysbut every time this guy has present time problem it actually seems to concern the course see thats all see or it concerns the girls around you see or it concerns something assessmentjust use scientology 0 see obviously obviously this person has problems about it because he can confront them he can confront the course he cant confront the world he can confront the course youll be surprised how often you will run somebodys best friend as service facsimile well he can confront his best friend but he cant confront any of his enemies very often by the way somebodys liable to get mad at you they wont be mad at anybody else in the whole world theyd be sweet as pie to them but theyll be mad at you youre their best friend they can confront getting mad at you you get the idea they would be in screaming rage at the rest of the world if they could confront it but they cant confront that but they can get mad at you you should understand that sometimes as an auditor because you realize its always safe to get mad at your auditor see your auditors bound by code of ethics not to get mad back furthermorefurthermore your auditor is friend of yours you see so that you might not be able to get mad at your bank but you can get mad at your auditor dont you see in actual fact it doesnt make the auditor less friend of the pc but thats the lowest level he can afford to get angry at thats actually the basic secret of the arc breaky pc hes arc breaky with the world at large and its safe to get mad at the auditor thats all now thatsyou recognize then that here is thismaybe this little mouse character you see why she hasnt whispered on the street anything of the sort and yet shes got agets into session or gets into group meeting or something like this and she realizes shes amongst friends so she can dare get mad at them its quite interesting quite case gain id never criticize them for it particularly id just find something else they could get mad at but whatthat isnt session use thing to do is find out the arc break and keep going get tone arm action is the whole answer to that find the bypassed charge and get tone arm action and youll bring them through anything these are good workable sizable stable data that wont wear out but heres your scientology 0 aspect of existence and you dont tell people about problems that are completely unreal to them and that they know they cant do anything about and expect them to be in wild stampeding enthusiasm to get going in any particular direction at all works with the pc works with group works with anybody why you can have the police shooting down rioters with machine guns right outside the door you see you could have rioters burning down every government building and thered be very large portion of the population in the midst of all this mess and so forth thatd besit there knowing that everybody had it under control who was supposed to have it under control see i mean the visual evidence means nothing to them that explodes one of probably your favorite stable datum that if somebody could see it with his own eyes he would believe it see this has such limited workability there was one of the high top aeronautical design scientists flew over here from holland some years ago heard i was in london had to come up and see and talk to about theory about something or other and he talked to brrrbang for while and went back and climbed on his airplane and went elsewhere but he told funny story and that is after he had demonstrated that something was actually hanging in space and suspended counteropposed to gravity the commanding general in charge of all of the project and so forth got down on his hands and knees and crawled all underneath the table and all around the room trying to find the secret magnetic equipment and so forth that was holding this thing aloft in view of the fact that there wasnt even any cloth on the table because there was way to put anything under the table this was quite remarkable now of course his observation of the situation was simply that his word had been questioned and he was quite wroth on the subject so he was also limited in his observation so he didnt really see how funny this story was there wasnt anyplace in the room to put any such machinery yet the general even invents table cloth to hide the nonexistent thing that is keeping the designed flying saucer you see in suspension see see he couldnthe saw it with his own eyes and he didnt believe it we know this is chronic this is customary if you get to thinking it over you could think of many instances where people see things with their own eyes and dont believe them in fact theyre probably more numerous than the reverse so you never count on that as stable datum theres not even any particularparticular sense in being terribly good to prove to people you are good because if theyre saying you are bad to that degree then they are incapable of the power of observation to determine when youre good this parents and fathers and mothers are notorious in this particular line sometimes the gets to be forty years old and his father still has never been introduced to him he has theoretical symbol someplace that he calls and sons behave in certain way so therefore this fellow behaves in that way and hell even invent whole false past and whole series of false adventures to account for this image that he has but this hasnt anything whatsoever and the child often goes gluuhhh practically spins on the unreality of this sort of thing there is many child who is always being challenged for the things they have done which they havent done and they get in woggy state of mind because theyre doing things that they should be challenged for and nobody ever sees these and it gives them complete zzzzz you see it doesnt match up reality so this is the type of person and this is the beingness of individuals when youre dealing in the sphere and zone of aberration or when youre dealing with guys who are downscale far enough to be doing nothing but wear meat bodies you know and be on the economic treadmill when this kind of thing occurs you must realize the power of observation is out and the easiest thing to relay in this particular line is an idea but the idea must not violate the confront ability or the confront potential of the individuals being brought to so therefore neither the problem which is being pointed out in scientology 0 nor the solution must exceed the reality of the person to whom it is being pointed out now all right this colonel goes around the army camp and he wonders how these fellows can be so involved in their company streets and their barracks and that sort of thing and operating in their tiny little spheres youve probably had the funny feeling yourself occasionally in going into shop and wondering how somebody could work at that particular bench all day long and never move out of that zone or area and it probably is almost giving you the creeps but in actual factin actual fact that persons confront potential on problems is problems of the zone of that particular little workbench and his ability to confront solutions are the zone of solutions which he is applying and therefore we say hes an effective person on the job now when his ability to confront problems gets up to the full zone and area of the entire camp and he really is confronting the problems of the campnot problems he dreams up because this very easily goes on lowerscale mockeryand he can confront solutions which are actual and real solutions to these problems or doingnesses in that particular direction you longer have somebody who is working at workbench you have colonel see now because of the system of labels which is used in this particular society very often the guy who was commanding general in his last life is private in the rear rank in this one may be that his confront potential has not particularly reduced hell have quite coterie in his immediate vicinity whereby hes pointing out the things that are wrong to the immediate troops in his vicinity and pointing out the solutions whats interesting is is these are usually more real than the command decisions thats quite amusing and sometimes at lower level of rank you start filtering around through the lower level of rank and picking up the grapevine on the subject of what are the problems of the camp and what are the solutions to it and you generally find out those are the answers but according to the staff command level you see why the problems areand its really theyll start in this sort of way well really its very involved for an uninformed observer you see to realize the tremendous difficulties of coping with this situation you see and in actual fact you see general smith here is having very very hard time trying to keep his number in the proper rank up you see at the pentagon and that is really the basic difficulty here because weve got to make better show with the and well your problem you thought up to that point was simply one of morals and drains dont you see we find out that theyre very complicated and if we listen to this kind of approach for little while we get absolutely staggered get completely overwhelmed we dont know whether were coming or going we dont know whether there are any problems in this camp or just lunatics dont you see if we listen to it at this level im sureim sure that the fdas opinion of what are the problems of the united states and so forth wouldnt stand inspection by psycho they wouldnt im sure that if you sat around the press office and the administrative centers and so forth at the white house today and listened to what the problems of the world really were you would sit there and your eyes would probably start an inch out of your skulls see their scientology 0 is wildly out see wildly out its based on an inability to observe well sometimes these inabilities to observe are quite real in other words you cant go there and look but that doesnt mean you cant get it trustworthily looked at thats always something to remember you can get things trustworthily looked at for instance all too often in scientology some guy is kicking around and somebody suddenly says well hes good and he audited pc very badly and all this kind of thing and therefore he should be suspended from staff or something like this until hes had 8000 hours of auditing or something like this well theres some kind of command decision see i mean its made by an assoc sec or somebody of this character well as long as everybodys fate depends on this particular level of action and as long as that fellow actually isnt observing what really happened or what the circumstances actually are there is actually justice or personal security possible if you get just freakish flip and oh well somebodys got to be hanged so well hang this one you know that is not possibility of solution if youre going to have any justice at all youve got to have the situation looked at dont you see the situation has to be intelligently looked at that is as intelligently observed as it can be observed and as unbiasedly observed as it can be unbiasedly observed youve got to hear people whove said all right he did bad job and so forth and all right and these other people say well yes and you eventually get down to it and you find out the pc had hangover that morning dont you see and something wild was in the lineup quite ordinarily that nobody suspected up to that particular time there were contributing factors there were all sorts of things well person at command level has neither time you see nor the position from which he could observe in order to settle it so hed better settle it with people who do have the time to observe the situation and then abide by what they have observed thats solution to the situation dont you see in what wonderful shape you would be in if all during your career in this universe you had only operated ever upon the actual facts see so we get branch out of scientology 0 if group is going to operate in any cleared level youve got to take the service facsimile out of it as far as you can and the characteristic of service facsimile is is nonobservation and generality substituting for judgment now those are the characteristics of service facsimile now to the degreeyou see you cannot totally remove those on an absolute from all situations everywhere see because the very fact of removing them would become so complicated that you would now have new complications to observe but you can go long way in this direction you can go an awful long way in this direction what is the situation thats the first question what part of the situation is potentially confrontable and what part of that situation will somebody do something about and of course youve got the whole formula worked out to get observation and action accomplished in this universe theres many amany king like kennedy swanking around wants to get everything done tomorrow im sureim sure kennedy left to his own devices im sure he would have the cubans out of cuba isnt that what hes trying to do im sure hed be able to accomplish this because hes good sincere man basically at heart even though hes stoneblind and stupid now im trying to be fair so he marshals up the whole united states army and the whole united states navy and the whole united states air force to solve this situation and they go out and make fools out of themselves on the high seas for number of days with tremendous amounts of rocketry big guns everything of the sort they put blockade all the way around cuba that anybody can get through they have an invasion on cuba and its carefully planned so that kennedy at the last moment calls off their air support the revolutionaries and the people who know cuba have now been disowned completely wont have anything to do with them shoot them theyretheyre not after all germane to the situation because they are out of cuba already see so he accomplished that much so we dont worry about them we dont ask for any of their advice its starting to look wilder and wilder when you get right down and look at it you see and this is just basis of generality substituting you see for actual judgment and the generality got there in the first place because there was observation of the situation i dont think anybodys made study of the situation at all of any kind of an impartial nature i think everybodys just riding hobbyhorses and big wild theories and that sort of thing situation couldnt possibly maintain itself the way it is if somebody sat down and made good broad wide survey of all the factual evidence and did all the personal observation that he could on the situation hed eventually wind up at the other end with an exact appraisement of the problems and situations as they exist in the vicinity of cuba and then of course he could pick up something which is confrontable about all this and start moving in on that quarter and then start moving in on another quarter and the problem called cuba would go pssww that would be the end of that got the idea all right you do withthis with case all the time and you ought to know this cold about eases very often any time youve got failure on case you have not estimated the state of the case that is to say the confusions and problems of the case these you have not estimated its very often great shock to an auditor after hes been auditing out of the best possible motives auditing somebody for two or three weeks to suddenly come up with gasp and find out something new about this pc that hed never known before and it completely alters the whole situation and program of which he was operating you see well whats at fault there was an uncareful survey of the ease he didnt look this case over before he began in on it so of course he made mistakes in other words he cut out the observational point then he himself didnt do what could be done because of course it was based on unreal information and then we get what is commonly called case failure you know he didnt make good progress its that sort of thing well frankly all case failures are addressed more or less into this zone and area somebody made an improper estimate of the ease in the first place based on bad observation of the confusions and difficulties of the case and then didnt handle it on the basis of what the auditor could confront and what the pc could confront and of course we have case failure now the auditor in looking this pc over as hes listing these problems and difficulties and solutions is actually listing two different zones or two different aspects the problems he can see about this caseproblems and difficulties and confusions about this case that he can seeand then of course there are problems and confusions and difficulties about the case that the pc can see and these vary widely these are two different points of view and they are quite different and ive told you about the fellow that walks in on the crutches and tells you that he has constant pain in his ear thats whats really wrong with him all right hes apparently never noticed that he didnt have right leg you see this then follows through that theres the auditors estimation of the pcs problems and difficulties then theres the pcs estimation of the pcs problems and difficulties well the auditor is too often simply content with his own estimation of the pcs problems and difficulties he pays attention to the pcs estimation of his problems and difficulties this becomes missing factor then in auditing now theres certain level of these problems and difficulties that the auditor finds confrontable he finds confrontable see or she finds confrontable and then of course there is the point of the problems and difficulties and now remember this is not point of view of what the auditor thinks is wrong but point of view of what the pc thinks is wrong which the pc finds confrontable theres one of these thingsnow get thisthat the pc thinks is wrong that the pc can find confrontable so therefore theres what the auditor can confront about this case dont you see but thats confrontation of this totality of confusions and difficulties which the auditor sees and then theres the pcs point of view over here but that is point of view of an entirely different group of problems and difficulties you got that now the pc has some part of that series of difficulties which the pc can confront see that all right thenthen theres certain point of level which the auditors experience and so forth has told him that he could do on the problems and difficulties which he has confronted so that actually is the doingness which the auditor is willing to attackthatsattack with thats what the auditor is going to do about the confrontable problem or difficulty out of the total problem and difficulties of the case you see that ah but theres another one for the pc theres the pcs attitude of what he could do about the problems and difficulties which he himself is able to confront out of all the problems and difficulties which he has some awareness that he has now look at these as six factors six factors all stacked up on one case you want to know how you get misestimate of the situation well just draw this for your pc sometime just ask your burning question at each level what are the problems and difficulties which i honestly think this case is in soandso and soandso and soandso all right what part of these am i willing to confront well soandso that ones the easiest to confront thats obvious all right then what am i willing to do or know that i can do with regard to that one i can confront that would be the auditors estimation of the case and its progress interesting all right then theres three more whats the pcs estimation of his states of confusion and difficulties what one of those problems and confusion does he find potentially confrontable and what is he himself willing to do about that problem and confusion which has been found confrontable in other words big one smaller two smaller three see youve got six factors at work here then in any auditorpc relationship this is all scientology 0 and nothing else now the funny part of it is is this isnt that important on pc level because its mostly taken care of by the fact that if you can get tone arm motion on the pc on huntandpunch system and pushabout and so forth why youre all right but listen when you cant get tone arm action man that is important and that becomes important and you havent done anything about it little serious discussion with the pc on this particular subject would entertain you vastly sometime or another the pc may be talking about these tremendous things that he has in mind that he would like to have or something like that but that isnt the question we just asked we asked the question of out of this total sum of his problems and difficulties which one is potentially confrontable by him and what could he do about that one problem or difficulty now of course the greatest use of that particular survey is not in the field of processing but in the field of auditor advices to the pc field which we almost never touch because we say we shouldnt evaluate or invalidate for the pc nevertheless it totally exists as field and exists as such broad field that not to call it level of scientology would be to disown what man is ordinarily doing with man all the time hes giving him advice and if you follow the rules which ive just given you here youll give some beautiful advice believe itll be pretty gorgeous youll be very successful adviser funny part of it is youll actually be in total control of the situation before you know it because all the advices you give will be followed and what stops people advising because the advice they give is never followed but your advice in this wise would always be followed youve got now an estimate of what the personnot pcbut what the person considers problems and difficulties good youve got that estimation now youve got what of all these problems and difficulties they would find confrontable see we only now wind up with one problem or difficulty you see now what would they be able to face doing about that one problem and you of course have smoked it right out into the clear see and bang that they will do something about it they will then to that degree win they will then to that degree be able to see more of their own problems and difficulties theyll be able to confront more of their problems and difficulties and the cycle can be repeated again so now you will find out that new review of the general situation finds out that they have an improved idea of what is potentially confrontable amongst their problems so you can now find out what they would be comfortable to do about this new problem and they would do that and that would give them another win now the only difficulty is is they very often go up scale with too great confidence and like little baby who has just learned how to walk they go tearing across the room at high run and ill call to your attention they usually fall on their face about the third step they can get much too ambitious so you have to take this into consideration when youre giving that sort of thing and say well dont do any more than that at this particular time you see that would be giving advice that would be social working and that sort of thing well now you have to enter this field as auditors because it is your duty to reduce the present time restimulation of pc to point where the session is controllable so in that particular field you have to study out the situation sometimes and say zit and zat and dit and get done what the pc can do about it and hes handled some of his present time environment dont you see so this is where this comes in it comes in at pcat pc level on advising the pc so as to cut down present time restimulation it all comesso comes down to wonder why the pc feels hes losing all the time of course he cant do any of this as the pc who eventually of course does all these things about his own case and then you get theyou get this additional aspect of the pe person the new person you get the people who cant audit who are part of group you get these various zones and spheres and you have to talk to these people about things well if you make it your business to rapidlybecause you mustnt dwell on it because theres tone arm action in it you seeto rapidly get an estimation of what they think is wrong then find out which one of these points they can confront and then find out what theyre going to do about that point that they think they can do and then get them to do it and at that point become terribly militant on the subject of getting that point done man you have agreement with capital agreement with capital affinity every time how come you havent told them anything that they think is false and theyve got an estimate of the situation and they know when youre advising them on that estimate of the situation they know then you speak true and im bad one to use for model on this because in the first place in talking to you im not talking to the public i say you see that vertical wall oh youve left your flyshoes home huh well climb the wall just walk straight up now keep your back stiff i know you sometimes feel like that when i hand you something to do slightly different relationship is involved now im talking about the analysis of situation in any given zone or area people dont know what the world is all about they dont know how to get any further along in life they know they cant make any improvement in life they know its impossible to be any better at all yeahhhh well you could actually sit down and prove to whole group that it is possible to get better you can make them write it on sheet of paper i can see allison down there in cape town doing this now in monthfew months have them write down on piece of paperand see the rest of you toowrite down on piece of paper now short list of problems that you think are wrong with your lifethe problems you have in your life just write this short list down and so forth all right which one of those is the easiest for you to confront and so forth now write that down see all right now now write down what you absolutely know for sure you could do about that last one you have just written down all right write that down now you see what youve written down at the bottom of this page do it they say my god this fellows reading minds the guys genius howd he know i could do that its quite fascinating you see you could thenand just leadership of group in pe or scientology group or something like thatincrease your agreement just enormously with the rawest meat you ever hadrawest meat you ever had anything to do withand social work and in other ways now i notice every once in while scientologist winds up as an adviser to some bigwig someplace this is quite interesting every once in while once in blue moon ill get sudden letter from somebody or another and it all of sudden itll really all be foxed up enormously more power to them you see but theresyou can see that mahogany desk you know just imprinted on that letter all over and this will be mr bushbottoms scientology adviser every now and then it comes through my mail lines quite intriguing and they land in these positions and they very often stay in them for years and years and years what are they doing theyre processing this guy you see and they process his staff and that sort of thing they dont do too much dissemination work and so on but that position and post does exist in scientology and does occur im not making any fun of it because we make considerable inroad its quite interesting its just niche that scientologists here and there carve out for themselves if he didwas very careful to do nothing but scientology 0 on his advisory capacities on that particular post they would think of him as the greatest screaming genius that ever walked through that front door particularly if he never pointed out single problem he himself never dreamed up single solution to any of the problems but just made people continuously estimate the situation and do that which they thought they could do about the situation see ive given you the perfect formula for this see that is not all of scientology 0 because its confrontation of what things are all about thats what it is its the problems its the chaoses its other things of that particular nature there are ways and means of handling these things ive given you the most elementary material there is on it scientology 0 has high applicability to any case level anyplace because its simply an estimation of the case and i point out to you that there are two actions always involved in scientology 0 in all of its problems and thats your viewpoint and the other fellows viewpoint and they are always those two and they always lead to two different views of the exactingof the same situation if you can get the other fellow to estimate the situation you seldom have to which is the laziest way to look at it of the two of them it is slightly more important for the other fellow to estimate the problems and confusionsthe potential problem be confronted and so forth and what he can do about itslightly more important for that than for you but you shouldnt lose your gift in this particular wise because life is successfully lived with scientology 0 well in and its very unsuccessfully lived with it out and probably the reason you came down scale and figured out all those things to do all that confronting for you in those gpms and that sort of thing is because your scientology 0 was out the whole way so i think its time after all this time that we got it in to some slight degree thank you
