decreases the presidents budget requested funding increases for several programs including public housing operating costs and programs for the homeless persons with aids and firsttime homebuyers the fy2008 funding debate was also shaped by the ongoing decline in receipts from the federal housing administration fha available to offset the cost of the budget for fy2007 it was estimated that fha

assistance programs public housing section 8 vouchers and section 8 projectbased rental assistance account for the majority of the departments funding nearly 75 in fy2007 two flexible block grant programs home and community development block grants help communities finance variety of housing and community development activities designed to serve lowincome families other more specialized block grants help communities meet the needs of homeless persons including those with aids in recent years hud has also focused more attention on efforts to increase the homeownership rates for lowerincome and minority households with programs providing funding for downpayment assistance and housing counseling huds federal housing administration fha insures mortgages made by lenders to lowerincome home buyers many with belowaverage credit records and to developers of multifamily rental buildings containing relatively affordable units fha collects fees from insured borrowers which are used to sustain

by the house and senate appropriations committees hrept 110 446 and the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 housing counseling assistance is typically funded as setaside in the home account in fy2007 it was funded at 42 million within home in recent years including fy2008 the presidents budget has requested that the program be funded in separate account both the house and senate bills as well as the conference agreement and final enacted bill included funding for housing counseling as setaside within the home account for fy2008 the house version of hr 3074 would have provided 49 million see table note p the senate version would have provided 150 million the conference agreement would have provided 50 million and the final enacted bill provided 50 million b the cost of these accounts is generally covered partially if not fully by offsetting receipts that are listed elsewhere in this table c the president proposed series of costsavingrevenueincreasing fha modernization proposals several of which were adopted by congress they are included in the discussion of the federal housing administration later in this report the presidents budget also included new 4 million legislative proposal for hud oversight of the government sponsored enterprises which was not adopted by congress d the fy2007 yearlong continuing resolution funded most accounts at their fy2006 enacted level however the cr specified higher or lower funding levels for some hud accounts the cr appropriated such sums as may be necessary to fund 50 of the cost of the statutory cost ofliving increase approved for fy2007 the amount shown here may change if estimates of the cost of this provision change f the fy2007 emergency supplemental appropriations law pl 11028 provided 7 million in additional funding for huds inspector general and authorized over 6 million in additional funding for the office of federal housing enterprise oversight fully offset by additional ofheo fees g estimates of offsetting receipts are subject to change h the president requested that congress rescind the amount provided in fy2007 for hope vi i as proposed by the president house bill senate bill and conference agreement the 28 million for rental housing assistance would have been fully offset by rescission of 28 million in unobligated and recaptured balances from the rental housing assistance account the fy2008 enacted funding bill provided 28 million for rental housing assistance but rescinded 38 million in unobligated balances leaving net offset of 10 million j the presidents budget requested rescission of fy2007 edi and funds within the cdf account but edi or funds were provided in fy2007 k floor amendment would have transferred 676 million from the inspector general account to the home account to be used for housing counseling assistance l the senatepassed funding bill proposed to change the way that huds salaries and expenses were funded traditionally hud has transferred funds from fha and gnma to cover the agencys management and administrative salaries according to the committee report the committee has eliminated such transfers and replaced them with direct appropriations to specific salaries and expenses accounts within each hud mission area in order to provide more transparency the net funding levels for salaries and expenses and fha and gnma administrative costs match the presidents request m the house and senate conference agreement for hud was approved by the house but never considered by the senate it was replaced with hud funding bill included as division k in the consolidated appropriations act 2008 n similar to the senate bill the conference agreement would have funded huds salaries and expenses directly at the presidents requested level in new accounts pl 110161 funded the account using the same structure as the conference agreement but provided 10 million less for nonpersonnel expenses 825 million for gnma expenses is included in the hud salaries and expenses account p the accountlevel funding table for division k transportation housing and urban development and related agencies appropriations act 2008 included in the joint explanatory statement as printed in the congressional record on december 17 2007 beginning on page h16632 is not consistent with the funding levels set by the legislative text as printed in the congressional record on the same date however the accountlevel table included in the joint explanatory statement posted on the house rules committee website prior to floor consideration of the bill crs7 is consistent with the legislative text printed in the congressional record and is also consistent with tables provided to crs by the house appropriations committee as result the table posted on the house rules committee website was used in place of the table printed in the congressional record q the consolidated appropriations act includes 4158 billion in advance appropriations for tenant based rental assistance to become available in fy2009 4193 billion in advance appropriations provided in fy2007 became available at the beginning of fy2008 of the advance appropriations provided in fy2007 for use in fy2008 pl 110161 rescinds 723 million for additional information see discussion under the tenantbased rental assistance heading later in this report accounts the following section of the report provides detailed discussion of the majority of accounts included in table 2 note that the unit of funding may vary between millions and thousands from table to table tenantbased rental assistance section 8 vouchers the tenant based rental assistance account funds the section 8 housing choice voucher program see crs report rl32284 an overview of the section 8 housing program by maggie mccarty section 8 vouchers are portable rent subsidies that lowincome families use to reduce their housing costs in the private market hud currently funds more than 2 million

floor action provided by the house and senate appropriations committees hrept 110 446 and the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 note totals may not add due to rounding unless noted otherwise amounts shown for fy2007 were not specified in the yearlong cr pl 1105 and are therefore assumed to be the same as provided in the fy2006 appropriations law crs8 b not all subaccount amounts for the tenantbased rental assistance account were initially specified in the yearlong cr pl 1105 only the total amount the voucher renewal amount and the rental subsidy reserve amount were specified the remainder of the subaccounts were presumably funded at their fy2006 level however if funded at the fy2006 level the sum of the setasides would not have equaled the total provided to the account 15905 million compared to 15920 million the fy2007 supplemental appropriations act pl 11028 amended the fy2007 yearlong cr to provide 1282 million for administrative fees compared to the fy2006 level of 1238 million and 149 million for tenantprotection vouchers compared to the fy2006 level of 178 million c the fy2007 yearlong cr specified an amount for this account d this account includes an advance appropriation provided for use in the next fiscal year in fy2007 the advance provided for fy2008 4193 million was 7 million less than the advance available from fy2006 4200 million this leaves 7 million more available in fy2007 than would have been available if the advances had been equal as they had been in recent years this 7 million was not allocated in the fy2007 appropriations law leaving the discretion to hud as to how to use the funds it is unclear how those funds were allocated for more information see discussion under heading advance appropriation below the setasides within this account total to 16436 7 million less than the amount shown here the reason for the discrepancy involves the treatment of an advance appropriation as noted in table note d in fy2007 4193 million was provided in advance appropriations for fy2008 in fy2008 the conferees proposed providing 4200 million for fy2009 the difference between the two amounts 7 million would not have been available until fy2009 and was therefore not included in the total for more information see discussion under heading advance appropriation below f the setasides within this account total to 16426 million 35 million more than the total for the account shown here the reason for the discrepancy involves the treatment of an advance appropriation the advance appropriation provided in fy2007 for use in fy2008 was 4193 million while the amount provided in fy2008 for use in fy2009 was 4158 million the difference between the two amounts 35 million is available for use in fy2008 but is not considered new budget authority authorized by the appropriations act so it is not included in the total for the account for more information see discussion under heading advance appropriation below g the amount actually available for renewals is 723 million less than the amount shown here 13971 because the enacted appropriations law includes rescission of 723 million in advance appropriations provided in fy2007 for use in fy2008 because of the way that congress designed the allocation formula that reduction will be taken from renewal funds see discussion under the heading voucher renewals below advance appropriation each year for the past several years the tenant based rental assistance account has included an advance appropriation generally congress provides the account with new budget authority equal to an amount of funding available to be used in the current fiscal year as well as an advance appropriation to be used in the subsequent fiscal year and each year the amount of budget authority newly available for the account is equal to the amount of funding provided for use in the current fiscal year plus the advance appropriation provided in the previous fiscal year for most years the advance available from the prior year and the advance that is provided for the subsequent year has been the same 42 billion as result the new budget authority for the tenantbased rental assistance account has equaled the budget authority newly available for the account each fiscal year for example as shown in table 4 the fy2006 appropriations act authorized 11374 million in new budget authority for use in fy2006 and 4200 million in new budget authority for use in fy2007 and 4200 million provided in fy2005 became newly available in fy2006 crs9 however in fy2007 congress provided only 4193 million in advance appropriations for use in fy2008 less than the 42 billion that became available in fy2007 from the fy2006 appropriation as result in fy2007 the amount of new budget authority authorized in fy2007 was less than the budget authority newly available for fy2007 by 7 million as shown in the fy2007 column of table 4 15920 million in new budget authority was authorized by the fy2007 law while 15927 million was budget authority newly available to be obligated in fy2007 as shown in table 3 the fy2007 appropriations act directed hud how to allocate only 15920 million of the 15927 million available for allocation it is unclear how hud chose to allocate the remaining 7 million again for fy2008 congress provided less advance appropriations for use in the subsequent year 4158 million provided in fy2008 for use in fy2009 than was provided in the prior year 4193 million provided in fy2007 for use in fy2008 as result the new budget authority authorized in fy2008 16931 million is less than the budget authority newly available in fy2008 16426 million see the fy2008 column of table 4 unlike the fy2007 appropriation law the fy2008 appropriations law allocates the full amount of the budget authority newly available in fy2008 the amount provided in fy2008 plus the advance from fy2007 however the fy2008 appropriations act also contains rescission of 723 million from the advance provided in fy2007 for use in fy2008 see the fy2008 adjusted column of table 4 this reduction will be taken from the amount available for

assistance funding is dedicated to voucher renewals congress has authorized the creation of more than 2 million vouchers over the history of the program and the funding for virtually all of them expires every year since fy2004 congress has made changes each year in the way that hud distributes voucher renewal funding to phas for more information see crs report rl33929 recent changes to section 8 housing voucher renewal funding by maggie mccarty several voucher reform proposals have also been considered that would alter the statutory formula for distributing voucher funds although none has been enacted even if they were enacted language included in appropriations bills could potentially override statutory formula changes for more information see crs report rl34002 section 8 housing choice voucher program issues and reform proposals in the 110th congress by maggie mccarty the fy2007 yearlong cr did not adopt the same allocation formula that was in place in fy2006 in fy2006 phas were funded on the basis of what they had received in fy2005 with some adjustments including for inflation and some first time voucher renewals and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated for fy2007 congress directed hud to fund phas on the basis of their actual leasing and costs from the previous 12 months adjusted for inflation and for the cost of the firsttime renewal of tenantprotection vouchers and vouchers set aside for project based use and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated moving to work mtw demonstration agencies were funded on the basis of their mtw agreements subject to proration several other categories of agencies also received modified funding allocation including certain katrinaaffected phas phas under administrative or judicial receiverships and phas that spent more than their funding allocation of the amount provided for renewals 100 million was set aside to adjust the budgets of agencies that 1 had experienced an increase in voucher costs due to unforeseen circumstances or portability1 and 2 were adversely affected by the formula change and risked losing vouchers the formula contained in the yearlong cr was similar to the one in place in fy2004 in his fy2008 budget the president requested that phas receive renewal funding using formula similar to the one in place in fy2006 specifically the president requested that phas be funded on the basis of what they received in fy2007 adjusted for inflation the costs of deposits to escrow accounts and the first time renewal of tenant protection vouchers and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated mtw agencies would be funded pursuant to their agreements subject to proration the presidents budget also requested that 100 million be set aside for additional rental subsidy needs resulting from unforeseen circumstances and to make portability adjustments the housepassed version of hr 3074 would have provided 147 billion for voucher renewals in fy2008 similar to the presidents requested formula the house bill would have allocated renewal funds on the basis of what phas received 1 portability is the term used to describe familys ability to move from the jurisdiction of one pha to another pha while maintaining their voucher assistance if family moves to more expensive community pha can face increased voucher costs crs11 in fy2007 plus inflation the bill would have further adjusted phas allocations to account for costs related to family self sufficiency fss escrow accounts the first time renewal of hope vi vouchers and vouchers set aside for projectbased contracts and would have prorated the allocations to fit within the amount appropriated mtw agencies were to be funded on the basis of their mtw agreements the bill would have required the secretary to notify agencies of their budgets within 45 days of enactment the secretary would have been permitted to set aside up to 75 million to provide agencies with additional rental subsidy funding in response to unforeseen exigencies as determined by the secretary or the cost of portability the bill would have continued to prohibit phas from using more than their authorized number of vouchers practice called overleasing the house committee report hrept 110238 noted that the committee chose not to use updated data for allocating fy2008 renewal funding because hud delayed allocating fy2007 funding under the new formula and therefore the committee wanted to give phas additional time to adjust to their fy2007 allocations before changing the formula again the senatepassed version of hr 3074 would have provided 149 billion for voucher renewals in fy2008 similar to the fy2007 yearlong cr the funding would have been allocated on the basis of phas most recent 12 months of leasing and cost data adjusted for inflation and the first time renewal of tenant protection or hope vi vouchers or vouchers set aside for projectbased commitment under the senate bill mtw agencies would have been funded subject to their agreements and as under the yearlong cr the same three categories of agencies would have been funded using different allocation formula first certain katrinaaffected agencies would have been funded on the basis of the higher of what they would have received under the fy2008 formula or what they received in fy2007 although phas would have been required to submit plans detailing how they could effectively use any additional funds within 12 months second agencies that would have lost funding under the fy2008 formula and had been put in receivership within the prior 24 months would have been funded on the basis of the higher amount they received in fy2007 as long as they submitted spending plan third agencies that spent more in fy2007 than their fy2007 allocation plus their unspent voucher and administrative fee balances from fy2006 would have been funded on the basis of what they received in fy2007 all allocations were to be prorated to fit within the amount appropriated and the secretary would have been required to notify phas of their budgets within 90 days of enactment the senatepassed version of hr 3074 would also have permitted the secretary to set aside up to 100 million to adjust the allocations of phas with significant increases in renewal costs due to unforeseen circumstances or increased portability costs or to adjust the allocations for phas that could face loss of voucher units due to the use of updated leasing and cost data like the house bill the senate bill would have continued the prohibition on overleasing the committee report srept 110131 noted that the committee continued the fy2007 formula because the committee believed that it would provide an efficient method to capture actual costs incurred by phas administering the voucher program including variations in rental markets crs12 the conference agreement hrept 110446 would have provided funding level for voucher renewals lower than either the house or senate bill similar to the senate bill it would have distributed funds on the basis of leasing and cost data but rather than using the most recent data the bill would have directed the secretary to use data from the most recent federal fiscal year the formula would have made adjustments for fss costs renewal of tenant protection or hope vi vouchers and vouchers setaside for projectbased commitments pha budgets would then have been adjusted for inflation and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated the conference agreement included the same adjustments for katrinaaffected agencies agencies in receivership and agencies that spent beyond their allocation that were included in the fy2007 yearlong cr and the senate bill it would have funded mtw agencies on the basis of their agreements and would have continued the prohibition on overleasing the conference agreement would also have permitted the secretary to set aside up to 50 million to adjust agency allocations for significant increases in costs due to portability or for agencies who had increased their voucher use indicated by leasing rates at the end of the calendar year that exceeded the 12 month average used in the formula under pl 110161 phas initial allocations will be determined using the same formula as in the conference agreement prior to proration however each agencys allocation will then be reduced by the amount by which their unusable restricted reserve accounts2 exceed 7 of the total they received in fy2007 once those reduced allocations are made hud is to prorate the amount provided to each pha to fit within the amount provided for renewals 14695 million reduced by 723 million the amount that the law rescinds from the advance appropriation provided in fy2007 for use in fy2008 given the reduction in the advance appropriation the total amount of new budget authority available for tenantbased renewals in fy2008 is 13 971 million if the aggregate amount of phas unusable restricted reserve accounts total less than 723 million the proration level in fy2008 will be higher administrative fees prior to fy2004 phas were paid fixed fee per voucher administered beginning in fy2004 at congress direction hud changed the way it distributed administrative fees providing agencies with prorata share of the amount appropriated for administrative fees on the basis of what they had received in the previous year the change was designed to contain the cost of administrative fees which were estimated to have grown to account for 10 of the cost of voucher the fy2007 yearlong cr did not initially specify an amount for administrative fees so they were funded at their fy2006 level 1238 million the fy2007 supplemental appropriations law pl 11028 amended the yearlong cr to increase funding for administrative fees to the amount requested by the president for fy2007 1281 million for fy2008 the president requested 1351 million for administrative fees and asked that 5 million be set aside for incentive bonuses for phas that voluntarily consolidated with each other the presidents budget also requested the authority to allocate administrative fee funding on the basis of the 2 restricted reserves are reserves that exceed the amount of funding needed by the agency to lease its full number of authorized vouchers crs13 number of families assisted by phas as opposed to the prorata allocation that has been in place in recent years both house and senatepassed versions of hr 3074 would have funded administrative fees at 1351 million and would have permitted the secretary to set aside up to 5 million for incentive bonuses for phas that voluntarily consolidate as requested in the presidents budget both bills would have directed the secretary to allocate administrative fees to phas on the basis of the perunit fee schedule that was used each year prior to fy2004 prorated to fit within the amount appropriated or in the house bill supplemented by recaptured or unobligated balances both bills would also have permitted the secretary to set aside up to 35 million for phas that needed additional fees the conference agreement would have funded administrative fees at the same level as the house and senate bills 1351 million using the same formula and with the same 35 million setaside like the house bill the conference agreement would have allowed hud to supplement administrative fees with other funds unlike the house and senate bills the conference agreement did not contain the 5 million consolidation bonus requested by the president pl 110161 adopts the conference agreement funding level and allocation requirements except that it does not contain language allowing the secretary to supplement administrative fee funding nor does it contain language directing the secretary to prorate phas allocations to fit within the amount appropriated tenant protection vouchers tenant protection vouchers are provided to families in variety of circumstances including families who are threatened with displacement because the contract on their assisted unit is ending projectbased section 8 for example families who are displaced from public housing due to demolition or disposition families in the witness protection program and families in the child welfare system including youth transitioning from foster care through the family unification program the fy2007 yearlong cr did not initially specify an amount for tenant protection vouchers so they were funded at their fy2006 level 178 million the fy2007 supplemental appropriations law pl 11028 amended the yearlong cr to reduce the amount for tenant protection vouchers to 149 million for fy2008 the president requested 150 million for tenant protection vouchers and requested the authority to supplement the appropriated funds with funds recaptured from unobligated balances both house and senatepassed versions of hr 3074 would have funded tenant protection vouchers at the presidents request the house bill would have authorized the secretary to use unobligated or recaptured balances from the housing certificate fund or the projectbased rental assistance account if the funding provided was not sufficient to cover the costs of tenantprotection vouchers both bills would have directed the secretary to provide tenant protection vouchers for all units that are eligible rather than just occupied units as has been the administrations recent practice crs14 pl 110161 like the conference agreement provides 200 million for tenant protection vouchers and directs the secretary to provide tenant protection vouchers for all units that were occupied within the 24 months prior to their eligibility for voucher incremental vouchers incremental is the term used to describe new vouchers available to serve additional families new incremental vouchers have been funded since fy2002 outside of replacement tenant protection vouchers the housepassed version of hr 3074 would have provided 30 million for new incremental vouchers for nonelderly disabled families affected by the designation of their housing units as elderlyonly if all 30 million were not needed for this purpose the funds were to be used to provide up to 1000 supportive housing vouchers for homeless veterans under joint hudveterans administration initiative hudvash discussed later in this report under homeless assistance grants the senatepassed version of hr 3074 would have provided 105 million for incremental vouchers of that amount 30 million would have been for new family unification program fup vouchers which are used to help reunite families involved in the child welfare system or help youth transitioning out of foster care the remaining 75 million would have been used to fund hudvash vouchers the conference agreement reflected combination of the house and senate proposals for incremental vouchers it would have provided 135 million 30 million for nonelderly disabled families affected by the designation of their housing units as elderly only if not needed for this purpose they could be used for other non elderly disabled families 75 million for hudvash vouchers and 30 million for family unification program vouchers pl 110161 is similar to the conference agreement but provides less funding specifically the law provides 125 million for incremental vouchers 30 million for nonelderly disabled families affected by the designation of their housing units as elderly only if not needed for this purpose they could be used for other nonelderly disabled families 75 million for hudvash vouchers and 20 million for family unification program vouchers section 8 projectbased rental assistance this account provides funding to administer and renew existing projectbased section 8 rental assistance contracts between hud and private landlords under those contracts hud provides subsidies to units owned by private landlords that allow eligible lowincome families to live in the units but pay only 30 of their incomes toward rent new contracts have been entered into under this program since the early 1980s when the program was active congress funded the contracts for 2040 year periods so the monthly payments for landlords came from old appropriations however once those contracts expire if they are renewed they require new annual appropriations this account funds contract renewals

is to be made available to fund renewals this amount may be reduced in order to increase funding for contract administrators see table note d below d the bill specifies that the secretary could designate less than 239 million and more than 286 million for contract administrators renewals for fy2008 the presidents budget requested that congress fund projectbased contract renewals at about 300 million less than the fy2007 level and permit the secretary to supplement the funding with recaptured funds from older expiring contracts questions were raised about the adequacy of the presidents request for renewals because of problems within the program during fy2007 towards the end of fy2007 july 2007 hud stopped issuing monthly payments to property owners with projectbased section 8 contracts at the time hud stated that they lacked sufficient funding to make payments on their existing contracts they stated that the problem arose because huds legal counsel had determined that hud could longer obligate partial funding when they entered into 12month contract renewal with property owner which had been their past practice omb and hud worked together to identify sufficient funding to resume payments to landlords for the remainder of fy2007 including retroactive payments and hud modified its contracts to indicate that funding may not be set aside for the full length of the contract this practice of shortfunding contracts was the subject of hearing before the house financial services committee at that hearing hud official testified that hud should have sufficient funding in its request to get through crs16 the end of fy2008 if the presidents requested funding level is provided3 however increased appropriations may be necessary in fy2009 the housepassed version of hr 3074 proposed to increase funding for renewals by over 700 million the committee report expressed concern about huds ability to estimate the actual renewal needs in the account and it directed the secretary to report back to the committee with the findings of review of future contract renewal needs and to include such an analysis in the fy2009 congressional budget justifications the senatepassed version proposed to fund renewals at the presidents request permitting the secretary to supplement the appropriation with recaptures as necessary it also would have required the secretary to report back to the committee on the status of projectbased contracts pl 110161 as also proposed by the conference agreement funds project based renewals at about 600 million above the presidents requested and senate passed level but about 100 million below the housepassed level the joint explanatory statement directs hud and omb to determine whether shortfunding contracts are violation of the antideficiency act and if so to report back to the appropriations committee and begin issuing 12month contracts subject to the availability of appropriations the law also directs the secretary to submit report on the status of projectbased contracts to the committee similar to the senate bill and conference agreement contract administrators contract administrators are subcontracted by hud to manage the contracts between landlords and the department hud formerly administered all of the contracts directly but has set goal to transfer all contract administration to subcontractors the presidents fy2008 budget requested 96 increase in appropriations for contract administrators huds congressional budget justifications indicate that this funding increase was necessary in order to maintain the same level of service provided in fy2005 and fy2006 when the appropriations were supplemented by recaptured funds the justifications noted that hud obligated almost 265 million for contract administrators in fy2006 even though only 146 million was provided in appropriations for fy2008 the justifications indicated that additional funding would not be available from recaptured funds so all of the account needs would have to be met through new appropriations the housepassed version of hr 3074 would have authorized the secretary to provide less than 239 million for contract administrators and more than 286 million the presidents requested level the senatepassed version would have funded contract administrators at the presidents requested level both bills would have

the conference agreement includes the house proposal for contract administrator funding housing certificate fund rescission the two section 8 programs tenantbased rental assistance and projectbased rental assistance were previously funded under joint account called the housing certificate fund hcf the hcf was split by the fy2005 appropriations law although the account still retains funding from prior years appropriations for longterm section 8 contracts each year the administration makes available for rescission an amount it estimates will be available from unobligated or recaptured section 8 funds within the hcf in recent years there has been some controversy surrounding whether or not there are sufficient unobligated balances in the hcf to meet the rescission if hud cannot meet the rescission from the hcf it has the authority to take the funds from other accounts the fy2007 yearlong cr rescinded 165 billion from the hcf the presidents fy2008 budget requested that congress rescind 13 billion from the hcf the housepassed version of hr 3074 included 13 billion rescission from the hcf the same as the presidents request the senatepassed version included rescission of 11 billion from this account the conference agreement would have rescinded 125 billion pl 110161 rescinds 125 billion as proposed in the conference agreement it permits hud to use funds from other accounts to meet the rescission but requires the secretary to notify the appropriations committees 30 days in advance if any funds were being taken from other accounts in order to meet the rescission public housing the public housing program provides publicly owned and subsidized rental units for very lowincome families although new public housing developments have been built for many years congress continues to provide funds to the more than 3100 public housing authorities phas that own and maintain the existing stock of more than 12 million units through the operating fund hud provides

is estimated to result in proration level of just over 80 for more information see crs report rs22557 public housing fact sheet on the new operating fund formula by maggie mccarty both house and senatepassed versions of hr 3074 would have provided 200 million more than the presidents request for the operating fund the senate bill would also have given hud the authority requested in the presidents budget to set aside 6 million to provide technical assistance funds to aid phas in their transition to assetbased management4 the house committee report hrept 110 238 noted that the committee did not provide the assetmanagement setaside because it did not believe that hud should receive technical assistance funds if hud is not providing such technical assistance funds to phas the report also would have directed the hud inspector general to investigate the implementation of asset based management and report back to the committee by march 15 2008 pl 110161 as proposed in the conference agreement funds the operating fund at the house and senate level 42 billion and includes the asset management setaside requested by the president administrative provisions included in the law similar to provisions in the senate bill would exempt certain small phas from asset management requirements and limit hud from implementing certain asset management requirements related to costs capital fund for fy2008 the president proposed 400 million reduction in funding for the capital fund about 35 million of that reduction comes from changes in the amount requested for setasides within the account the budget proposed to eliminate funding for resident opportunities for supportive services ross grants neighborhood networks technology grants and emergency funding it also proposed an increase for technical assistance and physical and financial assessments the majority of the capital fund reduction would have come from the formula grants that hud provides to phas to use to modernize their public housing the departments congressional budget justifications indicated that one of huds priorities is to support alternative financing of public housing for example using federal public housing funding to leverage private investment the justifications also noted that the department is undertaking modernization needs study and will develop protocol to measure the performance of phas in meeting modernization needs including incentives for phas that excel in modernizing the stock with limited capital fund resources 4 beginning in fy2007 phas are required to begin converting to assetbased management type of decentralized administration of their public housing programs implementation of this requirement has been controversial crs20 both house and senatepassed versions of hr

request and the senate bill would have provided almost 500 million above the presidents request the senate committee report included provision that would have required hud to conduct new capital needs assessment cna on the public housing stock and report back to the committee by june 30 2008 with its results pl 110161 as proposed in the conference agreement funds the capital fund at the housepassed

justifications hope vi each year since fy2004 the president has requested that congress provide new funds for the hope vi program although each year the congress has continued to fund the program the department has argued that the program has largely met its goal of eliminating the worst public housing and that it has backlog of unspent funds that needs to be addressed since fy2005 the president has also requested that congress rescind the funds it provided for the program in previous years before they are awarded to grantees although congress has not approved such rescission the fy2008

revitalization program background funding and issues by maggie mccarty both house and senatepassed versions of hr 3074 would have provided funding for the hope vi program and neither bill would have

conference agreement would have adopted the housepassed funding level 120 million pl 110161 funds the program at 100 million for fy2008 and setsaside 24 million for technical assistance the joint explanatory statement notes that the account contains unspent technical assistance funds and it directs the secretary to focus unobligated and unexpended technical assistance funds on pre2001 grantees

for the program for fy2008 and argued that activities of this account are best performed under the cdbg or home programs neither the house nor senate agreed that the rural housing and economic

activities undertaken through the community development block grant program in addition the cdf has funded other community developmentrelated programs in past years including the economic development initiatives and neighborhood initiative demonstrations the cdbg program is the largest source of federal assistance in support of the housing community and economic development activities of state and local governments the presidents fy2008 budget recommendation of 2975 billion for the formula portion of cdbg was 736 million 20 less than the 3711 billion appropriated for distribution to communities and states in fy20075 in addition the presidents budget request stated that the administration would seek to reform the cdbg program during the 110th congress but at the end of the first session formal legislative proposal had been introduced in the house or the senate during the 109th congress the administration unveiled proposal that would have restructured the cdbg distribution formula the legislative proposal the community development block grant reform act of 2006 which was not formally introduced during the 109th congress included the following changes 5 the largest share of cdbg money 70 is distributed to entitlement communities units of local government that meet specified threshold criteria the other 30 is allocated among the states crs24 replacement of the dual cdbg formula with single weighted formula that targeted assistance on the basis of the following factors communitys or states share of households living in poverty excluding college students number of femaleheaded households with minor children number of overcrowded housing units number of housing units 50 years or older occupied by lowincome families and per capita income hud would longer have allocated funds to entitlement communities and states using 7030 formula allocation split instead states and entitlement community allocations would have been drawn from single pool of funds entitlement communities would have been required to meet minimum grant threshold in order to receive direct annual allocation communities that failed to meet the minimum grant amount could have joined with their urban county creating new combined entitlement community or could have had their data included in the state totals twoyear transition would have been established for communities that longer met the minimum grant threshold amount hud would have been directed to establish set of performance measures and accountability standards 200 million bonus grant program dubbed the economic development and revitalization challenge grant would have been established to reward entitlement communities with programs resulting in improved living conditions in distressed neighborhoods in addition to reduced funding for cdbg formula grants the administrations fy2008 budget proposed eliminating funding for several other community development related programs including rural housing and economic development grants community development block grant section 108 loan guarantees and brownfields economic development initiatives the budget characterized these programs as duplicative of the activities funded by the cdbg formula grant program the housepassed version of hr 3074 and its accompanying report hrept 110238 recommended an appropriation of 3936 billion for cdbg formula grant activities this was 225 million above the appropriation for fy2007 961 million more than the administration request and 231 million more than the amount in the senatepassed version of the bill the report accompanying the house bill rejected the administrations consolidation proposal and included language that would have prohibited hud from using appropriated funds for its proposed economic development and revitalization challenge grant the senate bill and its accompanying report srept 110131 also rejected the administrations consolidation proposal the bill would have provided 6 million less for cdbg formula grants than the 3711 billion appropriated in fy2007 the senate report did not reference the challenge grant the conference agreement included 4 billion in community development fund assistance including 3790 billion for cdbg activities of this amount 3723 billion would be appropriated for cdbg formula grants 62 million for indian tribes 3 million for technical assistance and 16 million would be transferred to the working capital fund the conference agreements proposed cdbg formula allocation 3723 billion was 12 million crs25 more than appropriated for fy2007 18 million more than recommended by the senate and 748 million more than requested by the administration but 213 million less than that recommended by the house6 section 232 of the general provisions of the conference agreement would have extended cdbg entitlement status to two illinois communities the population of both communities falls short of the 50000 person threshold required to be defined as metropolitan city entitled to direct formulabased allocation of funds specifically alton and granite city illinois 2006 populations were 20000 persons less than the population threshold needed to meet the statutory definition of metropolitan city found at 42 usc 5302 the net effect of the provision if enacted would be that the two cities would gain direct control over portion of funds previously awarded to madison county illinois the county in which they are located this in turn would reduce the total amount controlled by the county government but not the total amount of cdbg funds allocated within the county boundaries the provisions other potential impact is that it would create precedent that other small metropolitan cities may point to in their efforts to secure direct cdbg funding provisions of hr 3074 were incorporated into the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 hr 2764 that was signed by the president on december 26 2007 as pl 110161 the statute includes the provision that grants entitlement status to the cities of alton and granite city illinois the act appropriates 3866 billion for cdf activities which is 25 more than the 3772 billion appropriated for fy2007 the

fund these programs at 735 million the housepassed version of hr 3074 would have provided the same amount that was appropriated in fy2007 the presidents fy2008 budget proposal would have reduced funding for elderly housing programs by almost 160 million nearly 29 from the fy2007 level to 575 million this reduction would have affected new capital grants and project rental assistance in the section 202 program hud estimated that this level of funds for fy2008 would support 3100 new units of section 202 housing down from the estimated 4994 units for fy2007 of the 735 million appropriated for section 202 and related programs in pl 110161 60 million is appropriated for the service coordinator program the same amount contained in the senatepassed version of hr 3074 as well as the conference agreement and 9 million more than the 51 million that was appropriated in fy2007 the house had proposed 59 million for service coordinators in its version of hr 3074 whereas the presidents budget proposed to increase funding to 71 million congress appropriated nearly 25 million for the assisted living conversion program in pl 110161 the amount is approximately the same as the fy2007 appropriation each of the funding proposals leading up to the passage of the consolidated appropriations act the housepassed version of hr 3074 the senatepassed version of hr 3074 the conference agreement and the presidents budget would have appropriated the same amount for the assisted living conversion program the administrations budget had proposed to allocate 25 million to leveraging financing demonstration program for section 202 housing through the program hud would work with private sector professionals to increase the use of mixed financing arrangements such as the lowincome housing tax credit to develop section 202 housing huds goal is that the program would leverage one dollar of outside financing for every dollar of section 202 funding neither the house nor senate versions of hr 3074 recommended funding for the demonstration program in their reports hrept 110238 and srept 110131 both appropriations committees noted that hud may already use section 202 funds in conjunction with other programs to create mixed financing developments the conference report did not discuss the proposed demonstration program and the consolidated appropriations act did not contain funds for the program the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act provides 237 million for the section 811 housing for persons with disabilities program slightly more than the 2366 million that was appropriated in fy2007 the house and senatepassed versions of hr 3074 as well as the conference agreement hrept 110446 all proposed to fund the section 811 program at the level eventually appropriated in pl 110161 the presidents budget for fy2008 like that for fy2007 had proposed to cut funding for the section 811 housing for persons with disabilities program nearly in half from just under 237 million to 125 million none of the five funding recommendations the presidents budget house and senatepassed versions of crs37 hr 3074 the conference agreement and pl 110161 specified funds for new section 811 housing vouchers however pl 110161 provides 30 million for vouchers for nonelderly disabled families through the section 8 tenantbased rental assistance account like its proposal for the section 202 program the administrations budget for section 811 would have provided funds 15 million for leveraging financing demonstration program under the proposal hud would work with professionals in the private sector to develop mixed financing arrangements for section 811 projects using the lowincome housing tax credit as well as other funding sources congress did not provide funds for this
