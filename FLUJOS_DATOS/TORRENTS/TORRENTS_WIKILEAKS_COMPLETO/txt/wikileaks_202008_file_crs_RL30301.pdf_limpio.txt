and in such diverse ways as to stimulate questions about their purposes organization operations funding status and relationship with organizations and interests outside of congress such questions about informal member groups are addressed in this report based on examination of the more than 200 such groups that now exist or have existed in the past decade historically most unofficial member organizations have been informal networks of members and staff with separate personnel office space or funding these groups have operated without any specific externally imposed rules or any direct congressional oversight however the house and bicameral member groups that were recognized as legislative service organizations lsos from 1979 through 1994 were governed by committee orders promulgated by the committee on house administration legislative service organizations tended to have more institutionalized character typically lsos employed separate staff occupied space in house office buildings prepared and distributed legislative analyses and other reports on regular basis and for financial and other operational support relied on participating members use of their official resources within the house the senate committee on rules and administration has never adopted any comparable regulations which provide for senators using their allowances to support informal groups in that body provision prohibiting the establishment or continuation of any legislative service organization as defined and authorized in the one hundred third congress was passed in the house on january 4 1995 as part of house rules package for the 104th congress as result the groups formerly designated as lsos lost that status and the special administrative arrangements that were accorded them eg financial support separate house office space and staff etc however former lsos were allowed to convert their operations into informal networks of members with separate personnel office space or funding if they chose to become congressional member organizations cmos they were required to register as such with what is now the committee on house administration under regulations adopted by the committee on house administration an informal group whose members want to formally share official resources eg staff in pursuit of the groups legislative objectives must register as cmo with the house

the conference of great lakes congressmen organized in 1970 in addition there were few state delegations which met to share information and to mobilize support for choice committee assignments there were also few social clubs eg the acorns and the chowder and marching society which by virtue of their purely social nature are not part of this analysis 2crs report rl30288 informal congressional groups and member organizations 106th congress an informational directory by sula p richardsoninformal congressional groups and members organizations selected questions and responses introduction in 1970 there were probably fewer than dozen informal congressional groups and member organizations only four of them were organized on basis similar to current practice1 in 1999 at least 185 such groups also referred to as congressional caucuses and ad hoc coalitions existed2 number of questions arise when considering the possible establishment of an informal congressional group and the factors and options relevant to its operation this report addresses 12 aspects of informal group formation and operation including ones pertinent to groups registered with the committee on house administration as congressional member organizati ons cmos and groups formerly designated as legislative service organizations lsos the information provided is in way intended to substitute for directives findings or any other information available from the congressional committees with primary jurisdiction over the groups accordingly questions regarding the operations organization and propriety of these groups should be directed to the following committees house commit tee on house administration house committee on standards of official conduct senate committee on rules and administration and senate committee on ethics political science literature sometimes refers to informal congressional groups and member organizations as congressional caucuses that term previously was used collectively to refer to all unofficial member groups in congress including groupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs2 3prior to the 104th congress 19951997 the terms congressional member organizations informal groups and congressional caucuses were used almost interchangeably initially the term informal groups was the most commonly used however by the early 1980s the institutionalized nature of some of the groups and the regulation of those recognized as legislative service organizations lsos by the house administration committee apparently led some political observers to prefer the term congressional caucuses by the late 1980s the term congressional member organizations cmos was being used more frequently it helped to distinguish unofficial groups from official party caucuses of members also called caucus by house democrats and conference by senate democrats and by republicans in both houses as well as from the alliances of citizens only and citizens and members that may also be called caucuses thus prior to 1995 the term cmo referred to all unofficial member groups including those designated as legislative service organizations indeed some political observers used an even broader definition of the term cmo such that it included the official party groups as well see for example congressional information services congressional member organizations caucuses 1993 publications and policy materials p 3 however pursuant to rules promulgated by the committee on house oversight now named committee on house administration on february 8 1995 the term congressional member organization as expressly defined referred solely to groups registered with the committee regulations which became effective august 1 1999 supersede all previous cmo regulations according to staff at the committee on house administration the concept of recognizing cmos as informal groups which are registered with the committee remains consequently for the purposes of this report the term cmo is used solely to refer to those groups groups not registered as cmos are referred to as informal groups and the terms member organizations member groups or member alliances may refer to cmos and informal groups separately or combined depending upon context 4arthur stevens susan hammond and daniel p mulhollan changes in decisionmaking networks in the congressional system an examination of the role of informal

shifting meanings of caucus the term congressional caucus is not used beyond this point in this report 1 what are the differences among informal groups congressional member organizations and legislative service organization s informal groups have been defined as voluntary associations of members of congress without direct recognition in chamber or party rules or line item appropriat ions which seek to have role in the policy process4 this definition distinguishes these unofficial groups from the official party caucuses of members called caucus by house democrats and conference by senate democrats and by republicans in both houses5 and from member groups of purely social nature eg the acorns and the chowder and marching society the unofficial status

exact number but at least 195 were operating in february 20016 specific limit has ever been set on the number of these groups that may exist the term congre ssional member organization cmo refers to group of members who join together in pursuit of common legislative objectives who register with the committee on house administration and who formally share official resources in particular sharing staff or coordinating their expenses to jointly carry out activities any group that wishes to formally share official resources must register with the house administration committee as cmo groups that view cmo status as an enhancement of their legitimacy or as beneficial in other ways eg openness or publicity may also register as cmos even though formal sharing of official resources occurs or is envisioned by group members in regulations adopted by the committee on house administration on june 22 1999 effective august 1 1999 cmo has separate corporate or legal identity is not an employing authority may not be assigned separate office space may not use the frank may not have independent web pages and may not accept goods funds or services from private organiza tions or individuals to support the cmo7 further the regulations require that upon registration at the beginning of each congress and as changes in information warrant each cmo provide to the house administration committee the cmos name statement of purpose names and titles of officers and the names of staff designated to work on the cmos issues thus like the groups formerly recognized as lsos cmos are governed by regulations developed expressly for them and they must register with the house administration committee however members may not contribute funds from theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs4 8funding

activities8 the term legislative service organization lso9 refers to now defunct set of unofficial member organizations which from 1979 through 1994 were recognized and regulated by the committee on house administration the committee recognized as lsos those house and bicameral groups that met and maintained the organizational financial and operational requirements prescribed by the committee in regulations it adopted in 1979 1981 and 1993 the senate committee on rules and administration has never accorded any comparable recognition or administrative arrangement to senate groups in 1994 28 of the 140 member organizations confirmed as operational were certified as lsos although the committee on house administration never placed specific limit on the number of lsos that could exist the committee could and sometimes did decline to accept or approve the applications of groups seeking recognition as lsos typically lsos had the advantages of employing staff or having clerkhire staff assigned to them from members administrative funds occupying space in house office buildings preparing and distributi ng legislative analyses and other reports on regular basis and for financial and other support relying on members payment of funds from their official allowances dues or expenses paid from house resources to sustain their operations on january 4 1995 the house agreed to provision which prohibited the establishment or continuation of any legislative service organization as defined and authorized in the one hundred third congress10 the house directed what is now the committee on house administration to take such steps as are necessary to ensure an orderly termination and accounting for funds of any legislative service organization in existence on january 3 199511 former lsos however were allowed to convert their operations into informal groups with separate staff office space or official funding they could also choose to become cmos by registering with what is now the house administration committee and meeting and maintaining the requirements for cmos set out in the committees regulations governing cmos since then lso status has not existed and the special administrative arrangements accorded groups recognized as lsos are longer available on that basis httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs5 12senator jennings randolph senate steel caucus productive group remarks in the senate congressional record vol 128 oct 1 1982 p 271342 what functions do informal groups and member organizations perform an informal group or congressional member organization may perform variety of functions in the policymaking process these functions may be categorized as 1 informational acquiring compiling coordinating and distributing information 2 legislative seeking congressional approval or promoting legislative proposals oversight or appropriation of funds and 3 casework and communications with constituen ts where the member acts on behalf of constituency and seeks to promote its interests these functions may overlap and group may be oriented toward any one or some combination of them the degree to which group performs any of these functions also varies informational common purpose of informal groups and member organizations is to collect and disseminate information both substantive and political some groups eg the former environmental and energy study conference have emphasized this role more than others some groups eg the house renewable energy and efficiency caucus and the house trails caucus have characterized themselves as informational and preclude themselves from taking positions on legislation others perform both legislative and information functions for example the congressional caucus on womens issues and thecongressional automotive caucus serve as resource centers and advocacy groups for legislation legislative several groups focus their activities on legislative proposals committee oversight and appropriation of funds they may concentrate on devising legislative proposals monitor and evaluate federal programs and agencies related to specific issues of their choosing prepare reports and disseminate information on issues of interest to them or conduct any combination of these functions number of groups also monitor executive branch operations some seek to influence the administration and government agencies to implement specific policy solutions for example in 1981 the senate steel caucus recommended that the commer ce department initiate trade complaints against european steel producers instead of waiting for the domestic industry to do so the commerce department adopted the caucus recommendation and on november 5 1981 made the historic announcement that it would initiate such complaints12 similarly other groups eg the congressional soybean caucus the house beef caucus and the senate jewelry task force monitor the activities of government agencies and coordinate their efforts with those agencies to protect domestic markets against foreign imports and unfair trade practices or to achieve other policy goals in 1990 the congressional caucus on womens issues was credited with having influenced the national institutes of health nih to implemen t two important changes 1 creation of federal office for research on womens health and 2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs6 13kent jenkins

research guidelines to ensure that future studies would devote more funds and effort to diseases that women contract13 casework and communications with const ituents some groups eg the congressional black caucus the congressional hispanic caucus the congression sportsmens caucus and the federal government service caucus provide representation for specific elements in national as well as members constituencies several groups prepare information and speech material which members have found useful others assist members in developing and conducting special events seminars and conferences on issues sometimes these events are held in the member s home districts and may enhance memberconstituent relations by increasing members visibility and identification with particular issues 3 what are the advantages and disadvantages of forming an informal congressional group or member organization advantages informal member alliances including cmos may be seen as advantageous because they can be readily established as circumstances and issues warrant without enacting legislation or changing house senate or party rules expand members opportunities to specialize on issues because neither the number of groups that can exist nor the number of group memberships that member can have are limited open or limit membership as they deem necessary to accomplish their goals serve as vehicle for the resolution of issue and policy differences between committees parties or the two houses provide an opportunity for comprehensive and coordinated approach to issues over which committee jurisdiction is unclear or fragmented serve as readily identifiable entities and provide means of access to congress for outside groups and individuals conduct briefings and use other means of information gathering to supply information to congress and interested segments of the public and enhance members relations and standing with particular constituencies disadvantages some disadvantages ascribed to informal congressional groups and member organizations arise from the perception that they compete with the formal leadership and committee structure and functions undermine or even impede the legislative process by further fragmenting decisionmaking have become so numerous that their significance has been diminished ie every cause or issue has group and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs7 14for further discussion on informal groups and the franking privilege see question 9 p 14may facilitate certain special interests in attaining undue attention in the legislative process in addition the proliferation of groups may raise questions of fair and equal representation of interests not represented by group create the perception of conflict of interest for members who may have formal legislative responsibilities within the same subject areas of the groups ie appearing to be an advocate and adjudicator of an issue at the same time and have negative impact on public opinion of congress by causing it to be viewed as overly influenced by special interests 4 what are the rules governing informal groups and congressional member organizations house in the house members of cmos and other informal groups must conduct their activities in accordance with other provisions in law the house ethics manual the congressional handbook and the rules of the house including house rule 43the house code of official conduct in general the assumption has been that unless otherwise specified the same regulatio ns applicable to house members as individuals also apply to their informal groups members are advised to contact the committee on house administr ation the franking commission and the office of advice and educati on of the committee on standards of official conduct for information and guidance all groups registered with the committee on house administration as congressional member organization s cmos are governed under regulations the committee adopted on june 22 1999 under house rules the committee has authority to promulgate such regulations without approval by the full house the regulations which became effective august 1 1999 provide that cmos have separate corporate or legal identity they may not have their own separate offices employ staff or accept goods funds or services from outside groups or individuals to support their operations furthermore members may not 1 make contributions to cmos from their official expenses allowances ie members representational allowances or 2 lend their frank to any cmo14 cmo member however is permitted to use staff and other resources under his or her control to assist the cmo with carrying out its legislative goals and objectives two or more members may each employ shared staffer to perform research and other duties in support of cmo ie shared staff all groups using shared staffing arrangement are required to register as cmos with the committee on house administration registration is optional for groups that do not have shared staff but some groups may choose to register because they see ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs8 15registration cmo regulations 1999 as an enhancement of the groups stature or perhaps as an indication of the groups openness each cmo is required to provide the following information to the committee at the time of registration and as changes in information warrant its name statement of purpose names and titles of officers and the names of staff designated to work on the cmos issues15 cmos activities must be conducted in accordance with the regulations of the committee on house administration senate historically the senate groups have been informal networks of members and staff contacts drawing upon resources available to senators for materials and services without any additional funding or staff because of their traditional nonofficial status and informal nature specific regulation of such groups has not been deemed necessary the assumption has been that these informal groups of members are collectively subject to the same regulations applicable to senators as individuals spelled out in the senate ethics manual the congressional handbook rules of the senate and the senate code of official conduct separate regulations expressly recognizing them and prescribing their operations have never been implemented in the senate internal rules number of groups have formulated certain decisions practices and procedures into bylaws or rules which prescribe their structure and operations but these rules have force outside the group typically groups rules specify any combination of the following elements the purposes of the group whether or not the group will advocate specific positions on issues eligibility criteria for membership structure of the group eg officers executive committe task forces manner of selecting officers responsibilities of officers manner of scheduling meetings voting requirements eg situations in which the entire membership the executive committee or certain members vote as well as the vote percentage required and the process for amending the bylaws 5 what is the procedure for setting up an informal group or cmo there is standardized procedure for establishing an informal group or congressional member organization cmo however few basic steps are often involved when such group is being established define the objective first clearly state the groups objectives what is its purpose determine the level of interest the founding members determines whether there is sufficient interest to warrant organizing the group number of methods may be used in making this determination these include informal discussions with colleagues communications with constituents individuals and organizations and the members personal judgement and interest httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs9 16under current house rules the jurisdiction of these two now defunct committees rests primarily with the committee on transportation and infrastructure military aspects of merchant marine and fisheries issues are currently under the jurisdiction of the committee on armed servicesthe extent to which an issue or interest is fragmented within the committee system may also be factor in an effort to bring the various aspects of an issue under one entity number of groups have been organized around issues which were widely dispersed among several committees and subcommittees consult prospective core members sometimes the organizing members selects few colleagues with an interest in the issue consults with them about the group and enlists their support in organizing it in many instances these members serve as the groups executive officers coordinators or sponsors and are the activists who lay the groups foundation and shape its policy this informal gathering of core members may occur before the group is actually established or shortly thereafter consider internal political concerns in an effort to avoid the appearance of rivalry or duplication with party or committee positions and policy group organizers may wish to consult with party and committee leadership or inform them of the intent to form the organization similar consideration may also be given to any existing groups which handle relevant aspects of the issues or policy organizers will likely want to give careful consideration to the groups name in order to avoid confusion with other existing entities whether formal or informal identify likely membership informal group membership is voluntary eligibility criteria for membership are determined by the group itself membership may be open to anyone who is willing to join or it may be limited to invitees only membership may be open to one party only or both parties one house only or both houses regions which share specific economic concerns districts or states which share common industry members who share personal characteristics members whose constituents share personal or occupational characteristics or members who share issue interests membership may also be based upon committee and subcommittee assignments for example the port caucus which existed from 1977 through 1988 consisted primarily of members of two house committeesthe merchant marine and public works committees16 similarly the membership lists of the committees and subcommittees with primary jurisdiction over the relevant issues can be used to identify prospective group members this procedure can provide an indication of whether how and by whom the issue is handled it may also identify some members who would either support or oppose the grouphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs10 17senator richard shelby senate air and space caucus remarks in the senate congressional record vol 134 feb 4 1988 p 1080seek necessary informati on and guidance the committee on house administration has issued specific regulations governing groups that register as cmos the regulations appear in the members congressional handbook1999 on pages 45 and 46 house members will undoubtedly want to thoroughly review these regulations additional copies may be obtained from the house administration committee or from the congressional research service furthermore house members may wish to contact the committee on house administration the house commission on congressional mailing standards also known as the franking commission the committee on standards of official conduct office of advice and education and any other authorities as appropriate for guidance senators may seek guidance from the committee on rules and administration and the senate ethics committee which have primary jurisdiction over senate informal groups to date specific regulations governing the operations of unofficial senate member organizations have been promulgated by the rules and administration committee the committee has never officially recognized informal groups conferred any special designation upon them or allowed them any special administrative arrangements notify or announce the groups formation there are instances where formation of an informal group has been announced on the house and senate floor in the congressional record by the media through press releases news articles newsletters television interviews etc and internally through circulation of dear colleague letters to members the dear colleague letter and announcement usually invite members to join the group and explain its goals anticipated activities and reasons for being formed sometimes notification of groups formation also includes language aimed at assuring that the group is not being established to supplant the structure or operations of any committee or party organizations for example in 1988 when announcing the formation of an air and space group senator stated that this organization cannot substitute for the senates formal committee process nor is it meant to instead it will facilitate the interaction of senators and their staffs aerospace contractors and aviation and spaceoriented public interest groups in an effort to become more informed and focused in regard to these very important issues17 register with the committee on house administ ration where appropriate under 1999 cmo regulations house groups whose members wish to formally share official resources eg staff must register with the committee on house administrati on the registration process involves providing the following information to the committee at the time of registration at the beginning of each congress and as changes in information warrant 1 the name of the group ie cmo 2 statement of the purpose of the cmo 3 the officers the cmo and 4 the names of designated staff who will work on cmo issues httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs11 6 how are informal groups and cmos structured each informal group whether cmo or not determines its own structure few groups are so informally organized that they have particular leaders however most groups have at least one identifiable leader who is designated either formally or informally as the groups chairman coordinator sponsor or president beyond that many organizations including most of those in the senate have little or formal structure often the founding member or members serve as the groups officers or coordina tors without formal election or designation leadership responsibili ties eg coordinating the groups activities scheduling meetings distributing information on group issues and actions etc are undertaken by members who volunteer and group business usually is handled by staff in an individual members office as part of their regular office duties several groups have structure which includes any combination of the following elements officers eg chairman cochairman vice chairmen secretary an executive committee alternatively called an executive board steering committee or advisory panel and subunits usually called task forces or working groups officers the chairman or coordinator usually is member who is highly interested in the issues around which the group is organized more often than not he or she steps forth to serve in that role or agrees to accept the position when recruited usually he or she also designates staff to serve as the key contact persons for the group and to provide assistance on group business most of the bipartisan or bicameral groups have had more than one coordinator or chairman ie cochairmen to emphasize the bipartisan and or bicameral aspect of their structure for example group might have two coordinators one from each party or the group might have chairman who may be member of either party in either house as well as senate cochairman and house cochairman while prescribing that all three officers cannot be members of the same party several groups have chairman vice chairman and secretary few organizations have opted for an even more stratified structure one which might include whips and an executive committee class groups ie freshmen in particular congress who organize as socio political force in each house usually have structure that includes president vice president and secretary most of the bicameral groups are also bipartisan and their structure usually reflects these characteristics thus many bicameral organizations require that the groups leadership be comprised of members from both parties and both houses current cmo regulations provide that members of both the house and senate mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs12 18membership cmo regulations 1999 participate in cmo but at least one of the officers of the cmo must be member of house18 executive committeesteering committeeadvisory board for most groups the officers andor executive committee administer the groups activities and set its agenda often the executive committee also serves as the groups source of expertise and it advises the group on certain issues an executive committee serving in this advisory capacity sometimes comprises members who serve on the committees and subcommittees with primary jurisdiction over the issues of concern to the group other bases for advisory or executive committee membership might be the members state or region common characteristics of members constituents or congressional districts or shared characteristics among the members themselves including their class group knowledge or interest some groups have separated the administrative and advisory roles of the executive committee by creating an advisory committee apart from the executive committee task forces sometimes informal groups and member organizations have established their own task forces or subdivision structures it is through these subunits that the groups have accomplished division of labor and specialization on issues 7 how are the chairman and other officers selected like other internal operational matters the manner by which the chairman or chairmen of group is selected is left to the discretion of each group group may use an informal method of selection whereby members volunteer to serve as chairman if more than one member expresses such interest cochairmanship arrangement may be used or the interested members themselves may work out an agreement as to who will serve perhaps so that some members serve during the first session and others during the second session alternatively group may choose more formal process whereby interested members must be nominated and then stand for election by the total membership or the executive committee invariably the initial chairman of groupwhether house senate or bicameralis its founder often he or she continues to serve until longer member of congress or until he or she relinquishes the position however in some instances tenure as chairman of group is limited either by custom or by rule in the groups bylaws senate in the senate the incidence of rotation and turnover among chairmen of these groups has tended to be relatively low in few instances there is designated chair for the group leadership responsibilities rotate and are conducted through the office of member who agrees to coordinate the groups businesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs13 usually when senate group has selected new chairman the basis for selection has been the members interest in the group and willingness to assume the position in most instances formal elections have not been held sometimes when more than one member has been interested in serving structure was created to accommodate cochairmen or scheduled changes in chairmanship were worked out among the interested members still another method used by one group was to send letter to the groups membership asking if there were any objection to the appointment of volunteering member as chair when there was none the announcement of the new chair was made also the outgoing chairman may personally select replacement recruiting another member who agrees to assume the position more or less by consensus house formal and informal processes for determining group officers have been used by house groups in some instances elections have been held after candidates for the various positions announced they were standing for election formal election meeting at the beginning of each congress was held and members voted by secret ballot for their group leaders ie officers and executive committee members under less formal system used by some groups members volunteer to serve as officers and executive committ ee members or express their desire to serve to former chairman executive members etc insofar as the executive committee is concerned if more than one member from the same state or region desired to serve they usually worked out an agreement as to who would stand for election sometimes if member from particular state or region expressed interest recruitment was made by the chairman or outgoing executive member from that state these members then usually announced that they were candidates and subsequently were elected rarely were their elections contested more often than not house groups choose some variation of the less formal means of selecting officers bicameral one bicameral group used more formalized procedure for selecting its chairman the chairman appointed an equal number of democrats and republicans usually one or two of each to serve as the nominations and elections committee that committee solicited and received nominations for appointment to the groups executive committee and submitted them to the members for their approval the executive committee then elected the groups officers including the chairman the chairman of another bicameral group was elected by the groups executive committee if member wished to serve as chairman he or she may have solicited support of executive committee members who would nominate him or her the executive committee could be elected by the membership at large as well as by specific members the regional executive committee members of the group were elected by members of their region while the at large members were elected by the general membershiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs14 19funding and resources cmo regulations 1999 20communications cmo regulations 1999 21morris k udall chairman and edward j derwinski ranking minority

in lso subcommittee report 1982 p 135136 22jack dail commission on congressional mailing standards telephone conversation with the author august 26 19998 how are informal groups and cmos staffed currently neither house nor senate informal groups and member organizations can employ staff consequently these groups have staff of their own in the senate where formal recognition has ever been given to nonofficial member organizations there are few instances where an informal pooling of staff occurs but the pooling is based upon the individual senators and not the group similarly house members may also informally coordinate staff activities to pursue goals as an informal group here again it is the individual members and not the group who are the employing entities thus in general in both the house and senate informal group business is handled by staff of an individual member often the groups chairman sponsor or coordinator as part of their regular duties frequently the staffer is legislative assistant who works in an area related to the groups issues in the house group must register with the committee on house administration as cmo if its members want to formally share and pay for staff to work on group business current cmo regulations expressly provide that cmo is not an employing authority19 accordingly it is not the cmo but the house members who are the employers 9 do informal groups have the franking privilege can member lend his or her frank to an informal group or cmo the short answer to both these questions is in the house the 1999 cmo regulations expressly state that cmos do not have the franking privilege and members are prohibited from lending their frank to cmos20 this regulation is consistent with the advisory opinion issued by the commission on congressional mailing standards also known as the franking commission in 1982 the commission held that section 3215 of title 39 united states code does not permit member to allow legislative service organization lso to use his or her frank member cannot lend his frank to informal committees or groups composed only of members of congress ie cmos but may lend it only to official committees created by congress absent an amendment to the franking law the commission cannot advise you that it would be permissible to allow an lso ie legislative service organization to use your frank21 such amendment to the franking law has been adopted and the commission has made change in its finding since that time22 the commissions ruling which specifically referred to lsos is considered to apply to informal groups and congressional member organizationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs15 23communications cmo regulations 1999 24communications cmo regulations 1999 25ibid 26ibidthe 1999 cmo regulations do

organizations have with outside organizations the types of relationships that an informal group or congressional member organization may have with outside organizations are varied they depend to large part on the scope of the congressional groups goals and operations as well as how they may be accomplished under the laws regulations and practices regarding the conduct of members and congressional groups in recent years issues of particular concern inside and outside the congress have included the extent to which informal groups are allowed to have relationships with outside organizations the nature and extent of participation by members on the governing bodies of outside organizations and the ability of members to raise funds for nonprofit taxexempt outside organizations the nature and extent of the relationships continues to be complex and evolving issue members who choose tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs16 27us congress house committee on standards of official conduct

prohibited from raising money for any organization that is established or controlled by members of congress27 the only exceptions are those expressly permitted by the committee on standards of

are related to members official duties should be directed to the committees office of advice and education specific examples are provided in the committees april 4 1995 guidelines the regulations promulgated on congressional groups have included provisions aimed maintaining separation between the congressional groups and those outside nonprofit foundations and institutes that provide research and policy development on related issues specific questions may be referred to the committee on house administration the house committee on standards of official conduct the senate committee on rules and administration or the senate committee on ethics as appropriate historically some groups have served as effective coordinative links between outside organizations and allies in congress congressional groups have sometimes responded to questions from their members by providing information from outside groups or by referring their members to outside experts the outside groups in turn have consulted informal groups on policy options and political strategies in congress sometimes an outside group has requested that particular member or members establish congressional group for example the ad hoc congressional committee for irish affairs was created september 28 1977 following the request of several major irishamerica n organizations including the ancient order of hibernians and the irish national caucus28 the senate beef caucus was formed after some coordinating initiative by the national cattlemens association29 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30301crs17 30unlike the informal groups the institutes status as 501c3 nonprofit foundations enables them to accept private tax deductible contributions current cmo regulations expressly provide that neither cmos nor individual members may accept goods funds or services from private organizations or individuals to support the cmo 31see for example alice love lso foundations take financial hit roll call vol 40 apr 27 1995 pp

foundations to conduct longterm research and policy analyses eg the congressional black caucus foundation congressional hispanic institute and the congressional hunger center these foundations and institutes developed in large part because unlike congressional groups they can accept private funding30 although it is not unlawful or uncommon for members of congress to be involved in the establishment of such groups some aspects of the relationship members have with the foundations and institutes have been the subject of some criticism31 some have been concerned that contact between member organizations and outside groups may lead to appearances or allegations of inappropriate or undue influence from special interests on the other hand it has been argued that appropriate ongoing contact and exchange of information between congressional groups and outside groups can help members to support beneficial public policy it may also promote favorable constituent relations consequently the level and scope of congressional groups involvement if any with outside organizations should be carefully considered
