service the library of congress crs2 possible jurisdictional realignment if the house decides to create permanent committee on homeland security will house rule x be amended to include specific jurisdictional terms for new standing committee if so will changes be effected pursuant to hres 5 at the start of the 109th congress will they be effected prior to the conclusion of the 108th congress will they be phased in over several congresses will other committees jurisdiction be changed to accommodate the jurisdiction of the new panel will jurisdictional changes affect only homeland security or is more extensive realignment anticipated will jurisdictional changes be made in concert with possible changes in referral procedures will legislative jurisdictional changes also reflect possible changes in oversight responsibilities can standing committee be authorized to conduct only oversight httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21901 referral the speaker has the authority to refer measures to committee with primary jurisdiction as well as to additional committees sequentially further he can impose time limitations on committees receiving referrals in the 108th congress the speaker was granted the authority to refer measures without designation of primary committee under exceptional circumstances to date the select committee has received measures as the primary committee as well as in sequential manner however several measures defined by some as relating to homeland security issues were not referred to the select committee if the house decides to create permanent committee on homeland security will referral rules and procedures need to be changed will the homeland security panel always be the primary panel on measures affecting homeland security if not will it always receive sequential referral will exceptional circumstances be clarified to mean homeland security in its broadest definition will referral changes be made in concert with possible jurisdictional changes assignments both parties make committee assignments pursuant to house rules and respective party caucus or conference rules and generally limit the number and type of panels on which member can serve although waivers are granted such waivers must be approved by the party caucus or conference to serve on the select committee several members in each party three republicans and 13 democrats took leaveofabsence from other committees in order to conform with their respective party assignment limits simultaneously several members were granted temporary assignments to serve on panels crs3 from which they had taken leave of absence if the house decides to create permanent committee on homeland security how will the panel be categorized by each party ie exclusive or non exclusive will the categorization of committees need to be changed what impact will the decision have on current committee members will assignment be subject to limitations if so what effect will limitations have on attracting members to serve on the panel what effect will that have on committees especially if numerous senior members seek assignment to new committee will membership be limited to specific number of terms or will the panel be treated like other standing committees will assignments be made through the regular steering committee process or will the speaker and minority leader make assignments might new selection process be created eg each committee would select its representative to serve on homeland security committee will assignment limitations if imposed be immediately in force or phased in over time will exemptions be allowed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21901 will membership reflect rankandfile members or committee or subcommittee leaders will membership be drawn from all committees of the house or from only those with jurisdiction over homeland security issues or from those committees with or limited jurisdiction over homeland security issues will party leaders serve on the committee in an ex officio capacity will assignment decisions be affected by possible changes in jurisdictions among committees chairmanshipranking minority member the republican conference and democratic caucus each have rules related to the selection of committee leaders the republican conference allows its steering committee to vote on committee chairs except for those panels where the speaker selects the chair the democratic caucus designates committee leaders the republicans also limit the service of some committee chairs nine current committee chairs serve on the select committee if the house decides to create permanent committee on homeland security will the chair be subject to term limits will the committee leader be allowed to serve on other standing committees if yes will the committee leader be allowed to lead subcommittee on the other committee will the committee leader be allowed to hold position in the party leadership how will the committee leader be chosen eg by the steering committee by party leadership or by seniority among existing members of the committee crs4 subcommittees most standing committees create subcommittees the select committee created subcommittees that generally parallel the structure of the new department an additional subcommittee is reviewing the rules of the house related to homeland security if the house decides to create permanent committee on homeland security will the existing homeland security subcommittee structure change will subcommittees have specified jurisdiction will the number of subcommittees comply with chamber rules will house rules need to be changed to allow for the creation of additional subcommittees how will subcommittee leaders be selected will they be subject to assignment and leadership position limitations how will subcommittee members be determined resources staff funding space httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21901 the select committee currently borrows space for committee meetings from other panels and its staff is generally housed in the offices of the chair and ranking member and the library of congress borrowing committee space has caused the committee to hold many meetings on mondays and fridays when space is generally available startup funding was provided by resolution additional funding was granted pursuant to the traditional funding mechanism if the house decides to create permanent committee on homeland security will the committee receive its own committee room and space for its staff will committee space need special facilities eg as the intelligence committee does will committee staff require unique security clearances how much will the committee require in funding and how many staff are anticipated will the staff and funding be allocated between the parties and if so how the 911 commission has recommended nonpartisan staff will subcommittees if created be provided autonomous staff
