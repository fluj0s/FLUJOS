divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836encryption technology the debate in the 105th and 106th congresses summary the controversy over encryption throughout the 1990s concerned what access the government should have to encrypted stored computer data or electronic communications voice and data wired and wireless for law enforcement and national security purposes encryption and decryption are methods of using cryptogra phy to protect the confidentiality of data and communications when encrypted message can only be understood by someone with the key to decrypt it businesses and consumers want strong encryption products to protect their information while the clinton administration wanted to ensure the law enforcement communitys ability to monitor undesirable activity in the digital age until 1998 the clinton administration promoted the use of strong encryption greater than 56 bits here and abroad only if it had key recovery features where key recovery agent holds spare key to decrypt the information the adminis tration wanted key recovery agents to make the decryption key available to authorized federal and state government entities privacy advocates argued that law enforcement entities would have too much access to private information under this policy the administration attempted to use the export control process to influence companies to develop key recover encryption products by making it easy to export products with key recovery and difficult for those products without there were limits on domestic use or import of any type of encryption so the administration tried to influence what was available for domestic use through export controls since most companies do not want to incur the costs of creating two versions of the same prod uctone for us use and another for export us companies argued that us export policies hurt their market share while helping foreign companies not subject to export restrictions while many businesses and consumer groups agreed that key recovery is desirable when keys are lost stolen or corrupted they wanted market forces to drive the development of key recovery encryption products they also objected to government having any role in determining who can hold the keys although general consensus emerged that encryption is essential to the growth of electronic commerce and use of the internet opposition to the clinton administrations policy grew as industry and privacy rights groups lobbied congress to loosen export controls in the 106th congress legislation was introduced intended to foster widespread use of the strongest encrypti on hr 850 s 798 while the administration continued to oppose that legislation hr 850 was marked up by five committees resulting in widely varying and in places contradictory provisions in september 1999 the clinton administration announced plans to relax its encryption export policy by allowing unlimited key length with some exceptions without key recovery and reducing reporting requirements the rules for implemen ting that policy were issued by the department of commerce in january 2000 while the new policy appears to have satisfied industry interests

enactment of legislation with the clinton administrations significant reduction of restrictions on the use of encryption some groups however would like to see further reductions in those restrictions and would also like to have the new policy codified in law others might want to reverse the current policy to reinstitute the previous restrictions on encryption use this report serves as comprehensive overview of the evolution of debate and legislation that led to modifications to the us encryption policy that took place in the 1990s and 2000 encryption computers and electronic communications encryption and decryption are procedures for applying the science of cryptography to ensure the confidentiality of messages technically the issue discussed here is cryptography policy but since encryption is the most controversial application of cryptography it is the term used popularly and in this report other methods of using cryptography to protect confidentialitysteganography and chaffing and winnowingwill not be discussed in this report also for discussion of the specific issues regarding medical records privacy and security see crs issue brief ib98002 medical records confidentiality updated regularly encrypting messages so they can be understood only by the intended recipient historically was the province of those protecting military secrets the burgeoning use of computers and computer networks including the internet now has focused attention on its value to much broader segment of society government agencies seeking to protect data stored in their databases busin esses wanting to guard proprietary data and consumers expecting electronic mail to be as private as first class mail all want access to strong encryption products other users of electronic communications for example cellular wireless phone users who expect calls to be as private as wireline calls also are showing increased interest in encryption while encryption is uncommon for telephone users today the advent of digital telephone services particularly personal communication services pcs digital form of cellular telephony is expected to make encrypted voice and data communications over telephones more common whether hardware or softwarebased an encryption product scrambles message using mathematical algorithms corresponding key is needed to decrypt unscramble the message and the key itself also may be encrypted the algorithm is series of digital numbers bits and the level of difficulty of breaking the code its strength is usually represented by the number of bits in the key there are otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs2 key recovery and key recovery agents once called key escrow key recovery means that when stored data or electronic communications are encrypted third party has copy of the key neede d to decrypt the information the third party is called key recovery agent formerly key escrow agent key recovery is useful in cases where key is lost stolen or corrupted most parties to the encryption debate agree that market forces will drive the developme nt of key recoverybased encryption products for stored computer data because businesses and individuals will want to be sure they can get copies of keys in an emergency it is less clear if market demands will drive key recovery systems for electronic communications the controversy was over governments attempt to encourage the development of key recoverybased products through the export control process the governments role in determining who can serve as key recovery agents and the extent to which law enforcement agencies could obtain the key if they suspect undesirable activity terrorism child pornography and drug cartels are often cited as examplesfactors that affect keys strength but in this debate bit length is used as benchmark unencrypted data are referred to as plaintext encrypted data are ciphertext the national institute of standards and technology nist in conjunction with industry developed an encryption standard using 56bit key in 1977 called the data encryption standard des it is widely used today in the united states and abroad often in an enhanced mode called 3key triple des providing the equivalent of 112 bit key nist is currently working to establish new stronger standard than des referred to as the advanced encryption standard aes the need for stronger standard was underscored in 1997 when des was broken see below encry ption products are widely available today including some that use 128bit keys or more some 128bit encryption software can be downloaded from the internet there are limits on the strength of encryption products used in the united states whether acquired here or imported the only limits are on expo rts this indirectly influences what is available domestically however since most us companies are reluctant to develop two products one for the us market and another for export for many years reflecting the policies of the past three administrations the state departm ent did not allow general exports of encryption with more than 40bit keys except for banking and usowned subsidiaries for list of exceptions see crs report 96232 in december 1996 the clinton administration raised the limit to 56 bits for easily exportable encryption products that do not have key recovery features see box and removed bit length limits entirely for products with key recovery breaking message encrypted with 40bit key by bruteforce trying every possible combina tion of bits until the correct one is found is not considered difficult in january 1997 40 bit key was broken in 35 hours in general for each bit added to the encryption key the time required to break the key doubles thus it takes 216 65536 times longer to break 56bit key than 40bit key in july 1998 group from the electronic freedom foundation an electronic privacy rights group demonstrated for less than 250000 the vulnerability of 40 and 56bit keys by using network of nearly 100000 pcs on the internet that broke 56bit key in 22 hours 15 minutes the ability to break 128bit encryption considered strong encryption has not yet been demonstrated publicly in may 1996 the national research council nrc released comprehensive report entitled cryptographys role in securing the information society the crisis report it stressed that national policy should make cryptography broadlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs3 1httpwwwseasgwueduseasinstitutescpi available to all legitimate elements of society promote continued economic growth and leadership of key us industries and ensure public safety and protection against foreign and domestic threats among the recommendations key escrow is an unproven technology and the government should experiment with it and work with other nations but not aggressively promote it now export controls should be relaxed progressively but not eliminated and encryption policy issues can be debated adequately in public without relying upon classified information the report also recommended that law should bar the manufacture sale or use of any form of encryption within the united states and government should promote information security in the private sector the report underscored that utilization of strong encryption and law enforcement objectives can be mutually compatible business and consumer groups consider 56bit keys inadequate to ensure privacy and security they oppose export encryption controls and requirements for key recovery features they object to the government using the export process to force the development of key recovery encryption products rather than allowing market forces to prevail and to the governments role in determining who can serve as key recovery agents these groups argue that strong encryption is needed for example to enhance the prospects for electronic commerce and other uses of computer networks the willingness of consumers to buy goods via the internet could be markedly affected by their beliefs as to whether credit card numbers will be secure businesses using computers for either internal or external communications need to ensure that competitors or other unauthoriz ed parties cannot gain access to proprietary information privacy advocates argue that consumers should be assured that personal medical and financial information transmitted by or stored in computers will be protected they note that since 128bit nonkey recovery encryption is available worldwide either by downloading it from the internet or buying it from foreign firms the us government already has lost control of influencing its availability 1997 survey conducted by trusted information systems found 656 foreign encryption products available from 29 countries in additio n to 963 us products 1998 report by the economic strategy institute finding the key concluded that if the administrations policies remained in effect the us economy would lose 3596 billion by 2002 in lost encryption product sales slower growth in encryptiondependent industries foregone cost savings and efficiency gains from the internet intranets and extranets and indirect effects throughout the economy in june 1999 study conducted by george washington university titled the growing development of foreign encryption products in the face of us export regulat ions found over 800 encryption products available from 35 foreign countries1 at least 167 of those products were found to use strong encryption over 512 compa nies either manufacture or distribute cryptographic products of quality comparable to us products in over 70 countries outside the united states in june 1999 the electronic privacy information center epic produced its second annual report on the encryption policies of foreign nations and internati onal organizations titled cryptography and liberty concluding that in the vast majority of countries both developed and developing cryptography may be used manufactured and sold without restriction on april 3 2000 epic released its third annual internationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs4 2for further details see crs report rl30677 digital surveillance the communications assistance for law enforcement act and fbi internet monitoring january 25 2001proponents and opponents of encryption export controls proponents the clinton adminis tration notably the department of justice and the national security agency and others concerned about the ability of terrorists and other criminal groups to conduct activities unmonitored if strong nonkey recovery encryption is widely available opponents computer hardware and software manufacturers who wanted to market the same products for domestic and foreign markets and worried that they would lose market share to foreign competitors who did not have to abide by such limits they were also concerned that one would buy encryption products for which the us government could obtain the key us businesses that wanted to use the same computer systems they had in their home offices with their foreign clients and privacy and consumer groups which are still not satisfied with the latest clinton administration encryption policy want individuals to have access to the best encryption possible without regard to key recovery features review of encryption policies covering 135 countries the report found the relaxation of export controls was continuing but that law enforcement agencies were seeking new authority and new funding to gain access to private keys and personal communications supporters of encryption export controls agree that strong encryption is needed but insist that law enforcement and national security concerns dema nd that when authorized the government be able to intercept and decrypt electronic communications or decrypt stored computer data where undesirable activity is suspected law enforcement and national security officials wanted to ensure their ability to access the plaintext of the information the method most often discussed was to obtain the key needed to unscramble encrypted information from key recovery agents hence they supported the use of strong encryption products as long as they included key recovery features and wanted to limit the development of strong nonkey recovery products while conceding some strong nonkey recovery encryption products were already available they claimed use of these products was not widespread they argued that while the us government cannot prevent the availability of strong nonkey recovery encryption at least it could be restrained and future generations of encryption products with key recovery would displace those without key recovery capabilities although the publicity surrounding the encryption debate centered on access to stored computer data electr onic communications are equally important to the law enforcement and national security communities an internet message for example is stored data when it resides on server or an individuals computer but it is an electronic communication while it is being transmitted between computers the encryption export regulations apply to products for encrypting other electronic communications not just those between computers telephones whether wired or wireless are also covered the 1994 communications assistance to law enforcement act calea pl 103414 requires telecommunic ations carriers to ensure their equipment permits the interception of any electronic communication by law enforcement officials2 if the communication is encrypted law enforcement agencies want to ensure they can decrypt it too calea requires thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs5 telecommunications carrier to provide decrypted information if the carrier itself is responsible for the encryption but not if the customer has encrypted it administration policy and industry reactions the clinton administration consistently supported argument s by law enforcement and national security agencies that the government must be able to gain access to the plaintext of encrypted electronic data and messages when undesirable activity is suspected in addition to international criminal activity the administration notably the fbi wants to be able to monitor domestic criminal activity the administr ation always permitted use of any strength encryption without key recovery requirement in the united states rather than attempting to change that policy directly the administration used the indirect route of export controls to influence what types of encryption products were available both here and abroad initially the clinton administration sought to restrain the development of strong encryption products by prohibiting export of greater than 40bit encryption with few exceptions the administration also tried several approaches to promote voluntary use of key recovery agents in april 1993 the administration released its clipper chip policy requiring emplacement of special encrypt ion computer chips called clipper an encryption device used for unclassified but sensitive government communications into new government equipment for voice communications with two government agencies nist and the department of treasury jointly serving as key escrow agents each holds part of the key the administration implemented this policy in 1994 for sensitive but unclassified voice communications in the federal government through federal information processing standard fips called the escrowed encryption standard ees or fips185 the administration hoped that industry would accept the clipper chip for its own use but industry strongly objected to the key escrow provisions particularly the fact that government agencies would hold the keys in july 1994 the administration agreed to work with the private sector to develop voluntary key escrow system for data using trust ed third parties as escrow agents instead of government agencies this proposal was referred to by its detractors as clipper ii industry continued to object to the key escrow concept as well as the export controls leading to the legislation discussed below in may 1996 the administration released draft paper on encryption policy followed by july statement by vice president gore called clipper iii by its opponents these documents outlined policy changes the administration was considering among other things the term key recovery replaced key escrow to emphasize the positive attributes of key escrow in providing means to recover key that is lost stolen or corrupted furthermore key escrow had come to be identified with the concept of the government holding the key under the key recovery policy trusted third party or an organization itself can serve that function self escrow with some restrictions on october 1 1996 vice preside nt gore announced the changes to the administrations policy to focus on the need for strong encryption as long as it included key recovery features the key recovery agent would be required to give thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs6 key to duly authorized law enforcement officials if undesirable activity is suspected the three types most often cited were drug cartels child pornographers and terrorists the associated executive order was signed november 15 and the administration published an interim final regulation on december 30 to last two years with the following details continuation of restrictions on domestic use or import of any encryption key length restrictions on export of encryption products if key recovery system was used for that product for 56bit encryption products without key recovery systems onetime review was required before exporting the product and within two years the exporter must have developed key recovery system export licenses were granted in 6month increments to hold exporters to timetable to ensure the key recovery systems were being developed if not the export license was not renewed trusted parties served as key recovery agents and in some cases organizations were allowed to escrow keys themselves selfescrow if they met certa in requirements and commercial encryption was removed from the munitions list and responsibility for commercial encryption export licensing was transferred from the state department to the commerce department with the department of justice serving an advisory role in commercial encryption export decisions foreign governments would apply to us courts to gain access to keys as they do when seeking other types of evidence during the next two years the commerce department granted some waivers for banking and financial services on september 3 1997 fbi director louis freeh testified to the senate judiciary committee that there was need for domestic use restrictions on encryption products following that testimony the existence of legislation proposed by the administration to impose domestic use restrictions became widely known among congressional and industry groups vice president gore later stated that freehs comments reflected the fbis view but did not indicate change in administration policy the house intelligence committee however later approved an amendment to legislation similar to freehs position about the need for key recovery to be built into encryption products in march 1998 vice president gore wrote to senator daschle restating the administrations desire for balanced approach to encryption policy and seeking to produce cooperative solutions rather than seeking to legislate domestic controls the discussions would also enable additional steps to relax export controls on encryption products shortly afterwards secretary of commerce daley announced the release of new report on electronic commerce wherein he said that although the administrations policy was the right one its implementation was failure he urged both industry and government to strive harder to reach consensus on the issue the undersecretary of commerce for the bureau of export administration bxa reinsch later commented at congressional internet caucus meeting that the administration was longer looking for legislative solution to the encryption issue in july 1998 the clinton administration declassified two security algorit hms used in the clipper chip in september 1998 it announced plans to allow the export of 56bit encryption products without requiring provisions for key recovery after onetime review to all users outside seven terrorist countries cuba iran iraq libya north korea syria and sudan export of encryption products of any strength was permitted to 46 designated countries if key recovery or access tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs7 3acps web site is httpwwwcomputerprivacyorg plaintext was provided to third party the administration also supported an fbi proposal to establish technical support center to help law enforcement keep abreast of encryption technologies in december 1998 the bxa released interim rules to implement the administrations export control policy initiative the rules allowed for the export of encryption commodities and software to us companies or subsidiaries in the finance insurance healthcare and medical endusers and electronic commerce industries industry reactions most participants in the debate agreed that market forces would lead to the development of key recoverybased encryption products for stored data because companies and individuals would want to be able to replace lost stolen or corrupted keys the debate was over the governments role in encouraging the development of key recove ry products through export regulations and the access government would have to the keys also of concern was the governments inclusion of other electronic communications while computer companies continued to argue agains t the administrations policy some also developed key recovery products to satisfy the policy group of companies formed the key recovery alliance in 1996 to identify barriers to the development of marketable key recovery products on march 4 1998 group of more than 100 companies and organizations some also members of the key recovery alliance formed the americans for computer privacy acp coalition to lobby for enabling the use of strong encryption against export controls on strong encryption and against mandatory key recovery3 among the members are america on line microsoft sybase the national rifle association the law enforcement alliance of america and the business software alliance in march 1998 network associates announced that it had arranged for swiss company to develop its own software product using specifications in book by philip zimmerman the creator of pretty good privacy pgp network associates bought mr zimmermans company in 1997 pgp was 128bit encryption product that does not have key recovery and hence could not be exported under the current regulations an older version is available via the internet however which sparked multiyear justice department investigation of mr zimmerman that resulted in action against him since the book could be exported and the swiss company received technical assistance from network associates the company believed laws were broken the swiss product was sold by dutch firm under the pgp name opponents of encryption controls pointed to this as evidence that the us government cannot control the spread of nonkey recovery encryption in july 1998 as possible compromise to the clinton administration group of software companies announced plans to develop product private doorbell to capture data that could be given to law enforcement before it is encrypted and sent over the internet while industry groups approved of the administrations encryption export policy they argued that 56bit encryption had been broken and that strongerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs8 encryption was necessary furthermore they asserted that the department of commerces rules could render the policy ineffective in increasin g their ability to export encryption products privacy rights groups argued that while the new policy may help big companies it would not increase the availability or use of 56bit or stronger encryption by individual users of internet communications action in the 105th congress three bills in the house and four in the senate concerning encryption were introduced in the 105th congre ss none were enacted although one hr 1903 passed the house three hr 695 s 376 and s 377 were versions of bills considered in the 104th congress generally favoring relaxed encryption export controls four new bills were also introduced s 909 reflected philosophy closer to that of the clinton administration than the three previous bills hr 1903 focused broadly on computer security issues and the role of nist hr 1964 focused broadly on computer privacy and security issues s 2067 was general ly viewed as pro industry and proprivacy hearings were held by six house committees commerce international relations intelligence judiciary national security and science and two senate committees judiciary and commerce science and transportation the secu rity and freedom through encryption safe act hr 695 goodlatte originally sought to relax export controls on encryption although versions of hr 695 as reported from various committees had substantially different provisions the bill was eventually considered by the committees on judiciary international relations commerce national security and intelligence amendments adopted by the latter two committees reversed some of the provisions of the original bill by maintaining or increasing restrictions on export controls of encryption the rules committee did not take action on the bills the encrypted communication privacy act of 1997 s 376 leahy prohibited mandatory use of key recovery but allowed law enforcement to access the key under court order if key recovery is used codified existing domestic use policy gave the secretary of commerce exclusive jurisdiction over commercial encryption exports liberalized export controls made it crime to use encryption to obstruct justice and established liability protection and penalties for key holders the bill also established procedures for foreign governments to access keys or decryption assistance the promotion of commerce online in the digital era procode act of 1997 s 377 burns prohibited mandatory key recovery and established an information security board as forum to foster communication and coordination between industry and government the bill also codified existing domestic use policy and gave the secretary of commerce exclusive jurisdiction over commercial encryption exports it liberalized export controls but required the publisher or manufacturer of encryption software or hardware to report to the secretary of commerce within 30 days after exporting product on the products encryption capabilities the report would have included the same information required under the december 30 1996 regulations but would be provided after export instead of as condition of obtaining license httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs9 the secure public networks act s 909 mccain et codified existing domestic use policy established penalties for use of encryption in commission of crime encouraged but did not require use of key recovery established procedures for government approval of key recovery agents and certificate authorities required key recovery agents whether or not registered by the government to disclose recovery information to lawfully authorized federal or state government entities provided liability protection for key recovery agents acting pursuant to the act permitted export of 56bit encryption products without key recovery if they meet certain conditions permitted export of any strength encryption product if it is based on qualified key recovery system and meets certain other conditions and allowed the president to waive provisions of the bill for national security or domestic safety and securi ty reasons during and after markup the committee adopted amendments establishing an encryption export advisory board eeab with four government cia fbi nsa and the white house and eight industry representatives to make recommendations on whether export exemptions should be granted for nonkey recovery products stronger than 56bits the committee ordered the bill reported but the report was never filed the senate judiciary committee requested sequential referral of s 909 and held hearing on july 9 1997 where fbi director louis freeh expressed reservations about the bill because it allowed widespr ead use of strong encryption within the united states regardless of whether it has key recovery freeh amplified his concerns at september 3 hearing before the subcomm ittee on technology terrorism and government information he stated that he wanted us manufacturers to be required to build key recovery into encryption products and that imported encryption products also be required to include key recovery he further stated that achieving the goal of immediate lawful decryption could be done in mandatory manner it could be done in an involuntary manner he later added that he thought legislation should first include the requirement that key recovery be built into encryption products and then take up the more complex discussion about how thats enabled he also stated that internet service providers should be required to be able to decrypt communications immediately the encryption protects the rights of individuals from violation and abuse in cyberspace eprivacy act s 2067 ashcroft et prohibited federal or state agencies from linking the use of encryption for authentication or identification to the use of encryption for confidentiality purposes required that the use of encryption products be voluntary and marketdriven outlined procedures for us and foreign law enforcement agencies to access decryption keys or assistance in decrypting electronic communication s or stored data established national electronic technologies net center in the departmen t of justice to help law enforcement keep pace with encryption technology made the use of encryption to obstruct justice crime established an encryption export advisory board to determine whether comparable foreign products are commercially available maintained the presidents authority to prohibit export of encryption products to countries that support internation terrorism or to impose embargoes on exports to or imports from specific country made electronic records in networked storage be treated in law as though the record had remained in the possession of the person who created the record and set the circumstances under which the government may require mobilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs10 electronic communication service to reveal the realtime physical location of subscriber and may obtain information from pen register and trap and trace devices the computer security enhancement act hr 1903 sensenbrenner amended and updated the computer security act of 1987 enhancing the role of the national institute of standards and technology nist as passed by the house hrept 105243 the bill required nist to promote the use of commercial offtheshelf encryption products by civilian government agencies clarified that nist standards and guidelines are not intended as restrictions on the production or use of encryption by the private sector provided funding for computer security fellowships at nist and required the national research council to conduct study of public key infras tructures section requiring nist to develop standardized tests and procedures to evaluate the strength of foreign encryption products was removed before passage the bill passed the house and was reported without amendment by the senate commerce committee october 13 1998 srept 105412 the communications privacy and consumer empowerment act hr 1964 markey covered range of computer privacy and security issues with regard to encryption the bill codified existing domestic use policy prohibited the government federal or state from conditioning the issuance of certificates of authentication or certificates of authority upon use of key recovery systems and prohibited the government federal or state from establishing licensing labeling or other regulatory scheme that requires key escrow as condition of licensing or regulatory approval the bill also required the national telecommunications and information administration ntia to conduct study on inter alia how data security issues affect electronic commerce including identificati on of generally available technologies including encryption for improving data security action in the 106th congress on february 25 1999 representative goodlatte introduced new version of safe hr 850 similar to the bill introduced in the 105th congr ess with new provision directing the attorney general to compile examples in which encryption has interfered with law enforcement the bill was reported by the judiciary committee on april 27 and was referred jointly and sequentially to committees on international relations commerce armed services and intelligence hearings were held by the committe on commerce may 5 and 25 international relations may 18 and intelligence june 9 and july 14 armed services july 1 and 13 the bill has gained 257 cosponsors with majority of both republican and democratic leadership the bill was reported amended by the committee on commerce hrept 106117 part ii on july 2 and by the remaining three committees parts iii iv and v on july 23 the five versions of hr850 differed significantly the versions passed by the committees on the judiciary commerce and international relations codified the regulations for unrestricted domestic use and sale of encryption prohibited the government from mandating key escrow practices for the public and liberalized the controls governing the export of strong encryption one of the amendments passedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs11 by the commerce committee made it crime to fail to decrypt information upon court orders raising opposition from privacy rights advocates the armed services and intell igence committee versions in contrast had minimal or mention of domestic use of encryption and increased the authority of the president in restricting the controls governing the export of strong encryption all of the bills except for the version by the armed services committee established criminal penalties for the use of encryption in the furtherance of criminal act the intelligence committee bill however provided greater details than the others for criminalizing the use of encryption in crimi nal act in addition each committee added provisions for specific agencies and circumstances for example the commerce committee established national electronic technologies net center in the department of commerce to promote the exchange of information regarding data security techniques and technologies and the international relations committee directed the secretary of commerce to consult with the attorney general the federal burea u of investigation and the drug enforcement administration before approving any license to export encryption products to any country identified as being major drug producer the intelligence committee bill authorized appropriations for the technical support center at the fbi the five versions were sent to the house rules committee on july 23 1999 further action was taken in the senate on april 14 1999 senators mccain burns wyden and leahy introduced s 798 the promote reliable transactions to encourage commerce and trade protect act the bill would have immediately raised the maximum exportable key length of encryption products to 64 bits s 798 also set deadline of january 1 2002 for the federal adoption of the advanced encryption standard which uses 128 bit key length and allowed the export of products employing aes at that date s798 allowed the export of strong greater than 64 bit encryption products with key recovery features as well as the export of strong encryption products to legitimate and responsible entities including publicly traded firms us corporate subsidiaries or affiliates firms required by law to maintain plaintext records and others s798 did not contain criminal provisions for the use of encryption in the furtherance of crime unlike hr 850 and prohibited domestic controls and mandatory plaintext access the senate commerce committee held hearing on the bill on june 10 the senate commerce committee approved s 798 on june 23 1999 further action was taken on the bill deep divisions remained between those who oppose liberalizing encryption policy and those who advocate it while the computer industry and privacy and consume r advocacy groups generally favored both bills hr 850 was considered more proindustry because of its greater liberalization of encryption export controls the departments of defense and justice remained opposed to both bills arguing that the existing export restrictions were necessary to prevent the use of encryption by undesirable groups in addition on july 27 1999 representative goss introduced two more bills on encryption policy hr 2616 which reflected house intelligence committee markup of hr 850 and hr 2617 which proposed tax incentives for the nations encryption software manufacturers to develop products with key recovery three other bills were introduced containing provisions regarding encryption on april 21 1999 senator leahy introduced s 854 which included provisions thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs12 promoted the use of encryption by 1 prohibiting government requirements for non federal use of key recovery or plaintext access practices 2 prohibiting federal agencies from requiring nonfederal entities to use specific encryption products to receive services 3 prohibiting federal encryption products that interact with commercial systems from interfering with the encryption capabilities of the commercial products and 4 prohibiting the disclosure of decryption assistance to foreign governments without court order the bill was referred to the committee on the judiciary on june 9 1999 represen tative sensenbrenner introduced hr 2086 which included provision directing the national science foundation to undertake study comparing the availability of encryption technologies in foreign countries to those subject to us export restrictions on july 1 1999 representative sensenbrenner introduced hr 2413 which contained provisions for establishment of public key management infrastructure and encryption standards for federal computers on september 21 1999 president clinton sent to congress proposed legislation that would ensur that law enforcement maintained its ability to access decryption information stored with third parties and would be allowed to withhold information in court rooms on its techniques used in decryption the bill also authorized 80 million over four years for the fbi technical support center which would serve as technic resource in responding to the use of encryption by criminals that legislation was never introduced in the 106th congress issues in the debate key recovery key recovery was the fundamental tenet of the clinton administration encryption policy the administration wanted law enforcement access to keys for encrypted data stored by computers transmitted between computers or other types of electronic communications not only did the administration view this as critical for us users but it sought to create global key management infrastructure kmi now referred to as public key infrastructure or pki to ensure confidenti ality for the grow th of global electronic commerce and monitoring undesirable activity by terrorists drug cartels or child pornographers for example many opponents of encryption controls agreed that key recovery has advantages for recovering lost stolen or corrupted key but believed market forces would drive the development of pki for stored computer data without government involvement less likely is marketdriven demand for key recovery products for electronic communicatio ns in any case opponents of controls insisted that the government should have role in choosing who holds the keys they feared the government would have unfettered access to private files and communications though the clinton administration stressed that proper legal authorization would be required liability protection for proper release of keys and penalties for improper use or release of keys were an important aspects of administration policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs13 questions about technical vulnerabilities that could be introduced if key recovery is incorporated into computer systems were raised in report updated june 1998 the risks of key recovery key escrow and trusted third party encryption by an ad hoc group of cryptographers and computer scientists they concluded that key recovery introduces new and vulnerable path to the unauthorized recovery of data and the massive deployment of keyr ecoverybased infrastructures to meet law enforcements specifications will require significant sacrifices in security and convenience and substantially increased costs the clinton administration acknowledge d that global agreement on key recovery and pki policy were essential to its policy and worked with the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to develop guidelines for global pki in 1997 the oecd released those guidelines which stated that national cryptography policies may allow lawful access to plaintext or cryptographic keys or encrypted data emphasis added hence oecd neither endorsed nor rejected the concept of law enforcement access to decryption keys the european commission published communication in october 1997 that noted the need for strong encryption to advance electronic commerce and expressed strong reservations about regulating encryption by requiring key recovery for example since then canada finland germany france and taiwan announced relaxation or elimination of their key recovery laws lacking international consensus many believed it was unlikely that mandated key recovery would survive export restrictions using the export process to influence the type of encryption products that were available in the united states and abroad was one strategy of the clinton administrations policy the administration points to threats to national security and public safety that would arise if criminals and terrorists used encryption that the us government could not decrypt administration representatives argued that nsa for example had been able to thwart criminals and terrorists because nsa intercepted communication s in time if those communications had been encrypted with strong encryption their task would have been much more difficult nsa opposed passing law that does not require companies to notify the government of what encryption products are being exported and to whom others pointed to difficulties in stopping future attacks in an era when terrorists could use strong encryption opponents of the adm inistrations policy countered that the united states through export controls could not prevent access to strong nonkey recovery encryption by criminals and terrorists because it was already available elsewhere in the world they further pointed out that the current policy of restrictions on domestic use or import of encryption meant that domestic threats would not be affected until its september 1999 announcement the clinton administration used the export process to encourage compan ies to develop products with key recovery features there were limits on the strength of encryption products that could be exported if they include key recovery opponents of export controls objected to the government mandating the use of key recovery arguing that foreign companies were not bound by such restrictions they argued that customers who did not want us law enforcement or national security agencies having access to decryption keys would buy encryption products from foreign suppliers they insisted that the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs14 government could not control the availability of strong nonkey recovery encryption products since they already could be procured from foreign suppliers or downloaded from the internet they asserted us policies simply ensured that us companies would lose market share to foreign competito rs and would not achieve the overall objective of assuring law enforcement access to encrypted information of criminal groups they pointed out that drug cartels for example could develop their own encryption products rather than buying commercially available products that would allow governments to access the keys proponents of export controls conceded that some criminal groups could develop their own encryption but insisted that at some point they would have to interact with mainstream companies such as banks or airlines if the mainstream companies were using key recoverybased systems this would provide an opportunity for law enforcement to access at least some of the groups activities they also pointed out that even though law enforcement agencies were allowed to tap telephone lines for decades criminals still used telephones because the infrastructure is already in place easily used and less costly than building an alternative system for their own use as for foreign competition proponents argued that although some strong nonkey recovery products were available from the internet or foreign suppliers they were not widely used and some were not as strong as their advertisements claimed some cases involving encryption export controls have been the basis for legal action one involves university of illinois professor daniel bernstein and his attempts to publish both in print and on the internet the source code for his snuffle encryption algorithm the government argued that the export required license under the arms export control act aeca and the interna tional traffic in arms regulations itar through which aeca is implemented on april 15 1996 us district judge marilyn patel ruled that computer source code is speech and protected under the constitution on december 18 she further ruled that itar represents an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech following the december 30 1996 shift in jurisdiction over commercial export products from the state department to the commerce department bernsteins lawyers asked her to review the new regulations on august 25 1997 she ruled that the new regulations also violate the first amendment on june 21 1999 the department of justice filed petition with federal appeals court for reconsideration in the bernstein case which on may 6 upheld ruling that encryption source code is scientific expression protected by the first amendment an opposite ruling was made in march 1996 by judge charles richey in case involving philip karn mr karn was denied permission to export source code on diskette even though the source code had been published in book and hence was in the public domain the state department designated the diskette as defense article under aeca and denied its export judge richey dismissed the complaint because the aeca does not permit judicial review of what is designated by the president as defense article mr karn appealed the ruling but by the time the appeal was heard in january 1997 the export regulations had changed so the case was remanded back to dc distr ict court on july 7 1998 us district judge james gwin ruled that an individual could not challenge encryption export restrictions on the grounds that they abridge his right to free speech on the internethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs15 4complete regulations are posted at httpwwwbxadocgovencryptiondefaulthtm domestic use the focus of the encryption debate has at times shifted to include potential changes to domestic use policy current us policy allows any type of encryption to be used in or imported into the united states clinton administration concerns that attempting to change this policy would be unsuccessful was factor in its choice of using export controls to influence what encryption products are available for domestic use fbi director freehs testimony to the senate judiciary committee on september 3 1997 heralded shift in the debate toward the possibility of requiring that key recovery be built into products manufactured in or imported into the united states and possibly enabled by the manufacturer not only the user the administrations policy however did not change on this issue in september 1999 questions were raised over the discovery of software element labeled nsakey in the security code of the microsoft windows operating system microsoft stated that the element was backup used for authentication of encryption components if the first key is damaged some question whether the key might enable the national security agency nsa to gain access to windows operating systems while it is unlikely that microsoft would have collaborated surreptitiously with nsa the dispute highlights the level of tension between industry and privacy rights groups over key recovery practices final clinton administration policy in september 1999 the clinton administration announce d its new encryption export policy to make encryption products of any key length after technical review exportable without license to users in any country except seven terrorist countries regulations implementing the administrations new encryption export policy were issued by the bxa on january 14 20004 according to these rules retail encryption commodities and software of any key length can be exported without license to any nongovernment end user in any country except the seven state supporters of terrorism and can be reexported to anyone including internet and telecommunications service providers exports previously allowed only for companys internal use can now be used for communication with other firms supply chains and customers exports to government endusers still require license exporters must report to bxa on where the encrypt ion product is exported and bxa will determine whether products qualify as retail by reviewing their functionality sales volume and distribution methods in addition if source code computer language instructions written by programmers is made publicly available under open source policies and royalty is charged for its use the code is not subject to export restrictions provision that was not included in an earlier draft and was the source of criticism by industry and privacy rights groups over the next year the administration announced further updates to its encryption policy on july 17 2000 changes were announced to allow exports of any strength encryption products to the governments of european unio n and eight additional countries it also allowed exports without technical review or reportinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30836crs16 requirements of encryption embedded in shortrange wireless products eg mobile phones audio devices cameras and videos on october 2 2000 the national institute for standards and technology announced its selection of new advanced encryption standard for federal agency use to protect unclassified information the algorithm for the standard known as rijndael was developed by belgian scientists and will be made freely available for use by the private sector while the computer industry is satisfied with the latest rules some privacy rights groups including the american civil liberties unio n the electronic frontier foundation and the electronic privacy information center argue that the remaining ambi guities in the rules make encryption technology overly cumbersome for individuals to use because the regulations could be reverse d by future adm inistration these groups still advocate the passage of legislation to codify the changes in us encryption policy
