conceptualized and assessed recent c oncern about globalizations impact on us competitiveness has brought to the fore another perceived social benefit of the educational system namely its provision of highly qualif ied workers who enable the nation to sustain its rate of economic grow th the former is an example of non monetary public benefit and the latter of monetary public benefit neither of which individuals ordinarily consider when choosing how much schooling to undertake because they are not rewarded for the positive effects thought to spill over from themselves to others as result of their pursuing additional schoo ling individuals are likely to underinvest in education the ex istence of such spill over benefits ie human capital externalities is key ju stification for government support and promotion of education that may thereby move society toward an optimal level of educational investment but how can it be shown that education per causes human capital externalities rather than other factors some of which are not readily observable for example does the pay gap between colle ge and high school graduates reflect differences between the two in productiv ity due to acquired knowledge or due to innate ability is voter turnout higher am ong the more educated because civics was part of their school curriculum or because th eir parents raised them to take seriously public affairs answers to these questi ons would indicate whether and to what extent education is worthwhile inve stment for both individuals and society voluminous literature on the private monetary return to education has developed over the last 40 years with adva nces in statistical techniques applied to estimation of the earnings premium caused by schooling as recently as the 1990s educations private pecuniary rate of return is estimate d to range from about 6 to 11 which suggests that investing in fo rmal education is comparatively sound financial decision for individuals sc hooling seems even more worthwhile to individuals in light of its nonmonetary returns eg own health although values are rarely developed for th is type of benefit researchers much more recently have focused on determining whether formal education causes public benef its while the number of such empirical studies is increasing estimates of the size of human capital externalities remain scarce due to the daunting analytical task of precisely measuring the monetary and nonmonetary benefits that spill over from highly educated persons to other members of society the results produced thus far are

competition in labour markets can also warrant government involvement and subsidizing edu cation can efficiently counteract the distortions in human capital investment decisions caused by income taxation5 perhaps the most widely known economic justification for public involvement in education is that the total benefits from learning exceed those which accrue solely to the individual making

human capital externalities suggests that government intervention in education can move society toward an optimal efficient result nascent debate has developed in the empirical literature about the size of human capital externalities to date the disagreement is confined to one presumed external benefit namely the contribution of human capital to economic growth this matter is addressed directly later in the report those empirical studies of the educationgrowth nexus that find individuals are by far the major beneficiaries of thei r schooling decisions nonetheless support the conclusion that public expe nditures on education are not wasted that is the social rate of return is positive albeit perhaps small6 put another way formal education does enhance productivity rather than years of schooling merely signaling to potential employers persons inherent characteristics eg motivation ev if educational attainment functions primarily as signal however spending still would not be socially wasteful to the extent that possession of degree permits employers to better screen workers for jobs ie people are more appropriately matched with jobs thereby enhancing productiv ity and economic growth7 for these among other reasons signaling appears to have lost fa vor among economists as useful tool for analyzing educational choices or for policy analysis8 the public benefits of education the public benefits of edu cation can be of monetary nature such as raising national income and the earnings of lesseducated members of society they also can be of nonmonetary nature these nonp ecuniary benefits are more vague and less amenable to quantification than monetary returns if measurement difficulties lead researchers to omit nonmonetary transfers from more educat ed individuals to others the consequences of education for society will be understatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33238crs4 9 small body of literature focuses on twins to ta ke advantage of their shared characteristics eg

unobservable characteristics eg the importance that parents place on civic responsibilities that also affect the return to education eg civic participation expressed differently the iv method removes

journal of public economics vol 88 2004civic participation the development and stability of democratic societies is perhaps one of the most commonly asserted spillover effects of edu cation schools in the united states teach students about the functions of governme nt and make them aware of political community and other social issues schools also attempt to instill in their charges democratic values and be haviors eg support for free speech and tolerance of others adults who have accumulated mo re years of education are presumed able to more readily and intelligently assess competing claims in political campaign literature and evaluate complex ballot initiatives as consequence education is purported to enhance the quantity and quality of civic engagement yet there may be factors individual family and communityspecific that simultaneously influence educational attainme nt and civic behaviors if analyses do not take into account such characteristic s for which there may not be readily observable variables in data sets correlation could be misinterpreted for causality and the public return to schooling could be overstated in the 1990s studies began utilizing methodologies thought to better dis tinguish the unique effects of education on civic participation and on other positive externalities9 the results of one such analysis c onfirm that additional secondary and postsecondary education has large st atistically significant impact on voting behavior10 for example another year of high school attendance increases the likelihood of voting in presidential electi on by almost 7 percentage points college entrance increases the likelihood of register ing to vote by some 22 percentage points education is estimated to significantly ra ise the quality of civic

reducing the probability of incarceration seems strongest among those who comple high school in addition oneyear increase in schooling is estimated to lower by 30 the probability that males will be

educations abling countries to adopt im ported technologies thereby allowing less develope d nations to catchup with more developed nations research also suggests that postsecondary education in particular is im portant to continued growth in more developed nations perh aps because workers must possess some minimum quality level to utilize or develop technological advances these crosscountry

temple growth effects of education and soc ial capital in th oecd countries continue rising over time many analysts question the accuracy of this counterintuitive finding primarily because of measurement error in international databases on education that worsens when change in schooling level over time is the variable of interest16 the macrogrowth literature also may confuse additional education leading to income growth with higher incomes leading to more schooling ie reverse causality the samples of na tions utilized may incl ude unrepresentative outliers that bias the results as well17 moreover in developi ng nations particularly most of the increase in highly educat ed labor has found employment in such industries as government reta il trade and business pers onal and other services where good output measures are lacking in national income and product accounts18 studies that take this approach also generally omit such c ountryspecific institutional characteristics as regulatory structures and political systems for example these among other omitted factors eg the quality of nations educational system presumably cause public rates of return to vary by country and within country over time as the characteristics themselves change19 accordingly the very design of crosscountry studies makes them less useful to policymakers than analyses of their own or similar nations thus for example an analysis of member countries of the organisation for econo mic cooperation and development oecd estimates that increases in persons with postsecondary education in particular have significant and positive effect on economic growth20 another study finds that the significant positive impact of huma n capital on oecd nations adoption of technology from abroad increases the higher the level of schooling in these developed countries21 research suggests however that in oecd nations education policies intended to promote increases in the rate of economic

207an alternative approach that focuses on geographic areas within the united states avoids the abovementioned shortc omings of crosscountry studies it similarly posits that in the presence of externalities greater stock of human capital ie higher average schooling in an area will cause area income from jobs ie average wages to rise above the earni ngs gains accorded more education persons ie the private return to education one analysis utilizes us states as the labor market area of interest it estimates modest imprecise effects of variations in state average schooling levels on state average wages after controlling for individual effects nonetheless the authors note that the social rate of return which they estimate ranges from 1 to 3 is still of sufficient size to justify signif icant public subsidies for education23 as the study is confined to white males aged 4049 secondary educati on and states other analyses that cover different demographi c groups educational vels and geographic areas may yield more substantial social returns indeed another study finds that othe rs do benefit to greater degree from employment in metropolitan ar eas with large shares of workers having postsecondary education specifically one percentage point incr ease in metropolitan areas share of workers with at least college degree raises the earnings of high school dropouts by 19 high school graduates by 16 persons with some college by 12 and the earnings of college gradua tes themselves by 04 beyond the private return to education24 these results imply that the attraction of college educated workers is worthwhile component of publicly funded economic development programs for urban areas n increase in the proportion of college educated persons at the national level is likely to yield such large social returns however because the estimates reflect holdi ng constant the collegeeducated share of workers in all other metropolitan areas like the statebased study di scussed above this analysis also finds that increases at the lower end of the educational distri bution ie greater share of high school graduates in metro area are unlikely to generate large positive externalities perhaps then if human capital is expanded at higher levels of education the benefits of the spillover are in the form of technological progress and higher productivity if human capital is expanded at lower levels the benefits are in the form of reductions in crime and lower welfare participation25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33238crs9 26 other private nonpecuniary benefits include more efficient household management eg greater use of new technologies for the hom among higher educated individuals and attainment of desired family size eg level of educational attainment is directly related to effective use of contraceptivesthe private benefits of education some analysts consider transfers from an educated individual to anyone else to be social benefits others categorize intrafamily transfers eg to children as private benefits this report takes the tter approach researchers also differ in their classification of benefits as mone tary or nonmonetary some regard an individuals compensation earni ngs and benefits to be the sole financial return to education others include bor market advantages more often enjoyed by better paid persons eg less unemployment as monetary benefits this report adopts the latter convention own health better own health probably is the leadin g nonfinancial benef it of education to individuals26 studies find strong positive asso ciation between years of schooling and health status measured in various ways eg selfreported h ealth mortality rates and physiological indicators of health three not mutually exclusive explanations typically are offered for this direct correlation more educated persons are less likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors perhaps because they are better informed about health matters their superior problemsolving skills may enable them to better utilize the health care system as well childhood illness may curtail years spent in school healthier students may more readily add to their human capital and have more years in which to reap the rewards of their additional schooling futureoriented persons ie thos willing to defer rewards are more likely to invest in all types of human capital both education and health the first explanation suggests that more education causes better health in the next explanation causality runs in the opposite direction from better health to more education the final explanation implies there are one or more unobserved factors eg genetic endowment asso ciated with schooling that actually determine health status if such variables are not accounted for educations role in the improvement of health may be overstated the degree to which each explanation is correct has important implications for policymakers if goal is having healthier population in order to min imize medicare and medicaid expenditures for example and causality largely runs from health to education then greater education spending would not be the most efficient means to the goals

not quite statistically significant influence on child educational attainment while fathers schooling has positive and significant impact33 when individuals enter the labor market rather than continuing in school it is unlikely that they consider how their choices will affect the wellbeing of their potential children college education may for example improve parenting skills in the future or the kind of social network to which they can offer their children access some policymakers similarly may not take an intergener ational perspective when developing educational policy if there is public component to this private benefit and it is not recogn ized underinvestment in edu cation over the longrun may result earnings in the nottoodistant past individuals who graduated from high school were considered wellequipped to succeed in the labor market that is obtain comparatively wellpaid jobs that they could remain in for most of their work lives the situation appears to have changed ove r the last few decades when the pace of economic change accelerated the wage gap between less and more educated workers widened as postsecondary ducation became seemingly necessary prerequisite to highp aid secure employment34 although people reportedly think it longer possible to obtain lifetime jobs individuals with postsecondary schooling are regarded as more likely to adjust to technological changes without experiencing unemployment and to be tter rebound from displacement related to international competition for example35 higher education thus appears to have become more important to employment if not job security and to earnings stability over the course of working life the labor market returns to education ty pically are manifested not only through greater probability of high earnings and low unemployment but also through more common employer provision of benefits eg health insu rance and better working conditions but the most studied labor market

comparing anticipated lifetime benefits eg the stream of earnings fro m college graduation to retirement with costs eg earnings forgone while attending college and outofpocket expenses for tuition and books less student aid36 if this comparison yields an anticipated rate of return that exceeds the market interest rate on alternative investments then wealth maximizing individuals are hypothesi zed to continue their schooling empirical studies that utilize variety of statistical techniques estimate the causal effect of education on individual earnings that is the private monetary return to one more year of schoo ling ranges from about 6 to 1137 as this generally compares favorably with the re turn on other investment opportunities the pursuit of additional formal education seems an economically sound choice for the average person the profitability of ducation appears to vary by population subgroup eg income category and gender schooling level colle ge major and type of

recent decades as the increased demand for college educated workers seemingly outpaced their increased supply and estimation of the rate of return is subject to limitations that can bias it downward or upward eg the cost of postsecondary school may be mitted as may unobserved determinants of schooling level neither the quality of education nor the differential probability of unemployment by

own health from an additional year of schooling is worth onetime increase of some 9000 in net family assets while the value of gains in childre ns cognitive development due to parents additional education varies widely it perhap s is equal to an average annual increase in family income of at least 500 and the increas in household efficiency related to another year of schooling is valued at

individuals and society39 concluding remarks voluminous literature on the private ma rketbased return to education has developed over the last 40 year s with advances in statistical techniques applied to estimation of the earnings premium from sc hooling as recently as the 1990s these studies of the causal relationship between schooling and earnings have produced rates of return to education that suggest unde rtaking further formal education is financially worthwhile endeavor for i ndividuals schooling becomes even more beneficial in light of the nonmonetary returns it seemingly accords individuals although values are rarely deve loped for this kind of benefit40 knowledge of the size of the social return to education is important for policymakers in their deliberations over pub lic investment in education visavis other government functions and in thei r deliberations over schooling expenditures by the public sector compared to spending by students and their families in contrast to their longstanding work on private mark etbased rates of return researchers have much more recently focused on the degree to which formal education causes public monetary and nonmonetary benefits the number of such empirical studies is increasing but estimates of the social returns magnitude remain scarce results are inconsistent as well but they do provide evidence of the existence of human capital externalities that is govern ment investment in educa tion is justified although the progress made in estimating the private monetary return to schooling implies that researchers will be able to one day approximate the magn itude of its public return that day may be some time off given the daunting analytical task of precisely measuring the monetary and nonmonetary benefits that spill over from highly educated persons to other members of society
