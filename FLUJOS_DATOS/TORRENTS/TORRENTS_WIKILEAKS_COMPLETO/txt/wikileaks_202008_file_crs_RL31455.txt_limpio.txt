enacted the first sunset law and by 1982 36 states had some version of sunset however state experiences with the sunset review process have proved mixed with some states having formally repealed sunset laws and others having substantially modified the original framework over 70 sunset bills were introduced in the 94th congress proposing various sorts of sunset frameworks hearings were held both in the house and in the senate and s 2925 was reported over 50 sunset measures were introduced in the 95th congress including s 2 which passed the senate 871 and would have required all federal programs except those specifically exempted to be reviewed by congress at least once every 10 years according to an explicit schedule that grouped functionally related activities together in the house the sunrise approach which emphasized clear statements of program goals in new authorizing legislation and detailed reporting requirements containing performance measures to facilitate congressional review of programs developed as complement to sunset in the 96th congress s 2 as passed by the senate in 1978 was reintroduced and again reported among 70 other sunset bills introduced was hr 5858 which incorporated elements both from s 2 and from sunrise proposals and thus was said to represent combined approach to improved oversight sunset measures continued to be introduced in each congress but interest declined in the 1980s when growing federal budget deficits led to preoccupation in congress with appropriations decisions however recently sunset has received renewed attention in the 1990s the enactment of various reform laws such as the government performance and results act of 1993 107 stat 285 which reflected aspects of the sunrise perspective evidenced resurgent concern with oversight of federal programs in 1998 for the first time since 1982 there was hearing on comprehensive sunset review bill hr 2939 and on april 23 2002 house subcommittee held hearing on similar bill hr 2373 modeled on the texas sunset law it would establish 12member bipartisan commission to conduct systematic reviews of all federal agencies and programs on 12year cycle once the sunset commission completed review and sent its report to congress an agency would be eliminated within year or two unless reauthorization measure were enacted at the 2002 hearing the witness from the office of management and budget omb testified in support of sunset review process for the federal government while acknowledging possible constitutional issues to be resolved subsequently detailed in letter from the justice department the omb representative noted that the sunset commission as outlined in the legislation was similar to the proposal for sunset review board endorsed by president bush during

97th into 107th congresses bibliography on sunset legislation with citations for related hearings reports and other congressional documents also is included2 background according to one definition sunset is the popular name for statute which provides for the periodic termination of government agencies unless they are able to justify their existence3 the idea of sunset thus stresses legislative oversight of government agencies so as to further economy and efficiency and control the growth of government or bureaucratic sprawl4 sunset measures typically contain two basic components an actionforcing mechanism carrying the ultimate threat of elimination and framework or guidelines for the systematic review and evaluation of past performance with sunset programs and agencies automatically terminate on periodic basis unless explicitly renewed by law termination of budget authority for program or agency after specified time is perhaps the most commonly employed mechanism other possible actionforcing tools include periodic expiration of the organic statute establishing an agency or of the rules and regulations issued by an agency ideally the timetable for review places functionally related programs on the same schedule 1 for short fact sheet on the subject of sunset review see crs report rs21210 sunset review brief introduction by virginia mcmurtry 2 in conjunction with deliberations on hr 2939 105th congress the federal sunset act of 1998 the house subcommittee on government management information and technology requested that crs prepare statement covering the background and history of federal sunset legislation with the permission of the subcommittee contents from that previous memorandum have been revised and incorporated into this report 3 anthony r licata zero base sunset review harvard journal on legislation vol 14 april 1977 pp 505506 4 see canada library of parliament legislative research service sunset theory and practice by david pond current issue paper 114 ottawa march 1991 p 1 crs2 perhaps the first example in federal legislation of the nascent sunset concept occurred in the federal advisory committee act of 1972 faca5 the sunset provision in faca called for the termination of each advisory committee after two year period unless some other duration was provided in statute or unless it was formally renewed for another two years the sunset idea was refined and popularized by the colorado chapter of the public interest group common cause as consequence of the frustrations experienced in efforts to reform colorados regulatory structure perhaps borrowing from the western imagery of the cowboy riding off into the sunset agencies subject to sunset provisions were to fade into the sunset unless following oversight review the legislature acted to extend their existence or sunset might be viewed as the inescapable end of the day for terminated agencies however the basic rationale underlying the sunset concept was not new in 1976 article by bruce adams then with common cause the sunset mechanism was commended as having the potential to provide the incentive and the discipline necessary to motivate public officials to increase program evaluation but its roots were traced back at least to the administration of president franklin d roosevelt former justice william douglas then chairman of the securities and exchange commission proposed to president roosevelt that every agency should be abolished within ten years of creation the prophetic douglas suggested that otherwise the regulatory agencies would be captured by the very industries they were established to regulate according to douglas roosevelt would always roar with delight at that and of course never did anything about it6 in 1976 colorado became the first state to enact sunset law by 1982 sunset measures had been considered in all 50 state legislatures and 36 states had enacted some version of the sunset review process representing remarkably rapid diffusion of state innovation7 however state experiences proved to be mixed by 1990 12 of the 36 states with sunset laws had ceased the use of this legislative oversight mechanism because of high monetary and temporal costs of sunset review intensive lobbying by vested interests unfulfilled expectations of agency termination low levels of citizen participation and other perceived problems still the study stated results indicate that sunset has resulted in some agency terminations and more importantly numerous substantive procedural and crosscutting modifications aimed at increasing accountability efficiency and effectiveness in state agencies8 according to survey conducted in 1992 by the national conference of state legislatures ncsl states reporting satisfaction and success with sunset have 5 pl 92463 86 stat 770 6 cited by bruce adams in sunset proposal for accountable government administrative law review vol 28 summer 1976 p 520 7 richard c kearney sunset survey and analysis of the state experience public administration review vol 50 janfeb1990 p 49 8 ibid crs3 tended to adapt the process so as to shift the emphasis away from occupational licensing and regulatory boards to major state agencies downplay the goal of terminating agencies use sunset to conduct program evaluation and commit sufficient staff resources to conduct the thorough reviews of agency operations9 unintended consequences of sunset have proved significant as legislatures expand and sharpen oversight capabilities when the lawmakers come to realize that eliminating agencies need not be the only measure of sunsets effectiveness in addition for some states sunset provides the primary mechanism for conducting program evaluation however the ultimate threat of termination even if infrequently employed continues to give the sunset review process special clout since 1978 biennial editions of the book of the states compiled by the council of state

done in attempting to arrive at the most appropriate tabulation of state sunset laws absent new comprehensive survey one can compare the data in 20002001 cosg table with that in the spreadsheet underlying the 2001 ncsl study with reference to the more detailed kearney study published in 1990 for additional background such an approach arrives at the following distribution in 2002 at least 18 states have active sunset laws at least 13 states have repealed suspended or inactive sunset laws while 13 states never enacted sunset laws12 this leaves six states in residual group of maybes13 five of the six maybesare states that repealed or substantially modified their original sunset law but replaced it with some other framework for relatively systematic oversight review14 the record of the sunset process in texas is of special interest both because it is generally recognized as one of the more successful state efforts and because recent federal legislative proposals borrow from that model when reviewing the accomplishments of sunset in texas it is well to recall that the texas sunset 12 states with active sunset laws include alabama alaska arizona california colorado delaware hawaii louisiana maine maryland new mexico ohio oklahoma tennessee texas utah washington and west virginia states that never enacted sunset laws include idaho iowa kentucky massachusetts michigan minnesota mississippi missouri new jersey new york north dakota virginia and wisconsin states with terminated or inactive sunset laws include arkansas montana nebraska nevada new hampshire north carolina oregon pennsylvania rhode island south carolina south dakota vermont and wyoming south carolina requires special mention while it was entered as having an active sunset law in the 2000 cosg table the data for south carolina are identified as coming not from the january 2000 survey but from the prior one in 1998 the response for south carolina in the 2001 ncsl survey falls in the terminated less than five years ago category further research confirmed that the sc sunset law was recently repealed in 1998 13 states placed in the group of maybes with terminated or substantially modified sunset laws replaced by some framework for evaluation reviews include connecticut florida georgia illinois indiana and kansas 14 the maybes also tended to be viewed differently in the cosg and ncsl compilations they were often labeled as having an active sunset law by the cosg table which did not always differentiate between classification of states with original sunset law active as compared with terminatedreplaced framework in use while the krell survey generally identified such instances more accurately as sunset terminated but then replaced states identified as terminatedinactive in the cosg survey but terminatedreplaced in the krell survey were not included here mississippi and new hampshire in some instances one source or the other notes that the evaluation component continues as before but without the automatic termination provision thereby lacking key element of true sunset law georgia indiana kansas finally illinois is placed with the maybes because of discrepancies between the ncsl data respondent answered state never had sunset law while the more thorough 1990 study listed illinois as then inactive the 20002001 cosg table lists illinois as having an active sunset law crs5 advisory commission while ultimately saved by its friends in the texas legislature was nearly abolished in 199315 the web site of the texas advisory commission offers 70page guide to the texas sunset process and reports that since the sunset process began in 1978 44 agencies have been abolished and another 11 agencies have been consolidated16 data are also presented on the fiscal impact of sunset in texas estimates from reviews conducted between 1982 and 2001 indicate potential 19year revenue generation savings of 7199 million compared with expenditures of 1694 million for the sunset commission based on these estimates every dollar spent on the sunset process earns the state 4250 in return17 94th congress 19751976 interest in federal sunset legislation emerged and grew quickly during the 94th congress when many bills were introduced proposing various types of sunset arrangements18 the first federal sunset bill s 2067 limiting the period of authorization of new budget authority and requiring comprehensive review and study of existing programs for which continued budget authority was proposed to be authorized by committees of congress was introduced by senator joseph biden d on july 9 1975 in the senate attention came to focus on s 2925 the government economy and spending reform act bill to provide for the elimination of inactive and overlapping federal programs to require authorizations of new budget authority for government programs and activities at least every four years to establish procedure for zerobased review and evaluation of government programs and activities every four years and for other purposes senator edmund muskie dme introduced s 2925 on february 3 1976 with bipartisan group of six cosponsors including senators william roth rde john glenn doh henry bellmon rok walter huddleston dky sam nunn dga and barry goldwater raz there were seven days of hearings on s 2925 and s 2067 by the

april 23 2002 18 this discussion of legislative history borrows heavily from the authors previous crs work data for the original research were derived from searches in the computerized databases for the respective congresses available through the former scorpio system at the library of congress and from tracking of bills in the congressional record crs6 noted that his support for sunset tied in with his brief but intense experience on the newly created budget committee which brought him to the realization that budget reform must not be viewed as an end in itself but as part of broader effort he continued i have come to believe that matter how successful the new budget process is the statement of national priorities which is the federal budget will not be complete until congress improves control over the services which the budget is intended to buy s 2925 has been offered as framework through which congress can begin to exert such control19 senator roth the ranking minority member on the subcommittee voiced concern also mentioned by others as reason to support sunset the proliferation of federal programs during the past decade congress in its desire to address national legislative priorities has enacted hundreds of new programs aimed at specific social or economic problems each program has added new legislative objectives more spending and an administrative apparatus in the executive branch to achieve the legislative purpose set forth while each of these programs may have considerable merit and while much of our spending for national needs is well spent the practical effect of this proliferation of programs has been chaos20 as the leadoff witness for the senate hearings in 1976 roy ash former director of the office of management and budget omb also considered it noteworthy that s 2925 follows hard on the heels of the highly desirable reforms made in the congressional budget processes he testified further authorizing programs and appropriating money is not enough for each program the simple questions to be kept in front of us are what are we trying to accomplish how much will it cost is it worth it are we actually accomplishing what we intended should we change something in order to achieve better match of objectives and results this is the closed circle model of program management in its essence21 after acknowledging his full agreement with the principles and philosophy underlying s 2925 ash offered some suggestions for improving the mechanisms involved in so doing his testimony provided preview of the 33 witnesses who followed almost everyone supported sunset principles but had some problem with details of the procedural framework ie sunset mechanics for example comptroller general elmer staats and others from the general accounting office gao supported the purposes of sunset but then provided detailed comments on possible technical problems and raised concerns with workload issues for tasks assigned in the bill to gao as well as for congressional committees 19 us congress senate committee on government operations government economy and spending reform act of 1976 hearings on s 2925 and s 2067 94th cong 2nd sess mar

committee the senate government operations committee then voted unanimously to report s 2925 favorably with additional amendments on august 4 1976 the bill as reported retained its two key sunset components termination of federal programs unless periodically reauthorized coupled with mandatory review of programs grouped functionally by congressional committees specifically the measure directed the compilation of an inventory of all federal programs established multiyear schedule for review of programs grouped by functional budget categories and prohibited the obligation or expenditure of new budget authority for any program not specifically reauthorized under the sunset rubric however significant changes occurred as result of full committee amendments including extending the review and termination cycle from four to five years extending the coverage of the sunset review process to tax expenditure provisions and adding new title to create temporary hoovertype commission to study the organization of the government and recommend program changes consolidations and eliminations on the day it was reported from the senate government operations committee s 2925 was rereferred to the committee on rules and administration and to the committee on finance following hearing on september 8 1976 the rules committee voted unanimously to report the bill without recommendation on september 20 as explained at the beginning of the report the committee is reporting s 2925 without prejudice but is strongly advising the senate that much more time than is available in this congress should be devoted to the consideration of this apparently desirable but most farreaching proposal22 at the beginning of september 1976 senate majority leader mike mansfield dmt announced the leaderships intention to consider s 2925 on the floor later in the month the bill by this time had 55 cosponsors however given the numerous reservations on procedural grounds outlined in the report of the senate rules committee and other concerns expressed by the finance committee along with the shortness of time remaining in the session it was ultimately decided not to schedule floor action on the bill in the house during the 94th congress hr 12055 companion bill to s 2925 was introduced by representative stephen neal dnc on february 24 1976 and referred to the rules committee but further action occurred on it the house rules committee did hold hearing on related bill hr 11734 dealing with zero base budgeting the task force on the budget process of the house budget committee also held three

bill similar to s 2925 as reported in the 94th congress senator muskie again introduced the bill but this time there were 41 cosponsors at the outset and eventually 62 senators signed on as cosponsors spanning wide ideological spectrum the short title of s 2 as introduced was sunset act of 1977 but it was changed more than once during subsequent consideration in the senate the senate subcommittee on intergovernmental relations held six days of hearings on s 2 in march 1977 and on april 28 1977 voted favorably to refer the bill as amended to the full committee action by the governmental affairs committee occurred on june 28 1977 and concluded with unanimous vote to report the bill favorably with additional amendments including renaming it as the program evaluation act of 1977 one amendment relating to the review and evaluation provisions reflected compromise between those who contended that sunset must be comprehensive and those who argued that to be effective sunset must be selective under title i all programs which are to be reauthorized must first be reconsidered by the authorizing committees with an eye toward answering certain basic questions about the program under title iii the senate and house committees can select from among these programs few which they believe ought to receive special attention thus the bill guarantees that the application of the sunset process can be both comprehensive in its requirement for reauthorization and selective in the program areas subject to intensive evaluation23 other amendments to s 2 adopted by governmental affairs lengthened the sunset review cycle to six years deleted the title covering tax expenditure provisions exempted regulatory functions and the federal judiciary from sunset review and added language protecting civil rights enforcement by unanimous consent the senate then rereferred s 2 to the committee on rules and administration on july 20 1977 the committee commenced hearings on september 28 1977 and established working group consisting of staff from the various senate committees to consider s 2 and s 1244 the reintroduced biden bill which limited all authorizations to duration of four fiscal years except in special circumstances and required comprehensive review and extensive reports by committees before they authorized new budget authority the staff working group met regularly over period of several months and their recommendations were published as committee print key features in their draft measure titled senate program review reforms of 1978 included requirements for senate committees to study all programs falling under their jurisdiction and draw up 10year plans to review all significant programs and to publish review schedules for each session in addition for each new or reauthorized program committees were to specify the program objectives review criteria and techniques and review necessary 23 us congress senate committee on governmental affairs program evaluation

s 1244 introduced by representative butler derrick d sc this sunrise approach emphasized clear statements of program goals in new authorizing legislation and detailed reporting requirements containing performance measures to facilitate congressional review of programs24 since many bills came to incorporate features of both sunrise and sunset the sunset label is generally used in discussions to encompass all such related legislative measures on april 19 1978 the senate rules and administration committee resumed hearings and turned to the recommendations of the staff working group at this point the committee also requested another study by the comptroller general to review the various alternative proposals for sunset and program review at hearing on june 8 with the gao report now in hand25 the rules and administration committee requested that gao staff along with representatives of senator muskie and of senator biden meet and draft compromise sunset bill agreeable to all of them on june 21 1978 the rules committee met to mark up s 2 and by vote of 52 reported favorably s 2 as amended by the committee substitute which had been previously amended by the committee26 among many significant changes in s 2 as reported by the rules committee the reauthorization schedule was lengthened to 10 years five congresses contemporaneous article appearing in congressional quarterly provided this perspective on the rules committees consideration of sunset legislation in the 95th congress in 1977 s 2 had little trouble winning approval from the governmental affairs committee but muskie could not persuade rules committee chairman howard w cannon dnev to set deadline for committee action cannon opposed automatic termination of federal programs which muskie considered the heart of the bill when cannon moved over to chair the senate commerce committee in 1978 muskie found more sympathetic leader on rules but the new chairman claiborne pell dri still took several months to move s 2 through committee27 supporters of sunset in the senate faced additional challenges once the rules committee had reported s 2 as amended apparently both majority leader robert byrd dwv and majority whip alan cranston dca among others still had reservations about sunset and wanted to see some further changes in s 2 according to the same congressional quarterly article they 24 crs report

continued funding of program one year past its sunset date if the programs reauthorization bill ran up against veto or filibuster28 following further negotiations senator muskie introduced an amendment in the nature of substitute for s 2 on september 26 1978 however by this time supporters of s 2 found themselves in the same position as senate sunset proponents in the 94th congress fierce competition to bring bill to the floor in the final days of the session especially for measure on which the house had yet to act three days before scheduled adjournment on october 11 1978 opportunity came for senate floor action with an agreement in place for limited debate and more than half the senators as cosponsors the senate passed s 2 by vote of 871 as passed by the senate s 2 would have required that all federal programs except those specifically exempted be reviewed by congress at least once every 10 years on an explicit schedule to that end the bill would have made it out of order to consider authorizations longer than 10 years linked reauthorizations to the schedule by making it out of order to consider authorizations beyond programs next scheduled reauthorization date

to congressional procedures including some sunset bills on october 12 1978 following senate passage s 2 was referred in the house jointly to the committees on government operations and on rules but further action occurred 96th congress 19791980 congressional interest in sunset and sunrise measures continued in the 96th congress in the senate s 2 was reintroduced with the same bill number the only change was an updating of the program review schedule similar bill was introduced in the house as hr 2 the house version of sunset however included tax expenditures along with spending programs

senator max baucus dmt in the house the newly created subcommittee on the legislative process chaired by representative gillis long dla began hearings on sunset sunrise and related bills which had

bill was characterized as combination approach to improved oversight borrowing both from sunset hr 2 and sunrise hr 65 from hr 2 we adopted the idea of an oversight agenda and the role given committees in setting review priorities from hr 65 we included the establishment of performance measures from both bills we included the compilation of program inventory most important program or tax expenditure will terminate automatically committees will have the opportunity to conduct thorough review and the congress will have the opportunity to vote on committee recommendations this feature allows us to include all programs and tax expenditures without exemptions 30 the subcommittee referred hr 5858 as amended back to the full rules committee on may 6 1980 but further action occurred in the house in the 96th congress in the senate the governmental affairs committee held seven days of hearings on sunset during june july and september 1979 on june 17 1980 the committee voted favorably to report s 2 with further amendments among the changes approved by the committee were the addition of expedited procedures for consideration of sunset reauthorization bills simplification of reporting requirements and addition of the decennial census and patent protection programs to the list of those exempted from sunset review of special interest in light of legislative developments in the house the senate governmental affairs committee added new title to s 2 to be called sunrise and embodying two basic features 1 congress should state specific legislative objectives when enacting new legislation or reauthorizing existing programs and 2 agencies should report back to congress on their success in reaching specified program objectives31 specifically the provision made it out of order to consider legislation authorizing new budget authority for program unless the measure contained the sunrise requirements in language prescient of framework eventually refined and enacted in

reached the floor as characterized in the 1980 cq almanac sunset legislation once great bipartisan hope for reining in the galloping growth of federal bureaucracy in the 96th congress faded in the 96th congress the bills failure was forecast when the senate rules committee voted sept 4 to recommend substitute for the sunset bill that vitiated most of the strength of the original proposal s 2 which mandated review of most government programs every 10 years before they could be continued the revised version still carried the name sunset but removed the elements which the senate governmental affairs committee called the key to the bill governmental programs would have to be reviewed programs would die automatically if not reauthorized committees would be free to choose the programs they wished to review subject to the approval of the appropriate house of congress in short the sun would set only when congress said it should33 although the action by the senate in passing s 2 in 1978 ultimately proved to be the closest congress ever came to enacting federal sunset law sunset measures during this period received continuing support from the carter administration candidate jimmy carter endorsed the idea of sunset laws during the 1976 campaign and reaffirmed this commitment on various occasions for example in his 1979 state of the union address he stated my administration will again work with the congress to enact sound sunset bill under such bill each federal program would have to be carefully re examined on periodic basis to determine whether its continued existence is justified through such procedure the american people can be assured that unnecessary government programs and agencies will be ended rather than continued through the force of inertia and other programs and agencies will be improved34 later in the spring of 1979 as the house rules committee commenced hearings on sunset legislation president carter issued statement in support of sunset review legislation and hr 2 specifically noting in part 32 ibid 33 sunset legislation congressional quarterly almanac vol 36 1980 p 530 34 us president carter the state of the union public papers of the

government more efficient more economical and more responsive that is why i have long supported the sunset approach35 subsequent developments sunset measures have continued to be introduced in every congress from the 97th through the 107th there were additional hearings by the house rules subcommittee on the legislative process in 19811982 however interest in sunset measures declined in the 1980s when growing federal budget deficits led to preoccupation in congress with appropriations decisions as result the authorization phase of the budget process so central to the sunset framework received relatively less attention in the 1990s the environment was changing enactment of various government reform laws such the government performance and results act of 199336 evidenced resurgent concern with oversight of federal programs for the first time in many years the federal budget showed surplus for fy1998 such circumstances with deficit reduction longer the overriding preoccupation in the budget process arguably allowed more time for consideration of authorization bills along with the annual appropriations measures renewed interest in sunset accompanying these developments there appeared to be renewed interest in the sunset concept for example at the end of 1997 an article appeared in insight on the news titled sunset bills rise over capitol hill37 the next year for the first time since 1982 there was congressional hearing on comprehensive sunset bill38 held toward the end of the 105th congress by the house subcommittee on government management information and technology39

to provide for the periodic review of the efficiency and public need for federal agencies to establish commission for the purpose of reviewing the efficiency and public need of such agencies and to provide for the abolishment of agencies for which public need does not exist was introduced by representative kevin brady rtx and eventually had more than 80 cosponsors modeled on the state sunset process in texas the bill called for establishment of 12member federal agency sunset commission to review and make recommendations at least every 12 years regarding the reorganization or abolishment of each federal agency with the schedule for review to be determined by the commission the speaker of the house and the majority leader of the senate were to appoint the members each naming four congressional members and two private citizens with experience in the operation and administration of government programs each agency was then to be abolished later than year after completion of the review by the commission unless congress acted to continue the agency criteria for review by the commission were set forth including the extent to which the agency was complying with the provisions of the government performance and results act at the hearing on hr 2939 held on september 14 1998 testimony was received from congressman brady and other members in support of the bill from patricia gray then vicechair of the texas sunset commission and from edward deseve ombs acting deputy director for management ms gray stressed that sunset is process rather than an event her statement provided examples of how sunset had been used as tool for uncovering fraud waste and abuse she also noted the value of sunset reviews in locating duplication of services as well as highlighting discrepancies and gaps in services in sum according to ms gray the sunset process is an efficient way to respond to increased public demand for accountability from elected officials40 mr deseve from omb testified that the clinton administration opposed the bill in their view the provisions of hr 2939 raise serious constitutional concerns are counterproductive to many recent improvements congress and the administration have made to support government reform and accountability and duplicate existing structures for evaluating agency performance on the part of authorizing and appropriating committees of congress as well as by the executive branch41 arguably the most serious criticism of the bill raised at the 1998 hearing concerned potential constitutional problems with the commission framework an 39

39 crs16 advisory opinion from the department of justice provided for the record referenced the ins v chada decision by the supreme court in 1983 and concluded because this bill hr 2939 would allow the abolishment of statutorily created executive agency not through legislation passed in conformity with article i but at the discretion and in accordance with timetable imposed by twelvemember commission composed of eight members of congress and four persons selected by the speaker of the house and the majority leader unless congress affirmatively decides to adopt legislation preserving the agency it violates the constitutionally required separation of powers42 similarly examination of the bill by the american law division of the congressional research service ended with this view as noted above the statutory scheme proposed by the federal sunset act hr 2939 is suspect due to the circumvention of the bicameralism and presentment requirements of article i in light of the supreme courts ruling in ins v chada and subsequent cases it seems that the federal sunset act in its present form constitutes an impermissible assignment of legislative authority and will not survive constitutional scrutiny43 in the 106th congress congressman brady along with 92 cosponsors introduced hr 2128 revised version of the sunset commission legislation this new bill contained provisions not found previously in hr 2939 first new subsection was added under review and abolishment of federal agencies relating to extensions that would have allowed the deadline for abolishment of the agency absent congressional action to reauthorize it to be extended for an additional two years if approved by supermajority of the house and the senate second new section was added providing for compilation by the three congressional support agencies of program inventory in language reminiscent of federal sunset measures dating back to the 1970s the section would have directed the comptroller general of the general accounting office and the director of the congressional budget office in cooperation with the director of the congressional research service to prepare an inventory of federal programs within each agency for the purpose of advising and assisting congress and the commission in carrying out the requirements of the act on june 28 2001 congressman brady with 33 cosponsors reintroduced virtually the same bill now called the abolishment of obsolete agencies and federal sunset act of 2001 in the 107th congress as hr 2373 on april 23 2002 the house government reform subcommittee on civil service census and agency organization held hearing on hr 2373 at which representative brady and representative jim turner dtx who had both served in the texas legislature testified in favor of the bill unlike the omb representative of the clinton 42 letter from william michael treanor deputy assistant attorney general dated sept 21 1998 see ibid pp 5354 43 crs memorandum constitutionality of hr 2939 by t j halstead p 4 prepared oct 26 1998 at the request of the house committee on government reform and oversight used with permission of the committee crs17 administration in 1997 the witness from the office of management and budget now representing the bush administration testified in general support of sunset review process for the federal government while acknowledging possible constitutional issues to be resolved subsequently detailed in letter from the justice department44 the omb spokesman noted that the sunset commission as outlined in the legislation was similar to the proposal for sunset review board that president bush endorsed during the 2000 campaign further according to the testimony from omb sunset review process could tie in with the presidents management agenda particularly in the governmentwide initiative for budget and performance integration45 three witnesses from the private sector also testified in favor of the measure46 afterword the initial enthusiasm with which the sunset review process was greeted in the 1970s has been tempered by mixed experiences in the states from high of 36 states with some sort of sunset process in the early 1980s the number has declined to fewer than 20 that have indisputable sunset review provisions still operating in 2002 of course from the outset sunset laws varied greatly among the states in terms of comprehensiveness types of agencies or programs covered as well as regularity reviews on predictable fixed schedule versus sporadic evaluations the record of the sunset process in texas is of particular interest because sunset review there is considered among the most expansive in the nation according to presentation at the national conference of state legislatures annual meeting in 2001 overall the sunset review process has been very successful in texas due to several factors including strong legislative support and the fact that all state agencies are subject to this type of review47 in assessing whether sunset remains an effective and necessary tool ken levine assistant director texas sunset advisory commission suggested looking at whether the sunset review makes government work better smarter and faster saves money and continues to challenge the status quo and eliminate bureaucratic inertia48 as noted already recent federal bills borrow from the texas model and president bush has endorsed sunset review in texas as successful approach that should be initiated as well at the federal level 44 daniel j bryant assistant attorney general department

initial problems and experiences with sunset review have led to unanticipated consequences for example experience with sunset led colorado the state that pioneered the process to expand its legislative oversight function as lawmakers came to realize the eliminating agencies was not the only measure of sunsets effectiveness another state that significantly revamped its sunset process is washington as originally established in 1977 the process focused mainly on minor or inactive programs so most sunset studies had little impact performance was also often difficult to assess due to lack of measures or data the sunset process was scheduled to expire in june 2000 but rather than terminating it the decision was make to streamline and strengthen the process the new law sought to place greater responsibility on agencies to demonstrate performance results by requiring them to submit performance measures and data collection plans to the joint legislative audit and review committee jlarc49 comprehensive sunset law for the federal government has been the subject of continuing interest for nearly three decades most recently there was hearing by house subcommittee in april 2002 but such legislative proposal has progressed further than passage by one house the senate in 1978 however as noted above the 1993 enactment of the government performance and results act gpra evidenced renewed concern with oversight of federal programs gpra joined number of other budget and financial management reform laws designed to upgrade existing procedures or to provide new mechanisms for managing government operations and improving transparency50 in addition to their impact on executive management and accountability these statutes provide new or enhanced data and information about federal programs and performance in turn they establish new mechanisms and means for congressional oversight or the review monitoring and supervision of the implementation of public policy51 at the recent hearing on hr 2373 the omb representative referred to the presidents management agenda and the initiative directed to budget and performance integration with the related aim of improving programs by focusing on results he noted ombs ongoing effort to assess program effectiveness and further observed the sunset review board or commission we contemplate would provide additional support tangible recommendations pertaining to the assessment process 49 ibid improving the sunset process in washington state by val ogden slides available at
