to sabina duerr gerber date 23 april 1999 from tia healy trust department telephon345 949 7212 fax 345 949 0993 subject lotty smolka trust dear sabina we have looked at the fee situation for lotty smolka trust and attach breakdown hereto we concur that the amount overcharged re the insurance policies is chf2199667 around us17600 as you mentioned when based on the premiums paid and not the face value of the policies we have never charged on the cash value of the policies however the us600000 loan to ruth smolka was not taken into account when calculating the 1997 fees and has now been included additionally for the years under dispute we did not include the values of the shares in elbora we have just received the annual accounts for the years in question and have assumed that we held the entire issued share capital we have adjusted the fees accordingly the accounts for elbora show loan from the lotty smolka trust as the corresponding loan to elbora has not been shown as an asset for the trust we have adjusted the net value of the company accordingly furthermore the fees were agreed at special rate of 01 which as you can see from the attached represents significant shortfall when compared to our standard fee schedule we have estimated that over the past six years there should have been around 64 hours charged in time spent the majority of these hours would be related to correspondence to and from the insurance companies mr smolka and the various advisors in relation to the life policies the time spent works out at little over 10 hours year which we consider to be very conservative estimate i note from the trust creation questionnaire that accounts for the trust were to be prepared by dr thomas baers office to date we have not received any of these accounts we would appreciate your assistance in getting them i also note that the fees were specially arranged as bank julius baer co ltd zurich would be receiving full portfolio management fees and that those fees were chf12001195 for 1998 we would suggest that if mr smolka persists in claiming for the fees charged for the past three years that we might come to some arrangement with bank julius baer co ltd zurich we do not believe that the fees should be refunded if anything we have still undercharged based on time spent if the fees for next year are to be charged on the value of the premiums paid they will fall under our minimum fee we will also be charging time spent we would appreciate your comments kindest regards tia healy cc dchvm lotty smolka trust up to 1996 fees were calcula ted on the us11 million paid in premium s on the life policie s from 1996 charged on the face value of the policie s chf 1996 chf 1997 chf 1998 chf portfol 8098954 8773643 11222475 io 00 00 00 value insuran 7382913 8666898 10048256 ce face 75 75 00 value 15481867 17440541 21270731 75 75 00 fee 1548187 1744054 2127073 portfol 8098954 8773643 11222475 io 00 00 00 value insuran 1265000 1485000 13514000 ce 00 00 0 premium s pd chf 9363954 10258643 12573875 11 00 00 00 million fee b 936395 1025864 1257388 scale 2590989 2814661 3393469 pre mar 1999 differe 611791 718190 869686 21996 nce 67 between and b since having the shares we should have charged on the asset value of elbora also 311295 chf 240047601 240048 64 311296 chf 2471263 247126 12 311297 chf 2507423 250742 7379 26 16 for 1997 the usd600000 as loan to rs should have been included usd600000 usd60000 1485 891 01 13726 51 time spent charges absorbe d by trustee s under special fee arrange ments hours jan99 review 5 and executi on of deed of indemni ty and release dec 98 prepara 2 jan tion of 99 account documen tation for transfe r of assets to ms rs jan99 prepara 1 tion of account opening forms for ogilvie securit jan99 prepara 1 tion of documen tation relatin g to loan of usd600 000 to ms rs199 7 jan95 1st 5 amendme nt to ls trust ongoing communi 50 cation and corresp ondence with insuran ce compani re life policie s over 64 past 6 years 25000 16000 00 138 22080 00 chfusd 311298 fees 83534 due to 9 trustee s
