categories discretionary spending mandatory spending and net interest mandatory spending includes federal government spending on entitlement programs and food stamps as well as other budget outlays controlled by laws other than appropriation acts entitlement programs such as social security and medicare make up the bulk of mandatory spending other mandatory sp ending programs include temporary assistance for needy families tanf supplemental security income ssi unemployment insurance some veterans benefits federal employee retirement and disability food stamps and the earned income tax credit eitc discretionary spending is provided and controlled through appropriations acts mandatory spending accounts for over half of total federal spending and almost ninth of gross domestic product gdp social security accounts for over fifth of federal spending medicare and the federal share of medicaid the fastest growing components of mandatory spending together account for over fifth of federal spending those three programs therefore make up over 40 of federal spending the composition of mandatory spending has changed significantly over the past 40 years in 1962 before the 1965 creation of medicare and medicaid mandatory spending was less than 30 of all federal spending at that time social security accounted for about half of all mandatory spending by 2008 mandatory spending composed 54 of total federal spending medicare and medicaid grew from almost nothing in 1965 to about 46 of gdp in 2008 similarly social security grew from 25 of gdp in 1962 to 43 in 2008 ssi outlays have remained between 02 and 03 of gdp federal spending has outrun federal revenues for the last six years in the long term projections suggest that if current policies remain unchanged the united states faces major fiscal imbalance largely due to rising health care co sts and impending baby bo omer retirements over the next 75 years growth in medicare and medicaid is projected to be the largest contributor to the longterm fiscal shortfall medicare and the federal portion of medicaid spending is projected to expand from 46 of gdp in 2008 to 185 in 2082 according to congressional budget office cbo extended baseline projection social security is projected to grow from 43 of gdp in 2008 to 64 of gdp by 2082 thus funding health care costs while the us population ages promises to strain federal budgets in coming decades because discretionary spending is now at historic low as proportion of total federal outlays some budget experts contend that any significant reductions in federal spending must include cuts in entitlement spending other budget and social policy experts contend that cuts in entitlement spending could compromise their goals the economic security of the elderly and the poor proposals for fundamental reform may strive to ease longterm fiscal strains while preserving the social protection goals of these programs this report will be updated annually

government spending on entitlement programs and food stamps as well as other budget outlays controlled by laws other than appropriation acts entitlement programs such as social security and medicare make up the bulk of mandatory spending congress sets eligibility requirements and benefits for entitlement programs rather than appropriating fixed sum each year therefore if the eligibility requirements are met for specific mandatory program outlays are made automatically other mandatory spending programs include temporary assistance for needy families tanf supplemental security income ssi unemployment insurance certain veterans benefits federal employee retirement and disability food stamps and the earned income tax credit eitc mandatory spending also includes many smaller budgetary items such as salaries of members of congress the president and federal judges in fy2008 mandatory spendingtotaling 112 of gross domestic product gdp overshadowed discretionary spendings 79 share of gdp in addition federal net interest payments accounted for 17 of gdp that is over half of all federal spending in fy2008 total federal spending represented 209 of gdp was spent on mandatory programs the congressional budget office cbo projects that mandatory spending will continue to account for over half of all federal outlays in the coming decade mandatory spending according to cbo currentlaw projections will be about 60 of total spending in 2018 the federal government spends more on mandatory items than on discretionary items mandatory spending was 54 of federal spending in 2008 discretionary spending in 2008 totaled just under 40 and net interest payments accounted for the remaining portion of spending social security medicare and the federal share of medicaid alone composed over 40 of all federal spending social security outlays in 2008 were 386 of mandatory spending and income support programs accounted for 144 of mandatory spending mandatory spending plays major role in larger fiscal trends during the 1950s and 1960s federal deficits were relatively small and except for two years below 2 of gdp the total federal deficit jumped from 12 of gdp in fy2007 to 32 of gdp in fy2008 in large part due to financial turmoil and recession during economic downturns government revenues fall and expenditures rise as more people become eligible for mandatory programs such as unemployment insurance and income support programs causing deficits to increase or surpluses to shrink these effects known as automatic stabilizers provide countercyclical fiscal stimulus in the short run without the need for new legislative action this report reviews trends in mandatory spending since 1962 cbo baseline projections of mandatory spending which extend to 2018 as well as extended baseline projections through 2082 are used to consider the longterm consequences of current mandatory spending policies 1 the report looks at mandatory spending and how it has grown

other than appropriations acts such laws usually specify an obligation on the part of the federal government to spend funds for certain purposes in most cases the authorizing law requires in the form of an eligibility criteria and benefit formula payment to an individual or entity eg state mandatory spending typically is provided in permanent or multiyear appropriations contained in the authorizing law and therefore the funding becomes available automatically each year without legislative action by congress in contrast discretionary spending is provided and controlled through the annual appropriations process 2 net interest payments which are automatically authorized are often reported as separate category portion of entitlement spending such as for medicaid and certain veterans programs is funded in annual appropriations acts such entitlement spending is referred to as appropriated entitlements the level of spending for appropriated entitlements like other entitlements is based on the benefit and eligibility criteria established in law the amount of budget authority provided in appropriations acts for these specific programs is based on meeting projected spending levels since the authorizing legislation effectively determines the amount of budget authority required the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 pl 101508 classified appropriated entitlement spending as mandatory 3 not all mandatory spending funds entitlement programs for example the forest service makes some payments to states that are mandatory but are not entitlements some agencies gained authority to sign contracts or create obligations in other ways which gao has termed backdoor spending authority4 those obligations become part of mandatory spending unless limited by the bea or other budget legislation as noted above salaries of members of congress the president and federal judges are also deemed mandatory mandatory spending is offset by certain fees and payments which are counted as offsetting receipts rather than as revenue marketlike charges such as medicare part deductibles and medicare part b premiums are considered offsetting receipts some intragovernmental transfers such as agency rents paid to the general services administration gsa are also counted as offsetting receipts by the recipient agency payments by medicare beneficiaries and the federal governments tax and pension contributions in its role as an employer comprise the largest component of offsetting receipts within the mandatory spending category table 1 presents components of projected mandatory spending in 2008 and cbo baseline projections for mandatory spending in fy2018 2 for more information on discretionary spending trends see the appendix 3 for

mandatory spending has taken up larger and larger share of the federal budget over time mandatory spending minuscule before the great depression grew over time with enactment of the social security act of 1935 pl 74271 and generation later with the medicare act of 1965 pl 89975 in 1962 three years before the creation of medicare and medicaid less than 30 of all federal spending was mandatory at that time social security accounted for about half of all mandatory spending6 in the mid1970s growth of mandatory spending as share of total federal spending slowed since then mandatory spending has increased its share of federal spending at gradual pace figure 1 shows mandatory spending since 1962 and cbo baseline projections for these components to 2018 both expressed as percentage of total federal spending mandatory spending was about quarter of total federal spending in 1962 nearly third if offsetting receipts are excluded in 1968 mandatory spending began growing relative to total federal spending and by 1975 accounted for about 45 of total spending about half before offsetting receipts from the mid1980s through 1990 mandatory spendings share in total spending remained relatively steady before starting to grow again after 1990 in 2008 mandatory spending accounted for 537 of total spending or 60 before offsetting receipts 5 officially titled social security amendments of 1965 6 this and subsequent calculations subtract offsetting recei pts from mandatory spending and so are comparable to those in table 1 in fy2008 offsetting receipts were 112 of mandatory spending before subtraction of offsetting receipts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33074g15g138g151g141g138g157g152g155 g162g561g21g153g142g151 g141g146g151g144 g561g21g146g151g140g142g561g343 g351

rojections to the right of dotted line mandatory spending plays major role in larger fiscal trends during the 1950s and 1960s federal deficits were relatively small and below 2 of gdp except for two years while the fy2007 deficit was 12 of gdp the fy2008 deficit was 32 in large part due to financial turmoil and recession during economic downturns government revenues fall and expenditures rise as more people qualify for unemployment insurance and income support programs causing deficits to increase or surpluses to shrink these effects known as automatic stabilizers provide countercyclical stimulus in the short run without the need for new legislative action discretionary spending as share of total federal expenditures has fallen for several reasons first defense spending generally has taken smaller share of the federal budget since world war ii despite recent increases in military spending second budget limits or caps in the 1990s held down discretionary spending and so discretionary spending fell as proportion of total federal spending third rising mandatory spending has decreased discretionary spendings share in total federal spending

composition of mandatory spending has changed dramatically over the past 40 years and according to cbo baseline projections will to continue to change over the decade figure 2 shows how major components of mandatory spending have evolved since 1962 persistent increases in health care spending have been particularly important driver of mandatory spending trends indigent health care programs before the 1965 medicare act folded them into medicaid accounted for less than 05 of mandatory spending since enactment of the 1965 medicare act the medicare and medicaid programs have composed growing share of mandatory spending medicare and medicaid spending grew from 155 of mandatory spending in 1970 to 414 in 2008 cbo baseline projections show further increases in federal health

spending to continue to rise as an example by 2018 based on cbo baseline projections medicare is projected to account for 321 of mandatory spending and medicaid is projected to account for an additional 162 in contrast to growing per capita health care spending social securitys share of outlays is projected to remain essentially flat as share of mandatory spending from 39 in fy2008 to 40 in fy2018 the cbo baseline intended as neutral starting point for the estimation of budgetary effects of legislative changes is not best guess of the likely future trajectory of the economy cbo baseline projections according to most budget experts may tend to understate the growth of discretionary spending as share of total federal spending and therefore may overstate the future growth of mandatory spending7 cbo baseline projections assume that discretionary spending will increase at the rate of inflation over the projection period8 in the past nondefense discretionary spending has grown roughly as fast as overall economic growth if discretionary spending grew as fast as overall economic growth rather than at the rate of inflation as in the cbo baseline projections discretionary spending would account for 79 of federal spending in 2018 rather than the 68 in the cbo baseline projections9 7 cbo baseline projections start with congresss most recent budgetary decisions and then assume that policy changes will be made over the projection period for ma ndatory programs the cbo baseline assumes current laws continue unchanged 8 while some budget enforcement legislation

mandatory spending including offsetting receipts about 1 of gdp remained around 10 of the economy social security spending grew relative to the economy from 25 of gdp in 1965 to its peak of 49 of gdp

increases on unemployment insurance and some meanstested programs such as food stamps spending on income support programs therefore has been more volatile than social security and medicare spending because income support spending is more closely tied to economic fluctuations in the 1960s income support programs accounted for about 1 of gdp or less in the wake of the 19741976 recession and the 1974 creation of the supplemental security income ssi program income support spending rose to over 2 of gdp in recent years income support spending has hovered around 15 of gdp and has been projected

federal spending and gdp for four reasons first discretionary spending defined as nonentitlement spending that is provided through appropriations acts has fallen relative to mandatory spending defense expenditures once dominated domestic discretionary spending but now accounts for relatively smaller share of federal spending defense discretionary expenditures as share of gdp have trended downwards since the height of the vietnam war in the late 1960s despite temporary increases during the late 1970s and early 1980s even with recent increases in defense spending due to military action in afghanistan and iraq defense spending which accounted for 4 of gdp in 2005 took up less than half the share of the economy that it did in the late 1960s these trends in discretionary spending are

domestic discretionary spending has been relatively stable as share of gdp compared to mandatory spending which has grown more quickly domestic discretionary spending about 25 of gdp in the early 1960s rose to about 45 of gdp in the mid1970s partly due to expansion of social spending and partly because of the severity of the 19741975 recession in the 1980s domestic discretionary spending as share of gdp fell and budget limits or caps helped restrict growth in discretionary spending in the 1990s due to slight increases in the last half dozen years domestic discretionary spending is just over 35 of gdpits approximate share httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33074g15g138g151g141g138g157g152g155 g162g561g21g153g142g151 g141g146g151g144 g561g21g146g151g140g142g561g343 g351 g348g344g561 g561

discretionary spending just under 1 of gdp in 1962 has declined to 03 of gdp in recent years11 third the number of beneficiaries of entitlement programs has grown as the average age of population has risen the medicare act of 1965 extended health benefits for most retirees and greatly expanded federal financial support for indigent health care through the medicaid program other programs such as ssi and the earned income tax credit eitc introduced in the 1970s also increased the number of beneficiaries moreover as life expectancy has increased the proportion of the population older than 85 has so increased which has helped increase social security and medicare spending fourth health care costs per capita have grown far faster than the overall economy new medical technologies transformed health care in the past generation leading to increased costs and more intensive style of medical practice thirdparty reimbursement of health care costs by public and private insurance programs provided consumers and medical providers with few incentives to control costs until the 1980s health care cost growth was slowed by the introduction of medicares prospective payment system for hospitals in 1983 and the expanding market share of health maintenance organizations hmos in th mid1980s attempts to control costs after the 1980s such as the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 have been only temporarily or partially successful in slowing the rate of increase in health care spending

force of the pressures the impending retirement of the large baby boom generation will exert on the federal budget the oldest baby boomers reach age 65 in 2011 and most will not reach age 65 until after 2015 extended baseline projections suggest that social security spending could amount to 64 of gdp by 2080an increase of 2 of gdp from its 2008 level medicare and medicaid spending in large part due to rising health care costs is projected to reach 185 of gdp by 2082 longterm cbo projections using an alternative set of assumptions show medicare and medicaid growing to 193 of gdp by 2080 12 by contrast total federal spending in 2008 was 209 of gdp most fiscal experts assert that avoiding the accumulation of large unsustainable debts will require cuts in entitlement benefits large increases in federal revenues significant reduction in discretionary spending or some mix of those policies because federal deficits and debts have adverse economic consequences including lower economic growth

federal spending mandatory spending has grown relative to the economy even as the size of total federal spending relative to the overall economy has remained roughly constant major entitlement programs play larger and larger part within the category of mandatory spending in 1962 before medicare and medicaid were created social security accounted for just over half of all mandatory spending today social security accounts for slightly less than 40 of mandatory spending medicare and medicaid since their inception have taken up an increasingly large share of mandatory spending together those two programs outlays now exceed social security spending and cbo current law projections indicate they could make up nearly half of mandatory spending in 2018 reducing the federal deficit significantly by cutting spending without reducing mandatory spending and in particular entitlements would be difficult social security medicare and medicaid account for over threequarters of mandatory spending and just under twofifths of total federal outlays focusing budget cuts on the big three programs however could adversely affect the elderly or the poor limiting budget reductions to income support programs such as temporary assistance for needy families tanf ssi and food stamps would not reduce the federal deficit by much as these programs account for about oneseventh of mandatory spending most of the increases in federal spending have been occurring in medicare and medicaid furthermore over the next 75 years the growth in medicare is projected to be the largest contributor to the longterm fiscal shortfall 13 fundamental reform of the health programs may be needed to eliminate longterm fiscal strains while preserving the goals of these programs 13 see crs

through appropriations acts this type of spending funds many of the activities commonly associated with federal government functions such as running executive branch agencies congressional offices and agencies and international operations of the government essentially all spending on federal wages and salaries is discretionary14 discretionary spending is often contrasted with mandatory or direct spending which the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 pl 101508 defines as 1 budget authority provided by law other than appropriation acts 2 entitlement authority and 3 the food stamp program thus

in fy1962 falling to 79 of gdp in fy2008 over time discretionary spending has fallen as percentage of gdp due to its slower growth rate relative to the overall economy in addition rapid growth of

outlays largely contributed to this increase growing at 8 per year in real terms while nondefense discretionary 14 salaries for members of congress the president and federal judges as well as federal retirement and disability costs are classified as mandatory spending 15 for more information see crs report rs20129 entitlements and appropriated entitlements in the federal budget process by bill

defense outlays grew from 30 to 43 of gdp while nondefense outlays grew from 30 to 37 of gdp as the recent expansion in discretionary spending illustrates outlays in some government departments and agencies have grown very slowly or have been cut while spending in other areas has expanded rapidly defense spending rose after the attacks of september 11 2001 and the start of wars in afghanistan and in iraq funding for defense and emergency and disaster management increased sharply in the wake of hurricane katrina boosting overall discretionary spending further in recent years disaster funding has dropped sharply allowing nondefense spending as share of gdp to fall as well the trajectory of future discretionary spending especially as it relates to defense spending depends in large part on the scale of future operations in iraq and afghanistan discretionary spending is likely to rise over the next several fiscal years due to the current economic turmoil and resulting federal interventions to stimulate the economy budget estimates of federal spending and revenues for fy2009 and beyond issued in summer 2008 were rendered largely obsolete by recent economic issues and resulting legislation enacted to reduce the impact of the housing and credit crises new shocks to the financial system and the economy may present congress with new demands for federal responses which will likely affect discretionary spending levels in fy2009 over the longer term projected future growth in entitlement program outlays may put severe pressure on discretionary spending unless policy changes are enacted or federal revenues are increased recent research on longterm fiscal challenges has focused on continued increases in the per beneficiary cost of health care as well as the more predictable demographic changes that will occur as the baby boom generation retires projections from variety of sources predict that spending on medicare and social security will increase sharply as share of gdp in coming decades 17 g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 d andrew austin analyst in economic policy aaustincrslocgov
