for national defense programs in several annual appropriations measures the largest of which is the defense appropriations bill congress also acts every year on national defense authorization bill which authorizes programs funded in several regular appropriations measures the authorization bill addresses defense programs in almost precisely the same level of detail as the defens erelated appropr iations and congressiona l debate about major defense policy and funding issues often occu rs mainly in action on the authorization because the defense authorization and appropriations bills are so closely related this report tracks congressi onal action on both measures the annual defense appropr iations bill provides funds for military activities of the department of defense dod includi ng pay and benefits of military personnelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32305crs2 operation and maintenance of weapons and facilities w eapons procurement and research and development as well as for ot her purposes most of the funding in the bill is for programs administered by the partment of defense though the bill also provides 1 relatively sma ll unclassified amounts for the central intelligence agency retirement fund and intelligence community management 2 classified amounts for national foreign intelligence ac tivities administered by the cia and by other agencies as well as by dod nd 3 very small amounts for some other agencies several other appropr iations bills also provide funds for national defense activities of dod and other agencies see table a2 in the appendix for list and

minimums military base closures the house approved measure in the authorization bill that would lay the next round of military base closures now planned for 2005 until 2007 and that would require number of reports in the inter im by vote of 4947 the senate rejected an amendment to its versi on of the authorization that would have delayed domestic ba closures until 2007 this issue is likely to be major conference item because the administration has threatened veto if the final bill includes delay in base closures1 conference outcome does not agree to the house proposal to delay base

onal debate about the fy2005 defense budget whether congress should provide funding for operations in iraq and afghanistan before early 2005 when the bush administration initially said it planned to request supplemental appropriations in may the administration requested anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32305crs50 additional 25 billion for iraq and afgh anistan which congress subsequently approved in all versions of the annual defense authoriza tion and appropriations bills congress did not however agreed to provide the administration with the extensive flexibility it wanted to allocate the money among accounts number of other issues were also on the agenda including some that were politically contentious this year and some with significant longterm defense policy implications among the key issues for congress were to what extent budget deficits over the next few years might constrain defense spending whether congress should require substantial temporary increase in active duty endstrength particularly in the army to ease pressures on the force caused by ope rations in iraq and afghanistan whether the planned deployment of missile defense test bed with limited operational capability in september or october was scheduled primarily for political rather than for sound technical reasons to what extent major weapons prog rams in all of the services may need to be reined in both b ecause of limits on overall defense spending and because of rapid cost growth in several big projects how the defense departments chan ge in longstanding regulations governing weapons acquisition pro cedures to permit what dod calls evolutionary acquisition is aff ecting managerial controls and congressional oversight over major weapons programs whether congress should provide additional military personnel benefits including 1 access to dodprovided health insurance for nondeployed military reservists and their dependents and 2 increased military retiree survivor benefits whether congress should delay or restrict new round of base closures planned in calendar year 2005 the status of pentagon plans to redeploy us military forcesstationed abroad and the impli cations for congressional oversight and defense budgets how the army plans to manage and to finance farreachingreorganization of its combat forces to increase the number of deployable combat brigades and to turn brigades rather than divisions into the major unit of action in future operations how the defense department is re structuring its civilian personnel system following congresss approva l last year of the pentagons request for broad authority to reform civil service pay and performance rules whether congress should approve the defense departments requestfor changes in environmental ws and regulations governing military training in addition to changes congress approved last year whether department of energy plans to investigate new nuclear weapons including low and variable yield

armed services committee on may 13 2004 deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz said that costs in iraq and afghanistan are running at 455 billion per month an annual rate of 5060 billionwhether congress should require th defense department to begin acquiring boeing kc767 tanker aircraft and whether congress should take st eps to limit foreign military sales offsets or to strengthen buy american requirements the following discussion provides brief background information on each of these issues and discusses cong ressional action to date funding for iraq and afghanistan the administration did not initially reque st funding for ongoing operations in iraq and afghanistan in the regular fy2005 fense bills instead officials said that they expected to request supplemental appropriations for ove rseas operations some time early in calendar ear 2005 po ssibly when the fy2006 budget request is submitted at the beginning of february after considerable debate in congress however on may 12 2004 the white house submitted an amendment to its fy2005 request in which it asked for 25 billion to be appropriated into reserve fund for operations in iraq and afghanistan in early fy20058 two issues remained for congress however one was whether congress should appropriate more than 25 billion since costs in fy2005 are expected to total at least twice as much9 although there was considerable discussion about the issue and several amendments were proposed to dd money the house and senatepassed versions of the authorization and ppropriations bills ll provided 25 billion second issue and in the end the key one was how much flexibility congress would agree to provide the admin istration in alloca ting additional funds the administrations may 12 request would permit the secretary of defense in consultation with the office of management and budget to allocate the funds to any budget account requiring only that the secr etary notify congress five days before transferring the funds many members of congress including the leaders of the appropriations co mmittees said that they were not willing to provide so much flexibility and intended to ensure that funds are available only for specified activities for full discussion see crs report rl32422 the administrations fy2005 request for 25 billion for opera tions in iraq and af ghanist an pr ecedents and options for congress by stephen daggett and amy belasco the debate over funding for iraq nd afghanistan began as soon as the administration presented its budget request when some legislators complained that the administrations failure to request m oney was intended to avoid congressional debate about iraq policy during the pres idential election campaign to obscure the wars longterm costs and to understate the size of projected federal budget deficitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32305crs52 10 dod comptroller dov zakheim defense department special briefing purpose of budget supplementals

2003the issue became particularly acute days later when army chief of staff general peter schoomaker was asked about it in senate arme d services committee hearing on february 10 schoomaker said he wa s concerned on how we bridge between the end of this fiscal year and whenever we could get supplemental in the next year and i do not have an answer for exactly how we could do that general michael hagee the commandant of the marine corps echoed schoomakers concern in response the next day februa ry 11 dod comptroller dov zakheim held press briefing to explain that pentagon leaders were sure they could meet army and marine corps requirements into next spring by cash flowing regular fy2005 appropriations10 in fy2003 zakheim said the fense department was able to provide 26 billion for iraq war costs befo re congress could pprove supplemental appropriations the money he said was mainly operation and maintenance funds that would otherwise not have been spent until the fourth quarter of the fiscal year dod and also the office of management and b udget omb he said were certain that they could manage fy2005 funding in s imilar way zakheim also argued that it was appropriate to lay requesting funds for iraq b ecause of great uncertainty about costs particularly following the planned transfer of sove reignty to an interim iraqi government on june 30 subsequently number of related issues emerged one issue is what precedents earlier wars provide last year crs memo reported that the initial f unding for most conflicts from world war ii to korea to vietnam to the 1991 persian gulf war was generally provided thr ough supplemental appropriations11 that memo did not however addr ess funding for wars after the initial phases on that questi on the precedents are mixed while the

that case the administration first asked for 700 million supplemental for fy1965 in may of 1965 then for 17 billion addition to the regular fy1966 defense appropriations bill which was re quested as budget amendment in the summer of 1965 and then in january of 1966 as troop levels in southeast asia were climbing supplemental of 123 b illion for fy1966 and regular appropriati ons of 103 billion

though troop levels were in flux and the duration of the conflict could not be foreseen as the defense bills were bein g marked up there was also some discussion in congress about the adequacy of fy 2004 f unding for iraq in testimony before the house armed services committee on april 21 2004 general richard myers the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said that the military services had identified preliminary shortfall of about 4 billion through the end of the fiscal year he also said that the defense department was in the midst of budget review wh ich the service chiefs thought would be able to find enough money in for example underexecuting acquisition programs to cover the shortfall general myers reiterated that assessment in testimony before the senate defe nse appropriations subcommittee on may 12 2004 in its review of the issue crs found that fy2004 shortfalls could be substantial but that funds to cover costs are also available so that the defense department may indeed be able to get th rough fy2004 see crs report rl32381 adequacy of the armys fy2004 funding for operations in iraq by amy belasco more recently the government accountability

that is for items such as uparmored humvees body armor robots and other devices for coping with imp rovised explosive devices ieds night vision goggles and other equipment of immediate value to troops on the ground senator jack reed pointed to defense department reprogramming request that would allocate 619 million for urgent iraq needs12 and in the april 21 house armed services committee hearing

congressional action in all four versions of the annual defense bills congress agreed to provide 25 billion as an initial down payment for costs of operations in iraq and afghanistan in fy2005 the house senate and conference versions of the defense appr opriations make the money av ailable as soon as the bill is signed into law which means that the money could be used not only for initial costs in fy2005 but also to cover any shortfalls in the remainder of fy2004 the key issues to be resolved in th appropriations conference were how to divide up the money among department of defense appropriations accounts how much to provide in flexible transfer acc ount that can be used to meet unanticipated expenses how much general transfer authority to provide the defense department to move money between appropriations accounts with advance congressional approval and what reporting requirements to establish the house version of the appropriations bills provided somewhat more detail than the senate bill in allocating the money among regular appropriations accounts and in specifying what weapons programs it approved though the differences were relatively minor the house bill provi ded 2978 billion in flexible transfer account called the iraq freedom fund of th 2978 billion however 1978 billion was for classified programs described in an annex to the report so only 1 billion was available as flexible funding the senate bill techni cally provided all of the 25 billion in the iraq freedom fund but it also set detailed floors andor ceilings on amounts that could be transferred

the defense budget congressional debate about the fy2005 budget seems to mark turning point of sorts after several years in which mounting budget deficits were apparently of less interest in congress than tax cuts medicare prescription drug coverage and increased benefits for military retirees oldtime deficit cutting religion appeared to undergo bit of revival the administr ation proposed budget plan which it said will cut the federal budget in half by fy2009 though there is considerable debate about whether it would actually accomplish that in their versions of the fy2005 budget resolution both the house and th senate imposed somewhat tighter restrictions on total discre tionary spending than the administration and the senate voted to reimpose procedural restri ctions known as paygo rules both on increases in mandatory programs and on reductions in revenues statutory paygo rules were first established by the budget enforcement act of 1990 but expired after fy2002 battles over how to control federal deficits were fixtures of congressional budget debates from the time congress pproved the first grammrudmanhollings deficit control act in november 1985 into the late 1990s c ongress passed revised measures to limit deficits in 1987 1990 1993 and 1997 it was only after 1998 that an economic boom together w ith several rounds of tax increases and measures to limit spending led though only temporarily to budget surpluses the deficit battles as well as the end of the cold war were major factor affecting defense spending adjusted for inflation the fense budget declined in real terms for 14 straight years from fy1986 through fy1999 and began to turn up again only in fy2000 as deficit pressures eased the reemergence of the deficit as an issu therefore raises an obvious question to what extent might ongoing efforts to control budget deficits eventually limit the amounts available for defense this year there was serious debate in congress about the total amount for defense for the firs t time in several year s in the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32305crs56 budget committee chairman don nickles proposed and the full committee reported budget resolution that reduced the reco mmended total for nati onal defense by 69 billion below the administration request in the house budget committee chairman jim nussle initially proposed 2 billion cut in defense in an attempt to make the point that everything even defense needed to be on the table to control longterm spending while cong ress did not in the end support cuts in defense the longterm budget situation ma raise the issue again in the future congressional action in the senate the budget committee reported version of the annual budget resoluti on sconres 95 recommended 4152 billion for the national defense budget functi on function 050 69 billion below the cbo reestimate of the administration request see table 4 in floor vote on march 10 however the senate approved an amendment by senator john warner to restore the funds in the house budget committee chairman jim nussle dropped his proposal to recommend 2 billion less for defense than the administration requested the house resolution hconres 393 as re ported by the budget committee and as passed by the full house recommended the requested level of funding for national defense though 26 billion of the request was shown in new budget function for homeland security the conference agreement on the budget resolution provides 4722 billion for national defense in fy2005 including 50 billion for overseas contingency operations the house approved the budget resolution on may 20 and also approved measure deeming the totals in the budget resolution to have been agreed to for purposes of subsequent house action on appropriations bills and other legislation the senate however never took up the budg et resolution this compelled the senate to begin acting on fy 2005 appropriations bills with the level of funding for total discretionary programs set at the level projected in the fy2004 budget resolution which was 814 billion in new budget authority this was about 8 billion below the level requested by the administration and 7 billion below the level approved in the deeming resolution in the house this caused some problems in the senate which came to head in action on the defense appropriations bill as way of coping with the 7 billion gap with the house the senate appropriations committee designated 7 billion in the regular fy2005 defense appropriations bill as emerge ncy funds the effect was to allow allocations of funds to other nondefense appropria tions bills to equal the total in the house if house conferees had accepted this approach it would have freed up 7 billion for additional funding for nondefense bills within the 821 b illion cap on discretionary funding the house leadersh ip objected the solution was to include in the fy2005 defense appropriations bill measure deeming total of 821 billion in discretionary budget authority to pply in the senate as in the house with senate passage of the defens appropriations conference re port that level is now in effect ultimately

military personnel when they retire from the defense department to the general treasury and from discretionary funds subject to budget ary caps to the mandatory side of the ledger under current law the defense department is required to make annual contributions to the military retirement fund fficient to cover cost in the future of providing guaranteed medical care to 65 andover military retirees this is known as tricare for life and was establis hed in the fy2001 national defense authorization act pl 106398 these contri butions are considered part of the cost of military personnel and are scored as discretionary funds requi ring annual appropriations the measure section 1541 of the h ouse bill which was approved with amendments in the conference agreemen t section 725 of the conference bill requires the treasury to make the contribu tions to the retirement trust fund instead of the defense department beginning in the fy2006 budget the effect would be to reduce dod personnel costs by an average of about 12 billion year over the next five years sense of congress provisi on added in the conference agreement urges that this shift should not reduce the tota l discretionary funding requested for the defense department in ffect increasing defense spending by 12 billion year so far the office of management and budget has not agreed in december 9 2004 letter to the chairmen of the h ouse and senate budget committees omb urged that the fy2006 budget resolution scor the health insurance contributions to the military retirement fund according to ear lier

annual budgets of federal agencies in order to allocate the actual full costs of personnel to current programs active duty endstrength even before the current conflict in iraq began there was some support in congress for increasing the size of the active duty force particularly in the army as means of reducing strains on military pers onnel that some argued were aggravated by frequent military operations abroad ch as peacekeeping operations in bosnia and kosovo13 in the house representative ik skelton the ranking democrat on the house armed services committee argued for some years that the

yet indeterminate period s made endstrength critical issue currently the defense department has waived stat utory caps on endstrength and it is keeping about 30000 more personnel in the active duty force than before the war in iraq costs of paying these additional troops as well as tem porarily mobilized reserve troops has been covered with fy2003 and fy2004 supplem ental appropriations army leaders have said that they want to keep as many as 30000 additional troops in the service for the next couple of years not only to eas strains of overseas deployments but also to allow some flexibility as the army reorganizes its combat units see below so it appears likely that the administration will want to keep some additional end strength for some time still paid for with supplemental appropriations army officials say the increases will be needed the end of fy2006 the defense department however s opposed congressional measures to increase statutory endstrength and to blish endstrength minimums it appears that the defense department wants flex ibility to increase or reduce troop levels without congressional manda but neither critics nor proponents of an increase in statutory endstrength ve addressed why it would be better or worse than the present situation in which dod is keepi ng added endstrength by waiving the current statutory caps in response to past preiraq proposal s to increase endstrength secretary rumsfeld has argued that the services can increase the number of deployable troops without adding to overall end strength by more efficiently managing the forces that are available one key effi ciency measure is plan to transfer as many as 10000 jobs now performed by uniformed pers onnel to civilians in fy2004 and another 10000 in fy2005 reportedly some pentagon studies have found that as many as 320000 military jobs could be performed by civilians15 these prospects have not persuaded advocates in congress that potential problems caused by the burden of rotating forces into iraq are being adequately addressed some member s of congress have proposed increasing the armys statutory endstrength by as many as 40000 troops and some have proposed as well that some of the additional troops should be assigned to units specially organized and trained for stability operations overseas part of the discussion of endstrength is the cost the congressional budget office estimated that in 2002 the average active duty servicemember received compensation package including pay and noncash benefits of about 99000 per year16 so without including training and ot her operating costs of additional forces rough starting point for analys is is that each additional 10 000 active duty troops will add about 1 billion to the defense budget

which are that it w ould cost 36 billion year to add 30000 troops to the force presumably these troops would be used to fill out existing units not to add new ones which would cost additional money congressional action at the end of april house armed services committee chairman duncan hunter announced that he would propose an increase in statutory endstrength for the army and the marine corps in the committee markup of the fy2005 defe nse authorization bill17 the bill as reported by the committee and passed by the house includes his proposal to increase statutory end strength in the army by 10000 and in the marine corps by 3000 in each of the next three years for total increase of 39000 troops the committee assumed that the costs of the increase in fy2005 will be paid for not out of regular funds but out of additional funding for iraq in the 25 b illion contingency fund for the first part of the fiscal year andor in ter supplemental appropriations in the senate senators reed akaka clinton nelson fl hagel mccain schumer landrieu and boxer sponsored bill s 2165 to increase army end strength by 30000 the senate armed services committee included measure in its version of the

adopted an amendment by senator reed to increas fy2005 army active duty endstrength by 20000 the endstrength issue was not resolv ed in the fy2005 defense appropriations conference report the bill provides funds for added endstrength within the 25 billion provided for iraq and afghanistan but it does not prejudge whether an increase in the statutory endstrength will be agreed to in the authorization conference the defense authorization conference agreement increases army end strength by 20000 and marine endstrength by 3000 in fy2005 and establishes the increased totals as minimums the conference bill also authorizes additional increases of 10000 in the army and 6000 in the marine corps over the next four years but it does not establish them as minimums missile defense in

realistic operating conditions test intercepts cannot however be carried out from the 10 interceptor missiles being deployed at fort greeley alaska however because of range safety issues the pentagons direct or of operational testing tom christie has told congress that he has advocated th deployment of some kind of test bed precisely as means of strengthening the rigor of the development process19 although there has been little criticism of the decision to develop missile defense test bed per the white house decision to declare system operational in the midst of presidential election campaign was matter of occasionally testy debate in congress20 some other issues have also emerged big issue is cost one key question is whether the big increas in missile defense funding over the past few years is justified or whether funds s hould be shifted to ot her priorities perennial issue has been whether the ssile defense agency should spend less on development of spacebased systems that ma be technologically risky or more on patriot missile batteries and other systems that may be of more immediate value to troops in the field another set of issues has to do with ma nagement of the program

require more stringent operational testing of missile defense systems on june 17 the senate adopted an amendment by senator john warn er to require the secretary of defense to prescribe and apply criteria for operationally realistic testing of fieldable prototypes developed under th ballistic missile defense pr ogram by adopting the warner amendment the senate rejected an amendment by senator jack reed to require the director of operational test and evaluation to prescribe and oversee operational tests later on june 22 by vote of 4456 the senate rejected an amendment by senator carl levin to reduce funds for missile defense by 515 million and reallocate the mone to department of ener gy counterproliferation to norad cruise missile detecti on programs and to various department of

reduction bow waves and train wrecks cost growth and affordability of major weapons programs perennial issue in defense policy is whether future defense budgets will be large enough to finance all of the wea pon acquisition programs that are in the pipeline there are couple of variations on the theme one issue is whether bow wave of acquisition costs will grow unsustainable at some point in the future the term bow wave technically refers to the normal funding profile of major program f unding is small in the early stages of development climbs during engineering development peaks during full rate procurement and then declines again as production winds down when several weapons programs appear likely to grow in concert then large collective bow wave may appear to be looming in the future second issue is whether projected weapons procurement budgets are large enough to replace aging weapons as they r each the ends of their nominal service lives 1999 report by the center for stra tegic and internati onal studies csis entitled the coming defense train wreck argued that projected procurement budgets would fall as much as 50 year s hort of the amount needed to maintain modernized

recently the army announced major restructur ing of the program which will delay major components for at l east two years and increase total program costs by 25 to 30 billion29 taken together all of this suggests th at the cost risk cbo has warned about is an imminent prospect and that the affo rdability of current weapons modernization plans is in some doubt the issue for cong ress this year and perhaps more and more pressingly in the future is what to do about it one possibility is to increase defense spending though budget deficits may make that problematic another is to terminate other programs in addition to the comanc he and earlier the crusader senator john mccain recently mentioned the f2230 third is to restructure priorities within the defense budget to find more money for weapons though demands to increase endstrength appear at odds with such prospect congressional action the congressional defense committees made number of changes in major weapons prog rams among the changes few stand out the senate armed services committee trimmed fa22 procurement from 24 to 22 aircraft saving 280 million the rationale was that the program had been delayed in any case so production will be slower than the air force had planned critics of the decision argued that pr oduction capabilities will ramp back up by 2007 when the money provided in the fy2005 budget would actually be spent neither appropriations committee supported cut ma king the issue moot the appropriations conference agreement provide s funds for 24 aircraft the house armed services committee trimmed funds for two highprofile navy programs on the grounds that production is beginning faster than the maturity of planned technology and the stability of system design warrants these programs are the navy ddx destroyer and the navy littoral combat ship lcs the fy2005 request includes funds in the rd acc ounts to begin construction of the first of each of the ddx and lcs ships th committee

senate appropriations committee provided the 221 million requested for ddx construction but in na vy procurement funds rather than in rd and added 99 million for second ship design following the

fully fund construction of the first lcs in the rd accounts as the house wanted the house armed services committee so trimmed 245 million from the armys future combat system developm ent request saying that the money was excess to requirements the co mmittee included provision section 211 requiring extensive reports on the status of the program and mandating that specific criteria be met

process for acquiring weapons which it calls evolu tionary acquisition with spir development the goal of the process is to accelerate the deployment of new technology to troops in the field by deploying what is technologically r eady and then progressively improving it as new technology matures these goals appear to have pretty wi despread support in congress moreover the new acquisition policies which the clinton administration had also been considering appear in many ways closer to commercial practices that have often been successful32 but there has also been some concern that the new procedures may weaken managerial controls and congressional oversight33 some programs like the littoral combat ship have been starte d without the kind of systematic formal analysis of alternatives that earlier re gulations required in other cases gao and others have warned that large investments are being made in programs that still appear technologically immature with potentially

military retirees once the survivors reach age 62 th reduction was originally enacted to take account of survivors becoming eligible for so cial security benef its veterans groups have long argued that the reduction is out of date unclear to pa rticipants and unfair to survivors for full discussion see crs report rl31664 the military survivor benefit plan description of its provisions by david burrelli and crs report rl31663 military benefits for former spous legislation and policy issues by david burrelli congressional action in the committeereported and housepassed version of the fy2005 defense authorization the house included provision that would increase survivor benefit plan sbp payments to over62 dependents of deceased military retirees from 35 of retired pay to 55 in increments by march 2008 on june 23 the senate adopted an amendment to the authorization by senators mary landrieu and olympia snowe to phase in increased benefits over 10 years through 2014 the amendment would provide 45 of retired pay after september 2008 and 55 after september 2014 key issue in congressional action on th survivor benefit plan and which shaped the terms of the amendment the sena adopted was how to pay for it the house version of the budget resoluti on included provision section 303 that established deficitneutra l reserve fund for measure that would increase sbphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32305crs70 35 congressional budget office cost estimate hr 4200 national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2005 as reported by the house armed services committee may 14 2004 may 17 2004 table 4payments the measure provided that the chairman of the budget committee may adjust totals in the budget resolution to accommodate an sbp increase if the armed services committee reports bill that provides an increase offset by cuts in other mandatory programs this was potentially showstopper because the armed services committees have jurisdiction only over limited number of mandatory programs mainly military retiree pay and benefits it normally would be difficult for the committees to come up with offsets though it may have been possible to offer floor amendment that would tap other mandatory programs or increase revenues the democratic alternative budget offered by representa tive john spratt included provision that would have required the armed services committee to report measure providing increased survivor benefits as part of larger reconciliation bill making other changes in mandatory programs and revenues but the house rejected the spratt alternative on march 11 the senate adopted floor amendment to its version the budget resolution by senator mary landrieu to tablish reserve fund that would raise aggregates in the budget resolution by 2757 billion from fy2005fy2009 to allow for measure reported either by the armed services committee or by the appropriations committee that would liminate the sbp over62 social security reduction senator landrieus amendm ent proposed offse tting the costs by eliminating tax benefits to individuals and corporations that avoid united states taxation by establishing foreign domicile and by closing other tax loopholes and tax shelters the conference agreement on the budget resolution includes the house provision ie it would permit an increase in sbp payments only if offset by other cuts in mandatory spending as it rns out however the house armed services committee acting before the conference agreement on the budget resolution was completed was able to fund way around the potential impasse the solution was byproduct of co mmittee action on boeing kc767 tanker aircraft acquisition last year the conference agreement on the fy2004 defense authorization pl 108136 included provi sion that authorized the air force to proceed with program to lease 20 and then buy 80 aircraft because of the way the provision was worded the congressional b udget office cbo scored the measure as mandatory program in its vers ion of the fy2005 authorization the house committee revised the kc767 acquisiti on plan it approved multiyear procurement contract for the 80 aircraft to be procured and it authorized money in air force rdte to develop needed aircraft modifications cbo scores this approach for procuring 80 aircraft as discretionary program so it credited the armed services committee with 143 billion in savings in mandatory programs from fy2006fy201235 these amounts were then available to offset the sbp increases and also to offs et an increase in mandatory spending due to the committees extension of the military fa mily housing privatiz ation initiativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32305crs71 the senate however did not have any such windfall of mandatory offsets in hand when it acted on survivor benefits as result the senate limited the cost of the program by providing the full 55 of retired pay only after the end of fy2014 since mandatory spending increases over 10year period but not beyond that are subject to point of order the senate also eliminated provision in the original landrieu proposal that limited premium incr eases for retirees who sign up for survivor benefits so the cost of the 45 increase that is phased in by 2008 may be paid for by the beneficiaries the issu for authorization conferees is whether to adopt the more limited be nefits provided in th senate proposal or figure out how to offset costs of the house proposal if as ppears quite possible there is agreement to alter that kc 767 acquisition plan as the house has proposed in action on tricare for reservists th house and senate approved several measures both the house and the senate armed services committees approved measures to establish monstration projects that would allow nondeployed reservists and their dependents to sign up for health insurance through the tricare program the senate armed services committeereported version of the defense authorization include d measure called tricare reserve select to allow nondepl oyed reservists access to health insurance for them and their dependents through the militaryrun tricare program provided that the full costs are paid either through employeremployee cost shar ing or if reservists cover the full cost on june 2 the senate approve d floor amendment to the authorization bill by senators tom daschle and lindsey graham to allow all nondeployed reservists to receive health insurance for themselves and their dependents through the military tricare program with the federal governme nt paying the employer share of costs the issue for the authorization conference was whether to approve only some kind of demonstration program for providi ng health insurance for reservists or whether instead to adopt one of the sena approaches either tricare reserve select which offers tricare if employers share costs or if reservists pay the full cost or the daschlegraham proposal for th federal government to pay the employer share the appropriations conference report did not resolve any of these or other personnel benefits issues the part of the bill providing 25 billion for iraq and afghanistan includes funds in the defense health program to finance increases in tricare for reservists including tric are for nondeployed reservists without access to employersponsored health insuran

panel new york times march 13 2004the authorization conference agreement resolved both issues the agreement incorporates the house measure on the survi vor benefits plan ie it phases in the full 55 benefit by fy2008 the costs were offset by savings in mandatory budget accounts from changes in the kc767 acquisition plan on the issue of tricare for reservists the authorization conference agreement is compromise between the house and the senate the agreement provides that reservists who are activated for duty and who subsequently reenlist are eligible for tricare benefits for one year for each 90 days of active duty service provided they pay 28 of the cost of the benefit th conference agreement did not establish demonstration program for broader program but instructed gao to study dods preparations for carrying out demonstration base closures in the fy2003 defense authorization b ill congress approved new r ound of military base closures to be carried out in calendar year 2005 in february 2004 the defense department met one requirement of the law by issuing statement of criteria to be used in deciding which bases to close in addition dod has issued guidance to the military services on how the process of identifying bases to recommend for closure will be organized senior pentagon fficials have said that size of the basing structure remains as much as 25 larger than is needed implying that the 2005 base closure round could be quite large in congress the 2005 base closure round s been matter of extensive debate last year the house armed services committeereported version of the fy2004 defense authorization bill included provision that would have restricted the extent of future base closures by requiring th defense department to maintain base structure large enough to absorb an in crease in the size of the force plus redeployment of forces deployed abroad to the united states under veto threat from the white house that provision was removed from the bill in conference this year the issue was again on the agenda several mbers of congress criticized the defense departments base closure criteria mainly for not including the cumulative economic effect of prior base closures as factor in deciding on new closures in the presidential campaign nator john kerry said he would prefer to delay new base closure round pending d ecisions on the size of the force and on overseas deployments36 congressional action the housepassed version of the defense authorization bill included provisions that would delay the next scheduled round of military base closures from 2005 to 2007 the measure required series of reports due between january 1 2006 and march 15 2006 before new round may begin the reports included studies on how th pentagons global posture review

markup by representative gene taylor to eliminate the next round entirely in floor action the full house rejected an amendment by representative mark kennedy to remove the base closure delay from the bill the senate however rejected an amendment by senators trent lott byron dorgan and others to delay additional domestic base closures until 20 07 so base closures were major issue in housesenate

conference agreement does not agree to the housepassed delay overseas troop deployments after the cold war ended the united states reduced the number of troops deployed overseas especially in europe but it did not relocate remaining troops away from old cold war forward bases in november 2003 the bush administration has announced that it was undertaking global posture review to reconsider where and how us troops are deployed overseas37 officials subsequently undertook extensive discussions with allies in eu rope and elsewhere about changes in the location of us troops on august 16 2004 the president announced that 6000070000 us troops w ould be withdrawn from locations overseas to the united states38 us forces in germany will be reduced the most naval command now in england will be relocated to italy and the united states will build number of bare bones f acilities in several c ountries that can be used as needed to support troop deployments to different parts of the world to date the main interest in the issue in congress has been from subcommittees overseeing military constructi on potential largescal redeployment of us troops however also has profound implica tions for the overall global capabilities of us forces for regional alliances and for foreign policy in general army transformation early in the year the new chief of staff of the army general peter schoomaker announced some very farreaching changes in the organization of the army and in army personnel policies these measures are designed to make the army more flexible to respond to small as well as large operational requirements and to create force that is eas ier to deploy rapidly abroad httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32305crs74 39 anne plummer army chief tells pres ident restructuring force could cost 20

plan implies for discussion see elaine m grossman general unscrambles new jargon for reformulated army divisions inside the pentagon february 12 2004one change is to increase the number of deployable combat brigades in the active duty force from 33 to 43 by 2006 and perhaps to 48 after that related change is to turn brigades rather than divisions into the basic deployable unit of action in the army this means giving brigades the communications command structures transportation and engineerin g support elements and other associated units to allow them to ope rate independently of divi sions and above the division level corps third change is to revise the personnel system so that entire units are kept together for training and deploymen t this is known as unit manning and it is to replace the armys longstanding individual replacement system the armys reorganization plan raises number of issues for congress one is how much it will cost and how the ar my will finance the reorganization the biggest costs may be in equipping brigades to operate independen tly reportedly the army has estimated that the plan could cost 20 billion through fy201139 another issue is how the plan will affect army endstrength requirements army officials want to add to the number of combat units within current endstrength but this will require reassigning personnel from noncomb at positions to the new brigades and officials have not said how many positions will be affected40 third issue is how the plan will affect the relationship be tween active duty and reserve components currently reserves are mobilized to fill out deploying active duty units the effort to make active duty units more rapidl deployable theref ore has important implications for the role and structure of reserves and finally the army has failed in past efforts to use unit manning in part because it affects how individuals meet rotational requirements for promotion congress may be concerned about how unit manning will affect the ove rall army personnel system dods civilian and uniformed personnel systems last year congress agreed to an administration request to give the secretary of defense very broad authority to re organize dods civilian personnel system dod is now beginning to implement changes some of the steps the department has taken to date have led to disagreements with some employees and some unions particularly measure that would move au thority to bargain locally over certain work rules to the national level so congress was in effect tasked to exercise some oversight over how the new system is bein g implemented in addition last year congress considered but u ltimately did not act on amendments to the personnel proposals to ensure certain traditional ci vil service procedures similar measures were proposed this year last year the defense department also requested changes in several laws governing assignment of senior officers but congress did not act on the request this year the pentagon has again submitted legislative proposals giving the secretaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32305crs75 of defense more authority over senior offi cers the proposals include allowing the secretary to reassign three and fours tar generals and admirals to new positions within the same grade without senate confir mation allowing senior officers to serve up to age 72 allowing the secretary greater flexibility to reassign officers between the ranks one to fourstar generals and admirals and measure to eliminate restrictions on the length of service of military service chiefs and of the chairman and vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff congressional action the house version of the authorization bill included measure allowing the president to extend the terms of military service chiefs by up to two years in normal circumstances or by an additional period if the total term is not over eight years in time or war or national emergency the house version also included measures to allow an increase in the militarys mandatory retirement age for up to 10 senior officers and measure rep ealing requirement that more than 50 of flag officers may be above the onesta r level none of these provision were included in the senate bill and none were adopted in the conference agreement several civilian pers onnel management issues were debated in floor action on the bills on june 22 by vote of 202218 the house rejected an amendment to the defense appropriations bill to prohibit the use of funds in the bill to implement changes in civilian personnel management practices that congress approved last year the house approved measure however setting conditions on the conversion of work to private contractors including requirement that for an conversion involving 10 or more employees the conversion invol ves full competition savings exceed the lesser of 10 or 10 million and that the contractor not r eceive an advantage due to health insurance costs the appropria tions conference accepted the house measure on the authorization bill the house approved similar measure limiting outsourcing and also approved measure permitting civilian employees to protest privatization decisions th senate approved also appr oved somewhat different measure allowing employee protests the authorization conference agreement includes limits on privatization similar to those in the appropriations bill the agreement does not directly address health in surance costs but requires study of the impact of health and other benefits in privatization competitions the authorization

100 boeing 767 aircra ft modified as refueling tankers and instead approved plan to leas 20 aircraft and purchase 80 more early in 2004 however report by the defense depa rtments inspector general and later study by the defense science board both ra ised questions about the status of the program the defense department then put decision on whether to proceed with the program on hold pending the results of formal air force analysis of alternatives aoa which is not expected until the end of this year subsequently the program was mired in scandal when former senior air force acquisition official overseeing tanker negotiations pleaded guilty to illegally seeking employment with boeing congress also investigated the proposal and senator john mccain put hold on approval of some pentagon nominati ons because dod has not provided some requested documents46 air force secretary douglas roche later warned that reopening the proposals might require re viewing pr oposals by other suppliers including the european aeronautic defence and space eads company congressional action the house armed services committeereported version of the fy2005 defense authorization included provision that authorizes the air force to proceed with multiyear proc urement of 80 kc767 ai rcraft and another provision that required the air force to ente r into contract with boeing to acquire the aircraft the multiyear authorizati on provision replaced and repealed an earlier authorization for multiyear procuremen t in the fy2004 defense authorization but did not repeal an authorization in that bill for the air force to lease 20 aircraft which therefore would remain in effect the committee provision also required that new contract for kc767 acquisiti on be signed after june 1 2004 and be reviewed by an independent panel established to assess the terms of the contract and determine whether the air force received full and fair value on the floor the house approvedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32305crs79

defense committees to turn down defense department reprogramming request that would have allowed the air force to go ahead with its initial proposal to lease 100 aircraft instead the committee proposed the modified lease 20buy 80 plan that the house then agreed to in conference negotiations on the fy2004 authorization on the senate fl oor senator mccain proposed number of 767related amendment to the defense authorization bill all of which would set conditions before funds may be obligated for the program on june 22 the senate adopted mccain amendment to prohibit acquisition of air force aerial refueling aircraft until 60 days after currently required studies are completed and requiring the secretary of defense to certify that acquisition complies with all applicable laws office of management circ ulars and regulations for their part the appropriators left resolution of the kc767 issue up to the authorizers though both the house nd the senate appr opriations committees supported the program in the past th house appropriations committee provided 100 million for kc767 acquisition in tran sfer fund that could be used for procurement rd or leasing of the ai rcraft the senate appropriations committee provided 110 million in fund available for tanker aircraft replacement which presumably could be used for kc767s or for some other program the appropriations conference report incl udes 100 million for tanker replacement program the authorization conference agreement repeals the lease provision in the fy2004 bill and approves multiyear procurement of tanker replacement so the air force may still decide to acquire kc767 refu eling aircraft at some time in the next few months or it may decide to acquire some other system buy american act trade ffsets and related issues last year the housepassed authorization bill included provisions to strengthen requirements that the defe nse department buy defens equipment and parts from american companies the senate opposed these measures and the issue held up final approval of the defense authorization bill for some time advocates of more stringent buy american provisions were not fully satisfied with the outcome so the issue was expected to come up in some form again this year related issue is whether the navy should be permitted to continue leasing some support ships from foreign firms or should instead be required to buy new ships from american shipyards see above for discussions of congressional action on the issue congressional action the house armed services committee did not directly seek to strengthen buy amer ican provisions it its version of the fy2005 defense authorization but it addressed the issue indirec tly in provision regarding offsets for foreign military sales us sales of military equipment to foreign countries often include agreem ents to offset part or ll of the value of the salehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32305crs80 offsets may include allowing foreign supp liers to provide parts for the system allowing foreign companies to perform assembly operations or other parts of production or requiring us purchases of equipment from foreign providers the house version of

the offsets the selling nation applies to purchases from the united states the provision may be waived if the secretary of defense certifies that purchase is necessary to meet us national security objections in the senate the authorization bill as reported by the armed services committee included provisions allowing the defense department to waive domestic content requirements for purchases from foreig n countries that have reciprocal trade agreement with the united states on june 22 the senate considered an amendment by senators mark dayton and russ feingold to eliminate those provisions the senate rejected that proposal however when it adopted by vote of 5446 substitute amendment pr oposed by senator mccain to revise the language of the original provision the mccain amendment included in the natepassed version of the bill allows the defense department to waive domestic content requirements for trade with any nation that has signed declaration of principles agreement with the united states regarding reciprocity in fense trade on june 23 the senate also agreed to an amendment by senator ch ristopher dodd to penalize contractors that agree to offsets of

4026 billion is for military activities of the department of defense 172 billion for atomic energy defense activities of the department of energy and 32 billion for defe nserelated activitie s of other agencies the request does not include funding for ongoing military operations in iraq afghanistan and elsewhere for which administration officials have said they expect to submit supplemental

funding for department of defense military activities and for defenserelated activities of the department of energy and other agencies it also shows the administrations estimate of fy2004 funding the fy2004 amounts are not directly comparable to figures for later years because they include s upplemental appropriations for ope rations in iraq afghanistan and elsewhere while the administrati on

2001comanche termination on february 23 two weeks after the budget was released the army announced decision to terminate development of th comanche helicopter and to shift budget savings into other army avia tion programs in all the army spent about 8 billion on the comanche prior to fy2005 and estimate d that its plan to acquire 650 aircraft through fy2014 would cost an additional 29 billion halting the program will save about 12 billion in fy2005 89 billion from fy2005fy2009 and according to army officials 146 b illion from fy 2005fy2011 minus termination costs estimated at 450680 million army official s said they would reallocate all of these funds to other army helicopter missile and unmanned aerial vehicle uav programs on march 3 2004 the white house submitted budget amendment that shifts fy2005 comanche funds to other army programs continued growth in operation and maintenance and in military personnel costs as table b2 above shows the defense departments fy2005 budget is about 26 billion higher than the baselin fy2004 budget ie excluding fy2004 supplemental funding of that increas 64 billion is for military personnel and 130 billion for operation and maintenance om the om increase is bit overstated because the fy2004 base re flects 35 billion rescission in fy2003 emergency supplemental funds but even after adjusting for the fy2004 rescission over 70 of the requested dod incr ease between fy2004 and fy2005 is for personnel and om operation and maintenance costs trends for om this is not new story as figure b1 shows after adjusting for inflation and for changes in the size of the force total operation and maintenance funding has grown at very steady rate of just over 25 per year above inflation ever since the end of the korean war many things explain the trend 1 the steadily growing cost of operating and maintaining new generations of more capab and sophisticated weapons 2 efforts to improve the extent and quality of military training 3 efforts to ensure that the quality of life in the military keeps up with th quality of life in the civilian sector as the military has shifted to an all volunteer older more commonly married and more skilled force this is reflected among other things in growing health care costs and in expenditures to operate facilities and 4 modest but steady real growth in the compensation of dod civilian personnel most of whom are paid with om funds the cost of maintaining aging equipment in recent years does not appear to be major factor47 over the years the defense department has perennially tried to slow the growth of om costs efficiency measures including base closures outsourcing business process reforms and attempts in the acquisition process to improve weapons reliability may ve had some effect but not enough to slow the long term trend perceptibly experience during the clinton administration may be anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32305crs96 figure b1 operation and maintenance budget authority per active duty troop fy1955fy2009object lesson pentagon officials often pr ojected that om costs would level off when they did not more money had to be found to make up om shortfalls sometimes at the expense of procuremen t accounts and at other times from increases in the defense total for its part the bush administration has built into its budgets an expectation that om costs will continue to rise recent rapid growth in military personnel costs military personnel costs have also grown over time particularly since the inception of the all volunteer force in 1973 until fy2000 the rate of gr owth was relatively modest beginning with the fy2000 defense bills however congress sometimes at the pentagons request and sometimes not has approved ries of increases in military pay and benefits that have driven up personnel costs dramatica lly these increases include annual military pay raises pegged at 05 above the employment cost index measure of pay rates in the civilian sector pay table reform which gave larg er often substantial pay raises to targeted midlevel personnel in an effort to ensure retention of skilled people repeal of 1986 measure known as redux

from budgeting perspective this is so nothing new the growing cost of major weapons programs also drove budget s higher in the past much of the increased spending during the defense buil dup of the first four years of the reagan administration went to pay for procuremen t of weapons that began development in the early 1970s as the war in vietnam was winding down similarly much of the increase in the early years of the george w bush administration is going to carry on weapons programs which were started some years ago almost all of these programs have experienced significant cost growth and

calculation using different deflators such as the consumer price index would show different amount see figure 2 abovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32305crs100 figure c1 national defense outlays of gdp fy1947fy2009though substantial these increases are not as large those in the first five years of the reagan administration between fy1980 and fy1985 the defense budget grew by 48 an average annual increase of 81 moreover even when funding for operations in iraq and afghanistan is included military spending remains relatively low as percentage of gdp the fy2004 budget including costs of iraq and afghanistan is about 4 of gdp substa ntially higher than in fy2000 but well below what it was in the mid1980s when the cold war was still going on see figure c1 advocates of higher military spending sometimes point to the longterm decline in defense as share of the economy to ar gue that the nation can easily afford more one counterargument or at least part of counterargument is that the trend in defense spending is part of broader longterm trend in the federal budget in which both defense and nondefense di scretionary spending have declined while mandatory programs have grown as figure c2 shows total federal spending has been remarkably stable at about 20 of gdp over the past 40 years so to increase defense substantially as share of the economy would require either an increase in total federal spending as share of gdp or offsetting reductions elsewherehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32305crs101 figure c2 federal outlays of gdp fy1962fy2009 after fy2005 the administration defense plan again
