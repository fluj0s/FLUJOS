for retirees summary many retirees depend on their former employer for retirement health insurance either as their sole source of coverage for those under age 65 or as supplement to their medicare coverage once they reach 65 however the future of these benefits is uncertain with the retirement of the baby boom generation looming ahead employers offering coverage to their retir ed workers will

insurance coverage for their retirees further among employers who provide health insurance for current retirees their current workers are less likely to be guaranteed these benefits upon retirement an important feature of employersponsor ed health insurance for retirees and current employees is that it is voluntary employers are not required to offer health insurance additionally there are few protections to prevent employers from cutting or eliminating benefits unless the employer has made specific promise to maintain the benefits or has contractual agreemen t with either the employee or labor group as result even among retirees who cu rrently have employersponsored retiree health insurance benefits are eroding as employers shift costs to retirees by increasing premiums copayments or deduc tibles for companies in bankruptcy retiree health benefits are particularly vul nerable unlike fined benefit pensions that offer some protections for employees of companies in bankruptcy through

coverage for retirees introduction many retirees depend on their former employer for retirement health insurance either as their sole source of coverage for those under age 65 or as supplement to their medicare coverage once they reach 65 however given that employers are not required to offer employersponsored hea lth insurance as well as limited federal protections available for persons losing c overage the future of these benefits is uncertain with the retirement of the baby boom generation looming ahead employers offering coverage to their retir ed workers will face huge future financial commitment some employers have already reduced or eliminated their commitment to insure their retirees recent trends indicate that retiree health benefits are increasingly subject to higher beneficiary costsharing further among employers who provide health insurance for current retirees their current workers are less likely to be guaranteed these benefits upon retirement retiree health insurance became prevalent after the passage of medicare in 1965 as result of the relatively low cost because medicare is the primary payer for qualified retired benefici aries aged 65 and older it was fairly inexpensive for employers to provide retiree health benefits that suppl emented the medicare benefit in the late 1980s retiree hea lth benefits became more expensive for employers due to both the rising costs of benefits not covered by medicare and the changing demographics of the retir ee populati on for example employersponsored plans often include coverage for prescription drugs and depending on the costsharing arrangements and level of c overage the cost of including prescription drug coverage can be very expensive with the imp lementation of medicare prescription drug coverage in january 2006 retiree coverage may see further changes as employers gain experience with the interaction between medicares and their plans prescription drug coverage however medicare covera ge affects only those retirees who are over 65 disabled have end stage renal diseas esrd and also qualify for medicare many individuals retire before reaching 65 and their retiree health insurance would most likely be their sole source of health insurance coverage including prescription drug coverage employersponsored retiree health insuran ce benefits are eroding as employers attempt to

retiree health benefits for their new employees17 employers are also managing their retir ee health insurance costs by providing different benefits for current and future retirees following th same trend although less dramatic than the findings in the kaiserhewitt survey the mercer national survey of employersponsored health pl ans 2004 study found that about 30 of its respondents slightly higher rates reported for medicar eeligible retirees reduced their retiree health benefits by raising retiree contributions increasing cost sharing or limiting coverage conversely about 3 of firms increased retiree health benefits some employers who offer retiree health insurance to their current retirees will not provide coverage for indivi duals who retire in the future other firms may only provide group access to health insurance for future retirees requiring them to pay 100 of the premiums firms may also us sliding scale based on factors such as age at retirement years of service at

both retirees and current employees is that employers are not required to offer health insurance there are few protections to prevent employers from cutting or eliminating benefits unless the employer has made specific promise to maintain the benefits or has contractual agreement with either the employee or labor group employers or other plan sponsors are gene rally free to adopt m odify or terminate welfare benefits which incl udes health insurance as l ong as they have preserved their right to modify such plans therefore the documents governing the plan are crucial according to employee retirem ent income security act of 1974 erisa pl 93406 requirements employers are re quired to provide individuals with copy of the summary plan description spd within 90 days after they become plan participant the spd can change each year but the spd in effect when the individual retired may be the controlling document employers may explicitly reserve the right in the spd and in other documents to change the terms of the plan additionally even when these documents promise that health benefits will continue they may not rule out the possibility for changes such as reduced benefits or increased copayments language in the plan may be vague and as result the courts have been asked to step in to settle disputes r ecords correspondence brochures or other documents that contain information about the duration or scope of coverage may be used for clarification as well as labor agreements that provide documentation clarifying retiree coverage as result of limited if any protections retirees have turned to the courts to seek relief however in cases in which the employer has maintained the right to modify or terminate plan the courts ve sided with the employers eg

2000 case involving group of medi careeligible retirees and the age discrimination and employment act adea the us court of appeals for the third circuit found that the county had distinguished impermissibly between its medicareeligible retirees nd its younger retirees with respect to their health insurance coverage based on the age of the retirees21 later settlement was reached between the county and the medicareeligible retirees along this line the equal employ ment opportunity commission eeoc issued proposed exception to adea allowing employers to alter reduce or eliminate retiree

allowing the eeoc to publish the regulation pending the decision by the us court of appeals for the third circuit the case is set fo r oral argument in february 2007 if issued as final regulation employers would be allowed to segment their retiree population providing di fferent retiree coverage for those over 65 than for those under 65 this could have signif icant consequences now that the new medicare prescription drug program is in effect for example plans could eliminate their prescription drug coverage for their medicareeligible retirees requiring these individuals to enroll in medicare part d if they wanted to continue to receive prescription drug coverage employers c ould choose to maintain prescription drug coverage for only their younger retirees however because the standard medicare part d prescription drug bene fit is generally less generous than coverage offered by employers medicareeligible retirees who lose employersponsored retiree prescription drug coverage w ould likely pay more or have less generous coverage or bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32944crs10 23 prospects for retiree health benefits as dicare drug coverage begins findings from the

survey response on this par ticular question results should only be viewed as general indicator of plan costs 25 employer health benefits 2005 annual survey the henry kaiser family foundation and health research and educational trustreasons for eroding coverage and issues the erosion of health insurance covera ge for the retiree population is based on several factors as previ ously discussed the demographi cs of this group foreshadow that employers may be facing coverage fo r larger number of individuals who are expected to live longer and therefore use lot more health care services than originally anticipated when these companies first began to offer retiree health coverage in addition seve ral other factors describe d below contribute to the erosion of retiree health insurance including increasing costs especially for prescription drugs the economy nd changes in accounting practices costs of health insurance according to kaiserhewitt january 2005 survey on retiree health benefits among their surveyed 300 employers with more than 1000 employees total costs for employersponsored retiree coverage we re 208 billion in 2004 including costs paid by the retiree and the employer and were estimated to increase to 229 billion for 200523 the cost to employers for providing these benefits has been increasing due to an increasing number of retirees as well as increased per capita costs according to mercer between 2003 and 2004 perperson retiree medical costs for premedicare eligibles increased by 8 from 7634 to 8247 and by 78 from 3060 to 3300 for medicareeligible retirees24 looking at the overall premium incr ease for employersponsored health insurance not solely premium increases for retiree health insurance according to the kaiserhret 2005 nnual survey increases in health insurance premiums are outpacing increases in both workers ear ning and overall inflation for example premiums increased by 92 from 2004 to 2005 compared with 27 increase in earnings and 35 increase in inflation25 in the early 1990s premium increases were smaller each year bottoming out at less than 1 increase in 1996 however increases soon became progressively larger over time r eaching double digits by 2001 recently the increases have slow ed to 112 between 2003 and 2004 and to 92 between 2003 and 2004 increases in pr emiums are expected to continue inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32944crs11 26 the underwriting cycle for health insurance is characterized by years of small increases in premiums followed by years of larger increa ses at some point increases become smaller and the cycle begins again the cycles are in part the result of health insurance providers first lowering increases in order to remain competitive and then raising increases as profit margins drop andor reserves are depleted 27 national survey of employ ersponsored health plans 2004 survey tables mercer 28 the employers subsidy covers gross costs which includes any copayments or co continuedpart due to increasing costs inflation and utilization of medical claims26 t h largest of these increases appear to be concentrated in the smallest firms prescription dr ug

those with more than 20000 employees coverage declined relative to 2003 the annual increase in prescription drug spending has outpaced that of overall medical benefits in large part because of increased prescription drug utilization as result employers have looked for ways to hold down their costs and plans have continued to develop costsaving mechanis ms such as increasing costsharing or requiring mailorder prescription refill plans are also increasingly using multiple tier payment arrangements such as one tier with lower outofpocket costs for the enrollee purchasing generic drugs and two tiers for nongeneric drugs preferred and nonpreferred as of january 2006 medicare beneficiar ies may now participate in the new voluntary part d program providing prescripti on drug coverage as

kaiser family foundation and hewitt dec 2005 up to 5350 the dollar amounts are adjusted annually by the percentage increase in medicare per capita prescription drug costs the majority of responding employ ers in the kaiserhewitt december 2005 retirement survey indicated that for 2006 th ey were likely to continue to offer prescription drug coverage among the re spondents 79 indicated that they were likely to choose the subsidy 10 pla nned to supplement medicare coverage 2 planned offer their own part d plan and 9 planned to disconti nue prescription drug coverage29 however as employers gain be tter understanding of the interaction between their coverage and medicare prescrip tion drug program in future years they may decide to make changes to their health plans for retirees with respect to prescription drug coverage or even to thei r entire benefit package for example if the subsidy covers significant portion of the employers cost for providing prescription drug coverage then the empl oyers continued coverage might be financially viable option on the othe r hand some employers may longer be willing to provide either prescription drug or even any retiree coverage some employers may only have been willing to pr ovide retiree coverage in the past because it was generally retirees sole source for prescription drug coverage with the inclusion of some coverage under medicare even if it is more limited than the employers coverage an employer may longer feel responsibility to provide coverage to its retirees em ployers could drop the drug coverage or even choose to drop all health insurance for retirees the employer does have the option of discontinuing its prescription drug covera ge and paying the medicare prescription drug premium for its employees finally younger retirees those under 65 will still depend on their employers for prescription drug coverage if the eeo c eventually issues its proposed exception to adea then employers could provide pr escription drug benefits for only their younger retirees and not thei r medicareeligible retirees financial downturn during the booming economic years of the late 1990s some workers were shielded from the increasing health insurance costs firms were willing to absorb these costs in order to remain competitive in tight labor market however as costs continued to escalate and the econom took downward turn employers found themselves less able to absorb these costs furthermore as the job market weakened and workers had more difficult time finding or switching jobs employers did not need to provide as many incentives to ttract employees and thus were less likely or willing to absorb increasing health insurance costs this issue is especially critical for small firms who often operate on narrow margins with little room to absorbhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32944crs13 increased costs not surprisingly the dec line in offering health insurance coverage is most notable among these small firms accounting rules fasb and gasb effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 1992 the financial accounting standards board fasb estab lished new requirements for the reporting of nonpension retiree benefits in fas 106 which includes h ealth benefits this rule significantly changed the practice of payasyougo accounting for these post retirement benefits to accrua l accounting the employers expense for these benefits is now incurred at the time the employee rende rs the services necessary to earn their postretirement benefits that is the empl oyer must account for the cost of retiree health insurance while the employee is working for the firm rather than waiting until the employee retires and enrolls in the retiree health insurance plan this accounting standard requires companies to more closely examine health insurance costs for their retirees and this examination may have led them to realize the magnitude of these costs in response to fa s 106 some companies announced changes in benefit programs such as eliminating retiree health coverage establishing caps on their dollar contribution increasing costsharing nd linking the level of benefits with the years of service fas 106 may have provi ded convenient rati onale for reducing or eliminating retiree coverage it may have also made some employers realize that their commitment to retiree health insurance was openended and growing at rapid pace recently the government accountin g standards board gasb adopted statement 43 which changed the accountin g rules for the costs of various post employment benefits for state and local governments the new standard is similar to fas 106 standards in that it require s accrual accounting but provides greater flexibility for example fas 106 prescrib single actuarial method for the calculation of postretirement health costs while gasb 43 allows choice between several different actuarial methods the application of gasb 43 could have similar impact on employers commitment causing them to rethink their retirees health insurance coverage however becau this group of employees is state and local government workers they may have more bargaining power or union protections than some of the groups in the private sector that we re affected by fas 106 employer caps on retiree health insurance some employers have established caps on their contributions to retiree health insurance in order to limit the openended nature of their liability this also allows employers to constrain the dollar amounts that they have to recognize as result of the fas 106 rules although firms often set the caps at level they expect to reach at some distant future date given the rapid rate of increase in health insurance costs employers may find that they exceed the cap even sooner than anticipated this presents an interesting dilemma for the provision of retiree health benefits according to the kaiserhewitt study of retiree health benefits among the surveyedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32944crs14 30 prospects for retiree health benefits as dicare drug coverage begins findings from the kaiserhewitt 2005 survey on retiree health benefits the henry kaiser family foundation and hewitt dec 2005 31 in addition under fas 106 pattern of repeatedly ra ising the caps would lead the companys auditors to conclude that the empl oyers substantive commitment is to provide retiree health benefits without cap thereby canceling the expense reducing effect of the capfirms about onehalf have cap s in place and of those with cap 59 have already reached the cap another 19 estimate that they will hit the cap in the next three years30 to alleviate this situation firms can raise the caps however this would require higher spending31 alternatively they can choose to adhere to the caps thus eroding retiree health insurance by either increasing the retirees contribution or reducing benefits another potential issue is the convergence of the cap and the employers subsidy for actuarially equivalent pr escription drug benefits under part d of medicare some firms may initially meet the standards re quired for receiving the subsidy in 2006 over time as the cost of insurance increas some firms will reach and exceed their cap thus possibly facing problem because once the cap is exceeded the value of their benefits would decline as result employers who at first meet the actuarial equivalent standard requi red under medicare law may ove r time longer meet that standard then they may longer qualify for the 28 employer subsidy on the other hand when companies redu ce their retirees health benefits they are not only spending less for these benefits they are also able to report smaller post retirement health costs for example in response to new medicare prescription drug coverage some companies will maintain th eir prescription drug coverage and receive 28 subsidy which will reduce their postretirement health costs other companies may reduce their health plan costs by eliminating or reducing prescription drug coverage which would also reduce their liability both of these options would help employers to lower their expens and possibly remain under their cap policy options there are wide variety of policy op tions that endeavor to make retiree coverage more available or affordable or even to require that employers maintain coverage however when considering any op tion it is also essen tial to consider the relationship between retirees health insu rance and insurance for current workers special treatment for retirees compared to current workers could lead to inequitable outcomes for example one policy option often discussed to protect retiree health insurance is to require employers to conti nue to provide previously promised health insurance coverage to their retiree popula tion without llel requirement for current workers employers could find themse lves in an awkward situation in which they were financially unable to cover workers but requi red to cover retirees thus any statutory requirement to provide retiree health insu rance coverage should be examined in the broader context of all employersponsored coveragehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32944crs15 32 for more detailed description of health insurance coverage under cobra see crs report rl30626 health insurance continuation coverage under cobra by heidi g yackermodify cobra under title x of the consolidated om nibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 cobra pl 99272 an employer with 20 or more employees must provide employees and their families with the opti on to continue their coverage under the employers group health insurance pl an in the case of certain events32 the former employee is responsible for paying the pr emium which is limited to 100 of the rate charged to current employees plus an dditional 2 for administrative costs in general when covered employee experi ences termination or reduction in hours of employment including retirement th continued coverage for the employee and the employees spouse and dependent child ren must be offered for 18 months if firm offers retiree health insurance coverage retirees would most likely decline the temporary coverage provide d under cobra in favor of the retiree coverage which may be less expensive if the employer pays part of the premium and would not be limited to only 18 months however if an individual chooses retiree coverage and the firm later discontinues this c overage the retiree longer current worker would not be eligible to elect cobra only those retirees who lose retiree health insurance benefits due to the bankruptcy reorganization under chapter 11 of their former employer may elect cobra coverage that can continue until their death their spouses and pendent children may continue cobra coverage for an additional 36 months afte r the death of the retiree furthermore cobra coverage is only available as long as the firm continues to offer health insurance to its current workers as result when firms declare bankruptcy and cease operations there are current workers and health insurance so that the retirees as well as displaced workers have health benefits available to purchase under cobra unlike defined benefit pensions that ffer some protections for employees of companies in bankruptcy through the pension benefits guaranty corporation there are similar protections for retiree health one option often discussed for providi ng health insurance coverage to individuals who retire before reaching ag 65 eligibility age for medicare is to expand cobra by allowing younger retirees to continue to purchase their coverage through their former employer until they reach 65 there are some advantages and disadvantages for both retirees and employ ers of expanding cobra coverage for retirees the greatest advantage may be their ability to purchase the same coverage they were offered as employees alt hough the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa pl 104191 re quires that certain individuals moving from the group to individual market are gu aranteed the right to purchase health insurance coverage hipaa does not limit premiums older individuals especially those with more health care needs may find that the available individual market coverage is very expensive even the cobra premium costs up to 102 of premiums may be prohibitively expensive for individuals whose incomes decline once they retire complicated by the fact that while they were working their employers most likely paid large share of the premium for some employers therehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32944crs16 33 the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 authorized federal health coverage tax credit hctc for certain individuals who are eligible for trade adjustment assistance allowances because they have lost manufacturi ng jobs due to increased foreign imports or shifts in production outside the united states

of what eligible taxpayers pay for qualified health insurance for themselves and their family members for more information see crs report rl32 620 health coverage tax credit authorized by the trade act by julie stone and bob lykemay be an incentive to substitute this expanded cobra coverage for other retiree coverage thus decreasing the share of retiree health insurance they offer employers on the other hand have argued that th 2 administrative allowance does not adequately cover their dditional burden furthermor individuals who choose cobra are likely to be less healthy than the rest of the employee population so that 102 of premiums that employers are allowe d to charge could be significantly lower than the claims incurred for the cobra enrollees tax deductions or credits under current law the tax treatment of premiums paid by employers makes it attractive for both employers and employ ees to purchase employersponsored health insurance any amount that an employer pays towards premiums is not counted as taxable income for the employee and not subject to payroll taxes by both the employer and employee additionally some employees are able to pay any required premium contribution from pr etax dollars retirees like current workers cannot pay for their share of any premium from pr etax dollars for most individuals who purchase their health insurance outside of their job the only allowable tax deduction is available to those who itemize and ve health care expenditures exceeding 75 of adjusted gross income expanding tax options such as allowing tax deduction for premiums paid by retirees allowing retirees to pay for premiums from pretax dollars or allowing deduction for those taxpayers who do not itemize may make these premiums more affordable whether the retiree has to pay all of the premium or some lesser share additionally providing tax credits is anot her option for reducing taxes thus making premiums more affordable currently there is tax credit available on limited basis for select group of individuals33 credits could be ex panded and designed to cover retirees entire share of premiums could be limited to specific dollar amount could be linked to income or an combination of the three however establishing tax credits for health insurance raises complex issues one important question is whether the credit would be the same for all taxpayers or more generous for those with lower incomes the credits would need to be large enough to encourage individuals to buy the insurance but might also have the adverse effect of providing employers with an incentive to reduce their commitment to health insurance additionally if individuals with tax credits did not have access to the group market they might have limited and or only expensive options for buying health insurance thus limiting the buying power of the credithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32944crs17 34 there are four types of these taxadvantaged accounts permitted under

used for unreimbur sed qualified medical expens such as deductibles copayments and certain services not covered by health insurance34 the newest of these types of accounts is the health sa vings account hsa established in the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 pl 108173 hsas are personal savings acc ounts for qualified medical expenses not covered by insurance or otherwise reimbur sable they can be established and contributions made only when the account owners are covered by qualifying high deductible insurance plan and have othe r coverage with some exceptions annual contributions to hsas are limited to federally established limit for 2007 the limit is 2850 for self coverage and 5650 for fa mily coverage additional catchup contributions limited to 800 in 2007 nd reaching 1000 by 2009 are allowed for individuals who are at least 55 years of age but not enrolled in medicare unused portions of hsas may be carried over from one year to the next so that even though medicareenrolled individuals are not allo wed to add money to an hsa account they may continue to use any accumulated funds indefinitely the hsa may be used to pay for the high deductible insurance plans cost sharing longterm care insurance premiums cobra premiums medicare pa rt b premiums and other qualified medical expenses as defined by the intern revenue service hsa funds may also be used for nonmedical expenditures subj ect to income tax and for those under 65 penalty thus any unused accumulated hsa funds ma be very beneficial for retirees if the rules for contributing to hsas we re expanded these funds have the potential of being even more useful although oppone nts of hsas are already concerned with their potential for syphoning off the hea lthier population and increasing insurance costs for people with the highest hea lthcare needs expanding opportunities to contribute to these funds could exacerbate these problems while these issues must be considered hsas have the potential to be altered and expanded for individuals to help them pay for their own retiree health insurance coverage for example individuals could be allowe d to contribute even higher amounts each year to make even larger contributions after reachin g age 55 or even to continue making contributions after enrolling in medicare if individuals were allowed to put larger sums into the account for medical expenses then the structure of the fund might need to be changed so that withdrawals c ould only be used for medical expenses as example of the potential for growth in contributions to hsas the employee benefit research institute ebri calcula ted contributions to an hsa for 10 20 or 30 years along with the allowed catchup payments for individuals over 55 years

though the retirees may not however few employers make these contributions for their workers and given the decline in health insurance coverage this is not likely option for retired workersthey assumed that the funds in the hsa w ould earn 5 interest and that individuals would be allowed to contribute the max imum of 2600 per year as the current limit for 2007 is actually higher the amount in the hsa account would be even larger indexed for inflation they did not assume that any withdrawals would be made for medical or other expenditures although so or all of these funds would almost certainly be withdrawn over the years in their example 55year old individual contributing 2600 plus catch up payments earning 5 on funds held in the hsa with the maximum allowable contributi on indexed for inflation could accumulate maximum of 44000 by age 65 if the indi vidual were allowed to contribute for 20 years the fund would grow to 101000 and after 30 years it would grow to 19000035 these figures only represent the contributions and earned interest but withdrawals another taxadvantaged account is flexible spending account fsa contributions to an fsa are voluntary w ith accounts usually funded by an employee although employers arent prohibited from contributing from his or her pretaxed salary thereby reducing taxable income funds in health care fsa hcfsa can be used to pay for qualified medical expens that are not reimbursed or covered by any other source qualified medical expenses include coinsurance amounts copayments deductibles dental care glasses hearing aids as well as certain over thecounter medical supplies that are not cosmetic in nature one significant limitation of the hcfsa is that at best funds can only be carried over for limited time after the end of the plan year36 any money remaining in the fund at the end of this time is forfeited another limitation of health care fsas is that only current employees and not annuitants ar eligible to contribute to an fsa on pretax basis37 allowing these funds to be carried ove r and accumulate without any deadlines allowing retirees to also contribute to fsas on pretax basis or allowing fsa funds to be used for retiree premiums are all options that could help retirees pay for their own health insurance similar to expanding these funds propos als have been discussed that would allow withdrawals above the current limit from other taxfavored accounts for retirement savings such as iras and 401k plans as long as the withdrawals were for medical expenses medicare buyin most persons aged 65 and

option for increasing coverage for the younger retirees is to allow individuals to purchase medicare prior to their attaining age 65 however similar to cobra coverage the premiums could be prohibitive and as result several options for lowering premiums have been discussed for example one option would be to spread out the cost of the premiums over time so that the premium charged to an individual under age 65 would cover only pa rt of the costs once reaching age 65 the official age for medicare aged eligibility the individual would pay the standard medicare part b premium plus an additional monthly amount fo r the rest of his or her life to compensate for the costs of the earlier coverage similar arrangement could be developed for the prescription drug benefit part d of medicare

around the medicare benefit paying for coinsurance deductibles and services covered by the plan but not medicare expanding medicare might replace or reduce the costs of retiree health insurance for this population although employers cannot currently divide their retiree population into medicare and nonmedicare retiree groups more medicare coverage translates into overall reduced costs for employers c overing retirees as this coverage would be secondary to medicare for the medicare eligible group as previously mentioned medicare covers only about onehalf of beneficiarys averag medical expenses this percentage will most likely increase for those beneficiaries who enroll in and use the new medicare part d prescription dr ug program however even for retirees covered by medicare there

of part d prescription drug services and regional medicare managed care plans medicare could be enhanced to expa nd coverage or to offer catastrophic limit however as medicare has just begun to offer its new cos tly prescription drug benefit it is unlikely that other expansions will take place in the near future that might serve to replace or reduce some of the costs of retiree health insurance employer mandates employersponsored health insurance is offered voluntarily by employers and in general38 they have the right to change coverage at any time this includes changes such as raising copayments increasing deductibles requiring larger premium contributions from employees using formularies for pres cription drug coverage or even eliminating coverage entirely employer mandates could be established to require that any retiree coverage offered to either current retirees andor promised to current workers upon retirement could not be changed or eliminated however employers who wanted to reduce their health insurance costs and were not allowed to change the coverage for their retirees would be forced to reduce costs only for their workers employers could reduce bene fits increase

extreme case employers could drop coverage for workers while still providinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32944crs21 coverage for retirees faced with restric tions employers might discontinue offering the promise of retiree health benefits to ne wly hired individuals so that at least for this group of employees they would not be required to offer retiree benefits when these workers eventually retire
