the environmental protection agency epa and states are implementing federally mandated program for controlling st ormwater discharges from industrial plants and municipalities large citie s and most industry sources are subject to rules issued in 1990 and epa issued permit rule s to cover smaller cities and other industrial sources and construction sites in 1999 because of the large numbe r of affected sources and deadline changes that led to confusion num erous questions have arisen about this program impacts and costs of the programs requirements especially on cities are continuing concern the 109th congress enacted energy legislation pl 10958 that included provision giving the oil and gas industry regulatory relief from some stormwater requirements in may 2008 federal court vacated an epa rule implementing this provision epa has not indicated how it will respond to the ruling background stormwater discharge systems are the pipes and sewer lines that carry rainwater or snow melt but not domestic sanitary wastes away from urban areas and commercial and industrial facilities for many years the focu s of the nations wate r quality programs was on controlling pollutants asso ciated with industrial process wastewaters and municipal sewage discharges more diffuse sources such as rainfall runoff from farm lands and urban runoff and discharges believed to be relatively uncontaminated received less attention from policymakers and regulators however as the traditional sources of wa ter pollution have beco better controlled through laws and regulations attention has increasingly focused on remaining problems that continue to prevent attainment of current state and tribal water quality standards stormwater is one such source of pollution for some time it was generally believed that stormwater was largely clea n or uncontaminated however studies have demonstrated that this type of discharge from rainfall and snow melt carries with it large amounts of organic and toxic pollutants that can harm water quality including oil and grease heavy metals pesticides soil and sediment in urban areas widespread residential andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97290crs2 1 moreover the 1990 regulations themselves were challenged by an environmental group the natural resources defense council in 1992 federal appeals court ruled that epa had failed to meet certain deadlines specified in the 1987 legislation and had been improper in exempting from regulation light industry and construction site s that affect less than five acres of land natural resources defense council v epa 966 f2d 1292 9th cir 1992commercial development results in the removal of vegetation cover and building of impervious structures such as roads and parking lots these activities may change natural drainage patterns in an area causing higher runoff flows during wet weather events states report that stormwater discharges including urba n runoff industrial activity construction and mining are significant source of surface water quality problems today recognition of the water quality problems of stormwater runoff led congress in 1987 when it last amended the clean water ac t cwa comprehensively to direct epa to implement specific permit program for st ormwater discharges from industrial sources and municipalities pl 1004 section 405 even before the 1987 amendments the issue of how to regulate stormwater disc harges had lengthy history of regulatory proposals delays legal challe nges and court decisions still epa had been unable to devise comprehensive and flexible administrative process for regulating stormwater discharges before requireme nts were legislated in 1987 epa initially issued regulations to imp lement congress 1987 legislative mandate in 1990 proposing series of phased requirements 55 federal register 47990 nov 16 1990 phase i applied to large dischargers those associated w ith industrial activities municipal separate st orm sewer systems serving 100000 people or more and construction projects disturbing more than five acres smaller sources were slated for possible regulation under phase ii of the program dis cussed below and incl uded cities and towns with separate storm sewe r systems serving fewer than 100000 people commercial operations and smaller construction projects stormwat er requirements are one element of the comprehensive permit program the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes authorized in section 402 of the act under the act it is illegal to discharge pollutants from point sources eg industrial plant pipe s sewage treatment plants or storm sewers into the nations wa ters without an npde s permit permits are the fundamental compliance and enforcement mechanism of the law epa manages the npdes stormwater program in five stat alaska idaho massachusetts new hampshire and new mexico and has delegated that authority to the remaining 45 states an estimated 123000 industrial facilities twice the number of industrial sources subject to the base npdes program and 220 municipalities and c ounties were covered by the 1990 permit rules for phase i of the pr ogram the initial procedures and deadlines were complex and were made more confusing by subsequent deadline extensions1 the 1987 cwa amendments dir ected epa or qualified stat to issue stormwater permits not later than four years after enac tment of that legisla tion this would have required permits to be issued by february 4 1991 but this did not occur in part because epas 1990 rule was issued 21 months after the statutory deadline regulated sources must comply with stormwater permits within three years of their issuancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97290crs3 2 the same deadlines also applied to industrial activities owned or operated by municipalities with population of 250000 or more for industrial activities owned or operated by municipalities with populations of more than 100000 but less than 250000 the respective deadlines were may 18 1992 and may 17 1993 ce rtain governmentowned or operated activities airports powerplants and uncontrolled sanitary landfills also were subject to the may 1992 and may 1993 deadlines even if the unit of government has population of less than 100000permits require dischargers at minimum to implement pollution prevention plans although remediation or additional treatment of runoff may also be required permits issued to municipalities requi re cities to devel op implement and enforce stormwater management program that addresses key areas such as public education eliminating illicit connections to storm sewers good housekeepin g of municipal opera tions and control of erosion and sedimentati on from construction sites industrial facilities industries that manufacture process or store raw mate rials and which collect and convey stormwater associated with those ac tivities were required to apply for an npdes permit under the phase i progra m several industries were specifically identified in epas 1990 regulation mining operations lu mber and wood products paper and allied products printing chemical pr oducts paints varnishes and lacquers stone clay glass and concrete meta ls petroleum bulk terminals zardous waste tr eatment facilities salvage operations and power plants industrial facilities d several options to comply with these permit requirements chiefly they could obtain either indivi dual or group permits applications for individual facility permits were due to be submitted by october 1 1992 for group permits covering multiple facilities with similar stor mwater discharges twostep process applied submitting list of facilities to be covered by september 30 1991 and submitting more detailed information such as sampling data on 10 of facilities in the group and description of stormwater management program by october 1 19922 epa also provided third option fo r industrial facilities through general permit procedure general permit is one that covers discharges from more than one facility sources are only required to submit notice of intent to be covered by general permit epa expected that general stormwater permits will make for less costly and burdensome permitting process through less extensive testing and control requirements as well as minimal monitoring and reporting for most sources general permits require preparation of pollution prevention plan and compliance w ith the plan six months later epa has issued general permits for stormwater discharges associated with industrial and construction activities that disturb five acres or more which apply in the five states where epa is the permitting authority for the stormwater program most other states which have been delegate d permitting responsibility by epa are using similar general permits to reduce the administrative burden of th industrial stormwat er permit program since 1987 congress has twice addressed the deadlines for stormwater permitting of industrial fac ilities congress first extended aspects of the deadlines for group applications by i ndustrial fac ilities pl 10227 dire emergency supplementalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97290crs4 appropriations act of 1991 and in the 1991 surface transportation act pl 102240 congress clarified the deadlines applicable to industrial activities that are municipally owned or operated such as airports or powerplants municipalities phase i much of the controversy about st ormwater requirements has focused on impacts on cities not industrial sources municipa lities with separate storm sewer systems called ms4s are subj ect to epas regulations unde r staggered deadlines based on the size of population served in the 1990 ph ase i regulations that apply to industrial activities epa also regulated discharges from mediumsize and large cities covering those with populations greater than 100000 pers ons the regulations specified deadlines for these cities to provide regulators with information on legal authority over stormwater discharges and to provide detailed information on source identification and monitoring data epa identified 173 cities and parts of 47 urban counties as c overed by phase i cities of all sizes ve complained about the costs and difficulties of complying with epas regulations especially because there is specific cwa grant or other type of assistance program to help pay for deve loping and implementing local stormwater programs many contend that cities already are burdened with numerous environmental compliance requirements and lack adequate re sources to address st ormwater controls in addition to drinking water solid waste wastewater treatment and sludge disposal problems phase ii the 1987 amendments exempted smaller cities w ith populations of fewer than 100000 from any stormwater pe rmit requirements til october 1 1992 and directed epa to develop suitable appro ach to address them under phase ii of the stormwater regulatory program because of problems in formulating permitting strategy epa did not issue regulations by the 1992 deadline nor did it meet the deadline in oneyear extension that congress pr ovided in pl 102580 in 1995 epa convened an advisory committee of stakeholders to ssist in developing rules by march 1 1999 deadline set in judicial consent order in natural resources defense council v epa civ 950634 pfl ddc apr 6 1995 th at required epa to clarify the scope of coverage and control mechanisms for the phas ii program based in part on extensive discussions with the stakeholder advisory committee and with another courtapproved extension epa issued final phase ii rule october 29 1999 64 federal register 68721 dec 8 1999 epa estimated that the rule would make approxima tely 3000 more river miles safe for boating annually and protect up to 500000 people year from illness due to swimming in contaminated waters the 1999 rule extended phase i by requiring permits of two dditional classes of dischargers on nationwide basi s 1 operators of ms4s rving populations of less than 100000 persons in urbanized areas as defined by the bureau of the census and 2 operators of construction activities that disturb greater than 1 and less than 5 acres of land larger construction sites ar covered by the phase i ru epa estimated that 5040 small cities are covered by phase ii ong with about 110200 currently unregulated construction starts per year waivers from coverage are available both for small cities those with fewer than 10000 persons and construction ac tivities if the discharges are not causing water qualityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97290crs5 impairment at the same time additional small municipal systems and construction sites may be brought into the stormwater prog ram on casebycase basis if permitting authorities determine that they are signifi cant contributors to water pollution covered facilities were required by the 1999 rule to apply for np des permit covera ge most under general rather than an individual per mit by march 2003 and implement six minimum management controls that effectively reduce or prevent pollutant discharges into receiving waters such as pollution pr evention and elimina ting illicit discharge connections for municipal operations the ru also provided that municipallyoperated industrial activities not previous ly regulated were required to apply for permit coverage under the same schedule as othe r facilities covered by phase ii in the final phase ii rule epa attempted to balance statutory requirements for nationally applicable program with sufficient administrative flexibility to focus on significant water quality impairments for example epa encouraged permitting authorities to use general rather than individual permits for the majority of covered dischargers the agencys decision to not include construction sites smaller than 1 acre was based on the belief that regulating the smallest of such sites would overwhelm the resources of permitting authorities and might not yield corresponding water quality benefits further epa modifi ed the previous phase i rule to exclude industrial facilities that have exposure of their activities such as raw materials to stormwater thus reducing coverage by an timated 76000 facilities th at have indust rial stormwater discharges these efforts to provide flexibility notwithstanding many regulated entities continued to criticize the scope of the stormwater program saying that epa had greatly underestimated the cost of the phase ii rule s projected to be 297 million annually for small cities and 505 milli on annually for cons truction activities many dischargers covered by the phase i program have reached the end of their initial permit terms npdes permits are issued for fiveyear terms for permit renewals the agency is implementing streamlined reapplication process that will not require the extensive information collection that ch aracterized the first round of permitting implementation of permits ie translating permits into specific steps to manage stormwater runoff is now the challe nge for permit author ities and permittees according to government accountability ffice report local governments are primarily using best management practices bmps to ma nage stormwater rather than requiring that stormwater be transported to treatment facilities water quality better data and evaluation of ur ban runoff pr ograms needed to assess effectiveness gao01679 june 2001 bmps include nonstructural meas ures to minimize contaminants getting into stormwater eg street sweeping and stru ctural practices such as detention ponds to separate contaminants from stormwater gao criticized epa for not establishing systematic efforts or measurable goals to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in reducing stormwater pollution or to determin its costs which local governments have portrayed as high congressional interest prior to issuance of the final phase ii rule in 1999 congress included language in epas fy2000 appropriation bill p l 10674 directing the agency not to issue the final rule before submitting detailed impact analysis to congress to meet courtorderedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97290crs6 deadline for the regulation epa released the report concurrently with the final rule legislation was introduced to exempt constr uction sites of less th an 5 acres and certain aboveground drainage ditche s from stormwater permittin g requirements s 2139hr 3625 at an october 1999 senate hearing epa witnesses opposed the bill saying that aboveground drainage ditches and small construc tion sites are significant sources of water pollution and thus should be subject to stormwater manageme nt requirements further action occurred in response to concerns about impacts of the phase ii program the 107th congress enacted legislation allowing states to us section 319 grant funds which are used for projects to manage nonpoint sources of wa ter pollution pl 107303 this authority only applied to section 319 funds in fy2003 gislation to extend this authority beyond fy2003 was introduced in the 108th congress but was not enacted s 1716hr 3528 oil and gas facilities as the march 2003 phase ii deadline approached affecting small municipalitie s and construction sites epa proposed twoyear extension of the rule for small oil and gas exploration and producti on facility construction sites to allow the agency to assess the rule s economic impact on that industry epa had initially assumed that most oil and gas facilities would be smaller than one acre in size and thus excluded from phase ii rules but newer data indicated that up to 30000 new sites per year would be of sizes subject to the rule in march 2005 epa extended the exemption until june 2006 for further study nd said it would issue specific rule for small oil and gas constr uction sites by that date the postponement did not affect other industries constructi on sites or small c ities covered by the 1999 rule under the cwa the operations of facilities involved in oil and gas explorati on and production generally are exempt from compliance with stormwater runoff regulations so long as the runoff is uncontaminated by pollutants but the construction of associated facilities is not in the 109th congress omnibus energy legisla tion enacted in august 2005 pl 10958 included provision addressing this issue section 323 amends the cwa to specifically include construction activities regardless of size including those previously covered by phase i in the oil and gas facilities covered by the laws general statutory exemption from stormwater rules its intention was to exempt from the cwa all uncontaminated stormwater discharges that occur while setting up drilling operations oil and gas officials who supported th provision said that the existing epa stormwater rules create timeconsuming per mitting requirements even though the short construction period for drilling sites carries little potential for stormwater runoff pollution opponents argued that the provision did not belong in the energy legislation and that there is evidence that construction at oil nd gas sites causes less pollution than other construction activities which are regulated under epa s stormwater program epa promulgated rule to implement section 323 71 federal register 33628 june 12 2006 some interest groups nd members of congress cr iticized the rule saying that epa exceeded its authority by broadly defining the scope of contamination exempted by the rule to include stormwater discharges contaminated sole ly with sediment in may 2008 federal court held that the rule is arbitrary and capricious and it vacated the rule nrdc v epa 0673217 ca 9 may 23 2008 in july epa petitioned the court to rehear the case but the request was denied on nove mber 3 epa has not yet formally responded to the vacatur of the rule legislation to repeal section 323 was introduced in the 109th congress hr 4541 but further action occurred
