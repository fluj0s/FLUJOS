shsbc 54 subjective reality lecture given on 6 september 1961 okay this is 6 sept 61 which is more properly ad 11 special briefing course saint hill well now i was early for the lecture today and i had complete lecture to give you and i forgot it so ill now have to dream up another lecture the difficulties of auditing that i covered yesterday if you will remember had two ways that you could learn something about auditing that is to say as an auditor observing the pc and being audited the subjective reality so todays lecture is definitely on the subject of subjective reality and this then perforce includes numerous parts of the mind and what its all about its very restimulative lecture so if youre easily restimulated why youd better put some earplugs in you better get your earplugs in because this is very bad stuff you know i mean engrams secondaries things of this character theyre just horrible shouldnt go near them might get stuck in them the earliest days of dianetics still expresses some of the awe and almost fear with which the reactive bank is regarded the viciousness of the subject matter the what an engram can do to you what secondary can do the horrors of being stuck on the track and that sort of thing of course immediately drops down intention and so on the more command you have of the subject now we have tools today which make the tools of 1950 look like moving mountains with teaspoon and there is great difficulty in getting somebody out of an engram for instance england on the 5th and 6th london accs scientology almost bit the dust in england asking people to go into the bank and look at engrams and secondaries and try to learn how to run engrams and that sort of thing it was completely beyond them much to my shame well basically we didnt have tools enough to move an engram through on somebody who was having terrible lot of difficulty looking at an engram person was having great deal of difficulty looking at an engram he didnt want too much to do with the engram this gave great deal of difficulty to the auditor who himself had reality on the engram in holding him in it and pushing him through so this compound difficulty of the auditor with reality on looking at the pc in an engram and the auditor with reality on being in an engram and the difficulty the pc was having being in and staying in an engram made dogs breakfast made pluperfect mess well just because it fell on its head in this degree is reason under the sun why it should continue to be on its head because you could run an engram today with difficulty at all you could get guy stuck in an engram and unstuck in an engram and so forth as quick itd make you spit just nothing to it believe believe and in this lecture im going to give you some processes that get people over their allergies of the bank now an auditor who believes that there is such thing as an engram and there is such thing as time track and who has the idea that there are such things as masses and has good intellectual approach to the subject and who is totally aware of pcs having been out of present time but himself has slightest idea of ever being in another time stream than now is dangerous auditor that is dangerous auditor because that auditor is doing an escape he is escaping from then and now is only an escape from then by definition therefore he will do everything in his power out of kindness to give the proper solution to the preclear and the proper solution to the preclear is escape from then this is directly in reverse to what makes clears and what makes people well and what recovers things is you have to show somebody that he doesnt have to escape from then because he can confront then and once he can confront then he is longer stuck in then you see thats very simple in other words you have to show somebody that he can stand and fight his demons down you see you have to show him that he can survive in spite of you have to show him that these things which are traveling after him were the shadows of life not the substance now thats what you have to show him and if youre sitting there showing him how to escape from life of course youre teaching him to be worse off now an auditor who is permitting pc to escape from life from the bank will make mistakes from standpoint of auditing and this is the most fruitful source of mistakes auditing mistakes auditing mistakes auditing mistakes pc has feeling that the auditor is pitching with him the pc has confidence in the auditor pc arc breaking all of this kind of thing is all mainly caused by this mechanism of the auditor is not getting the pc to confront the bank and the pc down deep knows this is wrong so the pc objects pc knows he isnt getting auditing in some vague dim way dont you see and you get all these arc breaks and upsets and so forth now as i say you can learn thousand rules well just i dont know what are you going to do keep dictionary open alongside of the emeter and look up the rule for every auditing command or are you going to have understanding and instinctive knowingness adequate to what the pc is fumbling around with of course there is substitute for an understanding and understandings are all built on observation and familiarity there can be understanding actually basic deep understanding without experience and person who has not had any experience of reactive mind trying to get somebody to handle reactive mind of course as i said just makes dogs breakfast out of it that is mess from there on now it has long been said that scientologist is harder to audit than raw meat off the street you hear this every now and then you hear this left and right well may be several reasons for this apparent reasons one of those is the scientologist knows how it ought to be and how it ought to go he is also accustomed to handling an auditing session so as pc of course he is more accustomed to handling the session than pc would be he knows which way this thing is actually he audits faster but he arc breaks more you see dont get these two things mixed dont say that scientologist gets less case gain than raw meat that is not true he gets more arc breaks than raw meat he is more critical as pc why what is the basic reason for this criticalness as pc it is all in the zone and area of duplication he just cannot sit there and permit himself to duplicate bad session all of his training tells him not to duplicate bad sessions you see hes supposed to run good session so he sees session running badly he becomes totally unwilling to duplicate it so therefore his havingness of the session disappears havingness and duplication are almost synonyms so his havingness of the session vanishes much more rapidly than somebody elses because he recognizes what the session should be and if he doesnt conceive the session to be what the session should be why then he is unwilling to duplicate the actions or activities of that auditor so as result he arc breaks he loses session faster than raw meat even though hes in better shape the apparency is that the amount of arc break would be case indicator it is not case indicator he has professional specialty and all of his training says do not duplicate bad auditing so he of course cannot duplicate bad auditor so if he feels the auditor is doing bad job he refuses to duplicate the auditor and of course duplication and havingness being the same breed of cat he of course loses his session much more rapidly that strike home that sound familiar to you all right youre just unwilling to duplicate bad session so therefore you put up quite show as pc has nothing to do with your case but has great deal to do with your professional attitudes or aptitudes all right nothing shows up faster in the auditor than an unfamiliarity with the bank and if scientologist who is familiar with the bank is being audited by scientologist who isnt at all familiar with the bank and hasnt any idea what the bank is all about youre never going to get session and thats it at every side this thing is going to arc break naturally because scientologist is supposed to duplicate bankhandling procedure which is reliable and good the pc being scientologist will not duplicate bad handling quite interesting its an interesting function manifestation rather effective process to get over bad auditing session would be what part of blank or an auditor or persons name would you be willing to be or what about soandso would you be willing to be what about soandso would you be unwilling to be you get the idea well now that shows up with great subjective reality at once that there are certain things about the auditor that the pc is unwilling to be and it is his unwillingness to be which makes it almost impossible for auditing to occur now scientologist will respond much faster to routine auditing which does so show some insight than any raw meat that ever walked off the street ill guarantee you if this other factor is introduced however he will riot move at all because of course he cant communicate in the session communication duplication you have to have duplication in order to have communication the auditor gives an auditing command the scientology pc is out the window if the command has absolutely nothing to do with what the pc is doing raw meat thinks hes wrong you see he thinks well i i dont know something new to therefore he says well the grapevine the grapevine im supposed to climb the grapevine the auditor has said well now take look at that grapevine well hes never really ever mentioned grapevine you see there wasnt any grapevine in the session and suddenly out of the blue why the auditor says take look at the grapevine well raw meat just says well grapevine he says there must be grapevine here theres obviously grapevine here so he mocks up grapevine or something of the sort tries to make something out of all this and hes little bit confused but he doesnt dare protest because of the altitude factor all right so hell go on and do an apparency of pcing you see you tell scientologist hes sitting there and hes looking at this railroad track and the auditor says all right now what about this grapevine and scientologist says grapevine what what the hell are you talking about what grapevine oh grapevine you mentioned few minutes ago grapevine i mentioned few minutes ago i dont recall mentioning any grapevine oh oh oh oh oh youre talking about i said it was on the grapevine it was rumored oh and youll get something like christ almighty why the hell dont you learn how to audit almost instant response dont you see and the auditor has not been in good communication with the pc hes made some little flub of some kind or another you get this razzledazzle going and whambo see well now if the auditor has good familiarity with the bank he will know exactly what he has done so therefore he can handle it and therefore the arc break doesnt continue very long he understands dont you see see instantly hell say well this pc must have been looking at something else and was quite absorbed in it and ive distracted his attention and i must be writing script here see i must have written little script now lets find out what the pc is doing so right away the auditor finds out that hes had the wrong look at the situation he says well all right what are you looking at then oh pc says this railroad track all right all right what about the railroad track railroad track and it goes on to infinity and so forth and it soandso cognition and this and that and so forth and that was what i was trying to tell you well all right i heard you now theres more arc break but the auditor who has reality on the bank will go this way the pc says grapevine what the hell grapevine good god why dont you learn how to audit see well hes thinking hes almost going into this you see and this other person says well takes up at once the flub puts the pcs attention on the flub you see and the flub isnt anything because its not aberrative but whats in the bank is see so he puts his pcs attention back on what is aberrative see and the auditor isnt so selfconscious about this but the auditor who has familiarity with the bank will say something like oh well couple of minutes ago you talked to about grapevine what did you mean about grapevine uh well i dont know it was this grapevine i mean i said it was on the grapevine and that meant some kind of rumor and so forth well i misunderstood you i thought you said that i thought you said that you had grapevine there well i didnt have grapevine here uh oh well well what kind of rumor was that that you were talking about well i dont know ive forgotten about it now see the auditor doesnt have the dimmest concept he sees the pc the pc is apparently there in body is apparently there in present time is apparently able to talk and so forth and has idea that the pc is not in present time but the pc is on the backtrack and the pc is actually expressing displeasure at having his attention flicked off of what his attention is on you see well the auditor that has some experience with the bank he says well this pcs attention is on something else what the hell is his attention on dont you see he says at once well the pcs attention must have been on something else well what is the pcs attention on and of course the session continues but if the auditor thinks that this arc break is terribly important the mistake is terribly important hell put the pcs attention over on the mistake and we get an entirely different situation going because now we have nothing to talk about but the mistake now well get off with tr 5n and so on and all this adds up to what this adds up to auditing ah but that is the only basis of the arc break haha so the more we handle the mistake the less auditing occurs so the more arc break occurs so apparently then you cant blow an arc break look simple you see so the auditor who has familiarity with the bank does not see why the pc is going kind of zzzzzzzz see he hasnt any subjective reality on the idea that somebody can be there and absorbed in something and looking at something and trying to do something and trying to follow out maybe an auditing command and has his attention on something if he understands this and if he knows this and if he has subjective reality on it of course his first thought rules or rules you see his first thought is well what the hell is his attention on see not selfconsciously what horrible mistake i have made now i will have to remedy this terrible mistake i have made well of course the person isnt projected on the pc hasnt any reality on whats going on he hasnt any idea that the pcs doing other than just sitting in chair see he thinks the pcs sitting in chair so the pcs there to be sat in chair so therefore the pc is person sitting in chair in present time who is just nastily and out of the meanness of his disposition or her disposition is having an arc break you get the adjudication see so you get an overt on the part of the auditor and an overt on the part of the pc and then you get dogs breakfast for session get the idea you can make fantastic number of flubs if you know what youre doing you actually can you can just go on flub flub flub and you know what youre doing you can always grab them but if your flubs are being made and you have an understanding of the subjective situation of the pc you can straighten them up so fast that theyre just there yeah you give the pc wrong auditing command or something like this you miss an auditing command and so on and pc starts to answer it dont stop him let him answer the auditing command then give him the right one dont keep dragging the thing up to pt but you see person who has subjective reality on the bank has idea that hes dragging pc up to pt you see hes not using any process that drags pc up to pt except put attention on the session so actually the pc now gets present time collapsed on the track well hes rather out of control he has hard time orienting himself now disorientation is for one thing the source of dreams and delusions disorientation person has dream well if you have dream youre worried about having nightmares something like that you want to cure yourself of having nightmares or when you wake up out of the nightmare well look it over and figure out how the nightmare spotted you somewhere how it located you and figure out where you are and locate yourself after youve done that few times you become so unanxious about locating yourself that you dont have nightmares interesting isnt it thetans in the skull and he cant find out where he is the eyes are closed and the body is asleep he cant find out where he is so he puts up some pretended or false knowingness as to where he is and so the false knowingness as to where he is then makes this sequence known as dream or nightmare or whatever and thats all that is its pretended knowingness about location is what dream is old papa freud were around why im sure he would contest that hed say thats actually dream is the expression of inhibitions because everybody knows man lives with horrible ravening beast barely repressed below the censor i think the guy must have been on naval vessel during the time of war and after duty he always had to censor letters or something he had some engram running there but the upshot of this is of course youd get totally wild idea if you were processing brain or something of the sort and you and there was thetan present why youd choose the thetan for your randomity and after that youd of course believe that there was primitive being of some kind or another which lay down below the intellectual surface of the mind and youd get all sorts of wild ideas and so forth well the second you disorient thetan you give him the only real shock that he can get youve sort of chosen him out for your randomity you sort of told him get lost get confused get lost now when youre auditing with the processes youre using and so forth youre in direct communication with the thetan all right now this guy hes got problems and theyre disorientation problems of various kinds and most of these problems are just disorientation he doesnt know where he is you see all right so hes down the track someplace groveling around and looking under odd corners of things to find out where he has been and you spring surprise on him and his first reaction is not to know where he is so his next action is delusory knowingness hell put up pretended knowingness he knows he doesnt know something but the first his first reaction is to tell you that he doesnt know something he doesnt know what you are doing he doesnt know this he doesnt know that you get the idea well actually all of hes all hes saying is im disoriented i was in one time stream and now youve got back in this other time stream and now what the hell are we doing its as simple as that dont you see he thought he was going through the back alleys of timbuktu about to be knifed dont you see and youve got him all persuaded that hes in timbuktu with your auditing command whether you realized it or not you were persuading him he was in timbuktu youve said youve given him an auditing command of what unknown alley could you confront see and hes obediently confronting some unknown alley and then you give him an unknown room because hes not aware of the room very much and you give him the room suddenly dont you see and then you insist he stays in the room while he is still in the alley and hell put up delusory arguments see just like dream or nightmare you know hell put up all kinds of reasons why you did this and the only reason why the auditor did this is because the auditor didnt have enough subjective reality on the bank to realize that the pc is in another time stream and thats it thats the only thing that occurred he didnt have enough reality on the pcs bank and he fostered disorientation and the pc becomes confused thereby and the delusory character of pc who is telling you all sorts of extraordinary things about your auditing and so forth these things are simply delusory hes trying to orient himself hes trying to find the unknown but of course hes in the unknown of thinkingness because hes confused enough not to be able to confront the unknown of whereness see the unknown of whereness you know location always requires more on the part of the pc than unknown of idea you see solids take much more ability to confront than an idea see thetan finds it very easy to confront an idea because he generally even thinks of himself as an idea you see so he finds it very hard to confront suddenly the masses which is to say location his location factor is the last thing hell confront so therefore he gives you delusory ideas as to what is going on when as an actual fact hes looking for factual location as to where he is dont you see and if you dont put him where he is in hurry he will go on delusorizing as to what you are doing and what he is thinking and what this is all about dont you see he just adds significance significance significance significance significance and this is all an effort on the part of the thetan believe it or not to orient himself it doesnt sound like it at first collision but it is just an effort to orient where he is all the auditor has to do to shut any of this off is to find out where the pc has been and where he is thats all its so elementary you see but an auditor would have to have an idea that there is place to be called the bank before he could ask the pc where he is in it see if he didnt have good solid subjective reality on the isness of bank he could be startled enough not to remember the textbook rule of always ask the pc where he is he would never think of this because its one of seven thousand rules an auditor who has good subjective reality on this the pc says what what the hell what what was what what are you doing so forth he knows what hes looking at he knows hes pcs attention has been on something and therefore hes had an orientation called bank orientation dont you see and he now longer has this orientation he is groping for an orientation he cant find himself in the room he cant find himself in the bank and therefore he feels very confused of course all the auditor can do is to find out well where are you see where are you what are you looking at what were you looking at not even just before you said that you see just before i made this mistake where were you now of course youve done this sequence youve put the pcs attention on the mistake and then put them on the whereness and now he doesnt know where the hell he is see youve given him via you can cure up an arc break and then by mentioning it in your next question arc break the pc twice as bad all over again its very simple youre asking security check question of some kind or another and you say well now just before that arc break i was going to ask you this question now and you see whatd you do you disoriented him again see he thinks hes supposed to be looking at his bank and getting auditing and you seem to be insisting that he look at noauditing called an arc break dont you see but if youve got good reality on the bank and the thenness of things and so on which is rather simple reality to attain actually why you get this other response and he rather grumpily says well i i was looking at this alley what alley this alley all right how long is it well its just an alley alley it isnt very damn long alleys normally arent hes still nattering hes little bit disoriented and so on well does it end does it run between two streets or what yeah well it ends between two streets and so forth well where is it there exactly and so on its here in cairo oh this is cairo he says this is cairo yeah i got it this is cairo theres the mosque and theres the street and theres the fiacres and theres the antibritish slogans and yeah i see where i am now oh fine all right thats dandy and he forgets all about the arc break orientation thats all it is but if of course as i say stressing again if the auditor has idea that there is whereness called the bank or the time track of course he doesnt he isnt actually capable of finding the whereness in the pc because he only knows that it exists intellectually so yeah having look at time track and having look at some pictures and engrams and secondaries and getting sensation of thenness and so forth is worth thousand hours of tr 0 to improve auditing quality see that all right now ill give you few processes by which an auditor could be audited and would wind up with reality on the bank you couldnt shake with bat and actually hell have to attain this anyhow before he even vaguely gets clear hell an auditor who is skipping out of the bank and skipping out of the engram and skipping off the track and skipping into pt he reminds somebody of parachute you kknow with compressed air blowing up against the top of the chute hes never goes down he just always floats up matter what you do he comes up and hell have to get over that before he gets clear anyhow so this is great kindness heres command what unknown would you escape from and what unknown would you attack this is simply basic command form and this is of course reach and withdraw on unknowns any verb form on either one of them is just escape the unknown attack the unknown see now you put it over into the valence rules and you say think of an unknown who would escape from it who would attack it got the idea that gets valences coming into it and you can go at this in reverse and you could say think of being what unknown would he escape from what unknown would he attack all kinds of command forms but its just escape and attack from unknowns and of course you the pc in this particular case is sitting in the middle of some wild unknown incident of some kind or another and hell start attacking and escaping from engrams he just cannot help himself from doing so and hell plunge around in the track like bumblebee in bottle wont know what the hells cooking of coourse hes never realized that hes right in the middle of the track he is not in present time he has kidded himself for years he is not oriented at all because hes totally surrounded by engrams he isnt looking at and anybody whos obsessively in present time is simply stacked up with engrams and thats all there is to that people who have obscure somatics or notsoobscure somatics are of course sitting in an engram now when you find that person who has somatics who has also quote never been back on the track and has awareness of thenness in the bank you know has awareness of yesterday in the bank of course that person is not in present ttime at all that person has escaped by total withdrawal from some environment which may be two hundred billion years ago see so theyre not in present time not even vaguely and of course this type of auditing command escape an attack from unknowns well of course theyre trying to escape from the unknown of what theyre in and at the same time they must be trying to attack the unknown of what theyre in and itll just unfold engrams like bunch of picture postcards you buy in venice thats one of them thats just one of them now you could have valencetype process who would escape from things who would attack things milder process now you can throw this over into beingness you can throw it over into beingness and youll also throw up track that comes into view ill go into this in minute as to why but you can write it down beingness who would you be willing to be who would you rather not be will show up track your first one is the beefiest one these others are simply variations of one kind or another now the reason why beingness is functional is that valences are packages and part of the package of valence is track valence has track this is great oddity but every once in while you find somebody without his own bank he isnt running in his own bank any pictures of himself will be wildly out of valence he is never never never in valence he always sees himself from afar if you do get him on the track he sees himself from afar and he gets the vaguest and thinnest impressions imaginable of being in anything its very unconvincing dont you see i mean well he has this picture of himself as child well ask him well how do you see the picture well the child is down there well you can immediately assume you have somebody out of valence who is therefore having valence trouble if he does have any pictures of his bank you would not be able to find them at first glance why let us say he is in mothers valence so of course the only pictures he gets of himself are the pictures seen by mother he always sees himself through somebody elses eyes so he has the bank of each person in whose valence he has gone and this becomes the most disorienting confusing sort of thing that anybody ever had anything to do with but first and foremost thing that it does is promote an unreality of location because of course the fellow knew he was in himself as child but as he gets the picture of it he does not see himself below his eyes he sees himself over there on the other side of the room well obviously hes seeing through somebody elses this must be picture in somebody elses bank immediately you see quite curious some of the phenomena here but every valence is complete package valence has bank has all these nowimsupposedtos has skills has disabilities and so forth its just package person dont you see its package person that does not exist in fact but is only resident in the mind and is mocked up by the pc now the pc of course entered this on the basis of not being able to have the person and not really controlling the person and so if the pc doesnt have or control the person in any way of course he cannot have or control any of the mechanisms of the person so you cannot move that bank its not his bank see he hasnt enough ownership of it to run it as an engram dont you see how he hasnt any ownership of this bank because its somebody elses he doesnt have any theres way he could change that persons personality you could audit him practically forever and youre trying to change somebody elses characteristics never his own ideas or characteristics theyre all packaged characteristics of the other now of course there was point where this person did enter or did accumulate or collect this other valence see and thats the only point where the valence will break by following this principle that valence is total package and then by the dealing with beings who you see and persons rather than ideas the auditing of beings rather than the auditing of ideas and conditions the auditing of beings rather than the auditing of pictures these views of other banks you see will suddenly blow off and the person will be left with some of his own pictures or you get two or three of these things blown off and one of the most effective ways of doing this happens to be routine 3 complete and thats why it clears people of course but theres shorthand way of doing this and you can really shake up bank you can really shake one up just by running any beingness process just any beingness process just like think of being thank you think of being thank you think of being thank you think of being thank you thisd be the most idiotically its long drag sort of process it may not be very stable may not be anything happening but it is going to shift the bank it will shift the fellow around and it will cure somebody of standing outside looking in at his own life and itll give him his own track back youre every once in while auditing pcs who have tremendous number of pictures that they dimly recognize as not theirs they dont have much familiarity with these pictures theyve got real recollection of these pictures and it seems sort of dull and sort of thin you get hell of an unreality going well theres i run across case in point there was person had whole bunch of pictures of sexual activities he couldnt fit them on the backtrack he couldnt fit them on the whole track this is one of the mechanisms by the way which invalidates past lives every once in while an individual gets into it and sees some thin pictures of past lives of some kind or another he cant integrate them in any way and he says well dimly well i sort of have some pictures on the track but i dont know and so forth the persons having beingness trouble of course in his past life he was another being and his other beingness is so flagrantly fact that its the same as somebody elses bank when this has occurred that when the other being he was being in the past life was in another valence figure that one out now people that have valence trouble go very easily accumulate very easily other valences and go into other valences very easily so he probably has been doing it for number of millennia so its not just one lifes worth of pictures that are wrong it is utterly thousands ill give you an example of this subjective reality on the thing this really had puzzled for while back about 1605 something like that i was set up i wont go into the story in any great deegree but it took warship and company of marines and broadside to kill one girl and its such fantastic ferocity you see to launch against one girl she was protected by four redcoats and and of course we caught it in the first three seconds of play dont you see that was the end of us but it was such terrific ferocity against this girl who by the way was blind now this really starts pouring it on see she was and her face was so disfigured through bomb assassination attempt when she was child at seven that she had to wear mask and she was rather pathetic little character whole manofwar and company of marines landing in boats and full broadside to kill this one girl she was the last of the family of charles v she was the granddaughter aspirant of the old holy roman empire and one of the innumerable french that lived down here about sixty miles had decided she was great menace to the throne so they set her up to be assassinated well that was quite an assassination it was with it was skyrockets see well i was being audited one day i found myself sitting around with picture of girl on rock apparently about 1870 didnt compare with any track i had nice exterior view it just didnt make sense didnt have any track i knew anything about here was girl sitting on rock in exactly the same location in exactly the same place and i knew what happened to the girl and i knew all about it and so forth but i hadnt ever known the girl fascinating what this was all about was very very simple apparently id kept spot of attention on this person as thetan for the next couple of hundred years i didnt have the girls valence particularly but there was there was cross there right at the moment of confusion dont you see i had her future bank you know id tracked the bank of this particular which gave whole set of totally disrelated pictures that had absolutely nothing to do with my pictures and nothing to do with the track it was very intriguing they were very thin very unreal i knew all about them but they didnt have any real substance dont you see and right now i could say well possibly this is the way the track looks to an awful lot of people dont you know its very thin and theres nothing much to it and so forth and its all just kind of an idea well it was this girls track from the time she had been killed straight on up i still had it on file funny part of it is that this girl picking up another body after that had gone along for very long time and had then happened accidentally to be taken by her parents to exactly the same rock that she was killed on in 1605 and she became very ill and she sickened and she died just keyed her in complete you possibly know the place its right across from gib and the hotel reina christina is on the spanish coast side and its one of those rocks right close to the reina christina hotel and of course its tourist resort and her parents had taken her back there what dirty trick that must have been some vacation man all right so you take an incident of vast confusion of motion that one is not willing to tolerate well one is willing to tolerate such motion in battle perhaps one in naval battle and its all the way it should be but the motion occurs at moment or with target which isnt suited to the motion dont you see theres this much bombardment and yippityyap and it causes hell of disorientation and you say well that shouldnt be you see and big protest about the whole thing and therefore you start tracking it now valence could occur that way and ordinarily however what would have happened is that whoever had been there would have picked up the girls valence dont you see and would have gone ahead with the girls valence and that would have been the person who died because her parents took her back on the rock dont you see that would be what valence solid valence picture would look like and this person wouldnt have any more pictures than the man in the moon theyd all have somebody elses pictures dont you see itd all be something else and itd all be from the wrong point of view and what would this add up to thisd add up to disorientation all of which springs from spot of total disorientation some incident which has in it total disorientation then is liable to breed total outofvalence situation from there on up all right somebody whos in that kind of condition of course is having valence trouble and an auditor whos having too much valence trouble of course has great reality on somebody elses bank because he thinks this bank is not bank you see its kind of well its about as real to him you know as thin indistinguishable picture cast up on that wall with the room lights on with cracked magic lantern slide never bothers him to look at pictures doesnt bother him at all you start running this person back however they wind up in the middle of some kind of an explosion eighteen spacecraft all of sudden collide instantly and immediately on one point in space because as he was picking up his paperweight off of the chart room desk you see it wasnt the paperweight but it was the fleet signal alarm or something you see and he shouldnt have done this and youll find him at this point of disorientation and hell be in and there was cabin boy there or something of the sort that he was quite fond of and you find him in the valence of the cabin boy only he isnt quite sure maybe its the captain you know and its all tingletangle and it goes back to such point that is the type of incident it takes to make valence transfer they are not just the conditioned reflex well joe just keeps hammering at mary you see and keeps hammering at mary and pretty soon why mary goes into joes valence thats ordinarily how we look at this thing were too prone to believe that aberration is gradient scale because it can be taken apart by gradient scale aberration is such thing for joe to go into marys valence there is either long track association with plenty of violence murder poison and sudden death on it or there is very similar person or something and there is some fantastic overt of some kind or another against such person which contains tremendous amount of violence and motion thats what it goes back to but of course the psyrologist looking at the tame stupid life that he himself leads in our modern world you see sitting at his hydraulically operated desk with his chromium selfpushing graph pens and he couldnt conceive of this much experience dont you see and he doesnt find that there is anybody in life ever has any real experience so of course it just must be the business of living itself daybyday living is what is aberrative this is what he winds up at and of course you take this character he would have reality on the backtrack hed have reality on anything of that character you shove him back on the backtrack and he finds out there was experience of some kind or another on the backtrack if he continued to see it through an othervalence bank you see of some kind you wouldnt wind up then with any kind of reality on it he wouldnt have much reality but of course the keynote of the case is he doesnt have much reality anyhow so he never conceived of this sort of thing now one of the things you want to watch for in auditors is the auditor who says that he has reality on past lives watch it because that person has not collided with his bank very hard he has touching acquaintance he has you know sort of polite hat tip you get him in the tonsillectomy and hes out there on the outside of the hospital you see and he knows how to run tonsillectomy you get on the outside of the hospital and you just watch the picture you see the picture of the hospital and you kind of look through the window and thats fine and thats it youve run the engram you see have you ever seen picture of an operation yes he says yes you see and that line of questioning is not very productive of anything but the line of questioning of you have any reality on past lives that is productive see because hell tell you quite frankly he does not have all right well thats not reprehensible nobodys trying to force anything on him im just giving you symptom of the thing this fellow is having valencebank trouble and having valencebank trouble youre not now likely to discover an inthemiddleof 3d sort of picture unless you look pretty hard all of sudden if he gets in the picture hell come out of it see therell be idea of attention stuck on pictures or attention in pictures or anything like that well until he himself has got some kind of reality of this character he will worry about his auditing flubs and these auditing flubs he knows that he has perfectly decent wish to help his fellow man theres nobody disputing that in any way whatsoever and hell wonder why pcs arc break or why he cant quite handle this pc or handle that pc and this will be very mysterious to him and hell say well i better have eight thousand hours more of tr 0 see and id better grind the midnight oil you know and id better read scientology 8 8008 or something or maybe theres something on tape i havent heard or and hell get into considerable anxiety about this particular activity why does he why do his pcs blow up and then hell get lot of loses and then hell decide well i maybe shouldnt audit you know and so on whats he trying to do hes trying to orient himself with datum or something of the sort well the datum hes actually looking for is just this as long as he has low subjective reality on bank of course when pc gets into one his understanding is not instantaneous so he will do fumble hell do little fumble and little comm lag and this little fumble and little comm lag will be just that instant necessary to permit the arc break to go bloom see the pc drops down in tone and is not making very much forward progress and then maybe blows up or blows session or something of the sort this is the common experience it is not true that this person was trying to do something bad to the pc that is not true it isnt true that this person didnt know his scientology he did none of these things that you would normally consider true are true its just this one little fact is the individuals mechanisms of handling life have been escape from self into others escape from situation out up dont get any real good contact with the horrors of yesterday because theyre just too horrible man and the best thing to do is just stay out of valence and out of picture and out of thenness and if you just stay out of thenness enough youll be all set alcoholics synonymous have themselves considerable time with this they have little mottos like live twentyfour hours at time and so on they also have another little motto which gets in your road occasionally and if you dont know about it youll have trouble processing alcoholics they have another motto which alcoholism is incurable and thats the first thing you have to know and thats the first thing you have to admit to be member of alcoholics synonymous you can get in the wildest arguments with an alcoholic well you say well well audit you for while and then youll be all right and you wonder what the devils the matter with the man you know whats the matter with him is he had to swear on stack of well i dont know what they swear on actually i guess empty bourbon bottles that they will never be cured of alcohol its practically amounts to that when you reaad the textbook of alcoholics anonymous your hair stands on end all looks fine right up to the point when you read the fact that they can never be cured they will never get over it and theyve had it and they must just succumb to the whole idea that they are an alcoholic they have to admit this ah youre digging somebody out of that what are you doing theyre just plowing him in harder and harder and harder into the valence of somebody that he thought was an alcoholic anyway that aside beyond the point the difficulties which you encounter all come under the heading of auditor comm lag and you yourself will recognize it looking back over the times when youve had pcs arc break on you that if youd just been in there little faster it wouldnt have happened and if you yourself have been ex inexpertly audited you can look it over and you can look at it very bluntly and you realize that if the auditor just said something before all of that silence and so on or you know if they hadnt fumbled and given the appearance of fumbling there wouldnt have been any arc break well whats that fumble now were really getting down to fundamentals see well that fumble is just the unreality that he has on what the pc is doing or going through and the fumble is sufficiently long to permit the pc to get out from underneath his control so actually you dont have time to look up the datum in the textbook or even to remember it dont you see your response must be instantaneous you must be in there so on so when i say there is substitute for knowing your business of course youve got to know scientology but youve also got to know instinctively the reactions of the mind what is this guy doing see what goofball situation is this you see and you havent even got time to say well lets see what is happenning here you know well the only thing that teaches you data to that degree is experience race driver who has read lot of textbooks on the subject of racing car doesnt take dead man bend you see out of the textbook he feels the wheel slipping its gone off and its hitting just slightly into the gravel its only an inch deep in the gravel and hes back on the track ah but if he read it in textbook and it said when you feel the wheel hit the gravel on the edge of the track you should turn the wheel slowly to the opposite direction oh yes i remember that now it was on page 73 well by this time they are of course are putting him in the ambulance and thats just exactly what happens in your arc breaky auditing difficulties when you get into these you dont yourself have enough subjective reality this isnt true of all auditors you see because they do have subjective reality the edge of the wheel hits the gravel and they of course they say well the edge of the wheel has hit the gravel but theyre already doing something about it you see theyve already turned the wheel pc isnt going in that direction anymore its very simple it is so simple that an auditor who has good subjective reality hearing this tape will wonder what the hell im talking about they say of course naturally yes well so what and then they sit down opposite mr doakes for an auditing session theyre the pc now and mr doakes in the auditing session the wheel edges over and one inch of wheel tire moves over into the gravel and mr doakes looks up in the textbook on how to drive racing cars how to drive mark sixteen racing car particularly and the conditions of the track and thats all on page 173 and so forth and he happens to get stuck on the datum of the worm gear of the steering wheel and so on details of you see well of course your poor auditor at this point is being picked up in pieces and put in the ambulance thats about all that happens because really you what what the hell is going on see and then you have great difficulty settling back and feeling relaxed enough to go into the bank because you know the next patch of gravel hes going to do the same thing amount of explaining on your part and amount of teaching on my part or anybody else is going to teach him anything enough data and enough textbooks and enough huge plots and blueprints as to how you do it to overcome that little comm lag see you could maybe drill him that every time the pc says what are you doing he says where are you but i think this would lead to an instantaneous arc break you see because he really doesnt want to know you get the idea so the only basic fundamental cure is to get somebody over the jumps now auditing has to be done before clearing that of course is the fundamental problem everybody can look at this and say well of course that is the problem lets clear everybody and then lets audit lets clear everybody on earth and then lets audit somebody figured it out the other day that you couldnt possibly clear everybody in new york city because it would require so many thousand auditors working so many thousand years and so forth and they figured it all out and they had it all taped and this was conclusive fact that you couldnt clear new york city they had absolutely totally omitted the fact of making any new auditors this had been omitted from the calculation it isnt true that an auditor has to be cleared before he can audit that is definitely not true and if it were true itd be god help earth that would be stopper that nobody could get around itd be nice you see and where auditors do get clear you find out they make clears very rapidly ill give you datum here brenda scott who was cleared on the last australian course back in sydney has cleared two more people well shes hardly been home any time at all but similarly an uncleared auditor off south african course who didnt get clear has also cleared somebody in south africa see get the idea so it isnt requisite to clearing is not to be clear its nice its nice its always nice when youre out in storm to be in nothing but camper and nicholson vessel that is fully equipped with all stabilizers and is fully proofed against everything and so on but at the same time why some old hooker that you picked up in back bay with half its bottom falling out itll very often ride storms too you see but it would be nice if you were in this other yacht but not absolutely necessary well anyway the road toward making good auditor is to get the auditor subjective reality on the bank now dont think that that is going to occur automatically by reason of straight auditing that is not going to occur automatically because people can be audited for many many many many hours with reality on the bank without getting one this has been demonstrated time and time again and where routine 3 is being terribly unthinkably ghastly awful slow its just that this particular facet of case has never been hit the escape mechanism of the case has not been triggered off it is still very much in full bloom and so the case as he runs the processes of course never does take any kind of tour of the track but is dealing with other things and you still got an escape mechanism going now the escape mechanism is not necessarily difficult mechanism to overcome it is surrenders rather easily because it is based on another idea than that which degrades or aberrates thetan escape is simply method of handling bank that is all its just method of handling bank its not method of getting aberrated now you can go reductio ad absurdum and trace it back and say well yes and if hed only stood and confronted it at the time but im sure that there are clears and they will not walk out in the middle of market street and say well i should be able to confront all this oncoming traffic from the middle of the street im sure they wont carry this on as practice they find themselves in the middle of market street in san francisco they will go over to the curb got the idea well you could say well theyre practicing an escape mechanism they didnt stand there and get run over the deterioration of case is based on another mechanism the individual longer has confidence in himself as himself and so he adopts another packaged beingness which could handle the situation and then this beingness he conceives to be useless in the handling of life and it is not solution so he adopts another packaged beingness in order to handle life and then that one is thoroughly invalidated why then of course he gets another one and when that one is thoroughly invalidated why he gets another one see how it goes and your backtrack of clearing could not be followed by the idea of escape because thats much too simple statement of the situation person can find themselves inadequate in numerous ways besides the fact that they are trying to escape i know lots of things that man would be very foolish fellow and thetan would be very foolish fellow not to escape from when youre wearing body which is inflammable it is not good sense not to escape from fire that is what comes under the heading of preservation of property but the deterioration of selfconfidence in being able to handle life in all of its facets and aspects goes down into degradation and it makes one believe that he now must have another beingness in order to handle things for him and now he starts living life on an irresponsibility and that being goes out and he gets another being on top and that being goes out and eventually this goes into the life death cycle that right now is so normal and usual on this planet well its of course about as normal and usual as girl in pink tights standing out on on buckingham palaces flagpole it is not at all usual you dont have to kick the bucket every few years this is not any part of your contract but life invalidating the body and the beingnesses the valences gets down to an invalidation which says well the best thing to do is to chuck the mockup well that just marks failure person ages to the degree that they feel invalidated and this could be stated processingwise the age of man in any lifetime is directly proportional to the accumulation of unknowns which of course is invalidation you could almost measure the physical age of person on this basis now of course this is exaggerated in childhood and probably in childhood that is why you get fast growth kids have terrific amount of unknownness and they move up rapidly through this unknownnesses and so forth but youre getting proportionate aging youre getting very rapid aging actually the change but of six months in childs life in his first ten years makes considerable difference well frankly hes getting lot of pretended knows and unknows and all that sort of thing theyre pounding at him one way or the other but hes carried through all this with hope and confidence you see because hes going to grow up and his growing up process of course doesnt necessarily carry with it all this validation of this confidence he felt he possibly shouldnt have been quite so confident unknowingnesses start to accumulate unknowingnesses now that he has hope of overcoming it and these go on and on and the unknowingnesses get greater and greater and greater and greater and he finally kicks the bucket aging the amount of gray hair and so on people are sometimes amazed at i get gray hair and then few weeks later i dont have gray hair and then i get gray hair and then gray hair and so on its the central organizations that are doing it you see i dont its how much i know about their operation or how many notknows theyre running on see directly proportional anyhow all joking aside i think you would do very well if youre seeking to prove up the auditing skill and of an auditor i think you would do extremely well to just check into this factor of reality on thenness and what he considers picture is and so forth and then use those processes i gave you or some other process similar to whoop this thing out and all of sudden straighten out his track in other words do track straightenout activity of some kind or another and youll all of sudden find his auditing ability will suddenly go zzzoooom he wont necessarily get clear but at the same time he will clear faster get the idea now this pays benefit completely aside from auditing in that it permits an individual to experience more benefit per unit of time in auditing now one of the ways you grope with this situation is in doing goals and terminal assessments the more valences person is in the more goals he is likely to come up with or have or the more submerged his goal is likely to be but if person is susceptible to invalidation then you do have coordination between roughness of case and length of time that it would take you to find the goal if you didnt take up the invalidation factor with rudiments in other words persons goal is so easily and so swiftly invalidated that it plunges out of sight with the greatest of ease so as the goal vanishes you apparently then have many more goals than you should have dont you see but itd be susceptibility to invalidation well his susceptibility to invalidation is directly proportional to the number of valences he has accumulated because of course the invalidation of valences of self was what caused valences and then the invalidation of valences is what caused more valences you see so if theres anything going on it is basis of invalidation if you wanted to draw common denominator of all aberration it would be it could be said to be in the vicinity of invalidation the person is as aberrated as they are invalidated as they feel invalidated it wouldnt be proportional you could take whole line of men invalidate them all equally youll find out theyd all react differently to the same amount of invalidation it would be how much invalidation person feels not how much person has and you just breathe on some people youre just passing by them accidentally and you just breathe you dont even breathe at them and theyre promptly invalidated you see how this would be and some other fellow you walk up to him and you slap him on the back enough to break his spine and you kick him in the stomach and he looks at you admiringly and he says come on and have beer i know that would be rather foreign to your experience in this particular lifetime but out on the frontiers ive run into such men i hauled off and hit guy hard enough one time to knock him from one side of the ship to the other he went on bragging about people he bragged to people god he sure can hit you know never bothered him at all it was very invalidative of you know it was quite remarkable experience never occurred to him you see had dog one time his name was for albino and crazy old was malemute half malemute half spitsbergen pure white meaner than mean you know big tough strong and my poor old mother used to try to make this dog do something you know and she would beat at this dog with her fists you see and she would push at the dog and she would maul the dog and she would drag at the dog and of course all this dog knew how to do was the second he felt weight against his chest he knew what youre supposed to do youre supposed to pull and if anybody was crazy enough to have him on leash which had harness on it you see you just just the second you tighten up the leash hed mush and he could really pull of course my mother weighed about 110 pounds wringing wet and i have seen her just practically clean up on this trying to get him to do something you know trying to get him to walk on up the road with her or something out in the country you know and hes busy barking at cats or something like that and all would do was stand around and laugh at her you know and hed pant and hed just be so happy about the whole thing im getting some attention is about the only thing that ever registered on him hed just be so happy and when i first ran into one day he i was stranger hed been around there for quite while and i hadnt been home and he showed oh 1652 sharp wolf fangs you see and he came at with low charge and he was ready to eat up and of course he meant to stop two or three feet away you see and just scare half to death and you learn about dogs living in europe and alaska and things and i just grabbed him by the jowls you see on the loose skin on either side of his teeth and then using his impetus coming forward then swung him sideways you see and threw him about twentyfive feet he landed in the flower bed with terrible thud and got up and he came over and he looked at and he spent quite bit of time looking at and then he finally started to smile about the whole thing he had very short memory i was home every few months so id have to repeat the process but we always stayed friends yep by god hed you could just hear him say i swear by this ron you know he didnt have any clue he didnt have any clue of ever being punished you couldnt do anything to and he was about the healthiest brute you ever laid your eyes on now hes probably still living yet they sent him up into the woods to live with lumberjacks i know he was at it for five or six years and just thriving so you can imagine so from animal to animal person to person being to being the factor of invalidation is entirely different and as invalidation is rather common denominator of aberration therefore you find the factors of clearing are registering on people differently but more important to this lecture that persons responses as an auditor or as pc measure up this invalidation factor to large degree but not so mu
