most of the ai d program is only in its second year it is too early to judge success or failure however the program has attracted widespread comment and criticism on number of fronts questions include is the program being implemented fast enough although measures have been taken to speed up th process past obstacles have included the slow pace of reform lack of knowledge of the region an inability to identify reformist elements and congressional notification procedures is the program wellcoordinated at least 16 us agencies are playing role making coordina tion complicated and cumbersome process it is the responsibility of the state partments new independent states nis coordina tor to develop strategy and allocate assistance to meet that strategy is assistance reaching the grassroots some believe that an approach favoring small nongovernment organizations ngos volunteer programs and exchanges is the best way to reach the people of the fsu what is the appropriate role of us consultants and contractors some suggest there are too many highly paid consultants performing questionable job is assistance being used for corrupt purposes despite the limited potential for corrupt uses of us

program 19921994 this report written in 1995 provides hist orical background that may be useful to congress as it c onsiders funding l evels types of programs and problems in implementation of us assistance to other countries introduction in fy1994 the new states of th former soviet union fsu1 collectively became the second largest recipient of us foreign assistance made available from all sources2 this leap from program at all only three years before reflected the exceptional importance attached by the u s government to the region and the multiple foreign policy objectives political economic and strategic that the aid program is intended to meet in the pr onouncements of both the bush and clinton administrations as well as in series of authorization and appropriations bills approved by congress the united states seeks to foster democratic systems free market economies and responsible security policies in the fsu whether and how the assistance progra m is helping to bring about these objectives is increasingly question of inte rest to congress and the public at large oversight hearings congre ssional delegation visits nd most recently amendments to the fy1995 foreign aid bill have focuse d on implementation issues prominent members of both parties ve criticized the program for its slowness misplaced priorities and administrative disarray and have raised concerns regarding possible corruption and waste critical press reports most prominently in major publications such as us news and world report forbes and the wall street journal have generated additional interest largely as result of these multiple concerns congress cut the administration request for fy1995 nis aid funding from 900 million to 850 million further efforts to trim funding have been initiated on december 12httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95170crs2 3 the latter objective is dealt with directly by the defense departmentfunded nunnlugar program and is not part of the traditional ec onomic assistance program it is aimed exclusively at the four nuclear states russia belarus ukra ine and kazakhstan although included in some specified aggregate aid amounts in this paper nunnlugar fund activities are not discussed in this report1994 senator mcconnell new chairman of the senate foreign operations appropriations subcommittee issued foreign aid proposal for fy1996 that includes 12 cut in assistance for the fsu from the fy1995 level the issue wrapped in hyperbole and dist ortion needs clarification this report first describes some ssential features of the aid program types of assistance and specific activities being undertaken it then frames the basic issues that have arisen during its early implementation period and those that are likely to arise in future years and places the debate in perspective that will facilitate reasoned congressional deliberation overview of the us assistance program to the former soviet union purpose of ssistance program judging by the freedom support act au thorizing legislation subsequent appropriations bills and executive branch aid strategy statements congress and both bush and clinton administrations have held to the same objectives with regard to the use of foreign assistance in the fsu that is chiefly the establishment of democratic societies the promotion of free market economies the meeting of humanitarian needs and control and dismantlement of nuclear weapons3 in its january 1994 strategy paper the clinton administration added to these crosscutting theme the environment reflecting its emphasis on this subject in its worldwide foreign policyassistance program while all foreign aid is meant to serve us foreign policy the aid program for the fsu has been framed by congress and tw administrations as more closely tied to this purpose than others what many believe to be the most important foreign policy focus of the united states is in large part an effort to facilitate an internal makeover of the new states something many believe foreign assistance can help advance the programs foreign policy tie is particularly reinforced by the appointment of the state depa rtment as coordinator of th program and the state department has repeatedly emphasized the programs unique and distinct httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95170crs3 4 limited aid budget resources and the sense th at russia and some of the other republics are not underdeveloped in human and natural resour ces lead state department policymakers to make distinction between more longterm aid to developing countries and that to the fsu russia is not rwanda is one such refrain 5 the group of 7 industrial nations the unite d states france germ any britain canada italy and japan has taken leadership ro in organizing donor assistance to the fsuhistoric foreign policy purpose by noting that it is shortterm that the bulk of the russia program is destined to end by fy1998 and the others shortly thereafter4 to some extent the delivery of us aid is at the very least strong statement of us support for the changes occurring in the new states but assistance is intended as more than that us government commercial guarantees and insurance programs can facilitate us private investment considered by many to be key to the economic and political transition in the fsu technical assistance and training programs can help bring the recipient c ountries step clos er to achieving an economic and political environment that would encourage that investment humanitarian aid can alleviate social and political stress strategic assistance can help encourage and facilitate disarmament to the extent it meets these multiple objectives the assistance program is playing useful role as an instrument of us foreign policy amount and terms of assistance us bilateral assistance something as seemingly straightforward as the amount of assistance provided by the unite d states has become the source of much confusion and misinterp retation yet getting it right is cen tral to any judgment of the efficacy of the aid program since the pr ogram began some have argued that funding has been insufficient while others argue that large sums have been spent to effect how much does the united states in fact provide the answer to the question hinges in large part on what one counts as foreign assistance during the first two years of the program for example the state department tried to make the size of us contributions look significant presum ably to demonstrate strong us support for the political and economic transition to an fsu as well as g7 audience5 although state has since developed somewh at more sound presentation of us aid contributions its old claims 176 billi on as late as january 1994 may easily be viewed as overstated and are instructive in the potential for widely varying interpretations of the size nd content of the aid program for example at one point more than half of the state departments aid total was made up of credit guarantees and insurance this sum included commodity credit corporation ccc agriculture credit guarantees program that insures the repayment of market rate loans used to purchase us food commodities it is commercial program rarely if ever cons idered foreign aid and in fact is prohibited by statute for such use st ate department figures even included 19 billion in loans provided to the region prior to the dissolution of the soviet union russia has assumed responsibility for this debt further although the overseas private investment corpora tion opic and the export import bank eximbank arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95170crs4 6 some suggest that given the odds of default the subsidy amount currently required to back up loans is insufficient see general accounting office credit reform us needs better method for estimating cost of foreign loans and guarantees gaonsiadggd9531 december 1994part of the annual foreign op erations bill which appropr iates most foreign aid the face value coverage of their guarantee and insurance programs has never before been calculated and purveyed as specific dollar benefit to recipient aid country like the ccc program the eximbank is also commercial program designed to benefit us exporters finally unlike government reporting for other countries the state department aid levels included privat donations delivered with publicly funded transport on the other hand it can be argued that the state department has been correct in including the face value of credit gu arantee programs because other donors do so for the fsu program although none appear to include insurance coverage of the sort provided by eximbank and opic in addition russian defaults in the ccc program and rescheduling of debt have given it tempor ary concessional element6 finally all these programs can be defended as instrumental in supporting the regions economic and democr atic transition some also suggest that aid totals might appear exaggerated because much of the claimed assistance either credit or grant has not yet been either obligated or disbursed further some charge that the aid is not directly benefitting the recipients but is remaining in the united states these last two concerns are discussed in more detail below given the varying interpretations that might be made of aid figures it is difficult to put precise dollar amount on us assistance to the fsu grant aid since fy1992 that has been made available but not necessarily obligated yet is roughly 67 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95170crs5 table 1 us bilateral

it has been generally understood that however much assistance the united states promises to provide to the region it is merely fraction of what is needed for example the international monetary fund imf calculated that russia alone would require at least 20 billion in outside assist ance to meet its foreign exchange needs in both 1992 and 1993 as they put together programs of assistance in those years the g7 anticipated that the bulk of fundi ng would come from three international financial institutions the imf the wo rld bank and the european development bank ebrd7 member of these institutions the united states contributes between 10 and 20 of their costs and has often argued that similar proportion of their programs in the fsu may be view ed as us contribution to the region additional to its bilateral program for several reasons both the imf and world bank have provided much less assistance than was originally anticipated by the g78 the imf bases its loans onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95170crs7 8 continued toward glasnost in the imf challenge mayjune 1994 p 411 for another view of what has been provided policy reforms which russia and the other stat have been slow to adopt the g7 led by the united states ve pressured the imf to forego its usual reticence and provide loans prior to reforms as wa of encouraging progress rather than rewarding implementation the world ba nk has sent numerous experts to design prospective loan projects in wide range of sectors but few were approved by the russian parliament which wa s reluctant for the country to assume more debt in the past year however ifi programs have moved much more rapidly as of november 1994 they had provided or reached agreements to provide an estimated 113 billion of this

fy19921994 although difficult to capture an everc hanging program figures suggest that russia was receiving little more than half of bilateral grant ai d allocations under the bush administration

this formula in the 25 billion fy1993 supplementalfy1994 fore ign operations bill in september 1993 after conferees overrode nate report language that criticized the emphasis on russia at the same

currently expected to receive 44 of fy1995 appropriations critics have taken the view that us policy is t oo russiacentered and given the political uncertainties there greater emphasis should be placed on fostering the transition in the new countries on its fringe some would counter however that the reason other countries have not until now recei ved larger share of funds is that

dissolution of the soviet union policymakers and analysts have viewed this period as rare and perhaps fleeting window of opportunity to affect successful transition to democracy and free market economies prior to introducti on of the freedom support act in april 1992 many in congress were highly critical of what they perceived as the bush administrations failure to react to these changes with an appropriate sense of urgency in bringing foreign aid programs to bear on events in the region in fact the bush administration had begun to formulate program using the existing economic support

coordinator to transl ate broad policy into aid programs and projects has been questioned some belie ve that the coordinator acts more as an arbitrator of agency differences than dictator of policy much of the time it handles the bickering and disagreements of the numerous implementing agencies in the face of agency heads with their own influence in the administration it appears that the coordinator has had insufficient clout to dictate action in many cases the coordinators authority to allocate resources does allow him to mold program content the coordinator st rongly supported the housing construction program the enterprise funds and sp ecial opic fund in the face of adamant opposition from some agencies when it was decided to spend 200 million on educational exchanges and training the c oordinator reviewed the different programs and allocated funds between aid and usia he mandated funding of peace corps operations through the fsu account budget over aid opposition when the trade and development agency tda proposed support for the russian land commissions privatization effort nd aid opposed it on the grounds that the body was not sufficiently reformist the c oordinators office led the interagency discussions that led to final determination on which russian body would r eceive us support the coordinator was also reportedly responsible for new shift in emphasis and resources from technical assistance to trade and investment leading up to the yeltsin summit in september 1994 nevertheless there has been widesp read impression that the coordinator office has little power part cause or part effect of this is the rise of other centers of decisionmaking on assistance issues th white house national security council and the gorechernomyrdin

because most of the assistance funds ostensibly flow through aid allocations or transfers from aid to other agencies totalled 5246 million or about 21 of nis account fund ob ligations made to the end

perceptions of incompetence have given other agencies an opportunity to carry out these programs first in ea stern europe and now in the fsu some argue that russia is not like number of developing countries and aid is illequipped to run program there but other agencies have not operated in the fsu either and do not have the ma nagement experience aid can argue it possesses for insuring

entirely clear cut21 house report language on the free dom support act suggested that where there was expertise within the us g overnment it should be used but it also expected that aid would be

state coordinator but subsequent appropr iations legislation has insured that funds woul d be funneled through aid to other agencies involved in the program funds move from aid to other agencies in two ways under section 632a of the foreign assistance act funds are tr ansferred to other agencies which then obligate them under certain terms and conditi ons aid is not expected to monitor or evaluate the use of those funds alterna tively under section 632b transfers aid has oversight responsibilities funds are pr ovided for use by another agency but they are considered part of aids budget obligat ed by it and the recipient agency must allocate funds and meet aid reporting requi rements as though they were an aid contractor in the first year of the fs u aid program most transfers were

coordination how coordination or the l ack of it affects actual project implementation in the field is concern for policymakers when many agencies and contractors fail to coordi nate programs redundancy the most often cited consequence is only part of the problem in the volga region there were repeated seminars during 1993 on privatiz ation banking and related topics conducted by the peace corps and aids privatization contractors it is not so much that one may repeat what the other has done but that there may be an overload of activities targeted at the same audience that produces level of frustration and disillusionment with the aid program among the recipients this is particularly exacerbated by the lack of strategic planning that failure to coordinate simply reflects everyone in

advice comprehens ive and integrated program might link up peace corps business advisers with private sector consultants and microand small businesscredit program in one region alone where sufficient

autumn 1994 is assistance reach ing the grassroots many critics argue that us assistance does not directly reach the maninthe street and is not allocated in way that lets the general public in the fsu know the united states is supporting reform in re sponse to these concerns the clinton administration announced in april 1993 that it was seeking to make its assistance program more visible to the average russian citizen the president claimed that 75 of new russian assistance would be used outside of moscow nd the same proportion would be provided to non governmental bodies it is plausible that the administrations numerical target will eventually be met however it likely to take long time be fore fsu populations ar broadly cognizant of the impact or source of us assist ance programs for one

economic and political transition in the region these impacts should be kept in mind when the united stat allocates assistan ce or observers judge its success for example humanitarian activities food aid to vulnerable groups and provision of vaccinations in central as ia directly benefit the grassroots however while these are highly beneficial to particular groups and possibly serve to still

sufficiently the expertis and skills of local people which in the case of the fsu is considerab such program would not be likely to successfully adapt us advice to the social and political environment of that country and would fail to be accepted at times the assistance program has been charged with exactly this deficiency the gap between announcement of the ai d program and actua l implementation in the field the predominant use of us contractors and the delay in establishing grassroots programs noted bove helped foster the sens that local people were not being used at all lack of familiarity with the recipients and difficulty in identifying appropriate local expertise likely inhibited their use in the early stages and may still be factor however while for practical and political reasons most project experts are going to be drawn from the united states local personnel are being used increasingly in support and other roles for one thing as us contractors have set up offices and initiated their projects they have generally hired local staff at allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95170crs29 36 according to moscowbased us offici russians also complained regarding the number of assessment teams at the beginning of the rule of law project they did not understand the visits and delays in project activ ities leading to perception that the united states was doing little except talk 37 most egregious according to some americ an peace corps volunteers were the public relations activities on privatization oneday seminars provided by flyin consultants with little or advance preparation in different centers around the country 38 even the volunteer programs iesc and farmer tofarmer by their short term nature are subject to this criticism the farmertofarmer program for example has been asked repeatedly by russians to lengthen the term of service for its volunteers now roughly three weeks but this move has to be weighed against the numerous demands for experts in other locations and possible diminishing value over time limiting shortterm assignments means loss of specialized expertise one response by the treasury department has been to assign longterm economic advisers who provide continuity for both the recipient government and shortterm advisers brought in for specific tasks levels especially in the chaotic politi cal and economic environment of the new states successful contractors will lean heavily on local expertise one example of this is the large privatization project that has essentially joined forces with the state property committee gki the government body it largely assists the secret of its success to date according to aid staff is the high level of russian involvement and commitment to th purposes of the project throughout actual privatization activities began at grassroots level with various pilots first one in one region then ten in ten regions once model was perfected the project expanded to the national leve l in addition while fore ign experts were dominant in its early experimental stages once it became highly visible national program it evolved much more into russian program run largely by russians trained for the tasks required russians have also expressed displeasur at the flyin and flyout methods of many consultants36 in the first two years the majority of technical assistance experts were in the fsu on shortterm basis of few months or less37 this approach has been criticized because it implies lack of knowledge of the local situation but some suggest is also less effective because the fsu culture is highly personalized one where ideas are more likely to be accepted on the basis of friendship than merit alone both aid and state say they are now aware of this problem and are emphasizing longerterm assignments38 another concern regarding use of us consultants arose when it was suggested by the wall street journal and others that they were paid extremely high salaries funds that could have been spent directly on russians except in the case of peace corps and the other volunteer programs it is true that us experts are paid substantially higher salaries than those of the recipient country first the discrepancy between recipient country economies and that of the united states is one of the reasons the aid program exists second in the case of the fsu in particular the united states is seeking to provide the mo st sophisticated expertise to facilitate complex economic transformation in some cases us financial market accounting etc experts have accepted less than their usual salaries to gain experience in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95170crs30 39 some critics see harm in this it is however consistent with the us strategy of leveraging assistance 40 interfax september 6 1994 41 for

salaries low by us private sector standards that according to aid has only been breach ed for ten individuals all in fy1993 as result of these criticisms of technical assistance some have suggested that other types of assistance specifically some kind of cash transfer might be emphasized many in the russian governme nt would have preferred direct grants made to the foreign aid body they set up to coordinate the activ ities of the various donors the office for international coopera tion and development it would then delegate funds to the progra ms it thought useful others recommend using assistance funds for central government budgetary s upport to reward policy reform efforts however us funding levels may not be high enough to make much of dent on fsu debt or have much leve rage over policy the one exception is ukraine to which the united states in november 1994 committe d 72 million to cover costs of gas imports from russia some energyrelated policy reform will be condition of

raised regarding the contractors ie the private forprofit firms or charitable private voluntary organizations pvos which provi the consultant experts these implement the vast majority of us assist ance projects worldwide in the case of the fsu there have been complaints regarding the absence of competitive selection process the amount of paperwork invol ved in applying for aid grants geographical imbalance in those selected and an unfair preference for those with prior aid experience41 presumably due to its high profile and political import thousands of public organizations universities and private firm s have sought to participate in some fashion in the fsu program in addition to formal project bi dding there have been numerous unsolicited proposals submitted to aid 983

applying for an aid contract according to an aid official the stack included an internal procedural handbook not relate d to contract requirements 43 most recently in senate report 103287 accompanying hr 4426 the foreign operations export financing and rela ted programs appropriation bill 1995 p 72 reported june 16 1994 44 on aid official has stated that in genera l only 25 of bidders had never worked with aid beforewhile there are legitimate grievances regarding the contracting process it is difficult to discern them among the gripes th at emanate from hundreds of unsuccessful bidders many of whom lobby their representatives and the press since undertaking aid work is new xperience for many successful as well as unsuccessful bidders the onerous pa perwork requirements of the aid proposal and contracting process are shock42 many agree that reform of this process has been long overdue although lot of th accountability requirements exist in order to protect the interests of the taxpayer and are not peculiar to the fsu aid program under political pressure steps were taken early in the fsu program to try to circumvent the traditional c ontracting process and speed up the program for one instead of tens of small projects bein g put up for bid several large umbrella projects were established in major sectors these were contracted to major firms who then subcontracted pieces of the whole project to other firms this imposed less burden on the subcontractees and fr eed aid of much of the accounting and program responsibility and c onsequent personnel and pa perwork requirements that managing numerous small projects woul d entail second using its freedom support act waiver authority aid let some contracts wit hout going through standard bidding procedures consequence of these novel contracting procedures were complaints that aid favored its usual roster of contractors ie those with experience in developing countries and that therefore most of the contracts went to firms in the washington area members of congress in particular have criticized the possible geographic imbalance in the program in some cases pointedly remedying the situation by recommending funding for northwestern u s efforts in siberia and noting its concern on this issue in report language43 in selecting the primary contractor for its umbrella projects it stands to reason that aid under time pressures imposed by the state department would tend to go with known experienced quantities44 further aid would point out that the far more numerous subcontractors represent more diverse pool of organizations and geographi c locations rough count of major aid beneficiaries as of august 1994 shows th at washington area firms and organizations represent 57 of total pr imary contractors and grantees but only 24 of sub contractors and grantees responding to congressional criticism aid has increasingly sought to attract procurem ent from outside washington advertising opportunities in wider range of publications opening an office in california and holding procurement conferen ces in different regions httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95170crs32 45 this was 34 percent of the

successessome critics reserve special disdain fo r the larger contractors because they appear to encapsulate their perception of the worst features of the assistance program lack of knowledge of the region high expenses and little to show for it in the field to highlight these failures these critics point out disparity in performance between the large firms and the small us ngos conducting programs throughout the fsu in the effort to spend money quickly aid provided these large contractors with tens of millions of dollars tec hnical assistance cont racts amounted to 714 million in

reporte dly wondering how to spend the money in contrast the ngos ve been able to act quickly disbursing funds rapidly and working with local people while there is an element of truth to each of these charges there may also be elements of distortion aid does not possess sufficient staff to monitor hundreds of sm all contracts this is the job of large contractors the large contractors may not be versed in fsu culture but they are supposed to hire people who are to carry out the programs this may not always occur finally some contractors have moved slowly partly because project objectives changed fsu relationships have been slow to develop and poor management46 how is the program helping us business and investment and trade consultants and contractors are not th only americans who benefit financially from the fsu aid program through both bush and clinton administrations the executive branch and many members of congress have argued that the us private sector not government would ultimately provide the critical financial resources to transform the russian economy and that one role of the aid program was to mobilize the us private sector to this end given the limited amounts of foreign aid available this was pure realism but it s also been way to draw political support for the program inasmuch as us compan ies are expected to benefit substantially from the increase in trade

assistance through opic tda and depa rtment of commerce of course major advantage of opic usda and eximbank guarantee programs is that their main cost to the united states is the subsidy amount needed

bill the 227 million utilized in fy1994 leveraged 13 billion in loan guarantees47 some argue however that the subsidy is too low and does not account for the high risk involved in lending to the region recent gao report calculates 676 risk that russia will default on loan and 807 chance that ukraine will default48 such concerns led the eximbank to structure possible 2billion oil and gas framework agreement so that loan collateral will be generated from current production proceeds in the first two years of the aid program trade and investment activities moved slowly on the russian side there was some reluctance to incur further debt especially following temporary defa ult in november 1992 on repayment of ccc guaranteed loans that brought use of th at program to halt of roughly 165 applications referred by eximbank fo r russian approval in fy199293 russia approved about ten in addition fsu g overnments which remain the largest potential purchasers of us goods and deve lopers of projects that could utilize us investment were not yet in position to launch major development projects that might use foreign investment the uncertain business climate and lack of investment laws also had its effect on us busin essmen and like aid opic has been criticized by us businessmen for being too slow in making decisions and offering difficult terms for credit although opic and eximbank reported large numbers of registrations and expressions of interest in their programs by us business early on actual commitments and final approvals were few th numbers have grown substantially in the past year in fy1993 eximbank guaranteed 184 million in face value loans and opic 135 million in fy1994 they covered 13 billion and 700 million respectively it is not possible to say whether the in surance and guarantee programs intended to compensate for inherent risks are having an impact on those who otherwise would not have invested in the region or that the investments supported to date

suffering from widespread corruption and criminal activity coupled w ith suspicions regarding the susceptibility to corruption of all foreign aid has led to charges that us assistance to the region is being used for corrupt purposes49 to the extent that the fsu is riddled with corrupt officials and businessmen the program may be marginally benefiting these individuals for example some believe members of the corrupt elite are benef itting from free trips to the united states provided by exchange opportunities or if th ey occupy key policy positions that their influence is increased by having say over where us technical assistance and exchanges are provided to the extent that aid is truly targeted at reformers these situations will be rare some would also add that the constructive purposes of the aid are more important than whether few members of the corrupt elite benefit peripherally from it similar response mig ht be provided those critics who charge that criminal elements have benefitted from the privatization program first by forging vouchers that allow them to accumula more than their legal share of newly privatized company stock and second by evidently thriving in an emerging free market economy50 it seems unlikely that the privatization program was specifically designed to facilitate criminal elements growing concern in the administration and congress

payoffs they also described the suspect roles of three russi an organizations responsible for handling the donated commodities and shipping them to their end destinations51 following the shift from commercial agri cultural exports to food aid shipments as result of russian default in paymen ts on usda guaranteed loans in late 1992 different laws and program terms took effect russian officials and others took advantage of the chaos and the opportunities for financial gain that the new importing arrangements offered and in turn some pr oblems the articles allege likely did occur in response to these charges secretary of agriculture espy however countered that food aid 1 served the objective of deliv ering adequate volumes of food to those who needed it requiring that usda deal with former state monopolies in russia that were the only organizations capable of doing so and 2 constituted part of the comprehensive us assistance package important to avert potentially destabilizing food shortages in the short term and to sure the survival of president yeltsins reformminded government52 the use of local currency funds generate d by the sale of us agricultural commodities donated

projects some knowledgeable americans report that the first round of grant distributions decided by the commissions tender co mmittee provi ded funds directly bene fitting members of the committee itself and for other questionable uses later the committee refused to provide assistance to selected beneficiaries unless they maintained funds in bank selected by the committee it was inferred that members of the committee were receiving benefits from the particular bank although usda has representative on the committee some believe it was more interested in getting food commodities into russia

of roughly one to tw thousand dollars offering more if these sums were well used unfortunately this is highly labor intensive administrative process not practicable on large scale54 managers of enterprise funds have indicated that efforts would be made to in sure that funds are not lent to criminally owned businesses but identifying such business may be problematic ultimately the best defense against corrupt uses of assistance as well as bad project design and ine ffective projects is the presence of aid and other implementing agency accountants and progra m managers in the recipient countries identifying who can best utilize the aid and monitoring its use are two of the main purposes of aid mission personnel howeve r the large number of other agencies now responsible for components of the assistance program may not be accustomed to implementing projects abroad in manne r that will ensure adequate accountability catching malfeasance after the fact would be facilitated by more regular auditing by agency inspector general offices as of september 1994 the aid inspector general has completed ten audits of proj ects representing roughly 1178 million in obligations criminal misuse of funds was found but audits of large projects still need to be done is us assistance being used effectively ultimately the success of us assistan ce programs will be

the region favorably others are not so sanguine it is just too early to tell for the moment without knowing ultimate outcomes many policymakers are wisely seeking to insure that the us aid program is being run in the most effective manner possible and the impact of us assistance maximized to the extent possible the us aid program has been in existence for less than three years and actual implementation on the ground is for most projects much less than two years old while it hardly seems fair to make judgments at such an early stage patterns and problems have emerged in this time that

to have become more sharpl defined the four most prominent are approaches that support targeting of re formers complementarity linkages and leveraging of resources targeting reformers is strategy perpetuated from the first executive branch statement in january 1993 it has always been us policy to favor reforming republics as the levels of aid for russi and most recent increases for ukraine demonstrate beyond this at the local level was the idea of bundling projects to create what secretary eagleburger called symbols of success under the principle of as ambassador simons put it aid follo

programs run by the different agencies in way that would complement each other creating synergy for example aid and usia are working together on joint media project with aid doing the financ ial

recipient agencies both the us contractors and fsu organizations and political bodies are relatively unknown quantities the evaluation process is an important indicator of efforts to learn and correct mistakes when the fsu program began it suffered from dearth of evaluations of eastern eu rope programs from which to learn but evaluations of ongoing fsu projects seem to be occurring earlier in their term as of september 17 formal out side project evaluations had been completed by aid representing however only 30 million in 1992 projects none of the very large programs such as the priva tization program have been evaluated yet although these are scheduled for 1995 the first round of interagency agreements neglected to include budget line for evaluations of project progress this repor tedly has been corrected further the coordinators office now requires that agencies receiving transfers have an evaluation plan budget and descripti on of the project with milestones goals program for meeting goals and regular revi ews the office also sends out its own people to conduct periodi c inhouse assessments ultimately the extent to which evaluations and audits are utilized is more important issue negative audit of the crop storage program d to termination of that program in june 1994 however severe criticisms of that project had been in circulation for more than year prior to project termination on the other hand viable response to the question of use of local currencies by the russian humanitarian commission was formulated by state department in the form of the rural commissions whether the aid coordinator office is willing to take strong action to identify correct or terminate questi onable programs or activities does remain an issue and crucial test of the usefulness of the position risk and accountability from the start the assistance program has suffered from tension between the desire for risk and accountability from the outset the bush administration explained the fsu program as an experiment they were functioning in unknown territory under pressure to act quickly and with assurance of success at the end of the day although russia is increasingly stabilized as political and economic entity reports of corruption and crime and the sudden plunge of the ruble are reminders of the unpr edictability of the situation there all the other republics remain economically and politically fragile both bush and clinton administrations have had to face the issue of how much risk they are willing to take with us taxpayer dollars in or der to achieve us foreign policy ends in the freedom support act congress allowed the executive branch an unusual amount of flexibility tempered by th need to inform and gain approval for appropriations it approve d notwithstanding clause that would allow the president to ignore other legislative restraints62 as the program was implementedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95170crs42 62 continued has allowed noncompetitive selection of some c ontractors permits the enterprise funds to adopt more private sector orientation and llows hiring of personal service contractors in washington to beef up scarce career staff capabilities 63 specifically the members of congress criticized the slow delivery of assistance and the lack of strong coordination l eadership suggested targeting specific reformist regions for assistance recommended that the russia enterp rise fund target small investments and proposed greater emphasis on exchanges 50000 vi sitors in fy1995 and assistance in tax policy reform and law enforcement accordin g to the memo americas current assistance program is simply inadequate in its strategy its intensity and its implementation members of congress and other observers encouraged the executive branch to act boldly on the other nd congress limited flexibility by earmarking funds for specific sectors pressuring the adminis tration to fund specific countries and put holds on proposed programs until they we re explained in detail and accountability concerns laid to rest these conflicting messages translated into an assistance program in which some believe the united states has been too cautious in its approach and that aid programming has not been creative enough to meet the challenges posed by the transition they assert that aid progra ms including enterprise funds supposedly designed to make risky investments may be overly encumbered by accountability requirements the notwithsta nding language is rarely applied both administrations have turned deaf ear to radical suggestions for such things as social safety nets to direct funding of russian organizati ons and been accused of being overly conservative and unimaginative as result these charges must be weighed against the need for accountability many believe the entire aid progra m would be undermined if re ports of corruption waste and bad programming became common that is why monitoring agency presence and forceful action on the part of the ai d coordinator to correct or terminate questionable programs are necessary conclusion the role of congress one of the most striking aspects of the fsu aid program has been its broad bipartisan support in congress each ear the program has been approved by wide margins and during the first two years the chief criticism ma by congressional opponents in both parties was that the dolla rs requested were better spent helping americans in 1994 however critical attention increasin gly shifted to implementation of the program itself with both pr aise and condemnation deliver ed on bipartisan basis following house delegation visit to the fsu in april house leaders gephardt and michel reportedly with the close par ticipation of then minority whip newt gingrich wrote wellpubliciz ed memo laying out their critical concerns regarding the leadership of the program and project priorities63 in may an amendment to the foreign aid appropriations bill was offered by representative callahan that would cuthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95170crs43 64 with senators thad cochran j james exon and hank brown specifically they praised the privatization agricultural exchange farm privatization opic peace corps and eurasia foundation programs recommended law enforcement programs and efforts to construct the legal framework for private sector activities and expressed caution regarding the new business development program according to the codel report although it took time the us assistance program for russia is now in full operation russian government and non government representatives with whom the delegation met were virtually unanimous in praising the contributions of the program and many requested increases in technical assistance for elements of the reform program congressional record december 1 1994 s1545015453 65 russian aid under siege by gop new york times november 25 1994 p 25 66 senate foreign relations

house rejected the amendment in 286144 vote in september bipartisan senate delegation led by the chairman of the appropriations foreign operations subcommittee senator leahy visited the region their trip report contains an ex tremely positive assessment of the assistance program and its own set of project preferences64 by the end of the year there were suggestions that the assistance issue was becoming more partisan65 surely the program will be closely scrutinized in 1995 the fsu aid program is intended to support what many in congress and elsewhere continue to believe is the most important purpose of us foreign policy assisting peaceful transition in the fs u to stable free market democracies as the program has developed over time it was always likely to attract more criticism from us interest groups consultants bus iness people and analysts weeding out the important criticisms from irrelevant or selfserving ones is of congressional concern because unfounded criticism undermines support for the program while legitimate critiques can be used to strengthen it because its interest has been strong from inception the senate foreign relations committee called the freedom support act joint executive legislative commitment many believe congress itself must take some of the responsibility for what happens to this program66 some suggest that it has been sending mixed messages regarding the dir ection the program should take congress provides unusual flexibility with its notwithst anding clause and other language yet adds program earmarks and re port language recommendations it asks that funds go only to reformers and then recommends funds for nonreform ers individual members have criticized the program in every way this report has mentioned not enough risks are taken too much waste too much paperwork for contractors too many contractors the program should be run with flexibility aid should provide more detail on programs and so forth the disparity of congressional views on implementation of the aid program is not unusual except in terms of the rela tive unanimity of views that existed inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95170crs44 67 the marshall plan often held up by analysts and others as model for foreign assistance and for the fsu program in particular might so offer an idea for congressional oversight as the plan was formulated it was subject to among the most extensive hearings and study in congressional history recognizing its im portance congress wrote into the authorizing legislation the establishment of nonlegisl ative joint committee of congress to conduct oversight studies of the marshall plan prog ram known as the watchdog committee it helped provide congress with continuing ries of informative reports on all aspects of program implementation supplementing the ongoi ng oversight activities of authorization and appropriations committees on the subject establishment of the program there are clear signs that the congressional consensus has begun to fall apart how to maintain consensus and work to strengthen the effectiveness of the program is concern to many in congress some would suggest that congress might both evaluate the criticism and improve congressional guidance of the pr ogram if it exercised more extensive oversight in 1992 as an aid policy for th region was being formulated and debated congress held dozens of hearings culminatin g in passage of veral important pieces of legislation most notably the freedom s upport act in the past two years the number of hearings on the subject have dwindl ed to handful it continues to be the most important foreign policy interest and therefore the details are legitimate concern of congress67 the fsu aid program has been evolving at rapid rate many criticisms that were legitimate year ago longer hold true for the current program nevertheless there remain issues that congress will likely wish to track carefully including the extent to which programs reach the grassroots corrupt uses of aid are avoided privatization advances with us assistance agencies and disparate programs work together programs produce visible results projects are regularly evaluated bad programs are terminated reformers are targeted and private sector funds leveraged the administration has assured congress that these steps are being taken congress may now seek to insure these promises are kept
