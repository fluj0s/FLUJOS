referendum on the export of natural gas acceding to demands of indigenous and opposition groups he also overturned 1997 decree that had given oil companies ownership of the natural gas they extracted

morales an indigenous leader and head of bolivias coca growers union and his party the leftist movement toward socialism mas won convincing victory in bolivias presidential and legislative elections morales captured the presidency with just under 54 of the vote marking the first time since bolivias return to democracy in 1982 that candidate won an absolute majority in the firs t round of presidential election the mas won majority in the lower chamber of the bolivian congress 12 of 27 seats in the senate and three of the countrys nine governorships prefectures with stronger electoral support than any of the countrys traditional political parties on january 22 2006 evo morales became bolivias first indigenous president in the countrys 180year history while some analysts forecasted morales victory few predicted that he would win by such decisive margin that margin proved that morales had broadened his support beyond rural indigenous union and lowermiddle class voters some factors that likely contributed to his victory included the perception that most bolivi ans had not benefitted from promarket economic reforms adopted by previous governments the corruption of the traditional parties and the tough nationalistic stances he had taken against foreign investors and us counternarcotics programs 9 the december 2005 elections were also significant because they included the first direct election of governors prefects in bolivia department prefects have traditionally been appointed by the executive and have not been held directly accountable to citizens demands although mas dominated the presidential and legislative elections candidates from the new centerright social and democratic power party podemos won most of the gubernatorial races ongoing conflicts have since occurred between the morales government in paz and departmental governments regarding the distribution of resources and political power in the country more than halfway through his fiveyear presidential term evo morales and the mas have already had profound effect on bolivias political system supporters maintain that despite entrenched opposition to many of his policies the

life of the country the convocation of constituent assembly to reform the bolivian constitution has been key demand of social protests since 2000 11 constituent assembly was originally planned for 2004 but disagreements with the congress on the subjects to be considered and other logistical considerations postponed it until 2006 in march 2006 president morales secured passage of legislation establishing elections for constituent assembly elections for assembly delegates were held on july 2 2006 the mas captured 507 of the popular vote and 137 of 255 seats in the assembly but lacked the twothirds majority necessary to pass constitutional reforms any constitutional reforms approved by twothirds of the delegates present were then to be voted on by bolivians in national referendum on august 6 2006 the constituent assembly was installed in sucre the colonial capital of bolivia president morales and his supporters urged the assembly to draft constitution that would redefine bolivia as multinational state made up of indigenous groups 12 and incorporate indigenous institutions within the national structure they also favored measures in support of agrarian reform and state ownership of the countrys natural resources many opposition delegates particularly those from bolivias wealthy eastern provinces maintained that the mas proposals could result in radically ethnic governing model that is not representative of the entire country 13 they argued that president morales was trying to dominate the assembly as occurred in venezuela under president hugo chávez opposition delegates in the assembly pushed for increased regional autonomy from the central government throughout the assembly process neither side appeared willing to compromise its positions in order to move negotiations forward14 for the first eight months of its deliberations the assembly was bogged down in protracted debate over voting procedures as result most of the constitutional

extend the assembly until december 14 2007 by the fall both sides positions were becoming deeply entrenched and increasingly divergent in october 2007 the mas government introduced decree which was approved by the congress that november to divert significant portion of the direct hydrocarbons tax idh revenue that had gone to the departments to pay for national pension payment for seniors this provoked heated resistance from the opposition prefects and assembly delegates at the same time opposition delegates supported sucre residents proposal to move the capital from laz paz to sucre seemingly inviolable proposal opposed by most of the mas delegation recurring protests in sucre which turned violent kept the assembly suspended for most the fall violent clashes between police and opposition protesters in sucre in november 2007 resulted in three deaths and dozens of injuries the constituent assembly passed draft constitution on december 9 2007 but many opposition delegates did not attend the final sessions during which it was approved and have denounced it as unlawful the draft constitution provides for indigenous rights communal justice land redistribution presidential reelection and increased federal government control over the countrys oil and gas resources it does not resolve the issue of what size of private land should be considered excessive and therefore vulnerable to government expropriation president morales put his plans to convoke national referendum on the draft constitution on hold until after national recall referendum was held on august 10 2008 to determine whether he and the prefects should remain in office after securing some 67 of the votes in the recall referendum president morales decided to push forward with constitutional reform in late august he issued decree scheduling referendum on the constitution passed by the constituent assembly for december 7 2008 move that prompted widespread protests from the opposition then in conciliatory response to national electoral court ruling that challenged the legality of that decree president morales sent bill to the bolivian congress seeking its approval to schedule referendums on the constitution and on the question of land ownership 15 he moved the proposed date of those referendums from december 7 2008 to january 25 2009 after weeks of protests and confrontations be tween mas and opposition supporters multiparty commission in the bolivian congress took up consideration of the draft constitution passed in december 2007 in order to assuage opposition legislators the commission made more than 100 changes to the original text of that constitution including adding provision that will limit president morales to one possible reelection on october 22 2008 the bolivian congress voted overwhelmingly in favor of two laws which taken together approved the draft constitution called for referendums on the constitution and on the land issue to be held on january 25 2009 and scheduled the next general elections for december 2009 while some observers have praised the recent congressional compromise as victory for both the morales government and for moderate legislators in the bolivian congress others have criticized the ambiguity of the agreement 16 15 the referendum on land ownership will enable voters to decide what size of private land should be considered

in recent years civic committees and citizens from the resourcerich areas around santa cruz have been pushing for increased regional au tonomy with implications for how central government resources are distributed this movement is largely supported by bolivias four wealthy eastern regions nine governors or prefects were elected on december 18 2005 however their powers have yet to be welldefined several of the prefects are pushing for autonomy over budgetary and even military powers this push for regional autonomy and devolution has caused friction between political and business leaders from the eastern regions and the morales government in paz on july 2 2006 concurrent with the constituent assembly elections bolivia held referendum on whether to grant increased powers and autonomy to the regional departmental governments according to the law convoking both the constituent assembly election and the refere ndum on regional autonomy the assembly delegates would be legally bound to grant increased powers which are still to be defined to prefects in the departments where majority of supporters approve the autonomy measure the election results revealed the deep socioeconomic and geographic divisions within bolivia the country was split as the four wealthy eastern provinces voted strongly in support of increased autonomy while the other five provinces opposed the measure notwithstanding the results of the autonomy refe rendum the morales government including the mas delegates in the constituent assembly has resisted devolving power or resources to prefects in the four departments that voted in favor of the autonomy measure president morales has asserted that gasproducing departments will not receive higher percentages of revenue at the expense of the national government in november 2006 he proposed legislation that would allow the bolivian legislature to impeach elected prefects these moves prompted six of the countrys nine prefects to break ties with the mas government in november 2006 and to launch massive protests in december 2006 conflicts between the eastern prefects and the mas government in paz continued throughout 2007 in midjanuary 2007 after the opposition pref ect from cochabamba hinted that he would seek greater regional autonomy mas sympathizers launched protests demanding his resignation those protests led to violent clashes that left 2 people dead and more than 100 injured 17 in july 2007 the four eastern prefects commemorated the anniversary of the autonomy referendum by announcing draft autonomy statutes in late november 2007 the prefects were deeply angered when the morales government was able to push its proposal to redirect the idh hydrocarbons revenues from their departmental budgets to pensions for seniors through the bolivian congress they also vehemently opposed the draft constitution passed by the assembly in early december 2007 in response to the draft constitution four prefects issued autonomy statutes on

agricultural production economic growth was driven by strong performance in the construction financial services manufacturing and hydrocarbons sectors 20 despite that growth some 63 of bolivians live

taxes on oil and gas production and reestablished state ownership of oil and gas at the wellhead in may 2005 the bolivian congress enacted its own version of hydrocarbons legislation that created nondeductible 32 direct tax on hydroc arbons idh that would apply to production and maintained the current 18 royalty rate fo reign oil companies vehemently criticized the law but most elected to

nationalization measure the bolivian governments income from gas and oil rose to an estimated 157 billion in 2007 compared to 173 million in 2002 the nationalization measure significantly raised

law by paying coca growers to eradicate their crops after this policy produced only modest results the banzerquiroga administration 19972002 implemented forced eradication program focusing on the chapare region30 although the program dramatically reduced coca cultivation in bolivia human rights abuses were committed by security forces during its implementation31 in addition the government failed to implement viable alternativ development programs to benefit coca growers and their families forced eradication caused econom ic hardship and fueled social discontent in the chapare region frequent clashes between coca growers and security forces which occasionally turned violent destabilized the region and the country as whole this ongoing conflict continued until october 3 2004 when chapare growers led by evo morales and others signed oneyear agreemen t with the mesa government which permitted limited coca production in the region and replaced forced eradication with more cooperative voluntary approach under the agreement each family is allowed to produce one cato 1600 square meters of coca but any coca grown beyond that is subject to eradication us state department figures found that drug cultivation in bolivia increased by 8 in 2005 compared to the previous year but the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc reported an 8 decrease in cultivation for the same period unodc credited that reduction largely to the success of the chapare agreement32 regardless of its merits the chapare agreement was only supposed to remain in place if european unionfunded study which just got underway in 2007 after long delay concluded that the traditional demand for coca in bolivia exceeds the current 12000 hectares allowed by law critics argue that since according to police sources some 99 of the coca grown in the chapare goes to the cocaine industry it is not going to meet traditional demand for coca and must therefore be eradicated33 evo morales and the mas have developed coca yes cocaine policy for bolivia based on the principles of the chapare agreement the policy seeks to 1 recognize the positive attributes of the coca leaf 2 industrialize coca for licit uses 3 continue rationalization of coca voluntary eradication in the chapare and extend it to other regions and 4 increase interdiction of cocaine and other illicit drugs at all stages of production president morales has sought to decriminalize coca growing and his government is trying to develop alternative uses of the coca plant for products such as coca tea venezuela is funding the restoration of two factories in the yungas region for the industrialization of coca productssuch as baking flour and toothpastefor export in june 2006 president morales announced plan to end the current division of the yungas region into legal and illegal coca growing zones to allow licensed growers to sell coca directly to consumer s and to permit each family in the yungas to grow one cato of coca in july 2006 his government then targeted some 3000 hectares in the yungas for cooperative eradication marking the first time that the bolivian government has attempted eradication in that region 34 according

government met its coca eradication targets for 2007 and seized more cocaine base marijuana and precursor chemicals than in 2006 proponents of the coca yes cocaine policy argue that it is culturally sensitive approach to coca eradication that is widely accepted in bolivia for those reasons they believe that although it may take time to show results it stands much better chance of being successful than previous forced eradication programs they assert that morales experience as coca grower has enabled him to negotiate agreements with producers in regions where prior governments were unable to limit coca cultivation35 critics of morales coca policy argue that it is based on the false premises that traditional demand for coca exceeds the current legal threshold and that there are viable markets outside bolivia for licit cocabased products they assert that both the rationalization policies and the december 2006 mas proposal to expand the areas allowed for licit cultivation may encourage further increases in illegal drug cultivation and processing in both the chapare and yungas regions 36 g14g138g151g141g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561 extreme land concentration and the lack

peasant communities nevertheless as of 2005 some 100 families reportedly owned 125 million acres of land in bolivia while 2 million survived on 25 million acres 37 in 1996 bolivia passed an agrarian reform law 1996 that allows indigenous communities to have legal title to their communal lands however these communities argue that their lands have not been legally defined or protected and that outsiders have been allowed to exploit their resources previous land reform efforts in bolivia and other countries in latin america reportedly have been incomplete because they have failed to provide land recipients the access to credit and technical assistance needed to use the land efficiently 38 in may 2006 the morales government launched its agrarian reform program giving land titles for 75 million acres to 60 indigenous communities and promising to distribute titles accompanied by access to credit and technical training for an additional 50 million acres to bolivias rural poor over the next five years according to the government about onethird of the land to be distributed is stateowned and the additional two thirds would be reclaimed from individuals or companies that own land in

story and close us ally in the fight against illegal narcotics as aggressive coca eradication programs in bolivia resulted in significant reductions in illegal coca production the bulk of us concern and counternarcotics funding shifted to neighboring colombia at that time some argued that bolivias earlier significant gains in reducing illegal coca production could be threatened by any successes in controlling production in colombia through balloon effect in which coca production shifts to other areas with less law enforcement presence those warnings appear to have some merit as according to the state department coca cultivation in bolivia increased 17 in 2003 6 in 2004 and 8 in 2005 these findings and the social discontent that has resulted from forced eradication have prompted some critics to question the efficacy of existing counternarcotics programs in bolivia and across south america 53 bush administration officials maintain that it is vital that governments in latin america continue to combat the cultivation of coca in order to help stem the flow of illicit narcotics to the united states many us officials were seriously concerned that the level of drug cooperation from bolivia would lessen following the december 2005 election of evo morales morales was coca growers union leader who had been extr emely critical of us drug policy at first some us officials expressed willingness to engage in dialogue with the morales government on how to fight drug processing and trafficking while allowing some level of coca cultivation for traditional uses this willingness has been replaced by increasing frustration on the part of the us government with bolivias counternarcotics efforts the state department found that the chapare agreement rather than contributing to reductions in coca cultivation actually undercut the government of bolivias commitment to its forced eradication policy and resulted in less eradication in 2005 us officials are wary of president morales december 2006 policy to allow more coca to be grown in order to satisfy demand for traditional coca usage and cocabased products for export the state department asserts that many suspect that traditional coca usage has declined as bolivian society has urbanized 54 in september 2007 president bush expressed concern about the expanded coca cultivation in bolivia that occurred in 2006 despite the morales governments eradication efforts55 figures from the united nations office of drugs and crime unodc showed that the area under coca cultivation in bolivia increased by 5 in 2007 as compared

on the bolivian economy bolivian officials have said that there are some 20000 jobs mainly in the textile and jewelry sectors that would likely be lost without the tpa benefits 63 while some argue
