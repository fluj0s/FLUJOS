monitoring the developments of malay programmes in terms of range and quality both on t v as well as radio throughout their term members have made several re commendations and raised concerns on selected programmes and genres while broadcasters have taken note of the feedback given and have also followed up on some of the suggestions made others raised by the commi ttee have yet to be fully addressed and these remain areas which broadcasters could improve upon the following are the key recommendations made by t he mpac proper usage of malay language 7 the committee stresses the importance of ensuring proper usage of the language especially by tv and radio presenters as they represent the image and reflect the competency of their stations hence broadcasters should remain vigilant to the overuse of poor langu age and continuously take steps to enhance the language proficiency standards of their presenters more community based programmes 8 it was observed that as there is lack of commun itybased events in programming suria could offer more of such program mes they would in turn help to promote the local arts scene suggestions i nclude having programmes showcasing events conducted by malay org anisations and university students as well as arts shows held at t he esplanade better promotion of current affairs programmes 9 the committee recognised that while current affai rs programmes would not be able to garner the same level of viewe r interest as entertainment or information programmes they are n evertheless an important means in which important messages are veyed to the community suria therefore has social responsibil ity to ensure that current affairs programmes are made as appealing and access ible as possible in order to attract more and retain existing viewers the mpac suggests that suria raise the profile branding and status of the programmes by re marketing and relaunching them on suria the promo tion of current affairs programmes should be given equal priority as that f drama and variety programmes for elderly 10 while the committee recognises the broadcasters effort in reaching out to younger audiences by offering concepts that are more appealing to them suria should not neglect the needs of older g eneration the committee suggests that the channel consider programmes showc asing traditional music such as keroncong and asli sect ion 2 sum ma ry of key recommend at io ns x1x2x3x4x5x2x6x7x8x5x9x10x11x4x12x13x10x2x4x14x6x8x15x8x10x9x2x8x11x9x3x8x5x4x3x5x16x6x14x2x4x9x10x8 x12x17x18x19x20x8 the malay programme advisory committee report 2006 2008 4 more local content on sensasi 11 the committee notes that acquired programmes is predominant on the cable tv channel including some that may depic t lifestyles and values which are different from that of the local malay vi ewers the committee hopes that sensasi will increase its local content programming over time and place less emphasis on acquired programmes more programmes on parenting on ria 12 while there is fair mix of infoeducational an d entertainment programmes on warna there is lack of infoeducat ional content and childrens programmes on ria considering that such programmes might affect rias overall branding as youthoriented r adio station members suggest that ria also consider programmes which tar get young parents instead such programmes could explore topics such as parenting which would be of interest to this group of listeners

acknowledges that there is difficulty in getting guest experts and panelists with strong command of the malay language broadcasters should remain vigilant to the overuse of poor language general issues i language 13 the usage of proper malay language in programmes on the malay tv channels and radio stations has been concern of p revious committees and continues to be so during this term the committee stresses the importance of ensuring proper usage of the language especially by tv and radio presenters as they are in the frontline while the committee acknowledges that there is difficulty in getting guest experts and panelists with strong command of the malay language broadcasters should remain vigilant to the overuse of poor language in the programmes broadcasters are urged to continuously take steps t enhance the language proficiency standards of the presenters especially on their articulation and syntax as ultimately they represent the image and reflect the competency of the broadcasters 14 at the same time the committee is pleased with an initiative by suria and kgms singapore malay teachers union in offer ing potret bahasa language snippets series of interstitials on the correct usage of the malay language which appeared before the news bulletins potret bahasa was well received by the parents students and schools it i s noted that some schools have incorporated this programme as part of their l earning tool to make it even more appealing to younger viewers it is hoped that the producers consider experimenting with other creative methods besides the textbased presentation used the committee also commends the programme tahu nahu know your grammar for its efforts in promoting proper usage of the language this programme which made its debut in december 2007 is thematic project by mda and suria with the help of kgms and is good example of the broadcaster working with relevant organisations for common good 15 programme that has made conscious effort to use good malay is the weekly talkshow on suria called cakap sini habis sini literal translation talk here ends sect ion 3 rang and q ua lit f bro adc ast p ro g ram mes and mp ac s reco mmend at io ns x1x2x3x4x5x2x6x7x8x5x9x10x11x4x12x13x10x2x4x14x6x8x15x8x10x9x2x8x11x9x3x8x5x4x3x5x16x6x14x2x4x9x10x8 x12x17x18x19x20x8 the malay programme advisory committee report 2006 2008 6 here which proves that lively and entertaining approac h does not necessarily inhibit the proper usage of the languag issues such as the increasing trend of men and women refusing to marry and the extreme measures people would take to enhance their image nd marketability were among the topics discussed 16 while the committee acknowledges that the inclu sion of malay and english in some programmes reflects current situati ons and realism there should be fine balance in doing so and that the u of english or any other language should be justified in context and kept t the minimum since suria is essentially malay channel catering to this par ticular community mpac members were concerned with the impact of an overus of mixed languages and have observed similar traits on this in acquire d programmes such as gol gincu goal lipstick and on some local programmes 17 while the mpac supports the provision of english subtitles in local malay programmes to cater to nonmalay speaking viewers members note the poor quality of subtitling in some programmes which can range from bad grammar to even inaccurate translation this can ve negative effect on the credibility of the channel members urge that q uality checks be conducted on the subtitles before programmes go on air ii advertisements and promotional trailers 18 the mpac also advises that broadcasters should xercise greater discretion on the types of commercials that are air ed on malay channels like suria advertising messages should not be misleadin g and must be mindful of public sensitivities serious societal concerns sho uld not be exploited for example an advertisement by property agency whic h capitalised on marital problems the appropriateness of hair pro duct advertisement where man continuously pulls thread from ladys dre ss close to her chest in response to her seduction was also questionable 19 the committee supports the broadcasters effort to reach out to more viewers through crosspromotion however this shoul d not be at the expense of standards of decency expected by the malay viewe rs and listeners the explicit nature of the trailers for the series desperate housewives trailer and the timing of trailers for the reality show the dance floor trailer during the earlier hours of the evening are two examples where broadcasters should exercise greater caution iii repeats 20 while the mpac acknowledges that some programmes are worth repeating eg juang anak watan and tabah the high number of repeat programmes in surias programming lineup especiall during the weekend is concern the committee feels that the situation n eeds to be improved and is of the view that suria should not start from the premise that there are fewer people watching tv on weekends as compared to weekd ay nights x1x2x3x4x5x2x6x7x8x5x9x10x11x4x12x13x10x2x4x14x6x8x15x8x10x9x2x8x11x9x3x8x5x4x3x5x16x6x14x2x4x9x10x8 x12x17x18x19x20x8 the malay programme advisory committee report 2006 2008 7 b childrens programmes 21 in its review of programmes for the young the m pac notes that it is important for suria to continue providing quality ducational programmes even if the ratings for this genre are not as good as other genres the committee acknowledges surias dilemma in the sched uling of childrens programmes during prime time slots but this should not deter it from promoting good quality ones relevant to local conte xt such as tahu nahu and cili padi 22 the committee does commend suria for its success in attracting popular following for some of their locally produced childrens programmes like krayon crayon which emulated the concept of the popular australian preschool programme hifive the committee is pleased that krayon is now in its fifth season and welcomes its collaboration with radio television malaysia rtm 1 c dramas i local 23 mpac members were generally pleased with the qua lity of local dramas like tetangga 2 neighbours 2 and rahsia perkahwinan 2 secrets of marriage 2 as these programmes effectively delivered their int ended community and social messaging in an entertaining nd engaging way surias multiracial drama tetangga 2 reflected the harmonious coexistence among singapores different communities and rahsia perkahwinan portrayed marital issues faced by different families and how each family dealt with them another commendable drama which promotes various he alth messages to the community in lighthearted manner is erlin montel which highlights the importance of eating right ways to stay smokefree and how regular physical activity can help one keep fit and prevent illheal th 24 it is observed that the community is now more ac cepting of the portrayal of certain negative behaviour on televisi on provided that these are not gratuitous and the intended messages are delivered clearly following the success of hanyut adrift the docudrama seksa torture was designed to encourage youths to learn how to make their own decisions and to consider the consequences of their decisions although some may feel that the visuals used in seksa can be somewhat graphic these would be acceptable if they are relevant to the storyline and message the committee 1 krayon is another one of surias coproduction with rtm f ollowing the variety shows muzika ekstravaganza and sinar lebaran with two malaysian artistes hosting the show alon gside two singaporean artistes the series was also shown on rtm1 x1x2x3x4x5x2x6x7x8x5x9x10x11x4x12x13x10x2x4x14x6x8x15x8x10x9x2x8x11x9x3x8x5x4x3x5x16x6x14x2x4x9x10x8 x12x17x18x19x20x8 the malay programme advisory committee report 2006 2008 8 the committee notes the lack of communitybased events in programming and suggests that suria offer m r f s u c h p rog ra mme encourages the need for followup to the programm to maximise the lasting and meaningful impact on both the young and old generally the mpac feels that seksa is good step in helping youngsters and parents discuss relationship and growingup issues 25 another commendable drama is mandai united set in the late 70s it has good storyline and provides an interesting in sight on life in singapore back then through the interweaving of football matc hes with historical information this could be emulated for future prog rammes while the treatment of the drama is impressive the committee notes with some concern tendency to show overly graphic beating scenes 26 on the whole mpac observed that while there wer some good dramas there are others which were not up to stand ard for example satu jam one hour which showcased different scenarios and what took p lace within one realtime hour was found to be too labor ious and lacked credibility ii acquired 27 it is observed that there has been an increase i n acquired drama series especially indonesian dramas the better ones from indonesia and malaysia include hantu jatuh cinta ghost falling in love hikmah wisdom puteri princess impian ilyana ilyanas dream and gol gincu goal lipstick while the community should be exposed to diverse cultures and values the broadcaster should be discerning in its selection bearing in mind that foreign programmes may carry differing lifestyles and values to the local malay viewers d variety cultural programmes 28 the members commended the idea and concept of gemilang glorious but felt that the mix of items could be streamline d more information could also have been incorporated for instance on the proper use and history of the kebaya malay traditional clothing 29 the committee notes the lack of communitybased events in programming and suggests that suria offer more of such programmes including those by malay organisations varsity students as well as arts shows held at the esplanade this is one way suria can help to promote the local arts scene to the public the committee welcomes coproductions such as rapsodi remix rhapsody remix x1x2x3x4x5x2x6x7x8x5x9x10x11x4x12x13x10x2x4x14x6x8x15x8x10x9x2x8x11x9x3x8x5x4x3x5x16x6x14x2x4x9x10x8 x12x17x18x19x20x8 the malay programme advisory committee report 2006 2008 9 suria should not neglect the needs of older generation by h v i n g p r g r m m s showcasing traditional music such as keroncong and asli which involved broadcasters and artistes from singa pore and brunei and muzika ekstravaganza musical extravaganza which featured talents from singapore and malaysia programmes such as mega perdana mega premier are encouraged the committee would also like suria to consider telecasting the yearly cultural event gentarasa which is showcase of the years best performances from among the various cultural groups of the peoples association 30 the mpac applauds the efforts of the variety show kpak bing bing local programme supported by the ministry for community development youth and sports mcys which focuses on strengthening marriages its refreshing and lighthearted approach and treatment of heavy topics on among others finance and communication was impactful 31 another variety show which the mpac members foun d entertaining was knite game show where karaoke enthusiasts prove that they are well versed in music and songs ranging from oldies folk foreign language and the latest pop its interesting concept tapped on the l ocals favourite pastime activity karaoke which appeals to both the young and older viewers 32 while suria attempts to produce more edgy concep ts for their variety programmes on its channel broadcasters are reminde d to be attuned to public sensitivities and to ensure that viewers are given the proper indication on the nature of programme to expect the mtvstyle d pesta pesta pesta is case in point while some viewers welcomed the casu and informal format others who expect award shows to be prestigious vent thought it was an inappropriate way of recognising talents this coul d have been avoided if viewers were given headsup of what to expect w hile the slapstick format was acceptable so long as it did not go overboard the use of crude language for example nak mampus should be avoided the members also found that love song item where children were fea tured as accompanying dancers to be inappropriate some viewers mainly f rom the older generation were uncomfortable with children emulating sexy s tances or poses broadcasters should thus exercise more discretion n how children are portrayed in entertainment programmes especially d uring family viewing hours when all ages are tuned in 33 variety programmes catering to the younger gener ation seem to be the current trend on suria and this can be seen from the expansion of talent shows such as anugerah anugerah skrin and anugerah band while the committee recognises the broadcasters efforts in reaching out to the young audience by providing concepts that are more appealing to them suria should x1x2x3x4x5x2x6x7x8x5x9x10x11x4x12x13x10x2x4x14x6x8x15x8x10x9x2x8x11x9x3x8x5x4x3x5x16x6x14x2x4x9x10x8 x12x17x18x19x20x8 the malay programme advisory committee report 2006 2008 10 not neglect the needs of the older generation by ving programmes showcasing traditional music such as keroncong and asli news current affairs and infoeducational progr ammes i news 34 while the delivery of accurate and timely inform ation to the local malays is given members felt that berita should also have more coverage of communitybased news which will help it to stay relevant in this ge where the audience has much larger variety of media and tv channels to obtain news from ii current affairs 35 the mpac recognises that current affairs program mes are generally not as popular as infoentertainment ones neverthe less the committee feels that suria has social responsibility to ensure that its current affairs programmes and important messages are reached out to the community with the emergence of advanced media technology there is need for suria to address the increasing competition from the different media one way is for suria to relook their format and presentation as change may be necessary to attract more and retain existing viewers for current affairs programmes the committee suggests that suria raises the profil branding and status of these programmes by remarketing and relaunching t hem on the channel the promotion of current affairs programmes should be given equal priority as that of drama and variety programmes 36 in discussion with editors and producers from mediacorp news on improving the standards of malay current affairs pr ogrammes especially the established ones the committee encouraged suria to consider formats with more public participation without trivialising the issues concerned 37 at the same time the committee appreciates sur ias efforts to provide more fresh choices of current affairs progr ammes for viewers in this regard it is pleased with the telecast of mediacor p news documentary titled juang anak watan struggles of young malays on suria which was in tune with what is relevant in the world today that is globalisation the series portrayed the success of local malay talents overse as and an image of the promotion of current affairs programmes should be given equal priority as that of drama and variety programmes x1x2x3x4x5x2x6x7x8x5x9x10x11x4x12x13x10x2x4x14x6x8x15x8x10x9x2x8x11x9x3x8x5x4x3x5x16x6x14x2x4x9x10x8 x12x17x18x19x20x8 the malay programme advisory committee report 2006 2008 11 the committee hopes that sensasi will increase its local content over time and place less m p h s i s n c q u i r d programmes on the channel globalisation among the community by featuring ordi nary people as new examples of role models in the community the progr amme also highlighted those from the less traditional industries of aeron autical engineering medical research and fashion iii infoeducational 38 in the past there were programmes such as bahas 4pm 4pm debate which were very educational and beneficial to the ouths the mpac hence encourages more of such programmes to be offered nother such programme is pantas pintas quick glance quiz show cum infoed programme targeted at teenagers and tests the conte stants on areas like mathematics science general knowledge current af fairs and traditions the committee urges that suria should continue to foste r more creative formats for the youth 39 while in their quest to showcase the various local cultures and religious practices in support of promoting racial and religious harmony all broadcasters should remain alert to the possibilities of offending public sensitivities in one episode of raikan bersama danielle which imparts very useful knowledge about the rituals and rites of various cultures and religions song with praises of deity by some malay teenagers was inappropriate especially given its telecast du ring the muslim fasting month 40 besides infoeducational programmes such as bongkar uncover dinamika dynamism smlsihat smlhealthy tabah resolute and perihal generasi about generation which stood out in terms of quality the standards of other infoeducational programmes on t he malay freetoair channel have generally improved over the years mor of such content and quality should follow f sensasi channel 41 to provide the community with wider choices of m alay language programmes the first locallypackaged malay subscr iption channel sensasi was launched in august 2007 by starhub cable vision given that the channel is in its first year of service the mpac notes that the first locallypackaged malay cable channel is continuously improving its programming mix and standards 42 the committee notes that foreign content is predominant on the channel x1x2x3x4x5x2x6x7x8x5x9x10x11x4x12x13x10x2x4x14x6x8x15x8x10x9x2x8x11x9x3x8x5x4x3x5x16x6x14x2x4x9x10x8 x12x17x18x19x20x8 the malay programme advisory committee report 2006 2008 12 including some that may portray lifestyles and valu which are different from that of local malay viewers the committee hopes th at sensasi will increase its local content over time and place less emphasis on acquired programmes on the channel sensasi also exudes an outdated feel i n its overall presentation which may not appeal to youths but they have made fforts to improve members also recognise the broadcasters approach f identifying flagship programmes such as manjalara and cinta fitri fitris love for their marketing strategy 43 mpac members felt that while sensasi has positio ned itself as targeting adult viewers aged 15 and above the broadcaster sh ould also ensure that proper advisories are included in programmes with u nsuitable themes like horror and romance notwithstanding the fact that i t is the parents responsibility to ensure that their children are t exposed to such programmes it is also advised to be mindful of sce nes in foreigndubbed content that could be sensitive to malay viewers specially those containing religious scenes or practices g radio programmes 44 warna and ria the mainstream malay radio statio ns have maintained their standing in the community and continue to rea ch out to more listeners both young and old with that in mind the mpac wou ld like the malay radio stations to be ambassadors of malay language and to ensure proper usage of the malay language by their presenters some members expressed concern that more english words seem to be creeping into th programmes and are often used by presenters while members recognise that the malay language like all other languages is constantly evolving they would like to encourage presenters to use the equivalent malay words whenever possible nevertheless members also acknowledge that ria djs might need to include some english lingo in their presentation to reach out to the younger listeners special mention was made of the dj adi rahman for his excellent use and command of the malay language 45 the committee commented that some of warnas pro grammes such as pentas radio have visual potential and the station could consid er having them staged as live events as well as leveraging on new media platforms to showcase their good programmes members also sugges ted that warna consider having lighthearted issues other than onl serious social issues as the radio dramas main plot 46 the members also applauded the stations for thei r effort to make anugerah planet muzik apm regional brand name and that it was able t successfully reach out to regional audience it is also heartening to know that the event which was telecast live via astro an d global tv received high viewership and was listed as one of the top program mes on those channels

arnas djs promoting websites with inappropriate names althou gh this was onceoff incident the committee advises malay radio djs to exercise more caution with the phrases they use onair as listeners migh t find the highlighting of such websites inappropriate even if they did not exist 48 one show which the committee would like to sing out for mention is the show which is aired on weekdays on ria while the use f prank calls is common in many stations members would like to r emind the stations that their presenters still need to exercise discretion and sensitivity should they decide to make such calls members cite the exampl of birthday segment in the programme where the dj called up male list ener and impersonated as the other woman knowing that his girlfriend wa s beside him while he attended to the call which they found was not done in good taste on another occasion the personal accounts of adultery by listener to the dj led to the creating of an inappropriate platform fo r listeners to reveal their own accounts as if they were trying to outdo each other the reading out on air of inappropriate short messaging sms on this daytime programme also seems to ignore the fact that children and young li steners could also be tuned in topics with adult themes would be more itable late at night 49 djs should also ensure that onair comments are made with caution and are balanced negative behaviour or standards f behavioural values should not be accentuated unless supported with edu cational values in addition these comments should not come across as advice but personal opinions djs are encouraged to recommend that list eners seek guidance from suitably qualified persons should they be faci ng difficulties alternatively the dj could provide listeners with contact details of various selfhelp groups for further consultation 50 while there is fair mix of infoeducational and entertainment programmes on warna ria is lacking in infoeducational content and childrens programmes considering that such programmes might affect rias overall branding as youthtarget radio station mpac members suggest that ria consider having programmes on parenting which target young parents nevertheless members pplauded rias programme dj pelajar where students with an interest in radio presenting are given the opportunity to experience being radio d j for the day 51 it is observed that some presenters eagerly and enthusiastically promote certain health food products for the young during these segments callers are encouraged to share their experiences n using the

the public it also questions the validity of such testimonies 52 another area of concern relates to presenters wh promote their own businesses for example those in the travel industry or the media entertainment while the committee recognises that the radio station would have taken the necessary precautions when promoting such businesses to avoid conflict of interest they nonetheless expres sed concern over whether listeners are able to decipher whether or not the d j on the show has vested interest in the product being promoted onair

demand for more entertainment programme s these recommendations aim to encourage the provision of wider and more balance range of programming which is vital to the malay communitys development and progress 54 while there is immense competition from various forms of media the mpac reminds that there is need for local broadca sters catering to the malay audiences to embrace their social

support and fe edback that mpac has provided we see the launch of sensasi as maj or development in the malay language broadcasting market in singapore in regard to the comment mpac has made on the feel of the channel we fully acknowledged that some viewers might have already seen some of sensasis earlier serials either via dvdvcd or vi fortuitous reception of malaysian freetoair channels however we believ that it is important to show the serials from their first episodes in orde r to give all of their customers the full story and plotlines of these serials if they had only watched the serials from the latest episodes there would have been s ignificant number of viewers who would not have been able to follow the plotlines however as mpac has noted this issue is declining over time

the malay programme advisory committee report 2006 2008 18 the issue of local production is an important one t sensasi given the need to create distinctive identity for the chann and to show themes that will appeal to local viewers as mpac will be aware we have already commissioned some locallyproduced programmes unfo rtunately the cost of locallyproduced programming is prohibitively expen sive for sensasi to fund by itself and we are not the recipient of public s ervice broadcasting funding nevertheless starhub will constantly look out on an ad hoc basis for new and differentiated local content that will appeal t the local viewers however we will also continue to work with mda to see if some level of co funding is possible for this locallyproduced malay language content mpac has also raised the issue of advisory notices for particular types of programming we would like to highlight that th content on sensasi has been structured into particular themes such as r omance action etc to help our viewers decide whether they should let the ir children watch sensasi on particular evening nevertheless we will cont inue to watch this area closely mediacorp radio warna and ria have always
