applicants ie state or local agencies to provide certain information for their grant requests to be considered eligible for potential approval it does not address the nepa process as it applies to disasterrelated projects that would likely involve collection of the necessary environmental review documentation by the federal agency responsible for the project eg water resources projects undertaken by the army corps of engineers two agencies that provide signiÔ¨Åcant proportion of applicantrequested funding for disasterrelated projects are the department of homeland securitys federal emergency management agency fema and the department of housing and urban development hud particularly under its community development block grant cdbg program therefore this report primarily discusses the nepa process as it applies to recovery and rebuilding projects funded under those agency programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34650 order code rl34650 implementing the national environmental policy

communities may need to rebuild replace or possibly even relocate multitude of structures when recovery activities take place on such potentially large scale compliance with any of number of local state and federal laws or regulations may apply for ex ample when older buildings must be repaired or demolis hed provisions of the nationa l historic preservation act nhpa may need to be considered if rebuilding will take pl ace in floodplain provisions of executive order 11988 on floodplain management may apply when federal agencies make decisions such as funding applicantproposed actions the national environmental po licy act of 1969 nepa 42 usc 4321 et seq applies for example when federal funding is provided for disasterrelated activities applicants for those funds may be required to asse ss the environmental impacts of their proposed action as commonly implemented nepas environmental review re quirements are used as vehicle to identify any other environmental requireme nts that may apply to project as well this use of nepa as an umbrella stat ute can lead to confusion for ex ample before an applicant can commit or expend funds under the department of housing and urban developments huds community development block gr ant cdbg program the applicant must complete an environmental review of the project required element of that review is the applicants certification that compliance criteria applicable to historic preservation floodplain manage ment endangered species air quality and farmland protection have been considered this re view is required not only to meet nepa obligations but also to ensure that the project being funded does not violate applicable environmental law from the applicants perspective this may blur the distinction between what is required under nepa and what is required under separate compliance requirements identified within the context of the nepa process for many federal actions undertaken in response to emergencies or major disasters nepas environmental review requirements are exempted under provisions of the robert t stafford disaster relie f and emergency assistance act the stafford act the stafford act does not how ever exempt such projects from other applicable environmental re quirements in the past some members of congress have been interested in the nepa proce ss as it applies to di sasterrelated projects this interest has been driven in part by federal grant applicants who have been confused about both their role in the ne pa process and what the law requires to address issues associated with

programs to assist individuals and communities in responding to recovering from and preparing for disasters for example after disaster some level of fe deral assistance may be available to rebuild damaged bridges or roads demolish nd dispose of damaged buildings rebuild schools or hospitals or rebu ild damaged levees such pr ojects often have at least some impact on the environment and hence ma be required to comply with any of number of local tribal state or federal environmenta l laws including requirements of the nationa l environmental policy ac t of 1969 nepa 42 usc 4321 et seq among other provisions nepa requires fe deral agencies to assess the potential environmental impacts of proposed acti on before proceeding exempted from nepas requirements are emergency respons actions under provisions of the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergenc assistance act the stafford act 42 usc 51215206 these exempted activitie s include providing essential relief to victims and implementin g protective measures necessary to reduce immediate threats to life property and public health and safety nepas environmental review requirements may however be applicable to longterm recovery projects such as the modification mitigation or expansion of existing structures or the relocation of certain structures cated in floodplain most agencies have implemented nepa as an umbrella statute as such it forms framework for the coordination or demonstration of compliance with any study review or consultati on required by any other envi ronmental law the use of nepa in this capacity has d to some confusion the need to comply with separate environmental law such as the clean water act cwa endangered species act or national hi storic preservation act nhpa may be identified within the framework of the nepa process but nepa itself is not the source of the obligation if theoretically the requirement to comply with nepa were removed compliance with each applicable w would still be required in the past there has been congressional interest in the nepa implementation process for disasterrela ted projects this interest has b een driven in part by federal grant applicants who have been confused about both their role in the nepa process and what the law requires httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34650crs2 1 for more information about the various grant programs available to assist local

web page at httpwwwhudgovoffices cpdcommunitydevelopmentprogramsdrsiindexcfm 2 40 cfr 15001508to address these issues this report discusses the nepa process as it applies to projects for which federal funding to rec over from or prepare for disaster may be requested by local tribal or state grant applicants specifically the report provides an overview of the nepa process as it app lies to such projects identifies the types of projects categorized by the federal fundi ng source likely to require environmental review and delineates both the types of projects for which or minimal environmental review is requi red those for which statutor or categorical exclusions apply and those that likely re quire more indepth review this report focuses on the nepa process as it applies to projects that require grant applicants ie state or local agencies to provide certain information for their grant requests to be considered eligible fo r potential approval it does not address the nepa process as it applies to disaste rrelated projects that would likely involve collection of the necessary environmenta l review documentation by the federal agency responsible for the project eg water resources projects undertaken by the army corps of engineers two agencies that provide significant proportion of applicantrequested funding for disasterrelated proj ects are the department of homeland securitys federal emergency management agency fema and the department of housing nd urban development hud particularly under its community development block grant cdbg program1 therefore this report primarily discusses the nepa process as it applies to recovery and rebuilding projects funded under those agency programs overview of the nepa process nepa is procedural statute with twin aims that require agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their propos ed actions and inform the public that environmental concerns have been accounted for in the decisionmaking process the nepa process involves the steps an agency must take to demons trate that it has met these aims environmental review nepa requires all federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of proposed federal actions befo re proceeding regulations that specify how agencies must implement nepas requirements were promulgated by the council on environmental quality ceq2 ceq regulations direct fede ral agencies to adopt and enforce their own regulations and proce dures implementing nepas environmental review requirements in manner specific to typical classes of actions undertaken by each agency two agencies that provide significant proportion of funding for disasterrelated projects are fema and hud their nepa regulations can be foundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34650crs3 3 additional environmental review requirements potentially applicable to cdbg projects are specified under 24 cfr 51environmen tal criteria and standards and 24 cfr 55 floodplain managementat 44 cfr 10 fema and 24 cfr 58 hud3 nepa regulations specify environmental review requirements that must be met to demonstrate that potential environmental impacts have in fact been considered generally the term envir onmental review refers to requirement to show evidence of formal consideration evaluati on or analysis of the impacts of proposed federal action most often the use of the term is in reference to the process of complying with nepa requirements however depending upon the project under consideration an environmenta l review may refer to the process of identifying any environmental compliance requirements or exemptions as applicable to certain project as it has been interpreted nepa is procedural statute that does not require agencies to elevate environmental concerns above others instead nepa requires only that an agency assess the potential environmental consequences of an action and its alternatives before proceeding if adverse environmental effects of proposed action are adequately identified and eval uated the agency is not constrained by nepa from deciding whether other benef its outweigh the environmental costs and moving forward with the action for more information about nepas requirements see crs report rl33152 the national environmental policy act background and implementation by linda luther nepa as an umbrella statute any given disasterrelated project may require complia nce with wide variety of legal requirements enforceable by one or more agencies for example the environmental impacts of given project may trigger compliance with elements of the clean air act endangered species act of 1973 national hi storic preservation act or clean water act most individual agency nepa procedur suggest that for given project compliance with all applicable environmental laws executive orders and other legal requirements should be docum ented within the appropr iate nepa documentation this concept is referred to as the nepa umbrella as such as previously noted nepa forms framework for the coordi nation and demonstra tion of compliance with any study review or consultation re quired by other environmental laws for example the need to comply with another environmental law such as the clean water act may be identified within the framework of the nepa process but nepa itself is not the source of the obligation if theoretically the requirement to comply with nepa were removed compliance w ith each applicable law would still be requiredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34650crs4 4 available on femas environmental historic preservation review site at

ag bright iii cmb president standard mortgage corpor ation member of the residential board of governors of the mortgage bankers asso ciation september 25 2007 available online at httpbankingsenategovpublicindexcfmfuseactionhearingshomean example of the use of nepa as an umbrella statute can be seen in femas environmental review process because of the types of projects the agency is likely to fund and the high probability that hist oric properties may be affected in many projects femas nepa process is referre d to as an environmental and historic preservation ehp review in its description of the ehp process fema states federal environmental and historic preservation laws and executive orders provide the basis and direction for the implementation of federal environmental and historic preservation review requi rements for femafunded projects these laws and executive orders are aimed at pr otecting our nations water air coastal wildlife land agricultural historical and cultural resources as well as minimizing potential adverse effects to children lowincome and minority populations failure to comply with these laws could result in project delays and denial of funding fema through the environmental and historic preservation program engages in review process to ensure that fema funded activities comply with these laws4 another example of the use of nepa as an umbrella statute can be seen in the hud office of community planning nd development environmental review requirements applicable to cdbgs before cdbg applicant can commit or expend funds for given project an environmental review of the project must be conducted the environmental review record must among other requirements document compliance with applicable statutes and authorities to meet this requirement hud regulations require the grantee to certify that it has considered compliance criteria applicable to historic preservation fl oodplain management nd wetland protection coastal zone management so lesource aquifers endangered species wild and scenic rivers air quality farmla nd protection hud environmental standards and environmental justice5 that does not mean that all of these compliance factors will apply to given project the environmenta l review process is intended simply to identify the compliance requirements that do apply and ensure that the applicant will be compliant as appropriate after hurricane katrina some stakeholders cited nepa as significant challenge to state efforts to disperse cdbg funds6 the requirement to evaluate the various compliance criteria listed above was cited specifically as the problem however as stated previously nepa is not the source of these compliance requirements the nepa process simply forms the framework within which compliance with any applicable environmental law is identified still this situation illustrates the difficultly some stakeholders have in distinguishing between what is required under nepa and what may be required under othe r relevant environmental laws it illustrates the challeng that applicants face when trying to comply with the range of requirements applicable to projects for which funding is soughthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34650crs5 7 40 cfr 150818a further the term federal agency is defined as all agencies of the federal government but does not mean the cong ress the judiciary or the president 40 cfr 150812also the comprehensive reviews documentation and analysis sometimes required by agencies such as the army corps of engineers the us fish and wildlife service the coast guard and the environmental protection agency epa as well as various state regulatory and revi ew agencies such as the office of state historic preservation officer may add to the perception that project delays are related to the nepa process what may be perceived by the applicant as nepa related delay may actually stem from an agencys need to complete permit process or analyses required under parate statutory authority eg the clean water act or endangered species act over which the agency preparing the nepa documentation has authority nepa issues relevant to disasterrelated projects when community is devastated by disaster it may be overwhelmed by the number of projects that need to be undertake n generally when local tribal or state agency participates in the nepa process it involves project that has been planned or at least to some degree anticipated in the wake of disaster however when entire neighborhoods towns or regions may be substantially da maged and in need of repair or reconstruction agencies can quickly become overburdened by the task of navigating applicable compliance re quirements coupled with the potential difficulty of determining the various fede ral funding sources available to recover from or mitigate damages local agencies responding to disaster may become confused about their environmental complia nce obligations if those obligations are not met funding will be slowed from the federal agency perspective the commitment to assist in rebuilding structures and facilities and restoring land must be done in way that will result in greater protection from future disasters that is federal agencies do not want to spend money that may have to be spen t again when another disaster strikes elements of the nepa process such as the requirement to monstrate floodplain management considerati ons help federal agencies meet this goal to understand what is required of app licants it is helpful to understand the types of disasterrela ted projects associated with va rious funding sources and the levels of environmental review that may be required for proposed projects disasterrelated pr ojects potentially subject to nepa nepas environmental review require ments apply to any project potentially subject to federal control or responsib ility such actions include projects and programs entirely or par tly funded assiste d conducted regulate d or approved by federal agencies7 with regard to disaster recovery rebuilding or mitigation projects nepa applies if fede ral funds are used for project or if federal agency permittinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34650crs6 8 if project is undertaken purely by using city or state funds and it requires federal authorization or permit nepas environmenta l review requirements do not apply however depending on the nature of the project comp liance with other environmental laws may be required also some cities and states have their own nepalike requirementsor other approvals are required8 table 1 summarizes severa l potential funding sources for disasterrelated projects the types of proj ects potentially qualified for those funds and the agencies au thorized to provide

on program overview and issues by francis x mccarthy agency and applicant roles generally there are three entities that play significant role in the nepa process for disasterrela ted projects the lead agency which is res ponsible for preparing the nepa documentation9 cooperating agencies which may be any local tribal state or federal agencies that have jurisdiction by law or special expertise regarding any environmental impact involved in proposal10 and the project applicant which may also be referred to as responsible entity or grantee under different agency requirements such as local tribal or state entities requesting federal funds for disasterrelated projects the lead agency coordinates environmental reviews for projects funded under that agencys prog rams for example fema would be the lead agency for debris removal operations involving public assistance pa grant funds in disasterstricken area it is po ssible that multiple funding sources may be available for single project if more than one federal agency proposes or is involved in the same action the agencies must dete rmine which agency will serve as the lead and which will serve as cooperating agen cies if there is disagreement among agencies involved factors including the ma gnitude of each agencys involvement and project approvaldisapproval au thority determine the designation of the lead agency cooperating agency is one that has ju risdiction by law or special expertise regarding any environmental impact involved in proposal11 it may be local tribal state or federal agencies from which the lead agency will need technical assistance for example depending on the impacts associ ated with given project the following agencies may serve as cooperating ag encies to develop appropriate nepa documentation the environmental protection agen cy to address air quality water quality and hazar dous waste standards advisory council on historic pres ervation andor state or tribal historic preservation officer to ensure that provisions of the national historic preser vation act are addressed the army corps of engineers to ensure that any us water or wetland impacts are identified avoided or minimized and mitigation resolved among other potential requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34650crs8 the us fish and wildlife service to evaluate projects to ensure that threatened and endangered species are identified any impacts avoided or minimized and mitigation resolved the us department of agriculture to ensure that impacts tofarmlands are considered although the lead agency such as fema or hud may be ultimately responsible for ensuring that nepa documen tation is complete the project applicant plays significant role in the nepa proce ss associated with di sasterrelated projects the project applicant such as state or local agency will likely be required to develop substantive portions of the envir onmental document while the lead agency is responsible for its scope and overall content for exampl project applicants are required to provide information to s upport femas environmental and historic preservation compliance process funds w ill not be awarded nd the applicant may not initiate the project until fema has completed its environmental review therefore it is in the applicants interest to gather and present all information necessary to assist the funding agency with meeting its environmental review requirements categories of action determining whether nepa applies is generally not complicated process determining what level of review is required for project ie whether its environmental impacts are significant may not be as clear and must be determined on casebycase basis when determining nepas applicability disasterrelated projects will fall into one of the following categories statutory exemptions appli cable to certain femafunded projects authorized under the stafford act categorical exclusions applicab to actions that normally do not individually or cumulatively have significant effect on the human environment and that the agency has determined from past experience have significant impact environmental impact statements eiss when the action willpotentially have significant environmental impact environmental assessments eas when the significance ofenvironmental impacts is uncertain and must be determined the requirement to produce an eis is probably the most familiar element of nepa compliance however actions requiri ng an eis account for small percentage of all federal actions proposed in gi ven year and generally none of those

considered when determining how an environm ental review may be carried out these alternative arrangements and the various categories of action potentially subject to nepa are discussed below statutory exemptions in responding to emerge ncies and major disasters existing provisions of the stafford act statutorily exempt certain femafunded activities from nepa statutory exclusions generally apply to actions that are emergency in nature or are necessary for the preservation of life and property they apply to most public assistance actions funded by fema but do not apply to hazard mitigation flood mitigation unmet needs pr ojects or fema grant programs specifically response actions excluded from nepa by the stafford act at 42 usc 5159 include the following general federal assistance such as the utilization of pers onnel equipment supplies technical nd advisory services in support of disaster assistance see actions specified under 42 usc 5170a essential federal assistance including actions to meet immediate threats to life and property resulting from major disaster such as the use of federal resources eg equipment supplies and facilities medicine food and other consumab and work and services to save lives and protect property g debris removal search and rescue clearance of roads demolition of unsafe structures warning of further risks and hazards s ee

consumable supplies and em ergency assistance see actions specified under 42 usc 5192 it is important to understand that as with actions categorically excluded discussed below an action statutorily ex cluded from nepa is not exempt from the requirements of other environmental statutes fema would still be responsible for complying with all other applicable local state tribal and federal laws and regulations relating to healt h safety and the environment14 this could encompass federal environmental statutes including among others the clean air act clean water act endangered species act nati onal historic preser vation act resource conservation and recovery act coastal zone management ac t and the coastal barrier resources act also these exemptions are specific to designated femafunded activities authorized under the stafford act simila r statutory exemptions do not exist for hudfunded programs such as cdbg disast er assistance in fact under the cdbg funding program states are allowed to s eek waivers of certain program requirements except those related to envir onmental review and fair housing nondiscrimination and labor standards categorical exclusions if project is of type that falls within an established category of activities the agency has previously dete rmined to have significant environmental impacts it is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an ea or eis sometimes such actions are referred to as being categorically excluded or exempt from nepa however nepa does apply to such actions they are excluded only from the re quirement to prepare an ea or eis individual agencies are required to specifically list in their respective nepa regulations those projects likely to be considered categorical exclusions15 for example fema has identified among ot hers the following actions as generally classifiable as categorical exclusions upg rades to codes and st andards removal of structures after addressing historic preservation need s and minor improvements or minor hazard mitigation measures at existing facilities such as placing riprap at culvert outlet to control erosion16 an example of hudidentified categorical exclusion is the acquisition repair impr ovement reconstructi on or rehabilitation of public facilities and improvements other than buildings when the facilities and improvements are in place and will be retained in the sa use without change in size or capacity of more than 20 percent eg replacement of water or sewer lines reconstruction of curbs and side walks repaving of streets17 note that this categorical exclusion is similar to the stafford acts statutory exemption for projects that would repair restore or replace damaged buildings most agencies have identified similar activities in their list of categorical exclusions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34650crs11 18 40 cfr 15084 19 see fema categorical exclusions catex at httpwwwfemagovplanehp regionviiicatexshtm 20 40 cfr 15089awhether or what types of documentati on may be required to demonstrate that project is categorically excluded w ill depend on whether the project involves extraordinary circumstances that may cause normally excluded action to have significant environmental effect18 also the fact that project does not have significant impact as defined under nepa does not mean that it will not trigger statutory requirements of othe r environmental laws for ex ample if historical sites endangered species habitat wetlands or property in minority neighborhoods to name few would be affected by proposed federal action comp liance with related environmental laws or re quirements in addition to nepa may be required even though categorically excluded projects do not have significant environmental impacts an agency may require certain level of documentation to prove that the ce determination is appropriate for example femas nepa regulations identify three levels of cat egorical exclusions and the types of documentation necessary for each19 if there are unresolved extraordinary circumstances that may have significant adverse environmental impact such as the potential to affect protected natural or cultural resources the proposed action cannot be categorically excluded and an ea is required projects requiring an ea or eis if project is not statutorily exempt from nepa or does not fit the criteria applicab to categorical exclusion it must be determined whether the environmental impact s of such project will be significant and hence require the preparation of an eis an eis may be required for projects intended to facilitate longter m recovery of an affected region examples may include disasterrelated floodcontro l or hurricane protection projects eg new wetlands restoration projects or levee repair projects c onstruction of roads bridges storm water management projects tornado shelters temporary housing fuel modification projects and public facilitie s eg schools libraries utilities debris storage staging and removal and building acquisition relocation and demolition if past disasters can serve as gauge disasterrelated project likely will not require an eis however it may require an ea an ea is carried out in order to clarify issues and determine the extent of an actions environmental effects ceq regulations define an ea as concise pub lic document that serves to briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an eis or finding of significant impact fonsi aid agency compliance with nepa when eis is required and fac ilitate preparation of an

attachments 1 and 2 at http wwwnepagovneparegsguidancehtmlconsulted21 individual agency regulations andor guidance may include more specific requirements some agencies suggest that the process for developing an ea should be similar to the process for developi ng an eis for example the applicant should consult interested agencies to scope the project to determine the potential for social economic or environmental impacts briefly discuss the projects purpose and need identify project alternatives and measures to mitigate adverse impacts and identify any other environmenta l review requirements appli cable to the project eg permitting requirements under the clean water act pub lic participation in the ea process is left largely to the discretion of the lead agency if at any time during preparation of the ea it is determined that projects impacts are significant eis preparation s hould begin if it is ultimately determined that impacts are not significant the lead agency must prepare fonsi the fonsi serves as the agencys administrative reco rd in support of its decision regarding projects impact the fonsi also must be available to the affected public22 alternative compliance arrangements in addition to categorical and statutory exclusions to nepa both ceq and individual agencies have specified alternative arrangements for complying with nepas requirements in the event of an emergency23 alternative arrangements are available where emergency circumstances make it necessary to take an action with significant environmental impacts ie project that would otherwise require an eis without observing the provisions of the applicable nepa regulations in such circumstances the federal agency taking the action should consult with ceq about what those arrangements may be and the time frame within which they must be completed exactly what those arrangements involve and how they woul d be implemented would vary according to the nature of the disaster generally their intent is to expedite the nepa process when an eis would otherwise be required these alternative arrangements do not waive the requirement to comply with nepa regulations but establish an alterna tive means of compliance agencies and ceq are to limit such arrangements to act ions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency on september 8 2005 ceq released memorandum that provides guidance on emergency alternative arrangements under nepa that guidance was specific to hurricane katrina24 but could be applicable to any disaster response activities undertaken by
