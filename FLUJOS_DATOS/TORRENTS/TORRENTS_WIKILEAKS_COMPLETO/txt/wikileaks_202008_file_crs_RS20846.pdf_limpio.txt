orders issuance and revocation tj halstead legislative attorney american law division summary executive orders and proclamations are used extensively by presidents to achieve policy goals set uniform standards for managing the executive branch or outline policy view intended to influence the behavior of private citizens the constitution does not define these presidential instruments and does not explicitly vest the president with the authority to issue them nonetheless such orders are accepted as an inherent aspect of presidential power and if based on appropriate authority they have the force and effect of law this report discusses the nature of executive orders and proclamations with focus on the scope of presidential authority to execute such instruments and judicial and congressional responses thereto definition and authority the constitution does not contain any provisions that define executive orders or proclamations the most widely accepted description appears to be that of the house government operations committee in 1957 executive orders and proclamations are directives or actions by the president when they are founded on the authority of the president derived from the constitution or statute they may have the force and effect of law in the narrower sense executive orders and proclamations are written documents denominated as such executive orders are generally directed to and govern actions by government officials and agencies they usually affect private individuals only indirectly proclamations in most instances affect primarily the activities of private individuals since the president has power or authority over individual citizens and their rights except where he is granted such power and authority by provision in the constitution or by statute the presidents proclamations are not legally binding and are at best hortatory unless based on such grants of authority the difference between executive orders and proclamations is more one of form than of substance1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20846crs2 2 armstrong v united states 80 us 154 1871 see also farkas v texas instrument inc 372 f2d 629 5th cir 1967 farmer

national emergencies how presidents have come to run the country by usurping legislative power cato institute oct 28 1999in addition to executive orders and proclamations presidents often issue presidential memoranda the distinction of these instruments from executive orders and proclamations is likewise more matter of form than of substance specifically all three instruments can be employed to direct and govern the actions of government officials and agencies further if issued under valid claim of authority and published all three may have the force and effect of law requiring courts to take judicial notice of their existence2 indeed it would appear that the only technical difference between executive orders and proclamations in relation to presidential memoranda is that the former must be published in the federal register while the latter are published only when the president determines that they have general applicability and legal effect3 just as there is definition of executive orders and proclamations in the constitution there is likewise specific provision authorizing their issuance as such authority for the execution and implementation of executive orders stems from implied constitutional and statutory authority in the constitutional context presidential power to issue such orders has been derived from article ii which states that the executive power shall be vested in president of the united states that the president shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states and that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed4 the president s power to issue executive order s and proclamations may also derive from express or implied statutory authority5 irrespective of the implied nature of the authority to issue executive orders and proclamations these instruments have been employed by every president since the inception of the republic despite the amorphous nature of the authority to issue executive orders presidents have not hesitated to wield this power over wide range of often controversial subjects6 this broad usage of executive orders to effectuate policy goals has led some commentators to complain that many such orders constitu executive lawmaking that impacts the interests of private citizens and encroaches upon congressional power7 the controversial nature of many presi dential directives thus raises questions regarding whether and how executive orders may be amended or revoked httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20846crs3 8 343 us 579 1952 9 id at 587 10 id at 585 11 id at 586589 12 id at 659

limitations the proper framework for analyzing executive orders in the judicial context may be found in youngstown sheet tube co v sawyer 8 there the supreme court dealt with president trumans executive order directing the seizure of steel mills which was issued in an effort to avert the effects of workers strike during the korean war invalidating this action the majority held that under the constitution the presidents power to see that laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be lawmaker9 specifically justice black maintained that presidential authority to issue such an executive order must stem either from an act of congress or from the constitution itself10 applying this reasoning justice blacks opinion for the court determined that as statute or constitutional provision authorized such presiden tial action the seizure order was in essence legislative act the court further noted that congress had rejected seizure as means to settle labor disputes during consideration of the tafthartley act given this characterization the court deemed the executive order to be an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine explaining the founders of this nation entrusted the lawmaking power to the congress alone in both good and bad times11 while justice blacks majority opinion in youngstown seems to refute the notion that the presi dent possesses implied constitutional powers it is important to note that there were five concurrences in the case four of which maintained that implied presidential authority adheres in certain contexts12 of these concurrences justice jacksons has proven to be the most influential even surpassing the impact of justice blacks majority opinion specifically jackson established tripartite scheme for analyzing the validity of presidential actions in relation to constitutional and congressional authority13 jacksons first category focuses on whether the president has acted according to an express or implied grant of congressional authority if so according to jackson presidential authori ty is at its maximum for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that congress can delegate and such action is supported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation14 secondly justice jackson maintained that in situations where congress has neither granted or denied authority to the president the president acts in reliance only upon his own independent powers but there is zone of twilight in which he and congress may have concurrent authority or in which its distribution is uncertain15 in the third and final category justice jackson stated that in instances where presidential action is incompatible with the expresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20846crs4 16 id at 637 17 id at 637638 18 id at 638639 19 id at 640 20 id at 638 640645 21 chamber of commerce v reich 74 f3d 1322 1996 22 id at 1339 23 3 cfr 1992 comp p 302 march 19 1992or implied will of congress the power of the president is at its minimum and any such action may be supported pursuant only the presidents own constitutional powers minus any constitut ional powers of congress over the matter16 in such circumstance presidential action must rest upon an exclusive power and the courts can uphold the measure only by disabling the congress from acting upon the subject17 applying this scheme to the case at hand justice jackson determ ined that analysis under the first category was inappropriate due to the fact that president trumans seizure of the steel mills had not been authorized by congress either implicitly or explicitly justice jackson also determined that the second category was clearly eliminated in that congress had addressed the issue of seizure through statutory policies conflicting with the presidents actions18 employing the third category justice jackson noted that president trumans actions could only be sustained by determining that the seizure was within his domain and beyond control by congress19 justice jackson established that such matters were not outside the scope of congressional power reinforcing his declaration that permitting the president to exercise such conclusive and preclusive power would endanger the equilibrium established by our constitutional system20 these standards remain applicable in the modern era in 1996 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia invalidated an executive order issued by president clinton on the grounds that it conflicted with the national labor relations act nlra21 the order at issue prohibited federal agencies from contracting with employers that permanently replaced striking employees upon determining that the order conflicted with provision of the nlra guarant eeing the right to hire permanent replacements during strikes the court of appeals held that the statute preempted the executive order stripping it of any effect22 congressional revocation further as long as it is not constitutionally based congress may repeal presidential order or terminate the underlying authority upon which the action is predicated the most recent example of the express nullification of an executive order by congress appears to have involved executive order 1280623 there congress revoked an order by president george hw bush to the secretary of the department of health and human service to establish human fetal tissue bank for research purposes to effectuate this repeal congress simply directed that the the provisions of executive order 12806 shall not havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20846crs5 24 pl 10343 107 stat 133 121 given the highly speculative basis of any asserted constitutional authority for the president to

similarly revoked executive orders25 presidential revocation illustrating the fact that executive orders are used to further an administrations policy goals there are frequent examples of situations in which sitting president has revoked or amended orders issued by his predecessor this practice is particularly apparent where presidents have used these instruments to assert control over and influence the agency rulemaking process president ford for instance issued executive order 11821 requiring agencies to issue inflation impact statements for proposed regulations26 president carter altered this practice with executive order 12044 requiring agencies to conside r the potential economic impact of certain rules and identify potential alternatives27 shortly after taking office president reagan revoked president carters order implementing scheme asserting much more extensive control over the rulemaking process executive order 12291 directed agencies to implement rules only if the potential benefits to society for the regulation outweigh the poten tial costs to society requiring agencies to prepare costbenefit analysis for any proposed rule that could have significant economic impact28 this order was criticized by some as violation of the separation of powers doctrine on the grounds that it imbued the president with the power to essentially control rulemaking authority that had been committed to particular agency by congress29 despite these concerns there were court rulings assessing the validity of president reagans order in turn president clinton issued executive order 12866 modifying the system established during the reagan admi nistration30 while retaining many of the basic features of president reagans order eo 12866 eased costbenefit analysis requirements and recognized the primary duty of agencies to fulfill the duties committed to them by congress it remains to be seen whether president george w bush will issue an executive order

dues and labor contracts significantly altering several requirements pertaining to government contracts first president bush issued executive order 13201 directing that all government contracts must include provision requiring contractors to notify their employees that they cannot be required to join union and that they can object to the use of required union dues for any purpose other than to support collective bargaining contract administrations or grievance adjustment31 executive order 13203 revoked an order issued by president clinton establishing the national partnership council and requiring federal agencies to form labormanagement partnerships32 executive order 13204 revoked another order issued by president clinton that required with respect to contracts for public buildings successive contractors to offer right of first refusal of employment to employees of the prior contractor33 perhaps most significantly president bush also issued executive order 13202 ordering that any executive agency that awards construction contract must ensure that awarding government authority either prohibit or require project labor agreements with labor organization34 this directive has been criticized as an example of the use of executive orders to achieve policy goals without explicit constitutional or statutory authority specifically critics assert that this order conflicts with the supreme courts decision in building trades council v associated builders boston harbor 35 there the supreme court held that the national labor relations act nlra does not preempt state authority when acting as the owner of construction project from enforcing an otherwise legal prehire construction labor agreement between private parties specifically the court explained that if private purchaser can enter into such an agreement public entity acting as purchaser must be able to do the same any other result according to the court would run contrary to the legislative goals that led congress to allow such agreements under the nlra36 given that executive order 13202 appears to prohibit government authority from requiring project labor agreement even when that authority is acting as the owner of construction project it has been argued that reviewing court could determine that the order lacks statutory authority rendering it invalid
