budget deficit moved together this pattern re emerged in the recession and subsequent expansion beginning in 2001 this is the opposite of what happened in the last half of the 1990s when the budget deficit fell as fraction of gross domestic product gdp and the trade deficit rose sharply as fraction of gdp from this experience it is clear that international capital flows which drive the net balance of trade do not depend solely on movements in the budget deficit during the last half of the 1990s real gross domestic investment rose as fraction of real gdp this resulted from the rise in us productivity and the related rise in the real yield on us assets this drew in additional private capital from abroad if the twin deficits theory is correct it has an adverse implication for the efficacy of fiscal policy as stimulus tool it suggests that in an environment of highly mobile international capital the effect of policy induced increases in the structural budget deficit eg tax cuts on shortrun economic growth would be larg ely offset by increases in the trade deficit the experience during both the 1980s and 1990s demonstrates that large and growing trade deficit need not be an impediment to overall job creation even though it may have had an effect on the type of jobs that were created since it af fected the composition of us output this report will be updated periodically

lively debates among economists and policymakers during the 1980s was the relationship between the federal budget deficit and the international trade deficit when the dust settled those arguing that the two deficits should move together seemed to have carried the day although doubters remained this prediction was based on mainstream macroeconomic theory as the 1990s unfolded the two deficits did not move together as the federal budget deficit came down as fraction of gross domestic product gdp the trade deficit rose as fraction of gdp is this evidence inconsistent with theory the analys is will suggest that the answer is there are other forces besides the federal budget deficit that can influence the us trade deficit they were not decisive during the 1980s they appear to have been operative during the 1990s with the onset of the recession in 2001 and subsequent move to expansion the coincident shift back to budget deficit the two deficits began to move together again

macroeconomic theory explains the twin deficit phenomenon as follows an increase in the federal budget deficit measured as an increase in the structural deficit as percent of full employment gdp will all else held constant both in the united states and abroad put upward pressure on us interest rates raising them above comparable rates abroad1 this occurs because the position of the governments budget influences the national saving rate when the structural budget deficit shrinks the government adds to the national saving supplied by households and businesses and interest rates fall when the structural budget deficit grows it represents claim on those savings and interest rates must rise for the market to remain in equilibrium in world in which us assets are good substitutes for foreign assets foreign investors will be tempted to buy more of the now higher yielding american assets 2 before they can buy these assets they must first purchase dollars thus the net demand for dollars in the foreign exchange market rises and the dollar increases in value and it is said to appreciate dollar appreciation reduces the price of foreign goods and services in america and increases the price of american goods and services abroad the net result is that americans spend more on foreign goods and services the value of american imports rise and foreigners spend less on american goods and services the value of us exports fall if the trade accounts were in balance to begin with the united states now has trade deficit 3 and indeed the data during the 1980s shown on table 1 conform to what the theory predicts4 the full employment or structural deficit rose from 06 of full employment gdp in 1981 to an expansion high of 48 in 1986 1 the reason for the assumption of all else held constant is that the fiscal action must raise us interest rates relative to those abroad if this does not happen because of offsetting ef fects in the private sector or foreign interest rates have risen theory suggests that fiscal expansion in the united states is unlikely to produce trade deficit 2 an essential part of the explanation for the emergence of twin deficits is that capital flows be highly mobile internationally in response to small international interest rate differen tials if capital mobility is low mainstream economic theory suggests that the trade deficit is unlikely to emerge or if it does it will be small 3 the trade deficit is the essence of the net inflow of fore ign capital or foreign saving to the united states like any loan it allows americans to consume use more goods and services than we produce 4 the data in table 1 for the structural budget deficit are on fiscal year basis whereas those for the trade deficit are on calendar year basis ideally the actual trade deficit should not be used in these computations rather structural trade deficit measured as percent of full employment gdp should be used unfortunately estimates of structural trade deficit do not exist the trade deficit and gdp data used in these computations are measured in terms of real 2000 chainbased dollars

gdp to 11 of gdp fall of 14 percentage points or about 56 of the decline in the structural budget deficit6 g22g145g142g561g344g342g342g342g156g561g7g161g153g142g155g146g142g151g140g142g561 as seen in table 2 events subsequent to the recession in 2001 have mirrored the 1980s experience as the budget deficit rose the trade deficit rose this occurred despite major easing in monetary policy by the federal reserve which should have discouraged foreign capital from coming to the united states however unlike the 1980s in this episode the growth of the trade deficit is coincident with fall in the international exchange value of the dollar which should signal net decrease in the inflow of foreign capital and indeed during 20022004 the inflow of private capital did abate the trade deficit did not fall because the decrease in the inflow of private capital was offset by the inflow of official capital from foreign central banks and treasuries 7 if the twin deficits theory is correct it has an adverse implication for the efficacy of fiscal policy as stimulus tool in the mainstream model policy induced increases in the structural budget deficit through tax cuts or increases in government spending boost aggregate spending by generating more government spending than the governments revenue intake this outcome is predicated on the absence of foreign capital mobility but if foreign capital flows are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates then any increase in aggregate spending caused by the larger budget deficit would be largely offset by an in crease in the trade deficit caused by the upward pressure placed on interest rates by the budget deficit in other words tax cuts or increases in government spending would not have much effect on the shortrun growth in output and employment under this view 5 had the trade balance relative to gdp measured in nominal dollars been used in this comparison the increase would have been 23 percentage points or about 54 of the total 6 had the trade deficit relative to gdp been measured in nominal dollars the decline would have been 12 percentage points or 46 of the decline in the structural deficit 7 for more complete discussion of

before looking at developments during the late 1990s it should be noted that mainstream macroeconomic theory has never excluded an independent causal role for international capital movements that is international capital movements can occur independent of any change in the federal budget deficit foreign capital may come to the untied states for variety of circumstances unrelated to the pressures the federal budget deficit puts on us interest rates change in us tax law which increases the after tax rate of return on capital could attract foreign funds even if it had effect on the federal budget deficit rising prospects for profit because of boom conditions in the us economy or an increase in productivity could increase domestic investment relative to gdp and could attract foreign capital even as the federal budget moves toward balance or into surplus similarly fears of inflation currency devaluation or political repression could induce foreigners to seek the safety of us assets moreover if falling federal deficit in the united states occurs with the onset of an economic downturn abroad such that yields on foreign assets fall relative to comparable us yields the emerging differential in favor of the united states could serve as magnet attracting additional capital that could forestall fall in the trade deficit or lead to rise in that deficit in this instance it would be possible to have falling budget deficit and rising trade deficit other possibilities also suggest themselves 8 the data on table 2 show very different pattern in the last half of the 1990s from the twin deficits of the 1980s as the structural budget deficit fell from 20 of gdp in 1995 to surplus of 11 of gdp in 2000 shift of 31 percentage points the last full year of the 19912001

clearly that changes in the magnitude and direction of the net inflow of foreign capital can occur independently of changes in the federal budget deficit the data in themselves do not explain why these movements occur however yet there are some interesting clues in the 8 foreign governments themselves can buy and sell us assets s lightly more than half of the privately held debt of the united states is owned by foreigners mainly by central banks and treasuries transactions by foreign official institutions have the same effects on the trade balance as do transactions by private citizens

the 1980s and 19952007 there is noticeable difference between these two expansions unlike 19831989 real gross domestic investment during the 1990s expansion was rapidly rising fraction of gdp the increase was especially strong in the period 19952000 the increase in desired investment motivated by the increase in productivity and the related rise in the real rate of return on american capital

capital and resulting trade deficit in both the 1980s and late 1990s the difference between the two periods was what caused the pressure on interest rates in the 1980s the upward pressure came from the rise in the structural budget deficit in the 1990s it came from the increased productivity and related rise in the profitability of private investment an interesting aspect of both historical periods is that policymakers in the united states have managed to bring the us economy to full employment with large and even growing trade deficits these trade deficits have not hampered the overall creation of jobs they have however influenced the nature of job creation since they alter the composition of us output away from export and importcompeting industries toward industries the demand for whose output is sensitive to interest rates g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 during the 1980s lively debate occurred the outcome of which was convincing case linking the growth in the structural measure of the federal budget deficit with the growth of the trade deficit with cause and effect running from budget deficit to trade deficit via interest rates and dollar appreciation lost in the small print of this debate was that the budget deficit is not the exclusive determinant of net capital flows and trade deficits international capital flows into and out of the united states can move in directions contrary to the movements in the position of the federal budget they depend not only on economic conditions in the united states but on similar conditions and decisions made abroad

structural or even the actual measure of the federal budget deficit both absolutely and as fraction of gdp beginning in 1995 real gross domestic investment rose as fraction of real gdp reflecting the increase in productivity and related increase in the real rate of return on american capital this increase served to attract private capital to the united states thus the trade deficit rose even as the budget deficit fell during the recovery that began in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the subsequent expansion rising structural budget deficit and the recove ry of private investment spending once again attracted foreign capital to the united states although in this episode the proportion of the inflow coming from foreign official sources central banks and treasuries has been especially important during 20022004 and 20062007 if the twin deficits theory is correct it has an adverse implication for the efficacy of fiscal policy as stimulus tool it suggests that when international capital flows are highly mobile the effect of policy induced increases in the structural budget deficit through tax cuts or increases in government spending on shortrun output growth and employment would be largely offset by increases in the trade deficit g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 marc labonte specialist in
