servi ces but also subjects an increasing number of us white collar jobs to international competition also globalization may benefit some groups more than others leading some to wonder whether the global economy is structur ed to help the few or the many the current wave of globalization is suppor ted by three broad trends the first is technology which has sharply re duced the cost of communication and transportation that previously divided ma rkets the second is dramatic increase in the world supply of labor engaged in inte rnational trade the third is government policies that have reduced barriers to trade and investment some recent research examines whether these trends are creating new vulnerabilities for workers some of the vulnerabilities for workers are underlined by changing employment patterns caused by increased foreign compe tition declining wage share of national income and rising earnings inequality these trends in turn have become source of economic insecurity for many ameri cans and may be weakening public support for us engagement with the world economy to bolster public support for an open world economy the conventional wisdom is that the legitimate concerns of those who are losing in the contemporary economic environment need to be addressed to wh at extent the losers should be compensated and how is matter of considerable cong ressional and public bate because the relationship between globalization and worker insecurity is complicated and uncertain number of different approaches may be considered if the goal is to bolster public support for us trade po licies globalization and an open world economy policies involving ad justment assistance education tax and trade are most commonly proposed there appears to be range of views on the merits of each of these policy approaches and the extent to which they can be designed and implemented in way that would reduce worker insecurity without undermining the benefits of globalization in the view of many econo mists policies that inhibit the dynamism of labor and capital markets or erect barriers to international trade and investment would not be helpful because technology and trade are critical sources of overall economic growth and increases in the us living standard this report will be updated should events warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34091contents

worker insecurity and policy approaches introduction the us economy is becoming increasingly open to the world economy with international trade and investment at record levels much of what americans consume or buy is produced in other count ries similarly much of what americans produce is exported abroad1 huge quantities of capital or money flow into and out of the united states every day swamping the value of goods and services that are exchanged2 new technologies and business practices accompany the flows of investment capital growing number of the largest us companies rely on international markets for over 50 of thei r sales and employ more foreign workers than domestic3 in the process todays global economy or what many call globalization is having growing impact on the economic futures of american companies workers and families4 economic theory holds that more ope n and integrated world economy provides large scale economic benefits by providi ng for specialization

labor intensively and to import goods that use lessskilled labor intensivel increased trade on balance raises the demand for skilled labor and reduces the demand for lessskilled labor thus it is reasonable to expect that as the united states increases its trade with lowwage and low skilled developing countries wages of lowskilled us workers will face downward pressure an influx of immigrants with less than highschool education by increasing the relative supply of lowskilled labor may further intensify pressures on wages at the bottom end as does technological change 8 bernanke ben s

poverty in c ountries such as china and india6 at the same time greater global economic integration does not always benefit everyone within country it can be accompanied by stress and anxiety as new competitors arise and compete for market share shifts in the structure of production impose costs on workers and business owners in declining sectors and thus create constituency that opposes the

suggests that the legitimate concerns of those who are losing in the contemporary economic environment need to be addre ssed yet compared to the benefits of globalization us programs geared toward s compensating the losers have been quite modest12 to what extent the losers should be compensated and how however is matter of considerable congressional and pub lic debate currently approaches

instantaneously at costs that continue to decline these advances in communica tion have allowed firms to break up the production process into discre steps and to produce goods in whatever location allows them to minimize costs the informa tion technology revolution also facilitates international trade in wider range of services from call center operations to sophisticated financial legal medical and engineering services in the process more jobs in the us labor force become increasingly vulnerable to international competition14 global labor supply the integration of brazil russia indi

strong over the past decade for most americans this has translated into absolute increases in living standards as measured by gains in real consumption and real disposable incomes18 growing engagement with the world economy has been an important factor facilitating robust overall economic performance however these positive developments have coincided with ch anging employment patterns caused by increased foreign competition declining wa ge share of national income and rising earnings inequality these trends in turn have become source of economic insecurity for many americans and may be contributing to declining public support for us engagement with the world ec onomy and for additional trade agreements19 job losses and fears much of the public anxiety about the economy and

economic future rests increasingly in the creation of highpaid service sector jobs is being jeopardized21 while some of these job fears rest on misconceptions others reflect problems th at may require new or different policy responses main anxiety about the us manufact uring base stems from sharp drop in us manufacturing employment the tota l number of manufacturing jobs fell by 23 million from 158 million in november 2001 the trough of the latest recession to 135 million in mid200822 despite growing economy and near fullemployment many of those who lost jobs have found it more difficult to secure new employment or had to accept lower paying jobs in order to become reemployed and most workers who permanently lose jobs in mass layoffs that involve outsourcing offshore or domestic had been employed by manufacturers23 this has been combined with internetfacilitated outsourcing of service jobs that were previously only tangentia lly involved in the global economy the fact that the work of wide range of us knowledge workers in business services medicine accounting and computer programming can now be done much more cheaply by workers residing in lowerwage countries has led to rising anxiety among white collar workers about international compe tition at the same time many businesses that are not shedding workers are pu lling back or reneging on decadesold commitments to provide health insurance and traditional pensions as they search for ways to stay competitive in todays global economy all of this may be factor in the erosion of traditional sources of secur ity for workers not only job security but the confidence of families in their own health and pension benefits and their childrens college prospects24 other economists maintain that worker fears of deindustrialization and massive offshoring of highpaid jobs are vastly overblown while rising foreign competition together with technical change will reduc employment in sectors of the economy most sensitive to foreign

as reflected by data showing that 1 manufacturing accounted for 117 of the u s economy in 2007 in real dollars down from 145 in 2000 and 2 that the us share of world manufacturing output dropped 04 from 214 in 1993 to 210 in 200625 they also emphasize that much of this is being accomplished by heavy investment in robots and computers which allow companies to pr oduce more goods with fewer workers domestic factors such as technological innovation not trad they argue have been the dominant factors in the loss of manufacturing jobs while services offshoring may be growin g rapidly most studies find the extent of job losses from services offshoring to be relatively small in the aggregate but concentrated in few i ndustries and occupations26 also most estimates do not take into this account the new jobs that ffshoring may create as result of making domestic firms more competitive or jobs that are offshored back to the united states thus offshoring appears not to be on scal so far that is major source of job destruction especially compared to th normal churning of jobs in the us economy27 yet anecdotes of higher skilled and highereducated computer programmers or medical technicians being outsourced combined with estimates by some reputable economists that onequarter of all us j obs could be potentially off shore generates fears over the kind of jobs that will be available for american workers in the future as result many more workers that have not been affected by foreign competition in the past may now feel concern that global competition is potential threat to their job security and future earnings28 rising income inequality second source of anxiety or insecurity may stem from the impact that globalization immigration and automation are having on the bargaining power of workers under this view while most work ers have continued to stay employed the pressures of the global marketplace and technological change have forced them to accept modest or

maintain that total compensation which has risen over the period under review is more appropriate measure 31 growing unequal trend of earnings from wo rk started many years ago for example according to irs data the average taxpayer in 1979 in the top 110th of one percent of all wage and salary earners earned about as much as 44 average taxpayers in the bottom half this number had risen to almost

clive crook why middle america needs free trade financial times june 28 2007globalization30 alternatively us companies as seen through the lens of corporate profitability are thriving as never before support for this view may be found in da ta that indicates little or wage and salary growth for all but the high est earners over the past six years31 one data set of real earnings growth by educational vel shows that only 34 of workers those with doctorates and pr ofessional graduate degrees in business law and medicine enjoyed any increases in average r eal money earnings from 20002006 stated differently more than 96 of us wo rkers are in educational groups high school dropout high school graduate some college college gr aduate and nonprofessional masters for which mean average money ear nings fell during this period for college graduates constituting 29 of the workforce this was new experience since real pay increase rose steadily between 1980 and 200032 another indicator that the average worker may not be getting ahead is captured by data linking productivity growth to gr owth in average real hourly wages while productivity growth or output per worker rose by 71 from 1980 to 2005 the real compensation of nonsupervisory workers co mprising 80 of the work force grew by 4 the gap in the manufacturing s ector was even greater productivity rose 131 while compensation of non supervisors grew only 733 according to this view the strong us productivity growth of the past several years has not been reflected in wage and salary earnings for most american workers whether the rest of the income genera ted by increased productivity is being captured by the top 1 of income earne rs by corporate profits or in nonwage compensation such as health benefits of nonproduction workers is major unresolved question one recent study found th at 60 of the gap is mostly accounted for by rising nonage benefits such as health insurance using an alternative measurement this study also found that th real incomes of hourly paid workers have not in fact been flat since the early 1980s but have risen by 15 per year34 at the same time while the vast majority of american workers may

earnings income growth at the top is being driven by corporate profits which accrue mainly to those with high labor earnings in 2006 corporate profits totaled 124 of nati onal income level not reached in 50 years the corporate profit share of national income is also at or near record levels in japan and europe35 variety of explanations trade with developing countries foreign investment an increase in lowskilled immigration the business cycle and skill based technological change have been put forth to explain these income trends but there is consensus on what weight each factor may have thereby making it difficult to prescribe an approximate polic remedy nor is it known whether these wage trends will persist but it is cl ear that the market starting over two decades ago turned strongly against less skilled and less educated workers36 policy approaches the relationship between globalization and worker insecurity is complicated and uncertain there are many different compone nts of globalization and it is not easy to discern which components are most linked to rising worker insecurity most research indicates that trade plays only limited ro in generating th economic losses or concerns but that it gets most of the bl ame because of its visibility particularly in the guise of new trade agreements while this report has identif ied three components of worker insecurity job losses outs ourcing fears and downward pressures on wages there easily could be other materi and psychological factors that are involved as well as result number of different approaches might be required if ones goal is to maximize american economic well being with the derivative need to bolster public support for globaliza tion and an open global economy approaches involving adjustment assist ance education taxe s and trade are most commonly put forth in this context adjustment assistance is designed primarily to address job dislocation concerns educa tion is generally considered means to foster skillsets demanded by globalizing economy as well as vehicle for promoting greater equality tax policy is the primary means of affecting changes in income distribution and trade policy tends to affect the kinds of jobs available in an economy but not the overa ll level of employment additional perspectives are offered at both ends of the political economy spectrum at one end there

jobs37 at another end there are those who call for primary reliance on market forces and deregulation as the best way to promote robust economic growth and vibrant job creation key question may be the extent to which any of these approaches can be designed and implemented in way that would reduce worker insecurity without undermining the benef its of globalization38 in the view of many economists policies that inhibit the dynamism and flexibility of labor and capital markets or raise barriers to international trade and investment would not be he lpful because technology and trade are critical sources of overall economic growth and increases in the us standard of living39 what follows is short description of the main policy approaches each section discusses how each policy is intended to

past 30 year s particularly in the area of training while number of st udies suggest workers trained through taa have had much better success in finding j obs than workers who have not received training many observers maintain that the current program is too narrow too bureaucratic and underfunde d to alleviate worker anxiety by itself43 current options for reform being proposed range from small to large while the bush administration has called for streamlining the processes of eligibility determination and assistan ce implementation many in congress have proposed broadening and expansion of the program in addition to funding increases the most prominent proposal s include extension of eligibility to service workers and to workers displaced by trade with nontrade agreement countries number of other proposals call for streamlining the program nd integrating it with other programs for displaced workers44 education while taa focuses directly on those work ers who appear to be visible losers from globalization some analysts believe that priority needs to be placed on ensuring that all americans are in position to ta ke advantage of globa lization support for increasing the skill level of the labor force through more education is based on the notion that higher skilled workers generally earn more have lower unemployment rates and are more likely to be better able to adapt to changing demands of the workplace45 some research also suggests that the higher rate of return to education and skill training is likely the single greatest source of the longterm increase in inequality thus policies th at boost national investment in education and training may also help reduce inequality wh ile expanding economic opportunity46 beyond the view that the provision of more

money be put into federally s ubsidized retraining programs particularly for economically disadvantaged populations47 given the increasing globalization of labor markets the question also arises as to what kind of skills to promote those at the top end of todays income distribution have skills that enable them to perform nonroutine kinds of problem solving often within the context of large complex global operations in contrast an increasing share of domestic workers in the middle of the wage spectrum have experienced lower demand because companies can now look all over the world for workers able to perform computer programming tasks communications tasks and similar jobs whose tasks can be routinized but do not require facetoface contact with others in this context it is not selfevident what kind of education or training will foster labor skills that will be immune to outsourcing and global comp etitive pressu res in the future other than that they require face toface contact for work that does not involve codifiable information48 another consideration in evaluating ducation as policy approach for dealing with worker insecurity about globaliz ation may be the amount of time for educational changes to achieve the objective one analyst maintains that education as policy approach to worker insecurity could take more than generation to make difference for example it took 60 years to boost the share of college graduates in the work force from 6 at the end of ww ii to 33 today and that required major government programs such as the gi bill49 tax policy calls for more

whether gove rnment should move in this direction is controversial51 on the one hand most economists main tain that some market determined income differences are needed to create incentives to work invest and take risks without the incentives economic growth w ould be less robust to the detriment of everyone on the other hand there are sign s that rising inequality is intensifying resistance to globalization and some observers maintain that it is important to act quickly if public support for global in tegration is to be maintained trade policy trade policy can also play role in re ducing worker insecurity traditional us policies toward free trade agreements ftas and unfair foreign trade practices in particular have been pointed to by labor activists as contributing to job loss and job insecurity if the united states adopted and successfully implemented more muscular policies in these areas proponents of this vi ew posit that some lleviation of job loss and worker anxiety could materialize bilateral and regional ftas and us ftas with countries such as canada mexico chile and australia have played role in accelerating the integration of global markets through mutual reduction in trade barriers countries entering into an fta accelerate specialization in pr oduction and trade by opening new opportunities for the export of us goods nd services ftas support jobs associated with increased exports at the same time some us jobs and production shift to fta partners who can offer lower costs of production including labor cost while most labor activists accept that lower labor costs are legitimate source of comparative advantage that many developing countries can offer they challenge any incremental cost advantage that these countries may gain from the suppression of workers rights to deal with concerns raised by unfair worker rights practices bipartisan policy position was agreed to by c ongressional leadership and the bush administration as outlined in the new trade policy for america us ftas will begin incorporating enforceable labor standards52 thus countries that sign an fta with the united states will have to allow collective bargaining and abolish forced labor among other requirement s but it is uncertain how much relief this provision will provide for american workers according to one analyst matter how free developing and newly industria

pressure us wages53httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34091crs14 54 drezner daniel w council on foreign relations us trade strategy free versus fair 2006 55 galbraith james k why populists need to rethink trade american prospect may 10 2007 web only version 56 ibid p7us efforts to eliminate foreign country unfair trade practices could also serve to reduce pressures on workers foreign pr actices such as subsidies and predatory pricing strategies can encourage shift in investment and employment to their markets thereby displacing us workers from the perspective of us workers whose jobs are displaced by these kinds of foreign government interventions the financial and psychic costs of dislocation are not insignificant accordingly some maintain that forceful us policy towards these practices may be justified in order to prevent unnecessary job displacement and churning in the domestic economy although measures that restri ct trade are likely to be opposed by stakeholders who may be disadvantaged by higher import prices54 nevertheless as economists constantly point out the role of trade policy in preserving or creating jobs in the overa ll economy is very limite d while trade policy measures to increase market access for us exports and investments or to impose restrictions on us imports can affect the composition of employment the overall level of employment is determined primar ily by fiscal and m onetary policies and by business cycles dislocation moreover is an inevitable byproduct of capitalism with or without trade domestic standards finding ways to create more highwage jobs in the united states is another approach that has been proposed for he lping those who lose out to the global economy number of different elements are sometimes included in this approach including higher minimum wage universal health care unionfriendly workplace and expanded funding for research and deve lopment for new indus tries particularly in the area of alternative energy55 this approach is based largely on the model of universal unions high minimum wages and strong welfare state benefits provided by norway and sweden these two scandinavian countries which enjo among the lowest unemployment rates in europe are highly open to in ternational trade and to job churning hiring and firing in their economies in the view of one proponent the key to their success is high wages firms are not free to compete by undercutting the union rate but must try to keep productivity high if they are to survive56 the premise of this high standards job creation approach is that the foundation of strong american middle class rest s with laws regula tions and standards developed at home instead of worryin g about what impact trade with lowwage developing countries has on us wages th is approach maintains that highwages domestic economy will have fa vorable impact on trade the big problem is simply that unions laws regulations and standa rds have been undercut by

touts the principles of free enterprise open markets and limited government as the best way to achieve economic prosperity and security for all americans the basic idea of this approach is that individua ls are best helped not by government intervention but by making their own choices in free marketplace58 under this view todays global ec onomy provides unprecedented opportunities for the united states to derive largescale economic benefits free trade policies are seen as creating higherpaying jobs for growing number of americans working in exportoriented industries high cor porate tax rates relatively high minimum wage domestic subsidies and weak protections of property rights are viewed as the real threats to american jobs59 when it comes to policies for allevia ting worker anxiety most supporters of this school of thought oppose government programs that redistribute income or protect workers from market forces rather many supporters of this approach urge focus on removing barriers to job creati on as well as various forms of retraining and relocation aids to help worker s find new jobs in growing economy
