secretary general jaap hoop scheffer appeared to stre ss in october 2007 that georgi should settle its separatist conflicts if it aspires to alliance membership12 however some observers argue that georgia should not be excluded from the map and ultimately nato membership due to separatist conflicts that are in part fueled by russia president saakashvili has declared that georgia will pursue only peaceful means to regain authority over abkhazia and south ossetia georgian officials envisage that progress toward alliance membership eventually will encourage the breakaway regions to reintegrate with stable peaceful democratic and prosperous georgia some georgians however allege that the alliance will condition membership on georgia accepting confederation with or independence for the separatist regions13 in contrast to these views leaders of the breakaway regions have tended to view nato as aggressive because it is assisting georgia to build up military forces which they cla

in georgia17 some georgian officials and others have appeared to try to prepare their compatriots for negative decision by the nato summit in april 2008 on georgia s participation in map they stress that nato decision on map for georgia is based on political as well as technical military issues that th civil disorder and government crackdown in late 2007 provided less than glowing image of georgias reform progress and that partly as result political consensus within the alliance on map for georgia may be lacking18 some observers caution that georgias politicians and citizenry may be seriously discouraged from pursuing difficult reforms if the country is not invited to participate in map in april 200819 others who discount such georgian response argue that the georgian government
