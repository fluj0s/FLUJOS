institutions must assess the political social and economic stability of the foreign country and its legal framework including the privacy regime and the financial institutions ability to enforce us privacy laws contractual provisions that address choice of law issues such as whic h countrys law is to apply to the various elements of the contract which courts will have jurisdiction over any
