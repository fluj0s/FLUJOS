do i thcrefoer live continuous martyrdom be cause of the incompetencetof the person over am i one of those who are always offended by the superiors attitude what ever it may be 7 when the superior gives an orderdo i usually think whether or not it pleases if it hurts or not if it seems f3ir to or not or if i am bound to obey just as he wants to 8 do i yet rejoice at seeing myself treat ed somewhat harshly by the superior be cause i can offer god real and costly living of my vow am i also pleased when i am ignored or when i find the superiors orders repugnant 9 or on the contrary do i

answers do i ask for the least possible number of permissions and always when the superior is most dis tracted if i can do i send someone else to ask on my behalf 10 do i ask permissions in an ambiguous way so that the superior will agree to them without exactly realising what they entai1thus enabling to interpret them loosely afterwards and without trouble 11 are all my dealings with the superior very superficial lacking full undelstand ing and filial confidence 12 do i cleverly twist obedience to suit myself fixing things in such way that the superior has to tell to do what pleases most 13 have i forced him to stop giving any orders because of my open disrespect b my protests longfaces or dishonesty in fulfilling his commands 14 do i obey because i have other j choice or has the realisation that obed ience wzthout meaning is miserable waste of time ever dawned on meif notam 1 i trying to live as parasite in the leg ion with purely selfish motives 15 have i realised that those of strong character who argue with their superior are victims of their own whims am i vinced that total surrender to my super i iors will is my only way to be true religious in the eyes of god 16 do i realise that any attitude towards the superior which is not filial and 1 fident will permantently separate from godand that god considers any disrespect i or lack of respect towards the superior as an offence against his own person 4 17 in order to make happy religious would the superior first have to study my likes and whims do i consider myself deserving of this 18 am i one of those who obey only when treated kindly who lose their vocation when they are treated unfairly as they see it 19 do i only obey god in my superior or do i obey frienda kind intelligent man who can either please or annoy mewhen i obey is there still some doubt in my mind as to whether i am fulfilling the will of god or not 20 does obedience give stable and happy security to my life because i act accor ding to the providence of god 21 do i know how to use obedience to paise all my actions to the high plane of fulfillment of gods will does this cept keep unconcerned about even my most admirable plans until they are firmed by the stamp of obediencecan i a1 so keep this uncaring attitude when the plans 1hold dearest are not approved 22 do i overcome my tendency towards com fort and egoism to the extent of anticipz ating the commands of the superior when ever possible 23 do i automarically try to justify my self by replying to the superiors orders with clarifications and objections if i have to clarify anything are my reasons clear brief charitable respectful and well thoughtout dg i always find excuses for not doing what the superior orders do there excuses actually arise or do i have to invent them 24 when obeying means something i find hard do i make up for this b doing it any way i like does anything seem morn important than obedience at the moment when i must stop doing one thing and start another sr do i carry oul the norm of leaving even the let ter i have begun writing as revealing sign of ay respect for the will of god do i only obey the bell when i find the pro gramme boring or do i also obey wlorl i like it and when selflove comes into play do i usually see my duty as the most perfect indication of gods will for nedo i accomplish it with canstant attitude of love and surrender or do i obey in routine way without any thought of god motivated by reasons such as human respect or desire for attention 27 do i do everything in the spirit ai my pules which i respect and love as the most direct and permanent expression of the divine will 28 havs i got the habityct of scing god in my duty and in the most insignificant and trivial events in life 65 29 do i express all my love for the legion in perfect fulfillment of obedience scious that obedience is her armour her inner strength and her most abundant i i pledge of divine blessings 30 do i realise that complete submission to the superiors in all matters is the first step towards understanding the spirit of the legion fully 31 is my life characterised by complete submission and docility following the example of christs surrender to his fath ers will or does this service of god still exist only in terms of affection and sentiment with application to my daily life 18 the first private vow have i given my private vows due inport anoe since the day of my pofesion7have f thought of them only little or have i completely forgotten them 2 have i tied tp go deep into their spirit by putting them intractise 3 do i interpret the first private vow as it suits or have i tried to give it its full supernatural value do i think that this vow is just ple promise made hastily in the secrecy of the sacristy or on the other hand do i really understand the significance of such step in the development of the legion have i at any time criticised the way in which legionary superiors govern why because of levity lack of supernatural spirit lack of faith in the legion be cause of desire to criticise everything or because of self sufficiency 1 6 have i attained complete selfdoninion on this point to the degree of practising 67 complete delicacy of conscience 7 do i usually question the superiors orders do t deny myself any freedon on this point both internally and externally 8 do i notice secret leanings towards corn fort in my life which are more than signs of internal conflict just under the surface have i hidden criticisms of the government of the legion which i screen behind halftruths and ambiguous phrases does this resentment take the form of constant questioning and belitt ling of everything the superior does 9 have 1 ever slipped up in this allin portant aspect 10 have i at any tine seen some partic ular command of the superior or norm of the institute as mere whim of authority under the pretence of doing good do i corrupt the consciences of others by crit icising always in subtle way any positive step taken by the superior 11 do i often examine myself on my poss ible faults against this vow do i tell them in confession 12 why have i not been faithful to this vow through weakness of chracter hy pocrisy or uncontrolled passion due to wounded selflove 13 have i learned how to control myself after any strong trial which my legionary vocation entails have i seen it as wise preparation for my spiritual wellbe ing and advancement on the apostolcte or as something insignificant mere whim of the superior 14 whenever i see real fault against the vow do i immediately tell the superioror so as to avoid complications do i refrain from doing this have i ever taken part in this grumbling and criticism against super iors 15 have i an internal attitude of constant ly renewing this vow as mere formula or am i ready to dsny myself making this vow the fundamental and true basis of ay leg ionary spirit and formation 16 have i therefore firmly resolved never to defam my superiors does this apply especially to my superiors in the legion am i specially carcful about this when outsiders are present 17 do i porniso to be faithful to my vow until death matter what happens a1 ways for christ and for the security and progress of the legion 19 the second privatl vow 1 do i understand the great importance of my second private vow or was it also just lifaloss formula rend in th sacristy after the profession i 2 da i thank god sincerely for this vow which has saved from so much worry and unpleasantness in my religious life 3 what prevents from breaking this vow love for jesus christ or for the legion or the fear of incurring censure which could prevent from accepting some res ponsibility at future date or on thc other hand do i fully realise its value to the legion 4 why do i not kill once and for al1the desie to get some position in the legion as demandzd by the very complete formula i prtomise never to ii 5 up to now have i coveted any position in the government of the legion does this ambition crop up only occasicnally or is it part of my way of being have i cultiv ated this tendency to obtain positions in any particular aspect or with any degree of constancy am i always thinking of show i ing off tho fact that i have leadership capabilities and that i could do it bett er than the superiors have i given way to 1 i these thoughts i ll do

when the superior is not presect in group do i naturally assume the command ing position 7 have i told my superior yet of these persistent attitudes which cause to fault against my vow internally i 13 8 do i make any effort to understand aid carry out the principle of being private soldierof the legion and leader of souls 9 have i shown my desire of being super ior of such and such community tomy fel i low brothers even if only jokingly 10 do i realise how dangerous this frust ratedambition for position and respect is for the legion 3 11 do i examine my faults against this point do i confess them as formal faults against an alreadyexisting vow 12 have i desired any position for any brother without realising that this is deformation of the legionary sgpirit 13 do i try to excel in my studies so as to be valued by the superiors and thus winning some dignity hn i longing to ob tzin some post in the legion under the pretence of promoting the wellbeing of others have i even tried to progress in the spiritual field in order to gain the esteem of the superiors and obtain some position 14 are my feelings on this point always the same have i told the superiors about them yet if not what pretensions have i to that apparent blamelessness sought in those external readymade formulas i 15 has human respect forced to conceal another brothers evident and real fault in this matter for the simple reason that i did not want to go to the trouble of informing the superiors something which i promised to do in the vow itself 16 have i ever told the superior that i had noticed attitudes which i thought were serious and grave faults against this vow purely from motives of envy or gossip without thinking of the consequences i 20 confidence in superiors 1 do i confide in my superiors am i sure they know deeply 2 hhat are my motives for this confidence li faith the fact that it is necessary in 1 order to know gods will or on the trary mere sentiment 0r human affection 3 how do i open up my conscicncc to my superiors do i do it fully trustfully n constantly with supernatural spirit or partially with twisted and calculat ing attitude n i 4 do i speak to my superiors frankly simply and clearly or am i complicate6 sn and f ormulist ic i 5 do i limit my confidence according to the demands of my selflove to my own in i terests to my sensuality or vanity or on the other hand according to the demands of my love for christ for the legion and rl for my vocation j 6 do i go to my superiors with the firm belief that they can help do i go 73 with humility with filial confidence sir plicity or only for the sake of going 8 does it cost lot to go to my sup eriors khy because of selflove and vanity because of fear that they may get to kno meir2itseof laziness sensual ity rationalism or the belief that i can manage on my own do i act accordingly 9 am i convinced of the need for this confidence with superiors in my religious life do i give it primary role not only in sanctifying myself but also for sav ing my soul do i consider it the guaren tee of my vocation and as one of the surest signs of my love for the legion 10 that is my attitude towards the advices i receive do i try to weigh their merits do i makc sure to carry them out do i only carry them out partially do i foll ow them simply and trustfully 11 am i thankful for this advice do i put it into practise 12 do i let much time go by without making contact with my superior when i cannot do this by word do i try to keep up written communication with him do i reduce this contact t mere formal necessity with out saying anything about the actual state of my soul what does the sacrament of penance mean to is it troublesome obligation an other disciplinary norm way to silence my conscience for moment or on the trary magnificent opportunity for drawz ing closer to cod of being reconciled with him and receiving an increase of sanctifying grace 2 do i comply with the rule of weekly fession how do i actually make my confession with faith and supernatural spirit with sincere repentence or with routine and in mechanical way does confession help to enliven and promote my compunction of heart is my examination before confession superficial glance at the faults of the past week do i look for the cause of my faults do i examine the previous confess ion to see if my repentence and proposal of amendment were sincere have i lively and supernatural sorr ow for my sins is it sincere is it true ozfering of my will to god or do i renew it just for moment to make the sacrament valid thereby reducing it to 2 mere supericial act does this sorrow affect my attitude of sincere contrition and humility while fessing my sins does it influence my us ual spirit of penance what are the reas ons for my sorrow shame and despair at my own personal abasement or the pain that it gives meto see that i have been unfaithful to god not responding to the pardon so generosly offered in my last confession are my proposals of amendment nothing more than what is required to make thecon fession valid is this just measure of relief demanding nothing from in my daily life do i realise that this atti tude can make all my confessions useless therefore have i ever worried about the value of my proposais of amendment when i have some doubts how do i reassure my self do i shrug my shoulders even in delicate matters chastity private vows etc or do i examine myself in depth do i look for advice on the matter have i considered the fact that god with all his grace is ony able to san cify according to the sincerity of my resolutions 10 after confession dc 1 often remexbcl the proposals of ainendmcnt made daiil it pc i nake rhtam the ccntre of my personcl efforts durizg the week so as to activate them with new motive for making repar ation 11 while confessing my sins do 1as rule remember that i am making my confess ion to god 12 do i confess my faults clearly haqe i ever hidden then behind ambiguous phras 2s have i ever concealed grave 13 am i anxious and scrupulous when coz fessing my sins do i cause myself undue worry by adding in unzecessary details why to convince the confessor that i have delicacy of conscience becacse of scruplcs and lack of maturity in this as pect because of lack of precisicn in pre paring the confession is it because of nervousness or through negligence 14 do i confess the same sins every week do i try to find out the reason for this 15 do i always try to go to the same fessor 16 do i look for confessor who helps lot in my legionary

or has it the practical meaning that of being fully awareof my basic powrlessness and ery in godfseyes and of the infinite debt whish i have incurred with him 2 whatform does my purpose of amendment i take is it goading sensation of sorrow for feeling of gratitude because god has pardoned or serious respon sibility of responding to the grace of forgiveness 3 therefore each time i raise up my i mind to god do1 make an act of humility beforehand do i always do this or only during spiritual exercises 4 do i confine this gratitude solely to moments of intimacy with god or do i ex tend it to all the

what spirit do i carry out penances the spirit of the fourth ruleof per fection that is reparation and glorific ation of the sacred hezrt do i do it to obtain graces of holiness for myself and for my legionary brothers so that god may give his grace in temptation for ners for other reason than to attraci the attention and notice of the superiors 21 is the sanctification and progress of my mother

keeping firm control and taking minute care do i keep the same watch over my thoughts and over the sense of touch or an i curious thus putting purity in dan ger in this context do i control danger ous memories and mental images 8 if the superiors should slacken their care and vigilance over my life would this have other effect than to make increase my personal effort on the other hand would i lose all i had gainedowing to the fact that it had been gained not from my own effort but as result of pressure from others 9 how do i get on during outings am i modest am i also charitable 10 do i forget

completefailure or that i have voc 3tion on the contrary do i suppress my sorrow and disappointment my sadness and selflove by new effort for victory is the fact of renewing my purity of intent ion enough to restore my peace of mind all in all does my life follow the firm and straight course of the will or the constantlychanging motion of thc senti ments 18 do i usuallytell my troubles to my fellow brother or am i the only one who knows about my problems is this because i am naturally shy or do i want to deny myself in this aspect do i see any pro gress in ray efforts to control my chang ing sentiments 19 do i think that all the trials and dis couragement i feel are simply trials from god or dc i carefully analyse them to see whether in fact they come from my own infidelity in any

do everything in my power to ensure that this does not happen 23 do i live the sacrifice of working only for god without claiming mcns teem as payment for my efforts 24 do i naturally reject all judgements which neither come from god ie from my right consciencenor from my superiors does this stem from the knowledge i have of myself which is so impartial that the very idea of praiseconfuses since i see it as totall unmerited on my part 25 when i see that others look up to do i think of my real limitations andmy inability to cope with the many aspects in which i am at most hindrence to god 26 has all this permeated my entire being to such an extent that with christ i prefer humiliation and insignificance in mens1 eyes 27 to obtain this do i try to keep my affairs in the background do i speak much about myself do i do this tdimake good impression do i take advantage of every opportunity to show off whenever i can attract attention or congratulatinns though this may be mere

of excuses so that im always the innocent partyv1 always the one ms understood by the superiors do1 take the liberty of telling them that their rebukes ofmy conduct are notrealistic indirectly accusing them of illwill t0 wards or of being unable to judg6 the complexity of my personality1 3 25 has envy ever crept into my life without completely dominating it have i fostered it and helped it

something like this bother for days on end making bear grudge 35 have i already formed opinions of my brothers according to whether or not they agree with and do what suits 36 am i prepared to adjust my criteria to suit others or do i think that to yield in this aspect would be to betray the truth do i regard myself as infall ible to some extent 37 am i stubborn in arguments in such way that i can stand up to anyone whose opinions differ from mine using the pow er of emotion rather than reason does t often happen that my opinions are at var ience with the unanimous opinion of all the others do i go against the opinions of others as matter of course purely out of habit 38 have i enough control of my thoughts and behaviour tc overcome these tendenc ies and give in quickly and amiably 39 when certain topics appeal to others at particular moment but not to do i control myself do i also surpress my human respect to speak openlyabout christ the legion and souls have i enough cour age to do this always and in any company 40 am i constantly in the company of those i get on well with thus forming an exclusive little clique within the comm unity 41 do i offer the annoyance i feel toward those who are naturally disagreeable to 124 as sacrifice to christ or is it im possible to persuade to spend even ten minutes with people who are like that if i feel obliged to spend some time in their company do my bearing aimless words or general silence betray my bad feeling do i try to help those who annoy 42 how do i manage in the fight to over come impatience does it come and go without any effort on my part to bring it under control does this lack of patience force to go against my duties and re solutions since i am unable to overcome it with energy do i waste the best part of my time and efforts getting annoyed at stupid details and then trying to regain my composure on the other hand do i ex tinguish even the mental outbursts of impatience and anger by firm decision of

of being saint saint form ed by many small things accomplished with perfection has this real obligltion the force of law in my religious life or do i not follow my vocationin this aspect 2 1s my work for perfection based on r1 burning desire to imitate christ lf 3 do i revise the rules oferfection often do i meditate on them 4 do i usually do things with perfection or do j keep to the standard of l1 nore or less 3 5 does this legionary principle seen to practically lacking in inportancc superfluos or only for scrupulous souls on the contrary is it in my opinion manifestation of my tender love for christ of my desire to please and imi tate him the one who did everything well 6 why do things go badly for be cause of lack of attention selfdenial or sacrifice because of laziness 7 do i do things in any way at all with out worrying myself about it 6 do i do the big things with perfection do i also do the small things well 9 on this point is my life controlled by what i like best 10 am i

more perfect i1 l d 12 h3ve i formed habit of perfection in the details closing book stamping letter shutting door etc 13 am i aware that these ordinary little things done for love of christ are the ones which build up my religious perfect s ion and give the legions family spirit 32 man of the klhrgdof 1 is my basic primary concept of the kingdom of christ that of all men living the life of grace or have i come to clear realisation of what these words i mean 2 does jesus christ reign in through sanctifying grace dc i understand that this is the essential condition of my fight for the kingdom 3 does it impress to thirk of the num 3 ber of places in which christ does not yet reign of the almost infinite number of those who dont know him and hate qim does this move to surrender my life with enlrgy and constancy or am i incon stant and shallow only roused to cnthus i iasm frcm time to time without this hav ing any practical results in my life 4 do ather things interest besides promoting the kingdon of christ art literature philosophy or even theology 5 do i feel anguish when i think of the i uselessness of many of christs suffer ings does this move to personal and absolute surrender

dedication 7 have i personal interests which hardly correspond to the interests of christ dd i believe that i will be able to keep them all my life 8 has the oftrepeated motto your king dom come any meaning on my lips and in my heart or has its meaning been oscup d by routine or insincerity does it scrvc as constant impetus and encourag ement for 3 does it encourage to think that my battles and my sacrifices hasten thecom ing of the kingdom of christ 10 do i iove the kingdom so much that sacrifice demanded by its establishment seems great or unbearnble i 11 if at the present moment i am not making total effort in study in inter ior life and in the practise of virtuedo i live with the illusion that i will do so at some future date do i cultivate charity as the weapon in the fight for the kingdom as christ demands 12 am i constant fighter in all circum stances always seeking prayer and sacri fice so as to fight effectively for the kingdom 13 do i learn the complete surrender which the

my self in my work 18 am i an enthusiastic beginner or am i always pessimistic and unhelpful 19 have i thought over the fact that an attitude of indolence and lazinesseven now but much more so

of my rhetoric do i believe in the possibility of being great apost without personal hoiiness do 1 make this belief reality by leading an easy life without complications 25 in my longing to begin working for the kingdom am i spurred on by aiy motive of vanity by an immoderate desire for free dom or for the gratification of my own sensuality on the other hand have i re alised that now in the

and my eternity do i detest mediocrity whether it be in spif itual intellectual or human affairs 2 is my life marked by dynamism typical of someone who wants to reach 2 certain goal is thereanything which animates my life and its value or does it give the impression of being an anorphic useless and colourless existence 1 3 does my ideal demand greater perfection and sacifics from are these denands total 1 personal fzrreaching and nob or are th2y vague partial orinere fleeting affairs i 4 have i one ideal on paper which i use as facade while another really determin my life would i be ashamed to reveal the true motive for my actions 5 is christ the ideal which embraces my whole life have i brought all other ideals i completely znder his command 6 have i grasped the fact that unless i live with christ as my ideal i will not be able to further the establishment of his kingdom and that i will be able to give others neither enthusiasm nor love nor true knowledge of him 7 does christs greatness arouse my enth usiasm am i inflamed with zeal by the idea of god giving himself to us do i fel his love as living influence in my lif do i love him personally as res pohse of his great lovc for 8 what are the consequences of my love for christ that i avoid that i joy fully fulfill bis will or that i strive to do great things for him and for his kingdom 9 as result do i live in an atmosphere of noble greatness of enthusiastic surren der and of generous plans or do i live instead in world of cowardice and fear of total surrenderin my daily life 10 could i deecibe my love for jesus as being deep or sentimental intense or erficial do show it in practical way is the fulfillment of my duty the most us ual form my lave for christ takes 11 do i at least try to deepen my motives for the lovc rrih i owe lliln 12 do i pray god to grant this love anowing it is the greatest gift he could give 13 does the thought of christ interest more than any other thought do i know christts criteria hre mine the same as his does his constqqt example help to see events and persons just he did do i think 1 can give what is ex pected of priest without harmonising my criteria completely with christs in my everyday life do i see the fathers hand in everything knowing that he arranges all things for our greater benefit my attitudes differ from christs views on on the world or on fame and wealth do 1 see myself as another christ most instinctively grasping how everything stands in relation to him 16 do i make christs interests my own do i believe that he cares about all my affairs and that all my criteria have an effect on the sacred heart of either pleas ing or displeasing it 17 does this have bearzng on all my deal ings with christ does it move to put my conduct on the same plane as his am i anxious to become like him is being as near as possible to him my greatest aim in life 18 is there any aspect of my conduct which differs lot from christs uhich facet of his personality most attracts my person a1 imitation his selfdenial obetlience purity love for his father or zeal for souls i do i believe in the transformation which love for christ can effect do i re gard love for christ as the key to success in my personal and apostolic life and as the thing which can make any existence worthwhile 20 could my tepidity and weakness be due fundamentally to cooling off of my love for christ are there elements of bitterness and re sentment in my religious life could this stem from the fact thatthe vows and rules without christs love stifle my effort on the other hand do i make the vows and rules lived with vigour and attention to detail demonstration of my enthusiasm for christ 1 i am i fully support of my most vile and get control the solution which face them but rat aware that if i losethe love for christ all the uncontrolled passions will f my heart do i realise that to the greatest problems does not lie in repressing her in directing my love to wards christ will 1 succeed in giving others b ing love for christ without too much di iculty does it cost great effort speak enthusiastically about him do i ply avoid this topic of conversation am i happy to have

motherfill with enthusiasm and win the graces i need to know and love her divine bet ter t i 52 love for the crucifix 1 am i accustomed to contemplate jesus on the cross is chis perhaps my usual medit ation on his person do i often meditate on the crucifix 2 do i try to understand and meditate on christs motives for dying on cross 1s the glory of the father the most important thing in my life j6st as it was for hrist ike him do i see as the most shame ful evil the giving of my life for others as the most subline ideal and the salvat ion of souls as the most precious prize i 3 is my soul touched by the sigt of god dying on the cross for love of do i re gretmy infidelities or do i think that christs sacrifice was inevitable or that there was reason for him to sacrifice himself for men 4 do i

doctrineby his deathrouse my enthusiasm 6 does the crucified christ stimulate my love when i contemplate him am i unable to resist his demands does this bring to adopt an attitude of sincerequrrender i i or is this mere sentimentality 7 do i think of christ as an examplebut lifeless one or do i see him as source of living graces for acquiring leg i ionary and priestly holiness i 8 does the sight of the crucifix move to love sacrifice do i often meditate on the gospel texts which strongly point out the necessity of selfdenial does this move to undertake constant selfcruc ifixion in the details of my duty in the i minute fulfillment of the voxs and in all the virtues within the specific framework of the legionary mystique 9 have i yet formed the habit of compar i ing the sufferings of christ on the cross i with the wide range of suffering in my i pr5estly life or do i think that christs death was something distant almost for eign to my daily life do the words of st paul in col 124 mean anything in my life in my own body i do what i can to make up all that has still to be undergone by christ for the sake of his body the church 10 am i insincere in carrying my cross rcn ducing it to mere externals or do i afply all my willpower to uprooting the ego from all my intentions thoughts and act ions 11 have 1 yet embraced my cross with cerity loyalty and generosity uniting my self to christs intention of glorifying the father and saving souls or do i do this because i have other choice 12 what is my attitude during mass have i grasped the fact that i cannot enter the kingdom of heaven without trials and suff erings 13 am i content to have nothing more than my crucifix do i take pride in it as st paul did 14 do i trust in christ do i feel suprem ely confident master of myself when christ is with 15 therefore can i say that i live in ion with him do i try to imitate im by offering myself to the father with the same spirit as he did do i always see the legionary virtues as exemplified in christs life 16 is the cross the climax of my life as it was the climax of christs 7 53 jza of the cross 1 how do i do the way of the cross do i regard it as just another item on the pro gramme as simple pious practise or something without meaning 2 do i try to do all in my power to win the graces connected with it 3 do i consider it as the sum and subst ance of all the virtues of christ do i think of it as an appreciable means of san ctification inasmuch as i receive the graces he won for in the very mysteries i am contemplating 4 while thinking over these sorrowful ha2 penings am i aware only of thc external aspects do i confine myself to sentiment a1 ideas or do i try to penetrate christs intimate and internal sufferings his feel ings and his attitudes 5 do i lovingly and reverently contemplate the moment of climax towards which the tire life of one who was fully god was dir ected do i do so with tender love like someone who remembers the crowning deed of his leader am i filled with love and faith 7 i 6 am i constantly aware during the way of i the cross that all this has been done for i my sake do i believe that it was i who l i treated christ like this does this thought prompt to make up for the wrong i have done him 7 do i foster bitter hatred towards which reduced christ to suei ctate i4 i 8 when praying the way of the cross do i 3ear in mind my holy mother the mother of jesus do i place myself under her protect ion 1 do i often think of thefourth vowhave i considered carefully what it implies and demands am i disposed to some day take this supreme step in my consecration to god 2 do i therefore prepare for it by means of sincere surrenderdo i study myfaults at their deepest roots do i examine nly affections and criteria do i study my vir tucs their origin reality and practi cal expression 3 do i foster complete lack of selfin terest as reaards my life of piety my search for god and all my undertakings 4 do i practicye true purity of intention as regards my personal formation and its external expression am i at least sincere in my fight to reduce my aim in life to the sole reality of god when the day comes to pronounce this vow will i be assured that i did all i could about this aspect or do i allow habits which are cidedly egoistic to go on developing do i condone habits which foster ambition in conscious way 5 in practise am i completely at the dis posal of my superiors do i rebel if they oppose my plans 6 do i try to obey at least by submitt ing my mind and will to authority do i reach the stage of doing so joyfully do i act in all situations with generos ity and selfassurance which would be worthy of personal servant of christ himself 7 have i formed the habit of being faith ful in the fulfillment of my duty up to 2 heroic degree 8 does my life yet reflect the qualities of christ do i think and evaluate on the lines laid down in the gospel do i give in to my fallen nature to naturalism to pride and to the world 9 is my life typified by constant eff ort to acquire the elbments of christs life or do i despair of ever imitating him fully 10 as far as i am concerned is christ yet everything my love my ideal and my corn panion would it matter little to to lose everything if i could possess him alone 11 have x full experimental knowledge cf his total love for 12 do i love whatever christ loves with the same love as his 13 do i offer my whole consccrated life as 1 an act of reparation to thc sacred cart do i live the reality of gods inner pres ence possessing him and being possessed i by him is my life in full harmony with k this reality 55 human formatm 1 do i care about my human formation am i convinced that i must be man before bekoming legionary 2 do i strive to form my intelligence and give order to it do i have some basic principles to which i subordinate the rest and are these principles always the same do i think before acting doi avail of all the means the legion provides for my better formation studies magazines books travel etc 3 are my ideas correct do i work to form my judgement am i prudent 30 trly to form an integral picture of thirgs 4 have i formed my will is it firm and solid or rather at the mercy of my sent iments do i apply it to the changing states of temperment and mind i experience am i lazy inconstant or slovenly j does my firmness of will take to the point of being cold with others 6 can i master my negative tendencies do 7 can i control my curiosity 1 8 which is usually the dominant note in l my daily life anger haughtiness impat ience goodness simplicity calmness hele fulness stability spitefulness or re moteness 9 do i have sense of responsibility do i live in thoughtful atmosphere or with levity routine lack of effort or higher preoccupations on the contrary does this sense of responsibility help to win out in evey aspect am i always in different to everything outside the will of god dissatisfied with my achievements and prepared to keep on working 10 do i know how to behave when dealing with others do i know how to listen am i attentive delicate natural when deal ing with others difficult for am i sociable distrustful or am i discreet anx amiable or mean and faultfinding 11 do i consider my human formatton as an end or as means 12 have my humanity studies produced their logical fruits in my life or have i gone through them as just another stage of my formation without giving them any special importance 56 formatlon of the will i 1 because i am convinced of its necessity do i work toform my will is my eff0rta sustained one or is it only stimulated by the influence of spiritual direction 1 do i try to fool myself by looking for exceptions from the inescapable necessity of this formation do i look on my will coupled with the grace of god as the axis of my sanctific ation in its role of determining the merit or demerit of my actions do i try to go ahead in the spiritual life without this quality of willpower have i never realised that man without an ideal is apoor man and that an ideal without formation of the will is an empty dream have i realised that without form ation of the will even my eternal salvat ion is in danger is the practical desire of identifying myself with jesus christ my key motive in the formation of my will why do i form my character from purely natural desire to be manly or to prepare the grouncl for the holy spirit to carry out his work in 6 am i governed by reason and will or by my lower faculties 7 do i apply my will first and foremost to always obeying god can i say therefore that i have enough strength of will to av oid do i possess the necessary selfr dominion to forestall and moderate the u surges of passions am i also able to dominate my affections and sentiments 8 in order to form my will correctly do i try to present my understanding with clear profollnd and wellfounded ideas which can afterwards serve to stimulate and guide my work 9 do i pray to god for grace to forn my wil1or am i still afaid because of my weakness and my lack character could this second attitude perhaps be trap set by my great sensuality andlove of comfort 10 in moments when my will is about to succumb to temptation does it eccourage to think how christ was faithful up to death on cross 11 do i apply any practical means to the formation of my will do i cultivate the sense of responsibility in my duty as the first of these do i therefore accomplish my duty to the last detail even when it calls for abnegation do i use the small but valuable means of forming my wil1like keeping dlary or writing ftjuminasvor do i scorn them as being only for beginners do i regard the development of good manners distinction and politeness as one of the best means to this end do i also value perfect tidiness and distinction in my cell or does my superior often have to call my attention whenever he enters it are diligence promptitude and punctuality among the other means which i use to help form my will 12 ant i systematically reflective or do i allow myself to be carried away by my first impulse or hy routine passion or whim am i accustomed to asking myself the

point of failing in my duty am i so influenced by bad example that i use it as an excuse not to fulfill my obligations 4 cnthe contrary is my willpower so strong that it overcomes my fear and hesi tation or the atmosphere good or bad which surrounds 15 am i extremely sensitive to failure does fear of it make draw back in the face of duty or confident in graze do i tackle it without hesitation 16 do i usually take refuge behind the cow ardly attitude of i would like to of when i see it is the will of god do i translate everything i decide on into act ion 17 do i put my ieblutions into practise with spirit of responsibility or are these resolutions merely the fruit of sentimentality do some grave reasons always crop up to prevent fom fulfill ing them do i make grave reason of even the smallest thing 18 is the formation of my will sincerely based on selfdenial is this selfdenial applied mainly to small costly things 57 formation of the passions 1 is my work governed solely by my temer ment or passions do i lack the loftier guidance of faith and reason 2 can i direct my passions along the path of duty do i always set about doing gods will wholeheartedly 3 do 1 use my

sufficient selfknowledge to maintarin constant progress in my efforts for spiritual perfection 5 am i anxious to eradicate any really bad aspect of my temperment or do i allow it to festerthrough lack

gratitude seeing it as one of the most beautiful of christian or legionary virtues i i r 63 simplicity 1 at first glance can i say that i am simple if not is this due to my temper ment or is it

i see double meaning in everything which is said to do i work hard to correct this tendegcy 13 what dttitude do i take during exam ination of conscience do i make effort to get to know ysclf is this because of lack of selfdenial in making the effort to concentrate and think over the deepest reasons behind my actions is it from lack of humility because i dont want to get discouraged by coming face to face with my own failings 14 what are the usual ends i have in mind whilt working the kingdom tthe good of souls do i also think of devel oping my own personalityof showing off of pleasing others or of passing the time pleasantly have i the one idea of staying out of danger and avoiding any kind of complications 64 silence 1 has silence any meaning for do i see in it nothing more than an

do so all the same do i make special cff ort during evening convcrsationeven when speaking of other subjectsis there always certain calm and assurance in my words which draws the conversation towards

having tried to please god on the certain triumph whicl christ offers or on the fact that from now on ill be saving souls am i 4 happy simply because i have problems because of the progress of my human ambit ions to succeed in life using the meane the legion provides or because of the superficial view i have of my life and my potential 7 3 personal and genuine or superficial and what is my

states of inner confusion i was passing through was this attitude caused by my wish to contest everything without knowinq the facts or more sinply by my lack of humility 4 am i convinced that i must foster har mony within the legion in every possible way have i realised what great diction it is if my conduct goes against the spirit of solidarity which should typ ify every legionary 5 do i share the same sentiments as my brothers do our ways of thinking and work 1 i ipg our criteria and our norms of conluct coincide do we judge things and events r in the same way b 6 on the contrarydo my opinions tend to differ lot from those of others do i get rea1 pleasure from expressing views which are opposed to the ones others hold why is this because i like annoying others because i am convinced iam right or because in this way i emphasise my own personality which gives great satis fact ion 7 have i ever had the nerve to put for ward my own opinions in opposition to the f opinions of people in authority has this i happened with my superiors r 8 has it ever occured to that going i 1 l against the general opinion of others could be mistake on my part do i even reject the opinions of those who speak from personal experience 9 am i always criticising everything and everybody is this because i find it is the only way i can win attention 10 have i ever made the effort to see r l i things from the other peoples point of view i 11 do i believe that being on peaceful and j and harmonious terms with my brothers is more important than trying to sway theill opinion on some trivial pointam i blind ed to this line of reasoning by anger or strong feeling do i desire and pray for the grace of always being in agreement with everyone else 12 do i meditate enough on the example christ left us of living in the okscurity of azaheth for thirty years as poor man among poor and humble peoplewithout doing anything out of the ordinary though he could do all things i things vague and impractical 5 would i father die than commit do i carefully avoid deliberate venial 1 have i sensitive conscience do i per form my exercises of piety with lot of 1 care 6 do i keep strict control of my feel ings do i dismiss dangerous daydreams and memories from my imagination 7 does the fearqf god not only ppevent from offending himbut also encourage to please him in everything i do 84 time of crisis 1 90 i often feel sad and gloomy with neither the will nor the energy to do any thing am i often worried and distressed p lacking the strength to do good 2 do i see these difficulx times as some thing normal in everyone s lifedo i thanr god for giving the chance of suffering i something for his sakethus making up for my past sins and gaining some merit r 3 does this supernatural outlook always i help to put up with trials and temptat ions or does trouble plunge into des pair do i think this is punishment ok godthai he has abandoned and rejected or on the contrarydo i realise that his love is never closer to than at these moments 4 do i think that the cross i have to f crry is heavier than anyone elses and j that i do not deserve to suffer so much 5 do i ask god for the grace to be very strong do i keep on calmly doing my duty although i feel like giving updo 1offer my sufferings and trials along withonistls for the sake of the churchthe legion and the salvation of souls 6 do i

humble since they bring homethe fact of how little i can do on my own 7 do i allow my feelings and imagination to play on the problem and increase it ot i of all proportion ii i 8 do i turn to human companionship to find relief in my suffering i 9 what is the usual reason for my trials and tribulations could i say that many have their beginnings in my negative att itude towards work or selfdenial 85 integration 1 can i say that i have precise idea of the meaning of integrationiin the light of the doctrine set forth in the letter of unity and in chapter nine of the constit utions do i realise its urgent necessity both in the life of the legion and in my own what does integration mean to am i satisfied merely to live in the legion without being too much out of tune do i accept the legions spirit bloc with out any further concern or havl ia broat er vision of integration equating it to living and loving our spirit in all cir cumstances and thus becoming holy 3 am i convinced that integration is the law which moulds the bodily life of the legion without which it would fall victim to anarchy egoism and my own personal selfishness do i see that without it the legion will fail to carry out the apostclic mission which god has given her 4 do i really believe that integration is avita1 demand made by ny legionary vocat ion the only way i can do gods uill do i consider it as the only way of grafting like living stone onto the legionary body 5 do i pray for the grace of integration kowing that it comes not from any human reasoning but frorn the pure love ofchpist and his kingdom 6 am i yet completely integrated into the legion are even the deepestmost decisive elements of my personality included in this integration are my mind and soul at tuned to the legions spirit and stiue7 as far as i am concerneddoes this amount to being filled by the holiness proper to it and drawn on by the ideal of this holi ness in my daytoday life i 7 do i see the need for integrating my criteria if i am to grasp the legions cri teria and make them my ownam i aware that the most dangerous enemies of integration are selfimportance mental profligacy gregarianism and infantile development of criteria which amounts to having crit 0 eria at all can i appreciate the gravt need for integration when confrontedbythe hostile atmosphere which surrounds i 8 do i realise that failure to renounc j 1 my own opinions and preferences means re renouncing the criteria of the legion am 1 convinced that docility in this field is way of building up my authentic christ ian personality

ap ostolate what do i do when icomeon some thing i find difficult to accept do i foget about it and carry on am i crit ical and sceptical about itldo i hold on to my own criteri n do i give in becaus i have option do i do so unwillingly can i open my heart ot my superior and discuss the matter sincerely and simply seeking to accept the solution he offers and to welcome it as my own do i try to get detailed knowledge of the spirit of the legiondo i respect venerate and practice all the ho1y rules with the greatest possible precision as regards my spiritual formationdo i nour ish it systematically with the eiong spirit and doctrine or do i leave them aside to dr1 from other sources 11 what prtveiltr from integrating my criteria stallowness of mind vanity conceit or pride or craze for novelty am i hindered by criteria which i had in the past and have never renounced are my emotions also at one with the legion so that love for the legion and the kingdom is their focal pointare they centered on something merely romantic and sentimental does my 1ove spring from my faith in the legion and my belief in the mission i have within her framework have i integrated my affectionsloves preferences tastes etc being aware of the fact that my heart is inclined to hold onto them are they source of friction and annoyance in my life do i keep my periors informed of my progress 14 how do i interpret the rules aboutdeal ing with family friends and outsiders how do i apply them do they seem too demanding have i learned to love my fai ily in moderate way as befits relij ious do i accept any sacrifices which this involves am i convinced that the best way to love my family is to leave them and follow christ 15 in dealing with friends and strangers is it my sole aim to implant god in thei souls do i tell them about the legion so t that they can love and support itor do i i rather try to win their esteem for myself 16 are nationalities barrier as far as i 319 i am concerned have i

adapt myself to others with respect simplicity and naturality 17 what importance do i give to the inte gration of my personal likes and dis likes what target have i set have i integrated my taste in music art and study how do i interpret and apply the norms regarding the use of the comrnunicat ions media press films tv etc d i give their real value to the rubs gov erning mutual social behaviour or do they seem somewhat artificial do i feel healthy pride on being taken for leg ionary or do i feel ashamed and embarg assed 18 does charity clpsely unite with my superiors and brothers do i always deal with them in manly agreeable wayoram i always cold towards them do i exclude any one of them from my friendship be cause i happen to find him unlikeable do i try to be on specially intimate terms

of being priest or religious outside the legion 21 do i believe that with gods help and my own effort i can integrate myselfmore and more each day intg the legion in spite of what my feelings on the matter may be do i believe that it all depends on whether god asks this of or not i 86 faith and the present situation in the church t 1 what is my attitude when brought face to face with he present situation in the church as described in padres letter of december 25 1966 am i still ignorant about it am i indifferent or u2 concerned doss this alarm signal seem an exaggeratin since if its not all i i 4 3 l that bad on the other hand as catholic and legionaryam i deeply i cerned about the situation k i 2 do i feel obliged to form judgement on the actual situation in accord with papal and ecclesial doctrine rs part of my training as legionary what form does this judgement take 3 an attitude of serious rejection of the mistaken views being put forward in z the firld rf drprna and

my opinion what external channels tv films booksmagazinescontact with outsiders etc could facilitate the infil tration of criteria and attitudes typicai of overprogressive currents into the corn munity to which i belong do i think that ideas such as these have actually affected do i believe they are active in some of my brothers in the legion what are the signs or indications that these ideas have in5iltrated my mind or the minds of my brothers 5 when faced by the widespread phenomen on of legitimate authority being question ad do i maintain my baliaf in he ab solute necessity of discipline if any soc iety is to survive do 1 apply this prin ciple to the church do i believe that the best way i can show my love for the ion is to be submissive to its guiding prin ciples and to obey the rulings made by my superiors 6 have i come under the influence of the systematic negative criticism of the church herpersonagesinstitutions and structures which is rife today has it lessened the happiness i derive from being catholic religiousa legionary priest is my cathnlic faith not as secure ae such fixed criterion should be even though this insecurity may only bea vague feeling i have do i by any chance use the excuseo that things in general are going badly to foster hesitant attitude towards giving myself fully to my vocation does the bad example of those who foz sake the priesthood for the world or of those who take advantage of excessive free_ dom to do as they please while training for the priesthood rouse my envy and make uneasy about the discipline we have in the legion when certain regrettable events are brught to my notice and when hear ala c rming news about the small numbers of christians in godless worldthe decrease in the number of conversions to catholic ism and the restriction and rejection of god both his word and his redemptionlam i tempted to think that perhaps we are wi nessing the beginning of the deaththr9es of christianity do i adopt the opinion that thr only way this can be averted suc cessfully is for the church to becomewse ularised that is to revert to merely human plane on both doctrinal and organ isational levels 8 do i realise that many nice sounding terms likd authenticity dialogue1 maturity aggiornamento sselfrealis at ion1 mature christianity cmot iona maturity etc are used today but that everyone in his turn interprets them as it suits him with the result that it is impossible tkat i should accept such ex pressdons at their face value without ez amining their content 9 do i believe that it is possible to ai peal to the second vatican council or its spirit to justify the fact of gdng beyond the limits set by the churchs authority in liturgiczl pastoral apostolic or ec umenical maters go i believe it

to is it an unchanging tuth or some thing which can be believed one day and disregarded the next because it longer satisfies public opinion 12 can i see the vicar of 2hrist as the guarantee of perseverance in faith and truth in the straight path of holiness and fidelity to christ and his church 3 13 do i criticise the popes attitude to 7 the present situation 6r do i accept it with comlete faith and submission 14 do i believe that at the present time of renewal tke legions progress is kee ing pace with the churchs 5 i think the legion is lagging behind if so in i pi what aspects is this opinion th product of my own thinking or is it something i have heard do i keep my superiors up to date on the discrepancies i notice in this aspect or do i keep my line of thought hidden 1 i 15 is the popes magisterium both ordin ary and extraordinary my incontestable guide towards life and truth i l r i 16 in the face of the present passion to criticise and change dogma and morals and in the face of the many new and err oneous theories which are put forwarddo i try to defend myself in an infantile way creating through lack of knowledge of the enemy fantastic monstrous and horrifying image of him do i think this is good defence do i rather try to face up to these departures from the cri teria of thc gospel and the church by grrunding rfiyself solidly in the churchs truth the authorised kagisterium thus acquainting myself little by littleusing extreme caution and depending on my sup eriors with the enemys point of view in viewing the situation which is threatening the church have i
