william knight and christopher bolkcom foreign affairs defense and trade division strategic airlift modernization analysis of c5 modernization and c17 acquisition issues summary strategic airlift has played pivotal role in us national security strategy since world war ii since then strategic airlift has provided timely worldwide reach for both combat and humanitarian relief operations the department of defense dod currently operates mix of c5 and c17 aircraft c5s were built in two production batches designated the c5a and c5b respectively total of 52 c5s are scheduled to undergo two major modification programs after which they will be redesignated c5m super galaxies the remaining 59 c5s will major avionics upgrade c17s are currently in production but the c17 production line is scheduled to close unless additional orders are placed in an anticipated fy2008 supplemental appropriations bill major issue currently before congress is how big should the strategic airlift fleet be there is consensus among policy makers that the dod must maintain robust and effective strategic airlift fleet currently the most pressing issue is whether congress should appropriate money for the purchase of more c17s in the fy2008 emergency supplemental bill and if so for how many third potential issue is the optimal mix of c5s and c 17s that congress should fund in fy2009 authorization and appropriation bills and in the out years at least five options have been proposed for c5 modernization and c17 procurement including the following buy additional c17s and pursue modernization of all c5s halt c17 production but modernize the current c5 fleet maintain the c5 fleet but forego modernization on all or part of the c5 fleet while replacing the capability gap with c17s replace all c5amodels with new c17s replace 30 c5s with 30 c17s most agree the strategic airlift fleet should consist of mix of c17s and modified c5s independent studies have analyzed policy options by attempting to measure longterm costs associated with various alternatives of c5 modernization with c17 acquisition however there remains disagreement over how many aircraft are required and of what type policy considerations include costs budget constraints industrial base risk aircraft performance considerations and optimal fleet mix in addition to the aforementioned options dod could increase use of commercial aircraft encourage foreign or civilian sales of the c17 bolster reliance on prepositioning of equipment leverage potential kcx airlift capability pursue airships or hybrid airships or

capabilities 38 strategic airlift modernization analysis of c5 modernization and c17 acquisition issues introduction the c5 galaxy and c17 globemaster iii form the core of dods strategic airlift capability both posses intercontinental range and the ability to transport outsized1 and oversized cargo2 the c5 is the air forces largest strategic airlift aircraft and can carry some loads too large for any other dod airlifter in addition to its strategic airlift capabilities the c17 can perform the tactical airlift mission which the c5 cannot the air forces current plan is to extensively modernize total of 52 c5s partially modernize 59 c5s and end c17 production this represents departure from prior dod plans that called for fully modernizing the air forces entire c5 fleet and was part of changes announced when dod recertified one of the c5s two major modification programs following high program costs growth3 the administration did not request c17s in either its fy2008 or fy2009 budget requests further the administrations fy2009 budget request did not contain funding to close the c17 production line4 however the air forces fy2009 unfunded priority list contained request for 15 additional c17s5 currently the most pressing issue is whether congress should appropriate money for the purchase of more c17s in the fy2008 emergency supplemental bill 1 outsized cargo exceeds the dimensions of oversized cargo and requires the use of c5 or c17 aircraft or surface transportation joint publication 102 dod dictionary of military and associated terms amended through october 17 2007

potential issue is the optimal mix of c5s and c 17s that congress should fund in fy2009 authorization and appropriation bills and in the out years decisions made this year regarding force structure of the air forces strategic airlift fleet could significantly affect future us military capabilities air force funding requirements and the aerospace industrial base background central tenet of us national military strategy strategic airlift is an essential capability enabling the military power projection anywhere around the world strategic airlift has proven critical in the success of global combat and humanitarian relief operations an alternative transportation mode sealift is capable of deploying larger quantities of troops and cargo when compared with airlift but it is slower and sometimes constrained by lack of seaports near potential contingency operations the capability that strategic airlift provides is the ability to deliver forces equipment and supplies with the greatest speed to virtually any place on the globe despite its importance dods strategic airlift system is under stress having supported continuous contingency operations over the last 17 years at the same time the united states has reduced its cold war infrastructure by closing twothirds of its forward bases thus us forces are now required to deploy more frequently and over greater distances for example even before the 911 terrorist attacks and resulting conflicts the air force estimated that it was deploying four times more frequently than when it enjoyed the larger cold war infrastructure6 the ongoing war against terrorism has placed further demands on the strategic airlift system combat operations the massive military buildup prior to the 1991 gulf war highlighted the value of strategic airlift when us aircraft moved over 500000 troops and 543548 tons of cargo into the persian gulf region7 after desert storm strategic airlift provided 12 years of continuous support to coalition forces enforcing the northern and southern nofly zones over iraq since 1995 strategic airlift has also supported us and nato operations in the balkans strategic airlift plays key role in combat operations in the middle east on typical day c5s bring cargo and troops from the united states to staging bases in europe central asia and the middle east while c17s fly directly to forward operating bases in iraq and afghanistan since september 2001 over 260000 airlift missions have delivered over 33 million passengers and 17 billion short tons of cargo to iraq and afghanistan8 few nations possess the organic airlift capability 6 maj gen howie chandler basic air force structure and expeditionary aerospace force operations briefing to congressional air force caucus march 23 2001

capability is often requisite to enabling coalition partners to join us in operations as part of operation enduring freedom in afghanistan nearly 170 c5 and c 17 cargo planes were initially dispatched to create an air bridge to this distant landlocked nation9 although distance was clearly challenge securing permission for overflight and sourcing infrastructure appears to have been even more burdensome most afghan airfields from which c17s operated were short 3500 feet and strewn with debris and potholes some airfields were nothing more than packed dirt and c5s cannot operate from these types of primitive airfields10 two events from the global war on terrorism the 2003 brigade airdrop and medical evacuation missions reflect the evolving capabilities of strategic airlift brigade airdrop prior to operation iraqi freedom us commanders expressed desire to open northern front during the invasion of iraq after the turkish government denied the united states rights to stage the land invasion from turkey air force c17s executed much publicized airdrop of the 173rd airborne brigade into northern iraq on march 26 200311 medical evacuation dod retired its dedicated aeromedical evacuation fleet in 2003 switching to concept where nearly every air mobility aircraft is capable of performing this timecritical mission strategic airlift platforms are now routinely tasked in system to perform patient movements as result the time required to return wounded service member from the battlefield is now approximately 72 hours less than half that required for desert storm this is contributing to survival rates for casualties in afghanistan and iraq now exceeding 90 compared with 75 during desert storm12 humanitarian relief operations strategic airlift has proven its value many times since world war ii by delivering humanitarian relief during 15month stretch in 1948 and 1949 american and british airmen executed some 277000 airlift sorties keeping berlin from being cut off

national guard and reserve components c5s were built in two production batches and aside from age both models are interchangeable operationally the first production aircraft were designated amodels while later aircraft were designated as bmodels two models were later modified to carry outsize cargo such as nasa rocket components and were redesignated cmodels the entire acmodel fleet received new

management requirements allowing c5s to fly in global airspace without restrictions operational testing of amp was completed in 2006 and the last of the 111 c5s planned for upgrade is scheduled to be complete by 2015 as of september 2007 30 c5s had completed amp modification which establishes the digital baseline for followon components to be installed under rerp18 reliability enhancement reengining program rerp rerp is reportedly 77 billion19 comprehensive modernization plan with more than 70 initiatives to upgrade major c5 systems20 the goal of rerp is to improve availability reliability and maintainability of portion of the c5 fleet the centerpiece of rerp is replacing c5 engines with modern general electric cf6 engines air force officials expect the c5m c5s modernized through both amp and rerp to bolster the strategic airlift capability by making more of the c5 fleet available on daily basis for example c5 missioncapable rates are expected to improve from the low 50 range today to at least 76 in the future in addition the c5m is expected to possess operational improvements that will require 30 less takeoff distance while enabling the super galaxy to reach cruise altitude 58 faster that current c5s finally the c5m is anticipated to be more environmentally friendly by creating less noise and fewer carbon emissions21 currently three c5s have been modified

changes in program costs in february 2008 dod announced changes for the c5 rerp rerp cost growth in 2007 air force officials began to express concern about anticipated significant c5 rerp cost growth as late as december 2006 the sar for the c5 rerp showed average procurement unit cost growth of 29 over the current acquisition program baseline and 16 over the original baseline this rate of cost growth is significantly lower than 15 and 30 cost growth respectively required to trigger nunnmccurdy breech notification23 in september 2007 the air force declared c5 rerp had breached nunnmccurdy thresholds the september 2007 sar followed showing cost increase of approximately 6 billion and estimating rerp will now cost total of 175 billion24 unfortunately the air force and lockheed martin were far apart on cost estimates for c5 rerp lockheed martin has submitted combination firmfixed price ffpnottoexceed nte contract offer for approximately 116 billion dollars25 further many contributing factors to rerp cost growth reported in the sar appeared to be onetime management problems that may not affect future costs for example permanent waiver to the berry amendment26 would allow the air force to proceed with purchase of new general electric engines that are built in part with imported specialty metals27 the impact of other factors affecting cost growth has proven more difficult to reconcile in testimony before senate subcommittee lockheed martin and the air force explained their perspectives on cost growth ms payton assistant secretary of the air force for acquisition testified that the c5s amp upgrade prerequisite the rerp has taken longer than anticipated because the air force has encountered unexpected repairs on its aging c5s during the modification process in addition 22 continued international security subcommittee hearing september 27 2007 p 4 23 the nunnmccurdy amendment was designed to curtail cost growth in defense procurement programs when program exceeds the nunnmccurdy thresholds for cost growth the service secretary must notify congress and the secretary of defense must 1 either cancel the program or certify that it remains essential

expressed concern that the air force could not commit to longterm schedule that might form the basis of ffp contract noting uncertainty with legacy maintenance issues and hardtopredict wartime requirements under ffp contracts some changes in quantity could serve to reopen contract negotiations leading to increased program costs the air force believes this risk alone could drive engine costs up by as much as 10 million per airplane in future years in addition the air force believes that lockheed martin cost estimates for handson or touch labor are overly optimistic further the air forces cost position accounts for anticipated legacy aircraft repairs that are likely to be discovered during rerp production28 while testifying larry mcquien vice president of business ventures for lockheed martin aeronautics acknowledged lockheed martins cost proposal did not include costs for training spares support equipment over and above aircraft maintenance and program management29 however he stated confidence in estimates for engine costs and cited production changes that would eliminate about 19600 hours in touch labor30 lockheed martin argues that if its cost estimates are proven correct the rerp program will grow at rates below the nunnmccurdy threshold notification requirement31 table 2 provides lockheed martins estimates of various production schedules table 2 rerp

from prior dod plans that called for fully modernizing the air forces entire c5 fleet34 legislative retirement restrictions the fy2004 defense authorization act pl 108136 sec 132 prohibited the retirement of c5a aircraft until the effectiveness of the c5a amp and rerp efforts has been determined through testing and evaluation and reported to congress as such the air force modified one c5a through both amp and rerp and is currently conducting operational testing on the aircraft bad actors during fy2008 budget deliberations air force leaders frequently requested permission to retire some c5a aircraft independent of flight test results on c5a rerp and amp to support their request former secretary of the air force michael w wynne and former air force chief of staff general t michael buzz moseley testified that some subset of the c5a fleet is composed of bad actors aircraft that are hard broke and prime candidates for retirement gen moseley in perfect world we would like to be able to manage that inventory and divest ourselves of the badacting tail numbers and some of them are bad actors theyre broke lot of the c5as have low flight hours on them because theyre broke and you cant fly them if i could line up the best b model or the best model at the head of line and go to the back end of the line and begin to kill off the bad actors and replace them with something new i would be very happy that doesnt mean all of them it doesnt mean that we class or blockretire airplanes it just means let us get at the tail numbers that are bad actors35 sec wynne theres some that are really bad actors and i think if you gave us the right to manage the fleet you would find that we would manage it in way that would actually retain the best mission profiles36 32 hrept 110477 december

congressional transcript federal news service inc 36 ibid crs9 sec wynne i can tell you sir that right now some worry about the entirety of the c5 fleet there are two things we should know about this first is that we dont we want to line up worst to best and we think there are between 20 25 and 30 of bad actors that we would like to retire37 some in congress appeared supportive of secretary wynnes and general moseleys bad actor testimony and requested the air force provide list of these hard broke aircraft presumably to make judgement on whether these aircraft should indeed be retired early38 others were skeptical concerned that congress had not received factual data on the health and performance of the c5a fleet during september 2007 senate hearing both ms sue payton assistant secretary of the air force for acquisition and general norton schwartz commander of us transportation command stated that they were unaware of specific bad actor c5 aircraft39 further an examination of c5 reliability and maintainability statistics for the past three fiscal years did not identify any obvious subset of the c5 fleet that stands out as notably bad actors reliability and availability measures studied included the amount of time spent in depot or otherwise unavailable because of maintenance mission capable rate and mission departure reliability graphic representation of data and analysis of the c5 fleet can be found in appendix d some might argue all c5as could be considered bad actors while the c5a may have many hours of life remaining it is an older aircraft than the c17 however the air forces fleet viability board found the c5a fleet with appropriate investments has at least 25 years of life remaining40 in addition the defense science board and the institute for defense analysis have also endorsed the viability of the c5a fleet further c5a performance and reliability are not uniformly inferior to the c5b over the past three years for example the c5a fleet has averaged marginally higher mission departure reliability rate 831 than the c5b fleet 813 this data may lead one to conclude that c5a mission capable rates lag behind those of the c5b because of

from flight and 12 were loadrestricted or flight profilerestricted because of variety of maintenance or repair issues some suggest these 14 aircraft are appropriate candidates for early retirement in contrast others cite that it is estimated to cost only 267 million to repair all 14 aircraft in addition 8 of the 14 restricted aircraft required routine modifications to address humanerror damage incurred during routine maintenance arguably these problems are minor and easily addressed and do not warrant early retirement while this counterargument appears sound it also speaks to the value of conducting robust analysis of an aircrafts maintenance and performance history and projected future costs and challenges singlepoint snapshot of an aircrafts condition can be an incomplete and misleading description of its health and by itself poor basis for retirement decisions c17 globemaster iii41 made by boeing the c17 is dods most modern strategic airlifter c17 specifications and basing are located in appendix c because it can use short and unfinished runways and has high maneuverability on the ground the c17 can operate in environments traditionally confined to smaller airlifters thus c17s can often deliver payloads from the united states directly to forward bases near the battle like c5s c17s can carry outsize and oversize cargo such as helicopters and missile launchers current dod plans call for the acquisition of 190 c17s the administration did not request additional c17s in either its fy2008 or fy2009 budget requests further the administrations fy2009 budget request did not contain funding to close the c17 production line42 however the air forces fy2009 unfunded priority list contained request for 39 billion to fund 15 additional c17s43 the c17 is also capable of performing tactical airlift missions during operation allied force the kosovo campaign in 1999 12 c17s were tasked to fly intratheater airlift missions moving 24 apache helicopters 36 abrams tanks and 58 bradley fighting vehicles from bases within europe to tirana albania44 likewise the c17 has been used extensively in tactical role in both afghanistan and iraq in the summer of 2006 the air force forwarddeployed two squadrons of c17s in addition to connecting mobility hubs in southwest asia and europe these two squadrons have been used extensively in both afghanistan and

transition to the tactical airlift role along side c130s to perform this mission45 the reported effect of increased tactical airlift has been to relieve nearly 3500 vehicles and 9000 convoy operators per month from having to travel treacherous iraqi and afghan roads46 precision airdrop enabling coalition ground forces operating in the rugged mountains of afghanistan c17s are using the joint precision airdrop system jpads to airdrop supplies with gpsguided steerable parachutes jpads allows the resupply of field units with high degree of accuracy helping ground forces receive supplies while avoiding the exposure of larger traditional drop zones also airdrops can be flown from high altitude increasing safety margins to airlift aircraft47 strategic airlift requirements strategic airlift requirements are ultimately derived from the presidents overall national security strategy based on the presidents strategy dod periodically studies the global threat environment and seeks to

strategic airlift dod examines the status of its fleet and quantifies future airlift requirements to judge whether airlift modernization programs are sufficient to support dod force structure and the presidents strategy in june 2004 dod began its first post 911 review of transportation requirements the most recent mobility capability study mcs was completed in december 2005 and briefed to congress in february 2006 currently two studies are underway that are expected to quantify strategic airlift requirements the institute of defense analyses is conducting congressionally mandated study on the size and mix of dods air mobility fleet that is due to congress in january 2009 dod is conducting mobility capabilities and requirements study that is expected to be completed by may 2009 mobility capability study mcs the current analytical basis for dods strategic airlift requirements is the mcs of 2005 the unclassified executive summary of the mcs notes that unlike past mobility studies the mcs did not recommend an airlift requirement expressed in milliontonmiles per day mtmd instead the mcs assessed the capabilities of the current and projected force by providing range of potential

airlift force structure at the bottom of the range necessary to meet nms requirements with acceptable risk49 subsequently the 2006 qdr stated dod goal of maintaining 292 strategic airlifters50 to

airlift requirements in terms of milliontonmiles per day in response to this requirement dod delivered classified report to the congressional defense committees on february 27 2007 the mcs findings surprised observers many expected the study to project growth in airlift needs perhaps requirement closer to 60 mtmd from the previous estimate the mobility study immediately prior to the mcs the mobility requirements study 2005 mrs05 completed in 2000 set airlift requirements at 545 mtmd51 others speculated the mcs would not increase the 545 mtmd requirement because planners knew that dod could not afford to purchase enough aircraft to provide additional airlift52 they imply the mcs was not an unbiased study of requirements but compromise between what is needed and what can likely be afforded within current budget constraints analysts also criticized the mcs for its methodology and focus in september 2005 the government accountability office gao documented number of shortcomings in methodology for the ongoing mcs53 more detailed gao criticism followed in september 2006 after the final mcs was released54 others criticized the study for not adequately addressing dod

requirements is particularly germane because the c17 can be used in both the strategic and intratheater roles as result some believe dod requires more c17s to meet tactical requirements even if strategic airlift requirements can be met with dods current programs of record in light of the criticism some have called for dod or an independent agency to conduct another mobility study to rectify the mcss perceived shortcomings in september 2006 it was reported that the air forces air mobility command was again studying dod airlift needs some may interpret the air forces initiation of another airlift study so soon after the completion of the mcs as tacit acknowledgment of flaws in the mcs and an attempt to ameliorate them56 dods ongoing study the mobility capability and requirements study mcrs is expected to be completed by may 200957 some have criticized the timing of the completion of the mcrs for being late to need to inform nearterm force structure decisions currently being debated by congress changes since mcs advocates of larger strategic airlift force structure often point contextual changes that were not considered by the mcs those that hold this view often point to four

airlift aircraft to support them60 in contrast the placement of additional ground forces into support units of current combat maneuver units would require less additional airlift as the number of maneuver units available for deployment would more closely parallel the force structure studied in the mcs further how new ground forces are intended to be employed could also potentially impact strategic airlift requirements for example if additional forces are intended to increase the number of maneuver units for potential future ground force operational surges then additional strategic airlift may be necessary to adequately support those forces however scenario where additional ground force end strength is used to reduce operational tempo of both the army and marine corps would be less likely to change overall strategic airlift requirements army transformation as yet unclear is the impact that the army transformation will have on future requirements key facet of the army plan is the brigade combat team bct61 bcts and future forces are being designed to be lighter and more easily air transportable therefore the army set goal of obtaining the capability to deploy bct anywhere in the world in 96 hours after liftoff division on the ground in 120 hours and five divisions in theater in 30 days62 although this organizational initiative may have merit it is not clear that the current strategic airlift fleet will be able to meet these deployability targets for example typical stryker bct consists of approximately 3500 soldiers 327 stryker vehicles 600 wheeled vehicles field and air defense artillery and engineering equipment when considering the feasability of army plans june 2003 gao study found that at present it would take from five to 14 days depending on brigade location and destination and require over one third of the air forces c17 and c5 transport aircraft fleet to deploy one stryker brigade by air63 some might argue this illustrates shortfall in strategic airlift capability others may point to pre positioning and fast sealift as better methods to accelerate bct deployment timelines further some may propose change in the composition of ground maneuver units to make them more deployable future airlift requirements may also be affected by the armys future combat system fcs 2007 defense science board dsb report cautioned increasing

concept if accepted would almost certainly require more strategic airlift aircraft66 c5 modernization both the mcs and qdr called for fully modernizing the entire c5 fleet however cost growth identified in 2007 led to changes in dods modernization plans for the c5 fleet the air forces current plan is to modernize all c5s through the avionics modernization program and total of 52 c5s with

previous 111aircraft program reached 175 billion68 as result some may question whether the current program of record for 190 c17s an increase of 10 aircraft over force structure recommend in the most recent mcs and qdr is sufficient to compensate for capability lost by forgoing the rerp on 59 c5as69 africa command africom some have suggested that the emergence of africom will lead to the need for

program reduced and recertified by dod general schwartz reiterated that he believes dod needs fleet of 111 c5s and 205 c17s73 it may be difficult for congress to evaluate dods airlift recapitalization

to transport new army equipment such as the future combat system and leveraging new capabilities such as the anticipated airlift capability of future air force air refueling aircraft further the study is expected to to analyze whether the estimated cost of c5 rerp makes rerpmodified c5 fleets life cycle costs higher when compared with alternative fleets with fewer c5ms and more c17s this study is

comparisons for example it is estimated 10 c17s procured via annual congressional earmark cost approximately 20 million more per aircraft than c17s procured via multiyear contracts78 consequently some

study the air forces decision to modernize all c5 aircraft was informed by march 2000 institute of defense analysis ida study on the cost and reliability implications of various c17 and c5 force structure options the idea of modernizing the c5 to achieve improved availability gained support in 1996 when the air force asked lockheed martin to submit proposals to bring c5 performance inline with other air mobility assets in 1997 ida validated that the concepts proposed by lockheed martin could be cost effective if nearterm dollars were available to fund the modernization program79 ida noted that earlier studies indicated upgrading the c5 may be costeffective if the c5 is to be retained in the fleet long enough the larger question of whether money spent for improving strategic airlift should be directed toward c5 improvements or toward some other improvements such as adding more c17s or even some of both is an issue80 ida measured the lifecycle cost lcc of nine alternatives for c5 modernization and c17 findings are summarized in table 4 however at least three assumptions have changed since the ida study was published causing some to question the validity of the now

reduced operating costs over the 40year period examined85 skeptics might contend that alternative 6 is longer viable option because congress has already funded c17 fleet of 190 aircraft while some may

modernization of all c5s maybe more cost effective and provide more capability than modernizing c5s or only the c5b fleets rand study in 2005 the rand corporation completed study proposing model to inform decisions about modernizing aging aircraft and procuring replacements the study specifically compared c5a rerp with c17 procurement using the air forces total ownership cost as measure like

estimates found in the air forces december 2006 sar after adjusting with discount factor of 29 per year second the study was unable to fully isolate c5a cost factors from those of the c5b this could be problematic if younger bmodels masked higher operating costs potentially associated with flying older amodels as result the studys authors viewed their findings as illustrative and suggestive rather than definitive particularly in light of concerns with c5a cost parameters utilized in the study86 rands study found for c5a rerp to cost less than new c17s rerp would have to start prior to 2015 to some this indicates beginning c5a rerp earlier makes the program more attractive than c17 acquisition when the first c5a begins rerp upgrade in 2014 the youngest amodel will be 41years old87 in 2004 former commander of us transportation command general john handy stated by 2012 it may be that the whole notion of performing the rerp on the c5as is overcome by events the amodels he said might be too far gone to be worth the investment88 rands study also suggested the number of c17s required to replace c5as was second key consideration results indicated if 70 or more c17s were required to replace the c5a fleet then rerp becomes the lowercost option89 budget both the ida and rand studies suggested life cycle costs savings favor c5 rerp performed sooner rather than later by providing longer period for the air force to recoup its upfront investment likewise testimony by both lockheed martin and the air force suggests that predictable schedule although difficult to achieve is potentially critical element to keeping program costs down over time 86 edward g keating don snyder matthew dixon and elvira n loredo rand corporation project air force aging aircraft

exists to keep c5a modernization lcc below the lcc for c17 acquisition proponents of c17 acquisition have suggested that retiring some c5s early could make funds available for additional c17s however these funds do not line up in the dod budget c5 rerp procurement funds for fy2008 are only 253 million just less than the cost of single c17 c5 rerp funds in fy2009 are 540 million approximately the cost of two c17s significant c5 rerp funds are not projected to be available until the end of the fydp and continued c17 production is an fy2008 issue given the imminent closure of the c17 production

source fy2008 global war on terror request department of defense february 2007 p1 decisions to add funds to dods fy2008 gwot request for c17s are likely to be influenced by wider debate on whether some of the large increase in weapons procurement requested in the past supplemental appropriation bills goes beyond the expanded definition of warrelated requirements that some have come to accept those opposed to expanded use of emergency supplementals may argue adding funds to the fy2008 gwot request is inappropriate because the rationale for doing so is not related to the immediate conflict instead the arguments proffered by the air force pertain to longterm savings those in favor of expanded use of supplemental appropriations may point to congressional action in the fy2007 supplemental where congress provided over 1 billion more than requested for dod procurement c17 production line and risk the c17 production line is scheduled to close without additional dod orders for fy2008 arguments for continued c17 production often revolve around the concept of risk questions commonly asked in discussions that address the risk of closing americas only strategic airlift production line include the following what alternative strategic airlift platforms are in production how many c17s would dod have to purchase to keep the c17 line open can the c17 line be shutdown in such way that would allow it to reopen later what are the longterm costs of keeping the c17 production line open what are the longterm force structure implications of continuing c 17 production crs23 other strategic airlifters currently the c17 is the only strategic airlift aircraft specifically designed for military applications still in production european aeronautic defence and space eads company is nearing production of the a400m that some tout as potential strategic airlift competitor others counter that with less than onehalf the payload capacity of c17 and roughly one quarter the payload capacity of c5 the a400m is too small to meet the air forces strategic airlift needs92 reportedly the air force has asked eads for data on the freighter version of the a380 as potential c5 replacement93 while an a380 is capable of carrying larger payload than c5 like most commercial aircraft its airframe design has been optimized for carrying passengers and pallets this may lead some to argue it is not suitable for moving outsized and oversized cargo like the c5 or c 17 c17 production requirements boeing representatives say that depending on their success in negotiating nearterm international sales of the c17 boeing will require funding for between 14 and 18 globemasters in fy2008 or the production line will begin to shut down in january or february 2008 with full shutdown in mid200994 however to date boeing officials have kept the c17 line open in anticipation of additional orders through the anticipated fy2008 supplemental war appropriations bill95 smart shutdown option if congress foregoes additional c17 procurement decision will have to be made regarding maintaining capacity to build c17s in the future when planning for the c17 lines end the air force budgeted 650 million to be spent shutting down the line in manner that would facilitate its restoration if necessary the advantage of this strategy is that the government pays onetime sum to hedge its bets disadvantage of smart shutdown is that in addition to the monetary cost of storing and maintaining tooling necessary to build future c17s there is also risk associated with losing the expertise of the current c 17 production workforce some believe that boeing may sell its production site at long beach california if the c17 line closes having to restart c17 production at new location would likely further increase costs96 comparison of estimated costs over different time spans between smart shutdown followed by line restoration and keeping the c17 line open via additional purchases would be useful 92 according to eads the max payload of an a400m is 37 tons or approximately 74000 pounds see httpwwweadscom1024enbusinetmiltraira400mteca400mhtml 93 stephen trimble exclusive us considers

billions of dollars of costs over the aircrafts lifetime however these life cycle costs could be offset to some degree if older aircraft were retired when dod officials defended the fy2006 budget decision to end c17 procurement they argued keeping the c17 production line open would be smart thing to do from pure risk perspective but the cost would be prohibitive given the other airlift procurement programs in air force plans97 in 2005 study on mobility the defense science board dsb also considered risk an issue to consider in determining the total number of c17s to purchase the task force understands that each year of additional c17 production beyond 2008 would represent an additional 24 billion acquisition and 23 billion life cycle cost commitment which the department must weigh against other war fighting capabilities it could not acquire however in view of the prominence of organic strategic airlift in enabling rapid response to crises the task force believes it is prudent to keep options open for the acquisition of additional c 17s98 longterm force structure implications while decisions about c5 modernization and c17 acquisition must be made nearterm there are longterm implications to these decisions for example air force leaders have stated the c5 rerp will enable c5ms to remain in service until 204099 in 2040 c17s will average 3040 years old potentially reaching the end of their service life will c17s be viable candidates for service life extension program after years of heavy use will pursuing dods current program of record result in dods entire strategic airlift fleet reaching the end of its service life at about the same time when is the optimal time to shift focus to future technology that may be better tailored to support the very dynamic requirements expected to be driven by army transformation performance some view the c17 as bettersuited than the c5 for counterinsurgency operations in parts of the world with limited aviation infrastructure cold war model of using strategic airlifters to transport large amounts of materiel from major stateside aerial ports to theater mobility hubs before transloading into smaller intra theater aircraft for delivery into forward operating locations is longer the most expedient airlift method c17s able to operate in hostile and austere environments remove longstanding seams traditionally woven together by strategic c5s and tactical c130s air mobility leaders often tout this concept of velocity as the 97 michael sirak senior dod officials defend decision to halt c17

assistant secretary of the air force acquisition written statement to the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee federal financial management government information federal services and international security subcommittee hearing on military airlift costs september 27 2007 p 3 crs25 ultimate measure of success for airlift100 some argue that velocity is improved by having larger midsized fleet capable of generating larger number of sorties and supporting more pointtopoint service the c5s unique capabilities may also argue for its continuation potentially at the expense of additional c17s in period where dods force posture is moving from forward basing to expeditionary it may be unwise to prematurely retire aircraft in todays inventory in addition to its capability to carry approximately 60 more cargo than single c17 the c5 can carry several unique loads that do not fit on c17 however it is not clear how many c5s are needed to meet dods requirement to carry loads that cannot fit on c17s just as the c17 can improve airlift velocity by providing planners with the ability to generate more sorties by supporting more pointtopoint pairings the c5 is superior in moving bulk101 general handy recalled in this last conflict there were many many times when frankly the only way to unclog charleston afb sc dover afb or ramstein airbase germany was to get the c5 in there in sufficient numbers and literally in weekend clean out all three aerial ports102 figure 2 provides comparison of selected airlift loads that can be carried on c17s and c5s figure 2

magazine vol 87 1 january 2004 httpwwwafaorgmagazinejan20040104galaxyasp crs26 fleet mix how to maintain the optimal fleet mix of the air forces strategic airlift fleet is often debated in congress in deliberations three issues are often discussed including the potential for turning the c5 fleet into low densityhigh demand ldhd asset the merits of maintaining singleaircraft type fleet against the perceived risk of potential fleetwide grounding the need to balance the size of the air forces organic fleet while maintaining incentives for commercial air carriers to participate in the civil reserve air fleet craf103 low densityhigh demand ldhd assets for many potential cost and capability concerns intersect when reductions to the size of the c5 fleet are discussed dods program of record maintains fleet of over 100 c5ms through the 2040s if the c5as are not modernized some believe the air force will be left with fleet of approximately 50 c5ms as older c5as are potentially divested from the air forces inventory some would argue that this would create another ldhd challenge for the air force because of the relatively small number of c5ms that would remain in the inventory both the 1997 and 2001 quadrennial defense reviews identified the challenges of operating and maintaining small aircraft fleets that are heavily used in peacetime and in war both studies recommended changes to asset management in order to reduce the prevalence of ldhd aircraft fleets likewise air force leaders have taken steps such as implementing the expeditionary aerospace force eaf construct in part to mitigate the ldhd problem conversely others might argue that if the tonnage capacity of retired c5s was replaced by c17s then smaller c5 fleet would not be in high demand as long as enough c5ms were retained to move bulk cargo shipments between air mobility hubs and large cargo loads unable to fit on smaller c17s homogeneous strategic airlift fleet some voice concern that fleet composed entirely of one model of aircraft is less robust than fleet composed of two aircraft types pointing out that if one aircraft type is grounded for safety the other can still fly others argue homogeneous fleets offer potentially significant savings in operations training and maintenance costs those that hold this view might point to southwest airlines an airline that has turned an enviable string of profitable years in part by using homogeneous fleet designed to minimize maintenance training and operating costs likewise the bulk of dods intratheater airlift fleet has been composed of just c130s for decades organic fleet size impact on the civil reserve air fleet some believe there is need to maintain balance between dods organic airlift capability and the civil reserve air fleet craf program under the craf program commercial carriers agree to make their commercial airliners available to dod to 103 see crs report rl33692 civil reserve air fleet by christopher bolkcom and william knight crs27 enable surge airlift operations in exchange for portion of dods airlift business during peacetime during congressional testimony general schwartz cautioned that too large of an organic airlift fleet could potentially hurt the craf program in the future when he stated one of the things that you hold accountable for is sort of maintaining the balance between the organic fleet and the commercial capability and as i mentioned in my opening remarks i caution about overbuilding the organic fleet because if that occurs it can competes in peace time with that preference cargo the incentives that we offer our commercial partners and so thats one of the reasons that i believe 205 is the right number of c17s104 fleet mix options for c5 modernizationc17 acquisition as the c17 production line wanes pressure is building to procure more aircraft in effect this brings longterm air force funding for c17 production into direct competition with c5 modernization however there are strong arguments for both programs and viewing them from this eitheror perspective may be unnecessary and counterproductive because the c17 can perform both tactical and strategic airlift it also competes to some degree with the c130j for funding thus decisions on c130 recapitalization affect strategic airlift preferably air mobility programs should be developed planned funded and executed in joint and interdependent way below are five commonly proposed tradeoffs between c5 modernization and c17 procurement with some pros and cons for each modernize all c5s and purchase additional c17s advocates of this option might believe the current mobility capabilities study mcs underestimated strategic airlift requirements or accepted too much risk some in congress have encouraged dod to procure more c17s than are currently planned arguing airlift needs are increasing105 for example general schwartz recently stated that he believes the sweet spot for the strategic airlift fleet is 205 c17s and 111 fully modernized c5s106 these arguments are often based on planned force structure increases or army plans to deploy faster that may foreshadow additional strategic airlift requirements finally proponents might cite the economic and industrial benefits of continuing the c17 production line for example longer production run might allow potential foreign or civilian sales to come to fruition and provide hedge against future uncertainty one might also assert the c17s 104 transcript from the hearing of the senate armed services subcommittee on seapower on fiscal year 2009 budget for the department of defense strategic lift programs march 12 2008 obtained through httpwwwcqcom 105 gail kaufman usaf c17s may come earlier than requested defense news march 29 2004 106 amy butler schwartz says to c17 line closure aviation week and space technology november 7 2007 at httpwwwaviationweekcom crs28 capability to perform tactical airlift missions justifies continued production at the expense of c130 buys others could argue adding dollars to the strategic airlift portfolio will pull scarce resources from higher priority programs in the zerosum gain dod budget when there is quantified requirement present likewise some dod leaders caution against building too much strategic airlift capacity as general schwartz recently testified in terms of organic capacity too much aluminum is just as counterproductive as not enough we should guard against overbuilding the organic fleet to the detriment of other strategic necessities such as modernizing the aging tanker fleet or the viability of our commercial partners107 modernize all c5s and halt acquisition of the c17 this option was dods program of record until dod cancelled the rerp for additional c5as advocates of this approach note that dod has not requested more c17s during the budget process likewise some assert that there are validated requirements to justify purchasing additional c17s for the tactical airlift role further some state this option is backed by both the most recent mcs and the 2000 ida study as the most cost effective solution108 others counter that recent cost growth has invalidated c5 rerp cost assumptions used in idas analysis opponents also criticize this approach because it allows the c17 production line to shut down before operational testing validates whether c5as can reach availability and reliability rates planned for in amp and rerp further some fear without the competitive option of c17 buys future c5 rerp cost may soar forego rerp on some or all c5s and buy more c17s this option appears to most closely resemble dods current program of record another alternative is to accept the current missioncapable rates and availability of the c5 fleet but to invest some c5a rerp dollars into additional c17 procurement some favor this option because it preserves the unique outsize cargo capability of the c5 keeps the c17 production line open and allows dod to move to less risky point on the continuum established in the most recent mcs however it is unclear how many c17s would be required to fill the airlift gap created by not improving c5 reliability some may argue that the 10 c17s congress provided the air force with fy2007 funds is sufficient to compensate for the loss of one c5 as result of an accident and dods decision to forego rerp on remaining c5as skeptics also assert this option runs counter to analysis in the 2000 ida study table 5 summarizes the ida study alternatives that compared the purchase of 180 c17s with various mixes of c5 fleets 107

dated in many ways closer examination of the three alternatives that hold the number of c17s constant at total acquisition program similar to dods current program of record of 190 c17s may prove helpful based on the assumptions ida examined fully modernizing all c5s produced the highest airlift capacity in terms of milliontonmiles per day for the lowest life cycle costs however it is not clear where the nearterm money would come from to keep c17 production going nor whether cost assumptions used in the ida study invalidate this comparison replace all c5as with c17s dod could also replace all c5as with c17s principal advantage of this approach is investing budget resources into new aircraft thereby facilitating recapitalization of the air forces aging fleet some believe that this might provide more flexible airlift fleet than dods current program of record and would closely mirror air force plans prior to being faced with c5 retirement restrictions from congress109 however some contend that this option runs counter to analysis conducted by both the rand corporation and ida others point out that this option would likely take resources from potentially higher dod acquisition priorities like the 3030 proposal discussed below murkiness of requirements as defined in the latest mcs makes it unclear how many c17s would be required to replace retiring c5s further it is also unclear whether this approach would leave dod with sufficient c5s for cargo that can only be carried by the galaxy or that would optimally be transported on c5 replace 30 c5as with 30 c17s in early 2007 senior air force officials proposed buying 30 additional c17s instead of modernizing 30 c5as likewise it was reported boeing provided the air force with an unsolicited bid for multiyear purchase of 30 globemasters purchased at rate of 10 per year according to the report the cost of purchasing 30 c17s and retiring 30 c5s was roughly equivalent couple hundred million dollars apart 109 us representative jim saxton theres more to the story washington post october 30 2007 p 14 crs30 but where the air force would find funds for this proposal is unclear110 proponents of this idea argue it would allow the air force to retire the oldest or poorest performing amodels and invest in the youngest portion of the c5 fleet the portion that has the most time to return dividends on the upfront rerp investment opponents of this option contend this approach is premature because operational testing of the first amodel upgraded to the c5m configuration is incomplete likewise because of budget pressures 3030 proposal may only be executable as an add to the fy2008 gwot request111 furthermore skeptics may point out the air force has not proven that there is subset of the c5a fleet that chronically underperforms the remainder of the fleet replacing 30 c5 aircraft with 30 c17s might also present airlift capability issues airlift capability can be measured in different ways but it appears clear that on oneforone basis the c5 can carry more outsize cargo and more cargo pallets than the c17 in many cases c5s can carry twice as much of given piece of outsize cargo as the c17112 the c5s advantage in size is offset to degree by lower availability thus figure 2 does not compare accurately the two aircrafts capabilities over multiple sorties table 6 illustrates the effect the

httpwwwinsidedefensecomsecuredefense_docnumaspfdefense_2002askdocnum airforce18161 111 crs interview with saffml april 27 2007 112 outsize cargo is defined by dod as cargo that exceeds the dimensions of oversized cargo and requires the use of c5 or c17 aircraft or surface transportation single item that exceeds 1000 inches long by 117 inches wide by 105 inches high in any one dimension crs31 other strategic airlift options at least four other approaches have been suggested to address dods strategic needs these approaches include increasing use of commercial aircraft encouraging foreign or civilian sales of c17s bolstering reliance on prepositioning of equipment leveraging potential kcx airlift capabilities and pursuing airships like the tradeoffs of buying c17s compared with upgrading c5s each of these options has strengths and weaknesses these options are not mutually exclusive from the c 5c17 debate as some might be pursued concurrently increased use of commercial aircraft dod currently contracts with civilian carriers to move passengers and cargo under the civil reserve air fleet craf program dod can also obtain use of additional civilian airliners to augment the air forces organic strategic airlift fleet113 some suggest that dod should increase the use of commercial aircraft which offer many advantages over dedicated military aircraft commercial aircraft are numerous tend to have longer range and are typically less expensive to buy and operate than most military aircraft however civilian aircraft also have limitations most cannot carry outsized cargo conduct special missions like airdrops or support special operations also they tend to congest airfields because of longer ground times resulting from lack of roll onroll off capability and reduced ramp maneuverability114 further potential hostile fire effectively deters civilian crews from entering combat zones it is noteworthy that during operations enduring freedom and iraqi freedom dod has leased russian an124 aircraft to carry outsize and oversize cargo the an124 condor is strategic lift aircraft larger than but comparable to the c5 it also appears that dod use of an124 missions is accelerating some contend that while c5s may not be as modern as c17s or able to operate from as many runways the fact that dod is outsourcing missions to russian aircraft indicates c5s offer important capabilities other us aircraft may not be able to satisfy in contrast it is possible an124 contract missions may be the result of the convenient availability of relatively lowcost airlift near busy theater of operations since the air force retired 14 c5s in 2004 the number of an124 missions has increased during congressional testimony general schwartz explained that costs associated with transporting mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicles to iraq were about 130000 per mrap for both c5s and an124s and less expensive than moving them on c17s however he suggested an124 reliability made it the logical choice stating because kids are in jeopardy im not going to have airplanes broke in europe or somewhere else when i have an alternative which to date has not resulted

force indicates in the mrs05 study that it could not use the 205 mtmd of craf capability assigned for most of the halt phase of the wartime scenarios studied because of the limitations listed above likewise planning to utilize foreignowned contract carriers during contingency operations might be risky because of potential political constraints foreign carriers government may impose on their use encourage civilianforeign c17 sales civilian sales and international exports of c17s are seen as potentially complementary methods of keeping the c17 production line open and reducing the perunit production costs likewise foreign military sales could potentially reduce allied nations demand on us strategic airlift platforms in future operations bc17x one civil aircraft initiative that may have some utility for the military is the effort by boeing with the air forces endorsement to market civilian version of the c17 appropriations conferees have directed the air force to study options for commercializing the heavy outsized aircraft for incorporation into the craf116 however is there sufficient market for these aircraft to be commercially viable in may of 2007 boeings c17 program manager dave bowman stated we have 115 hearing of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee federal financial management government information federal services and international security subcommittee on military airlift costs september 27 2007 116 hrept 108553 p 77 crs33 several customers with money that have given us requests for proposals117 some industry studies suggest that commercial market for up to 10 c17s may exist for use in heavy industry mining or similar endeavors while boeing believes there is market potential of upwards of 100 aircraft118 the air force and boeing have considered number of different potential strategies to exploit or expand this potential market if the commercial application of military airlift aircraft camaa were pursued dod would loan money directly to companies or guarantee their financing to enable purchase of c17s from boeing civilian owners of the bc17x as the commercial variant would be called would make the aircraft available to dod in time of need much like craf the air force proposed several options to sweeten the deal such as helping companies find customers who need outsized cargo delivery and providing them monthly military business paid for at commercial rates in addition to having access to these aircraft the air force and civilian users could benefit because building bc17xs for civilian use would effectively exploit excess production capacity and help lower the perunit cost of aircraft bought by dod119 in october 2002 it was reported that dods business initiatives council had approved camaa as an efficiency measure120 however dod has reportedly cooled to this approach in an april 2006 letter to congress secretary michael wynne wrote the pentagons recent reviews of mobility requirements determined there is need for an outsized commercial aircraft in craf121 second strategy could be for the air force or the general services administration gsa to sell used c17s to commercial companies commercial clients would presumably be interested in used aircraft because they would cost less than new aircraft as part of the arrangement commercial owners would make the aircraft available to dod in times of crisis thus increasing the potential inventory of outsizeoversize airlifters available to dod the air force could use the proceeds from the sales to help finance the purchase of new c17s third approach might allow the air force to trade older c17s to boeing and receive credit toward the purchase of new ones reportedly the air force prefers this option over selling aircraft directly to commercial companies because it would avoid potential costs with certifying c17s for civil application122 some analysts 117 guy norris online at flightglobalcom may 23 2007 118 ibid 119 amy butler

its c17s if there is growing requirement for them the feasibility of these strategies is unclear as few companies may wish to risk investing in expensive outsize cargo aircraft conversely one private company cargo force has publicly stated desire to purchase 2580 c17s but alleges that dod is blocking deals fearing commercial sales may dampen congresss interest in funding more c17s for the air force123 some also question congresss appetite for unconventional financing and procurement strategies in the aftermath of the kc767 tanker lease proposal124 creative attempts to establish an outsizeoversize commercial market using c17s would likely have to be done without dod incurring financial liability125 foreign sales allied nations also have strategic airlift requirements that could potentially be satisfied by the c17 in august 2006 the royal australian air force awarded boeing 780 million contract for four c17 aircraft126 likewise canada is also importing four c17s127 whether the c17 is successful in the export market will be determined in part by its competition the most prominent competitor is eadss a400m aircraft having long recognized deficit in longrange airlift capabilities several nato countries germany france spain britain turkey belgium and portugal plan on purchasing the jointly developed a400m turboprop airlifter this program has experienced numerous perturbations in schedule and budget in december 2002 for example germany announced that it would reduce its planned acquisition of the a400m from 73 to 60 aircraft in october 2007 eads informed a400m

by individual states or as part of consortium136 if these sales come to fruition they would represent significant boost for the globemasters export prospects bolster reliance on prepositioning of equipment137 potential risk incurred by ending c17 production is not apportioned solely over the airlift fleet longrange cargo aircraft are only one component of larger military mobility system while aircraft offer advantages over other transportation modes such as speed and flexibility these characteristics may potentially be offered by mix of other assets both the defense science board and the congressional budget office cbo recommended that dod improve its mobility capabilities by increased investments in afloat prepositioning of equipment not by large investments in fixed wing longrange airlift for example the dsb found that investments now in intermediate staging bases more and improved force and sustainment prepositioning and highspeed intratheater vessels capable of austere port access could add significant new capabilities to enable land force deployments and meet variety of contingencies these investments need to be complemented by incremental investments in aerial tankers and possibly in strategic airlift138 both the dsb and cbo found prepositioning equipment offered opportunities to increase delivery velocity for example the dsb found that prepositioning is the sole component of the mobility system that can deliver employable heavymedium land forces early in campaign139 cbo added prepositioning sets of unit equipment offers greater improvements in the promptness of cargo deliveries than the other options that cbo examined such as increasing airlift and fast sealift capabilities140 further increasing the number of existing ships and aircraft would offer very limited improvements in the promptness of unit deliveries during large deployments141 further there are some instances where an increased reliance on strategic airlift could exacerbate logistical chokepoints potentially slowing the deployment of forces often the transportation problem is not too few aircraft but too few airfields or poor infrastructure study conducted by the armys military

for many if not most future conflicts144 leverage next generation tankers airlift capability acquisition decisions regarding kcx the air forces next generation tanker program may also affect strategic airlift capability145 both competitors for the kc x program the northrop grumman kc30 based on the airbus 330200 and the kc 767 based on boeings 767200 could add airlift capability compared to the kc135s they are envisioned to replace on february 29 2008 the air force awarded the kc x contract to northrop grumman the initial 121 billion kcx contract provides for the purchase the first 68 kc45s of the anticipated 179 aircraft146 on march 11 2008 boeing protested the air forces decision to the government accountability office gao147 the gao is expected to adjudicate boeings protest by june 19

is secondary mission for aerial refuelers and that tanker capability could be fully tapped to perform core refueling missions during times of peak airlift demand therefore some argue that tanker airlift capacity should be viewed as additive to other transportation means when calculating strategic airlift requirements even though airlift is viewed as secondary mission for kcx most agree airlift capacity on tankers can reduce strain on the strategic airlift fleet general schwartz expects the kcx to mitigate wear and tear on the c5 and c17150 the air force envisions kcx to be built from the outset with reinforced floors necessary for carrying either passengers or cargo in the fuselage cargo door sized to facilitate loading and offloading and defensive systems enabling kcx to land in certain combat environments151 with these capabilities kcx could potentially fly scheduled combat air refueling mission be subsequently retasked inflight land at an airfield located within threat environment upload battle casualties and air evacuate the patients to needed medical care in another theater this illustrates how kcx with defensive systems not currently found on kc135s might give planners additional options to execute an unplanned medical evacuation sortie perhaps negating the need to tap strategic airlift platform likewise this scenario could be applied to the movement other timesensitive cargo or passengers thus some believe purchasing kcx platform with robust airlift capabilities may extend the service life of other airlifters table 8 summarizes airlift capability

information federal services and international security subcommittee september 27 2007 p 6 151 defensive systems facilitate tanker aircrafts primary mission of inflight air refueling by potentially enabling the tanker to operate closer to its refueling track thus making more fuel available on each mission as this example illustrates defensive systems also increase tankers capability in its secondary mission of airlift crs39 pursue airships or hybrid airships152 another potential strategy to bolster strategic airlift capability might be to re invigorate dod efforts to develop heavylift airships before congress cancelled the program in 2006 the defense advanced research projects agency was developing hybrid airship capable of transporting up to 1000 tons across international distances unlike traditional cigarshaped airships hybrid airship is shaped more like an aircrafts wing to generate lift through aerodynamic forces advocates hope airships may be capable of carrying complete army brigade directly from the fort to the fight overcoming logistic choke points and mitigating the effects of limited forward basing in addition to very large payloads and long range airships and hybrids may offer other advantages to the strategic airlift mission first they may not require as expensive and as specialized infrastructure as aircraft cbo study estimated developing and procuring 1416 heavylift airships would have the same life cycle cost as 21 c17 aircraft 11 billion but would deliver cargo at rate nearly three times greater second they may be able to deliver their payloads near the conflict rather than at ports or airfields miles to the rear thus overcoming logistic choke points and mitigating the effects of limited forward basing airships and hybrids may be able to land on water which could prove valuable in realizing the department of the navys sea basing concept detractors challenge airship survivability and ability to operate in adverse weather also hybrid airships use aerodynamic lift and will takeoff and land much like conventional aircraft some estimate that 1000 tonclass hybrid aircraft will require 5000 footlong runways153 along with loadingoffloading equipment and facilities these runways appear to constitute infrastructures like those required by conventional aircraft in addition delivering brigadesized payload directly to theater of conflict sounds attractive from conventional wisdom point of view however large payloads take longer to consolidate load and unload than smaller payloads and the their delivery must be tightly scheduled likewise the inflight loss of single airship carrying 3500soldier brigade could be both operationally and politically catastrophic finally while lifecycle costs for these concepts could be notably less than manned aircraft can dod find budget room for another procurement program 152 see crs report rs21886 potential use of airships and aerostats by christopher bolkcom 153 john
