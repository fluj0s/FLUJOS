national government government and finance division summary task forces long used by both house parties come in various sizes and shapes typically they are created by the majority and minority leadership to accomplish diverse goals renewed attention is being given these informal entities because of their recent larger role in house politics and policymaking on the one hand leadership task forces are flexible devices for addressing problems that do not fall neatly within committees jurisdictional boundaries on the other hand system of standing committees is well suited for providing continuit and expertise to congressional policymaking and for overseeing the administration of laws in short there appears to be role for both in the houses committee system during the 104th congress wider use of party task forces was an important and somewhat controversial initiative of speaker newt gingrich proponent of adhocracy in the information age the speaker employed task forces in part to expedite action on the republican agenda especially during the 100day period associated with house consideration of the contract with america standing or permanent committees were sometimes bypassed by the speakers appointment of informal work groups during and beyond the contract period although data about task forces are sparse their use in the next two congresses appeared to decline evolution of the house committee system before discussing the houses recent use of task forces it is worth reviewing broad evolutiona ry trends in the committee system itself these trends illustrate not only the dynamic character of the committee structure they highlight the recurrent shift of power between parties and committees this dynamic likely influences the extent to which task forces are employed by either party the report will then discuss the use of task forces during selected years when democrats or republicans controlled the house the paper will close with summary observations about the role of task forces in the legislative processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20421crs2 1 lauros g mcconachie congressional committees new york thomas crowell co 1898 p 124 2 wall street journal may 3 1979 p 1during early congresses the house functioned largely through temporary ad hoc committees at least three hundred and fifty were raised in the third congress1 then the house devised permanent system of standing committees permanent committees were simply better suited than ad hoc panels to cope with increases both in the houses membership and in the scope and complexity of legislative business significantly system of permanent committees changed the way the house allocated authority within the chamber party leaders soon had to contend with growing numbers of committee leaders for much of the nineteenth century however there was close connection between party and committee structures the speaker for instance chaired the rules committee plus he had the authority to name everyone else to the standing committees including the chairmen this system of party power coordinating committee power prevailed until the famous 1910 revolt against the arbitrary rule of speaker joseph cannon rill 190319 11 cannon was stripped of much of his authority power was decentralized and committee chairmen who were soon selected by nearly inviolable seniority custom acquired significant autonomy in that era of committee government powerful committee chairmen significantly dominated lawmaking in virtually all substantive arenas committee chairs rather than party leaders largely shaped and controlled the houses agenda and policies speakers were compelled to bargain with committee chairs if they wanted to achieve their partisan or policy objectives as speaker john w mccormack dmass 19621971 told freshmen lawmakers whenever you pass committee chairman in the house you bow from the waist i do2 the era of committee government began to give way in the late 1960s and 1970s to system of subcommittee government the influx of many new lawmakers who allied themselves with senior members dissatisfied with the status quo produced changes that trimmed the power of the chairs and strengthened subcommittees and various central party organs such as the democratic caucus and republican conference for instance power was spread to many subcommittee chairs and full committee chairs were subjected to secret ballot election by the majority party caucus concurrent with the decentralization of authority came centralizing tendencies agendasetting committee assignment authority the power to refer measures to more than one committee and more which became more prominent during the speakerships of thomas oneill dmass 19771987 jim wright dtexas 19871989 and thomas foley dwash 19891995 these centralizing trends accelerated during the speakership of newt gingrich rga 19951999 and were prominent feature of the gopcontrolled house today house decision making is longer as committee centered as it once was suffice it to say that standing committees are arguably subjected to broader and wider array of chamber influences such as leadership task forces than ever beforehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20421crs3 3 see for example barbara sinclair the speakers task force in the postreform house of representatives american political science review june 1981 pp 397410 4

focus increasing attention on the oneill innovation3 speaker oneill used task forces to forge consensus draft legislation involve noncommittee and junior members in issue areas coordinate strategy and promote intraparty communication work on task force is thought to be especially likely to influence junior members to teach them the value of joint action under the aegis of the party wrote congressional scholar4 democratic leaders oneill wright and foley established partisan and bipartisan task forces far more of the former than the latter they even created new party post task force coordinat or two examples of partisan task forces illustrate the range of purposes for which they were created in 1985 after the gopcontrolled senate attached the grammrudmanhollings grh deficit reduction plan to housepassed bill raising the federal debt ceiling speaker oneill appointed billwriting task force to handle the political hot potato tossed at the house by the senate action5 the house democratic alternative to grh was presented at housesenate conference on the legislation two years later after the supreme court declared part of the grh law unconst itutional speaker wright named task force headed by majority leader tom foley to recommend ways to improve thecongressional budget process6 in addition the democratic caucus frequently created task forces in the aftermath of ronald reagans 1980 presidential victory the caucus chairman established task forces to address the partys priority issues7 growing use of task forces by the caucus and party leaders eventually triggered the ire of several committee chairmen four committee chairmen publicly expressed their displeasure at the trend and convened meeting of all chairmen with legislative jurisdiction to discuss this matter this task force disease has become contagious declared ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski dill8 concern about the use of task forces prompted the democratic caucus of the 102nd congress to adopt the following party rule the standing committee or committees of jurisdiction of the house of representatives shall have the right for period not less than five legislative days to consider review and report on any legislative measure developed by any ad hoc task force appointed or designated by the speaker or other officer of the house or democratic caucushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20421crs4 9 charles jones the minority party in congress boston little brown and co 1970 p 158 10 the hill february 22 1995 p 3 11 the washington times march 16 1995 p

forces during its four decades as the house minority party with democrats in charge of the standing committees republicans often employed task forces to formulate policy alternatives provide leadership opportunities for gop lawmakers conduct their own public hearings and otherwise devise ways and means to advance party interests in 1965 gop task forces issued press releases held hearings on policy issues conducted studies including white paper on vietnam criticized the administration and developed policy proposals9 task forces during the gopcontrolled 104th congress during the 104th congress the gop majority advanced initiatives to change the structure and culture of the house part of that effort involved party initiatives to hold committees accountable to the gop conference and to top party leaders not only was the houses early legislative agenda set by the contract with america which was both devised and advanced by leadership task forces but throughout much of that congress the speaker and other party leaders demonstrated willingness to circumvent standing committees to advance republican priorities fundamentally there was an acceleration during the 104th congress in the shift of power from committee chairs to the party leadershipand to the republican conference as whole more use of task forces was an important manifestation of this trend task forces became increasingly important under speaker gingrich because the speaker according to rep bob barr rga is much more active than other speakers have been in putting together members with particular interest10 typically task forces were created by the speaker on his authority as party leader they were generally staffed by aides of the chair and the members appointed to the task force the traditional goals behind the creation of such ad hoc groupsmoving high priority legislation to enactment for instancestill applied but additional objectives also were evident in their establishment one for example involved outreach an entertainment task force was established to improve relations between the gop and traditionally liberal hollywood11 another motivation was electoral the speaker created the california task force composed of the states entire 25member gop delegation in part because of the states electoral importance and its economic and social impact on the nation12 still another assignment was to craft legislative agenda for instance gop task force developed an antipoverty agenda designed to reinvigorate economically hardpressed urban areas called project hope and opportunity the republican antipoverty agenda emphasized the role of grassroots organizations rather than federal or state governments in revitalizing poor urban communities13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20421crs5 14 the washington post october 29 1995 p a26 15 ibid october 20 1995 p a4 16 the hill february 22 1995 p 3 17 national journal april 22 1995 p 974 18 the hill march 6 1996 p 1 task forces usually dilute the traditional prerogatives of committees and their chairs for example the speaker handpicked eight lawmakers to serve on an ad hoc design group they drafted sensitive medicare legislation outside normal committee channels14 as commerce chairman thomas bliley rva said this bill right from the start was written in the speakers office15 task forces remarked an aide to the speaker were devices for finessing some institutional obstacles to decisionmaking16 the minority democrats also employed task forces democratic drafting group for instance bypassed democrats on the ways and means committee and devised comprehensive welfare reform bill that was endorsed by the democratic caucus this approach to policymaking would not have succeeded when democrats were in the majority according to democratic caucus chairman vic fazio calif we were deathly afraid of interfering with committee chairmen he said but with republican control we need to broaden the base on every issue in the caucus our goal is to empower our members17 the mid1990s shift in power from standing committees to party leaders and ad hoc groups was triggered by various factors including the willingness of rankandfile members to grant authority to the leadership the second session of the 104th witnessed somewhat more emphasis on the committee system an aide to the speaker observed when we first came in and there was lot of excitement we said oh lets create task force now were more sophisticated and know better how to use the committees18 task forces since the 104th congress since the 104th congress there has been dropoff in the number of gop leadership task forces although there is single source so far as is known that identifies the formation of leadership task forces published reports indicate that during the last two years of the gingrich speakership these task forces were established 1 budget leadership task force 2 y2k task force 3 chinamfn working group 4 task force on bank modernization 5 task force on sexual harassment in the military 6 high technology working group 7 working group on health care quality 8 task force for drugfree america and 9 the tobacco task force the minority party too created several task forces during this period such as the democratic caucus budget task force handful of bipartisan task forces was also established during this period such as civility ethics and the hong kong transition by compari with speaker gingrichs top down management style which sometimes meant that the committee process was circumvented speaker dennis hastert rill has stressed the regular orderand generally restored committees policymakinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20421crs6 19 see richard cohen crackup of the committees national journal july 31 1999 pp 2210 2217 20 roll call november 16 1995 p 5prerogatives still there have been instances when speaker hastert has bypassed committees to bring legislation to the floor19 further while the speaker has emphasized use of task forces published reports indicate either the formation or the continuation of several informal party groups 1 the north korea advisory group 2 the entertai nment task force 3 working group on the minimum wage 4 high technology working group 5 task force on labor issues 6 antidrug working group and the 7 working group on health in addition there were at least three bipartisan task forces the hong kong transition working group on youth violence and appointment of house chaplain under the auspices of the democratic caucus ten party task forces were established social security census defense military personnel education livable communities health medicare financial services crimes drugs and campaign finance reform see the caucuss web site httpdcaucuswebhousegov periodically the minority leader has named informal party groups such as the hightech advisory committee summary observations as the world is changing wrote former speaker gingrich we need to be flexible and find ways to get people with competence in room together to solve problems20 clearly task forces are flexible and adaptable devices for addressing problems that do not fall neatly within committees jurisdictional boundaries informal groups can complement and supplement the regular committees relevant expertise can be mobilized from the houses membership to address issues which crosscut the responsibilities of several standing committees on the other hand system of standing committees is well suited for providing continuity expertise and representation to congressional policymaking and for overseeing the administration of laws members careers reputations and actions are often shaped by their committee work these permanent structural units then serve important institutional and individual purposes in sum there appears to be role for both adhocracy and permanency in the houses committee system
