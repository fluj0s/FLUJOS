12 and the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh13 which conclude that many fire departments fall below minimum standards for personnel levels according to these studies the result of this shortfall can lead to inadequate response to different types of emergency incidents substandard response times and an increased risk of firefighter fatalities those opposed to safer grants contend that funding for basic local government functions such as paying for firefighter salaries should not be assumed by the federal govern ment particularly at time of high budget deficits also some safer opponents disagree that belowstandard levels in firefighting personnel is necessarily problem atic and point to statistics indicating that the number of structural fires in the united states s continued to decline over the past twenty years14 another ongoing issue has been the administration and organizational positioning of safer and fire grants with in the department of homeland security legislation considered in the 109th congress sought to restructure fema within dhs with the result that fire and safer grant programs would be transferred back to fema ultimately title vi of
