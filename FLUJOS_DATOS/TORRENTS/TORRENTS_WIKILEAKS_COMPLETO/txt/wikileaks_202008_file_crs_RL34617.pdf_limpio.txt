the 101st congress 19891991 administered by the architect of the capitol the recycling programs aimed to reduce the amount of material sent to landﬁlls and establish the house and the senate as leaders of the recycling movement the initial recycling programs in the house and senate focused on the recycling of paper and the use of recycled paper including white oﬃce paper newspaper and cardboard while the program had modest beginnings since 1992 when the general services administration gsa began managing the house and senate recycling contracts the house 9939 tons and the senate 5117 tons have recycled combined total of approximately 15056 tons of paper at approximately the same time the house and senate began recycling paper they also began recycling bottles and cans since 1992 when gsa began managing the recycling of nonpaper materials the house 572 tons and the senate 198 tons have recycled combined total of approximately 770 tons of bottles and cans this number has

general services administration gsa to issue regulations on the use of recycled paper products two bills total of 16 bills and reso lutions were introduced using these three approaches each bill or

government recycling programs comprehensive congressional r ecycling program bills named the congressional recycling act were introduced in the house during the 101st and 102nd congresses14 for example hr 4523 was introduced by representative glenn anderson during the 101st congress with similar language to other bills15 hr 4523 contained language mandating the recycled content of paper

in his remarks acco mpanying the introduction of hr 1201 representative john porter explained why he believed this legisl ation was necessary my bill will amend the resource conservation and recovery act which currently requires the federal purchasin g agents to implement affirmative procurement programs for paper products containing recovered material that is an interesting concept but the truth of the matter is mr speaker the act does not promote the use of paper with postconsumerwaste content that is paper which has already been used once thrown away and collected for recycling which would be deinked and put back into use with standard to include postconsumer waste paper the affirmative procurement programs have not helped create market in this country for separated paper and do nothing at all to help us solve the solidwaste problems plaguing the country19 neither hr 1201 nor other bills creating broader federal r ecycling program were reported by committee in any congress senate the

cornerstone of the future plans of our municipalities and counties to ensure that necessary landfill space remains available the senate s hould serve as an example in the recycling efforts of the

environmental impact of recycling while i am pleased to see the number of bills introduced in congress to promote recycling i feel that we as congress must set the example for the rest of the nation capitol hill currently produces 20000 tons of trash every year of which only 30 percent is recycled to ones surprise much of the hills trash is highgrade paper for which there is currently large demand instead of paying people to dump our paper along with wrappers food and other trash in landfills we could be responding to this market demand with recycled highgrade paper22 on september 27 the

testimony on the budget request representative lindy boggs requested more information about the request and the use of the funds in re sponse to representative boggs the architect cited costs associated with the recycling pilot program including the expense related to cardboard collection boxes that could be placed on an individuals desk we have asked for that because there is some cost associated with this pilot program it costs 5 for the little cardboard devi ce that is on peoples desks32 the architect then continued by explaining the goal of making the recycling program selfs upporting and re minding the committee that he was not able to ascertain whether an annual appropriations request would be made but he hoped that eventually the committee would authorize th use of recycling proceeds to sustain future recycling efforts in any event the predicted savings in the sense of increased value for the recycling material is in the order of magnitude of quarter million dollars that is the amount we might get returned to us this is all to be developed as part of the pilot program presumably if those kinds of funds do become available this committee could authorize us to recycle the money as well as the other products by our collecting that money and using it for the expenses associated with the recycling so that we could perhaps not expend appropriated funds annually but end up with self supported recycling which has another purpose entirely33 fy1992 in the architect of the capitols budget justification for fy1992 request was included for 180000 for the dispos of waste paper the funds were requested to offset costs associated with new contracts that required the house to pay contractor to remove recyclable paper instead of receiving proceeds from the

floor representative lloyd doggett addressed what he perceived as the deficiencies in the recycling program and the need for better management and organization let recite the facts for 3 of the last 3 ½ years that this house has been under republican control there has been re cycling coordinator in this congress indeed there is recycling coordinator today as we debate today this bill there is recycling plan in place as we debate this bill there is recycling of mixed paper in this house indeed that is zero zip being done with reference to recycling of mixed paper why is that particularly important because since there is recycling coordinator and real recycling effort most people even if they have the best of intent with regard to recycling do not have correct information about how to recycle in way that will be effective nd that is reflected in other facts when the house did recycle it earned 30 cents per ton on the paper it recycled compare that with the department of housing and urban development which earned 60 per ton because it did it properly42 following representative doggett s speech representative sam farr introduced an amendment to hr 4112 to provide 100000 from the architects house office building funds to address sp ecifically the financial needs of the recycling program for all necessary expenses for the mainte nance care and operation of the house office buildings 42139000 of which 11449000 shall remain available until expended provided that of the total amount provided under this heading not less than 100000 shall be used exclusively for waste recycling programs43 in his remarks representative farr pr ovided his rationale for the amendment the amendment by earmarking specific funds for this program sets recycling as priority for the house i

to provide status report on the recycling program lynne theiss executive officer for the architect testified on efforts to improve the recycling program and make it selfsustaining currently the house complex sends about 2200 tons of paper for recycling annually the program has not been very successful but during fiscal year 1998 it underwent renovation in the house group the superintendent of the house introduced color coded bags for material separation that our custodial staff actually used each evening when they were removing the office recycle program materials48 ms theiss then continued by discussing specific improvement made between 1997 and 1998 there was an improvement in the quality of the recycling effort as reflected in the funds received in 1998 versus 1997 in 1997 with 2226 tons recycled the value of the material was less than 2000 in 1998 with almost three months of out of service time we recycl ed 1532 tons but with value of 25483 had we been in operation for those othe r months we anticipated total tonnage of 2770 the object of the program is to increase the overall tonnage and at the same time insure that the quality re duced contamination is improved to increase the recyclability of the materials while the program measures tonnage and dollars it must also reflect the market value given to the tonnage so it is incumbent upon the program to have the cleanest recycling stream possible regardless of the tonnage measured49 subsequently the house report to accompany hr 1905 included four provisions on the house recycling program these included 1 making

options available to expand congressional recycling programs legislative options there are several legislative options for the recycling program since current participation in the recycling program is

use the proceeds from the recycling program to offset program costs creating mandatory recycling program participation in the current recycling program is voluntary to incr ease participation the

voluntary programs however reported that offering curbside pickup ie pickup in i ndividual offices resulted in much higher mean level of participation compared to those programs in which citizens could only drop off materials at recycling collection centers98 as the result of greater participation the benefits of mandatory recycling program could include an increase in total volume of material r ecycled by individual committee and support organization offices an increase in the volume of paper bottles and cans recycled from these offi ces the most commonly recycled products could result in greater proceeds an increase in proceeds would benefit the senate fitness center and if passed would allow the architect to develop other recycling initiatives in the house99 on the other hand it may prove diffi cult for the architect to enforce participation some member offices may object to manda tory participation while incentives such as an enhanced senate fitness center could increase participation ultimately individuals decide whether they participate in recycling program should an individual choose not to particip ate enforcement of mandatory program could be logistically

allow for reduction in appropriations dedicating funds generated by the recycling program to energy conservation and recycling efforts could motivate additional participation in the recycling program dedicating funds would also mirror action previously taken by the senate which directs proceeds from the senate recycling program to the senate fitness center102 opponents of allowing the architect to retain proceeds from the house recycling program could argue that the current system meets the recycling programs needs other opponents could argue that dedicating the proceeds to the recycling program would not motivate dditional participa tion and that dedication of the funds to the house day care center or the h ouse fitness center would be better incentive103 administrative options since the current recycling program is voluntary and administered by the architect of the capitol there are thr ee major administrative options available to expand the recycling program the archit ect

and recyclable materials to indepth programs on the shortterm and longterm benefits of recycling on capitol hill research suggests that recycling increases with greater awareness and that such awareness is achieved by educatin g the public about the urgency of waste stream reduction106 additionally the architect c ould offer visits to individual offices to demonstrate recycling techniques or consultation on the placement and quantity of recycling bins recycling containers to increase participation in the recycling program the house and the senate could examine th number of recycling containers and the placement of the containers throughout the capitol complex increasing the number of containers and the placement of containers could allow the architect to collect greater volumes of recycled materials from individual member and committee offices should individual member and co mmittee offices desire multiple containers the containers could be placed strategically to facilitate greater st aff participation while increasing the number and the placement of the containers could increase staff participation it could so make it more difficult for the architect to collect recycled materials more containers will increase the num ber of pickup points this could make the collection of materials more time consuming and more difficult to monitor the house or senate could change how recycled items are collected by moving from having few centralized locations for the dropoff of recyclables to creating more decentralized with inoffice collection of materials in decentralized pickup system materials would be placed in recycling bins located within individual offices picked up by the architect and categorized at central location if individual staffers did not separate materials in their re spective offices such responsibility would remain with the architect to ensure that the house and senate receive maximum value for recycled materials recycling of other materials the house
