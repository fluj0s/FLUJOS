the common law rules apply to determine whether or not the workers are employees of the placement firms section 530 of the revenue act of 19781 permits many firms to use more liberal set of rules to determine the employment status of their workers among other things section 530 prevents the internal revenue service from challenging an employers misclassification of worker as an independent contractor if the empl oyer has reasonable basis for treating the worker as an independent contractor and certain other requireme nts are met including consistent treatment of the worker and similarly situated workers section 1706 of the tax reform act of 1986 bars certain firms from claiming the protection of section 530 section 1706 took away the statutory safe har bor for firms that pl ace

background although workers and the firms for which they work can have any number of arrangements for providing services and be ing paid for the services for tax purposes workers are either employees or independent contractors and the firms are either employers or not each status carries specifi c tax and legal obligati ons on the part of the workers and the firms there are advantages and disadvantages to each classification for workers for firms there is fairly str ong incentive to classify workers as independent contractors prior to 1982 the combined total of employ er and employee taxes for social security and medicare was more than the selfe mployment taxes imposed on independent contractors of course fi rm could avoid paying any empl oyment taxes if the workers were independent contractors the firm only incurred employment tax obligations for employees after 1982 the combined soci security and medicare tax burden approximated the selfemploymen t tax burden but the advantage to firm of classifying workers as independent contractors remained the irs had fairly strong revenue incen tives to assure that workers who were misclassified as independent c ontractors were reclassified as employees big problem for the firms was the statute of limitations provisions if taxpayer has filed return the statute of limitations is normally three years if the taxpayer failed to file return the statute of limitations never starts to run if an employer treated workers as independent contractors the employer woul d not have filed employment ta x returns consequently the irs could potentially assess the employer for taxes back to the effective date of the social security and medicare that could be heavy burden for what may have been goodfaith mistake in the 1970s and 1980s when the irs stepped up enforcement efforts in the employment tax areas taxpayers sought gislative relief in 1978 congress provided statutory relief by enacting section 530 of the revenue act of 1978 pl 95600 section 530 did three things 1 it termin ated any retroactive employment tax liability for employers who had treated workers as i ndependent contractors before january 1 1980 unless there was reasonable basis for not treating the worker as an employee 2 it spelled out reasonable bases for classifying worker as an inde pendent contractor requiring consistent treatment of the worker and similarly situated workers as independent contractors and reliance on judicial or administrative precedent past irs audit or long standing industry practice 3 it prohibite d the irs from issuing regulations or revenue rulings addressing the status of workers as employees or indepe ndent contractors for employment tax purposes originally s ection 530 was intended to be temporary legislation to retain the status quo while c ongress took time to figure out what the correct solution should be in the tax equity and fiscal respons ibility act of 1982 pl 97248 section 530 of the 1978 act was extended indefinitely agai n to give congress time to decide whether different statutory design w ould be desirable in additi on congress designated

classification system in section 1706 of the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 which originated as senate floor amendment subsection d was added to section 530 of the revenue act of 1978 the provision barred technical service placement firms from claiming the protections of the section 530 safe harbors this meant that placement firms could rely only on the common law as defense for their classification of the workers and it meant that the irs was not prohibited from issuing regulations or rulings relating to the employment status of t echnical service workers in threeparty situations empowered by secti on 1706 the irs promptly issu ed revenue ru ling 8741 19871 cb 296 the ruling spelled out the types of arrangements where the irs would treat placement firm as the employer of technical service employees basically if the placement firm retained the right to control the worker either by supervising performance or hours worked or guaranteeing the quality of the work of the worker to the client then the relationship was an employeremployee relationship if the placement firm simply acted as broker with guarantees about performance of the worker and supervision of the workers hours or relationship to the client then the worker was an independent contractor and the firm was not the workers employer although there was dissatisfaction with the revenue ruling on the part of worker s and firms who could not arrange for their desired employment classifi cation the ruling had the advantage of providing clear standards for technical service workers in threeparty situations since section 1706 was enacted congre ss has held number of hearings2 on employment classification none of the hearings focused specifically on section 1706 but at each of them there has been testim ony both for and against the repeal of 1706 those in favor of the repeal argued th at section 1706 makes the technical services industry the only industry that cannot benef it from section 530 they pointed out that section 1706 was enacted without hearings they noted that th march 1991 treasury study entitled taxation of technical services pers onnel section 1706 of the tax reform act of 1986 found that technical serv ice workers are at least as compliant with tax requirements as those in other industries th ey argued that there is justification for singling out the technical serv ices placement industry for sp ecial treatment they noted that company that contracts directly with technical service worker gets the benefit of section 530 if it can qualify but that placem ent firms dealing with technical servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98481crs4 workers do not enjoy this advantage they believed 1706 is difficult to apply especially in multiparty situations such as those contemplated by 1706 those opposed to the repeal argue that s ection 1706 does not cause true independent contractors to be classified as employees they claimed that repeal would set dangerous precedent by encouraging those who concede they cannot meet the common law test for independent cont ractor status to claim they are independent contractors anyway they argued that the law is relativel clear and the industry is able to distinguish employees from independent c ontractors they quoted the march 1991 treasury report to the effect that section 1706 presents rela tively few administrative problems especially in comparison with section 530 they believed that the years since the passage of section 1706 have been profitable for the inform ation technology and technical services industries in part because of the relative st ability of the work force they complained that before the enactment of section 1706 taxpayers that cons istently misclassified their workers were entitled to relie f under section 530 while taxpay ers who diligently followed the law would not be entitled to relief because of the consistency requi rements they felt that the repeal of 1706 would place them at competitive disadvantagethey asked for consistency in tax policy to avoid financial disruptions s 1924 s 1924 would repeal section 1706 of the tax reform act of 1986 which is section 530d of the revenue act of 1978 entitled the techni cal workers fairness act of 1998 s 1924 105th congress was introduced on april 2 1998 the bill would be effective after the date of enactment the bill would prospectively restore the benefits of section 530 to placement firms that serve the technical services industries it is not clear that the bill would actually benefit existing pl acement firms since they would still be bound by the duty of consistency contained in section 530 if existing firms have been treating workers as employees since 1987 it is unlikely that s ection 530 would permit them to treat those workers as independent contractors even if s 1924 is enacted if existing firms have been treating workers as independent contractor s then enactment of s 1924 would probably make such choice ss likely to be challenged by the irs there appear to be two possible benefits from enactment of the bill first there may be an intangible benefit to the workers there is anecdotal evidence that workers who believe that they are independent c ontractors cannot convin ce the placement firms or the companies that ultimately receive their services to treat them as independent contractors the workers believe that th repeal of section 1706 will make the placement firms and the companies more receptive to treating them as independent contractors whether that will be the result cannot be determined if the placement firms and companies have strong preference for the status quo enactme nt of s 1924 may not change anything if the t echnical services community regards s 1924 as green light to classify technical rvice workers as independent cont ractors then s 1924 may provide the workers with the ability to determine whether they want to be employees or independent contractors second enactment of s 1924 ma decrease the perception of unfairness to the technical rvices industry even though section 1706 applies only to technical services placement firms there seems to be belief that the whole technical services industry is be ing unfairly targeted
