and carol glover resources science and industry division march 8 2006 abstract the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 signed by president bush august 8 2005 was the ﬁrst omnibus energy legislation enacted in more than decade major provisions include tax incentives for domestic energy production and energy eﬃciency mandate to double the nations use of biofuels repeal of restrictions on interstate utility holding companies faster procedures for energy production on federal lands and authorization of numerous federal energy research and development programs spurred by rising energy prices and growing dependence on foreign oil the new energy law was shaped by competing concerns about energy security environmental quality and economic growth for example eﬀorts to enhance energy security by allowing oil and gas production in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr were blocked by environmental concerns conversely eﬀorts to address environmental quality by restricting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases were stymied largely because of their potential eﬀect on the us economy as were proposals to increase automobile fuel economy standards soon after the energy policy act was enacted disruption from hurricanes katrina and rita contributed to surge in us gasoline prices prompting widespread criticism that the new law did not adequately address the nations gasoline supply as with most energy legislation since the 1970s the new energy law has few provisions aimed at nearterm problems in the energy market being focused primarily on the mid to long termhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33302congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rl33302 energy policy act of 2005 summary and

conditions ferc is authorized to issue construction permits in congested areas permit holders may petition in us district court to acquire rights ofway through eminent domain an applicant for federal authorization to site transmission facilities on federal lands could request that the department of energy be the lead agency to coordinate nvironmental review and other federal authorization if federal agency has denied an authorization required by transmission or distribution facility the denial could be appealed by the applicant or relevant state to the president section 210 of the public

increasing amount of renewable fuel such as ethanol or biodiesel the law requires that motor fuels contain at least 40 b illion gallons of renewables in 2006 and requires an increase of 700 million gallons each year through 2011 before reaching level of 75 billion gallons in 2012 i n 2004 about 34 billion gallons of ethanolhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33302crs3 were used in motor fuels the law also authorizes funds to clean up mtbe contamination in groundwater the enacted law also contains antibacksliding provisions to preserve the reductions in emissions of toxic substa nces achieved by the rfg program the baseline emissions are set as the quantity emitted in 2001 and 2002 the most controversial of the mtbe provisions was dropped in conference safe harbor that the house version w ould have provided for fuels containing renewable fuel or mtbe the safe harbor from liability would have meant that such fuels could not be deemed defective in sign or manufacture by virtue of the fact that they contained mtbe or renewable fu the effect of this provision would have been to protect anyone in the product chain from manufacturers to retailers from liability for cleanup of contamin ation or

have an impact outside the government such as through the influence of federal procurement on manufacturers and in setting an example for the private sector to reduce energy consumption policy context the provision for extending daylight saving time and the extension of goals for energy savings in federal executive branch agencies are noteworthy provisions in this subtitle also the requirement for energy efficiency measures in congressional facilities is significant expansion of the requirements for the federal government in its effort to lead by example subtitle b energy assi stance and state

agencies fish and wildlife recommendations for the dams it regulates the subtitle also authorizes 20 million to increase energy efficiency and expand hydroelectric production at existing nonfederal dams alternative conditions and fishways sec 241 this provision gives applicants for hydroelectric licenses increased flexibility in complying with conditions imposed by federal agencies currently the federal power act 16 usc 791 et gives certain federal agencies conditioning agencies the authority to attach conditions to federal energy regulatory commission ferc licenses for example federal agencies may require applicants to build passageways through which fish can travel around dam schedul periodic water rel eases for recreation release minimum flows of water for fish migration control wate r release rates to reduce erosion or limit reservoi r fluctuations to protect reservoirs shoreline habitat once an agency issues such conditions ferc must include them in its license while these conditions often generate environmental or recreational benefits they may also require construction expe nditures and may increase power generation costs by reducing operational flexibility this provision allows entities to propos alternative license conditions and requires federal agencies to consider the alternatives proposed by license applicants and other parties to the license pro ceeding an agency shall accept proposed alternative if it finds that the alternative 1 provides for the adequate protection and utilization of the federal rese rvation or is less protectiv of the fish

general insular areas face much higher energy costs than the continental united states because most fuels must be imported this is especially true for oil which often costs twice as much as it does on the mainland also such areas rely mainly on diesel generators for power production and relatively often experience brownouts and blackouts the 1982 territorial energy assessment sought to lay out

coalbed methane reservoirs washington dc june 2004 pp 43 44 6 ibid pp 16 according to epa hydraulic fract uring of oil and gas found in conventional geologic traps is well established however hy draulic fracturing of coal beds is relatively new conventional sites are usually very deep and involve saline groundwater that is unsuitable for drinking water in contrast fo rmations that contain coal bed methane can be near the surface where groundwater may be used as source of drinking water supplies pp 49 410activities this provision removes epas current authority to regulate the underground injection of fluids other than diesel fuel used in hydraulic fracturing as needed to protect drinking water before 1997 epa had not considered regu lating hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas development because it did not view this wellproduction pr ocess as an activity subject to regulation under sdwas underg round injection control uic program in 1997 the 11th circuit court of appeals ruled that the injection of fluids for the purpose of hydraulic fracturing cons tituted underground injection that all underground injection must be regulated nd that hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane cbm wells in alabama must be regulated under the states uic program leaf v epa 118 f 3d 1467 hydraulic fracturing involves the highpressure injection of fluids into coal beds to enhance the recovery of oil and na tural gas from underground formations water based fluids are typically used as fracturin g fluids however diesel fuel often is used instead of water and various chemi cals are added to fracturing fluids5 while hydraulic fracturing has been used in the recovery of conventi onal oil and gas since the 1950s this practice has been used fo r cbm recovery mainly since the 1990s growing concern is that in many cbmproducing regions the target coal beds occur within underground sources of dr inking water and the fracturing process injects fluids directly into the drinking water sources epa has determined that the use of diesel fuel as fracturing fluid introduces benzene and other toxic substances directly into underground s ources of drinking water6 also because the process fractures rock fracturing can create new pathways for natural gas primarily methane to enter drinking water aquifers as the number of coalbed methane cbm wells and the use of hydraulic fracturing have increased rapidly in recent years so has concern over the potential impact on water resources particularly in the waterscarce west very few studies have been done to evaluate

include construction activities in the types of oil and gas facilities that are covered by the acts statutory exemption from stormwater rules the issue arises from cwa stormwater permitting rules for small construction sites and municipal separa storm sewer systems that were issued by the environmental protection agency epa in 1999 and became effective march 10 2003 those rules known as phase ii of th cwa stormwater program require most small construction sites disturbing one to five acres and munici pal separate storm sewer systems serving populations of up to 100000 people to have cwa discharge permit the permits require pollutionprevention plans describing practices for curbing sediment and other pollutants from being washed by stormwater runoff into local water bodies phase i of the stormw ater program require d construction sites larger than five acres including oil and gas facilities and larger municipal separate storm sewer systems to obtain di scharge permits beginning in 1991 epa had initially assumed that most oil and gas facilities would be smaller than one acre in size and thus excluded from th phase ii rules but newer data indicate that up to 30000 new sites per year would be of sizes subject to the rule as the march 2003 compliance deadline approached epa authorized twoyear extension of the phase ii rules for small oil and gas construction sites to allow the agency to assess the economic impact of the rule on that industry in march 2005 epa extended the exemption until june 2006 and sa id it would propose specific rule for small oil and gas c onstruction

development and production sites regardless of size including those previously covered by phase i rules industry had argued that the stormwater rule creates timeconsuming permitting requirements even

deadline is for the secretary of commerce to publish an initial notice of an appeal in the federal register within 30 days of when it is filed the second deadline is that the administrative record is closed after 160 days from the date of that publication during that time period the s ecretary can receive filings related to the appeal the secretary has the discretion to extend th is period for up to 60 days under certain circumstances the final deadline gives the secretary up to 60 days to issue decision after the administrative record had been closed and gives the secretary the option of extending that time span for up to 15 additional days there are grandfather provisions for dete rminations that are currently in the appeals process background the consistency provisions in section 307 of the czma allow state to object to any proposed federal activ ity that it determines to be incompatible with its federally approved and stateadministered coastal zone management plan since the first state plan was approved in the mid1970s there has been considerable friction between states and federal agencies over the reach of the consistency provisions states have sought broader application to have stronger role in decisions about the largest possible array of proposed federal activities while the federal government has soug ht narrower interpretations especially relating to offshore energy development determin ing an exact boundary separating actions on which the state is to have primary role from actions on which the state does not have such powers has been subject of fe deral litigation including decisions by the us supreme court notably secretary of the interior v california 464 us 312 1984 in which the court termined that the sale of oil and gas leases on the outer continental shelf ocs was not an act affecting the coastal zone when state and federal agency cannot reach an agreement on consistency determination the law and regu lations lay out an elaborate process for resolving that disagreement most disagreements are re solved through this process but if nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33302crs31 agreement can be reached the final step is an appeal to the secretary of commerce to make decision appeals to the secr etary have not been common according to citations of appeals posted on the website of the office of ocean and coastal resource management in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa viewed may 12 2005 38 consistency determinations were appealed to the secretary between 1984 and 1999 and 19 of th em involved proposed activities by oil companies the appeals process like all ot her aspects of consistency is currently covered under final rule issued by noaa in the december 8 2000 federal register while proposal to modify the appeals time line with deadlines very similar to this legislation was included in proposed ru on federal consistency published in the june 11 2003 federal register final rule was issued section 319 in previous w had less detail than the newly amended version it stated that the secretary would either issue final decision on the appeal or publish notice in the federal register stating why decision could not be reached within 90 days after the record had closed if the secretary published notice that decision had not been made that decision had to be issued within 45 days of the date of publication of that notice policy context consistency appeals have been contentious and in some instances the appeals process has dra gged on for long time periods the 1996 amendments in section 319 were meant to ddress those delays by establishing some time limits this proved unsatisfactory to some who sought additional statutory language to remove decisions about d eadlines from the unpredictable rulemaking process by defining the length of compone nt steps in law and therefore the overall process after an appeal to the secretary has been filed the consistency provision creates an unusual relationship where states have been granted the authority to halt most federal actions that are incompatible with state interests when enacted the consistency requirement was viewed as main incentive for states to develop and implement coastal plans since the other incentive to participate federal financial grants always has been modest this view appears to have some validity as 34 of the 35 ligible states and territories are now administering federally approved coastal ma nagement programs appeals relating to offshore mineral development sec 382 appeals of decisions under section

to secure federal funding for coastal re source protection and restorati on efforts grew with the replacement of the surplus forecast with deficit forecasts and changing national priorities since the

makes relatively few changes in the longstanding priceanderson system except that the maximum annual accident assessment on each reactor is raised from 10 million to 15 million and subjected for the first time to an inflation adjustment special treatment is also provided for modular reactors renewal of priceanderson is widely considered to be prerequisite for building the new nuclear power plants that are encouraged elsewhere in the act short title sec 601 this subtitle may be cited as the priceanderson amendments act of 2005 extension of indemnification authority sec 602 priceanderson liability coverage for new commercial reactors doe nuc lear contracts and non profit educational ins titutions is extended through december 31 2025 maximum assessment sec 603 the total retrospective

609 none of the increased liability limits apply to nuclear incidents taking place before the amendments were enacted civil penalties sec 610 for doe nuclear contracts signed after enactment this section eliminates the civil penalty exemption for nuclear safety violations by the seven nonprofit contractor s listed in previous law does authority to automatically remit penalties imposed on all nonprofit educational institutions serving as contractors is also repealed however this section limits the civil penalties agains t nonpr ofit contractor to the amount of management fees received under that contract within oneyear period as determined by the secretary of energy background under priceanderson the owners of commercial reactors must assume all liability for nucl ear damages awarded to the public by the court system and they must waive most of their legal defenses following severe radioactive release extraordinary nuclear occurre nce to pay any such damages each licensed reactor must carry financial pr otection in the amount of the maximum liability insurance available which was increased by the insurance industry from 200 million to 300 million on january 1 2003 any damages exceeding that amount are to be assessed equally against all covered commercial reactors up to 958 million per reactor most recently adju sted for inflation on august 20 2003 those assessments called retrospectiv premiums would now be paid at an annual rate of more than 15 million per reactor to be ad justed for inflation every five years to limit the potential financial burden on reactor owners following major accident according to the nu clear regulatory commission nrc 103 commercial reactors are currently covered by the priceanderson retrospective premium requirement funding for public compensation following major nuclear incident therefore would include the 300 million in insurance coverage carried by the reactor that suffered the incident plus the 958 million in retrospective premiums from each of the 103 currently covered reactors totalin g 102 billion on top of those payments 5 surcharge may also be imposed raising the total perreactor retrospective premium to 1006 million and the total poten tial compensation for each incident to about 107 billion under priceanderson th nuclear industrys liability for anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33302crs40 incident is capped at that amount which varies depending on th number of covered reactors the amount of availa ble insurance and an inflation adjustment that is made every five years payment of any da mages above that lia bility limit would require congressional approval under speci procedures in the act the priceanderson act also covers contractors who operate hazardous doe nuclear facilities the liability limit for doe contractors is set by the new law at 10 billion priceanderson authorizes doe to indemnify its contractors for the entire amount so any damage payments for nuc lear incidents at doe facilities would ultimately come from the us treasury however the law also allows doe to fine its contractors for safety vi olations and contractor empl oyees and directors can face criminal penalties for knowin gly and willfully violatin g nuclear safety rules previously section 234a of the atomic energy act specifically exempted seven nonprofit doe contractors and their subcontractors and allowed doe to automatically remit any civ il penalties imposed on nonprof it educationa l institutions serving as doe contractors the new law repeals those provisions but imposes limits on penalties imposed on nonprofit entities policy context the priceanderson acts limits on liability were crucial in establishing the commercial nuclear power industry in th 1950s supporters of the priceanderson system contend that it has worked well since that time in ensuring that nuclear accident victims would have secure source of compensation at little cost to the taxpayer however opponent s contend that priceanderson subsidizes the nuclear power industry by protecting it from some or most of the financial consequences of the worst conceivable accidents although priceanderson coverage for ne w reactors lapsed at the end of 2003 there was immediate effect on the industr because previously licensed reactors continued to be covered nd new us reactors are currently planned however the energy policy act of 2005 contains num erous incentives for construction of new commercial nuclear power plants and it is unlikely that any such projects would move forward without priceanderson cove rage lapse in priceanderson also would have affected all subsequently signed doe nuclear facility contracts which would have had to fall back on lternate indemnification authority subtitle b general

despite any conflict of intere st as long as nrc deter mines that the conflict cannot be mitigated and that there is adequate justification to proceed without mitigation background and policy context one of the energy policy acts potentially most significant incentives for building new nuclear power plants is the regulatory risk insurance in section 638 the administration had proposed such risk insurance for the first four new reactor s as substitute for loan guarantees and tax credits contending that the risk insura nce and various regulatory measures would provide sufficient encouragement for new reactors the enacted law includes regulatory risk compensation for up to six new reactors plus loan guarantees and production tax credit concern about regulatory risk stems fro m the experience of some earlier nuclear plants whose operation was held up by licensing problems after they were built all of todays operating reactor s were approved under two step licensing system in which they were first issued construction permit and then after construction was completed an operating license was sought some reactors notably the shoreham plant in new york and seabrook in new hampshire experienced years of litigation over their operating licenses while billions of dollars in interest costs piled up the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 created one step reactor licensing process in which combined construction permit and operating license col could be issued by nrc with col in hand utility or other electric generating company could build reactor and then operate the completed plant without further licensing proceedings howe ver nrc would still have to ensure that the plant was built to its specifications the process for making that final determination remains uncertain since it has never been used nuclear power critics want to make sure they can raise construc tion issues with nrc before plant begins operation but the nuclear industry wants to prevent nrcs fina l approval of completed reactor from becoming as litigious as the old twostep licensing system uncertainty about how long it would take for completed reactor with col to be approved for operation has been s een as potential obstacle to obtaining financing for new nuclear plants by insuring the first six reactors against regulatory delays the provision in the new energy act is intended to provide more confidence to potential investors however the stipulation that the federal payments will not cover the failure of reactor ow ner to take any action required by law or regulation could undermine th at confidence since many reactor delays in the past resulted from disagreements over whether ws and regulations had been properly adhered to durin g constructionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33302crs44 section 621 addresses anothe r area of uncertainty about the onestep licensing process under the process as establis hed in 1992 atomic energy act section 185 b reactors 40year initial license peri od may begin when col is issued before construction starts several years before the reactor is to begin operating before section 185 was added react or operating licenses had been issued only after construction was complete at which point the 40year license period would begin section 621 of the new energy act specifies that the 40y ear period begins after nrc authorizes reactor to operate rather than when the col is issued substantial controversy wa s generated by the partia l exemption in section 630 for exports of highly enriched uraniu m for medical isotope production the heu restrictions are intended to spur foreign cooperation with us efforts to convert all heu reactors to leu but supporters of the exemption contended th at the restrictions could disrupt us supplies of medical isotopes produced in foreign heu reactors nuclear nonproliferation efforts are intende d to be strengthened by the export restrictions in section 632

most of the provisions in this subtitle have been the subject of considerable discussion since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 particular ly contentious has been the debate over the design basis threat which prescribes the severity of attacks that nuclear security forces must be prepared to defeat after toptobo ttom review of its security requirements following 911 nrc issued regulatory

announcement the details of the revise d dbt which took effect october 29 2004 were not released to the public critics contend that the revised dbt remains inadequate in light of the separate coordinated terrorist attack s that were demonstrated on 911 criticism of the dbt is reflected in the factor s that section 651 requires n rc to consider in making further revisions such as potential attacks by multiple teams and suicide attacks since late 2004 nrc has required each nuclear power plant to conduct monitored forceonforce exercises once every three years nrc required the nuclear

repealed background and analysis the oil embargoes of the 1970s created concerns about the security of the nation s electricity supply and led to enactment of the public utility regulato ry policies act of 1978 fo r the first time utilities were required to purchase power from outside s ources or qualifying facilities the purchase price was set at the utilities avoided cost the cost they would have incurred to generate the additional power themselves as determined by utility regulators purpa was established in part to augment electric utility generation with more efficiently produced electricity and to provide equitable rates to electric consumers in addition to purpa the fuel us act of 1978 fua helped qualifying facilities qfs become established20 under fua utilities were not permitted to use natural gas to fuel new generating facilities qfs which are by definition not utilities were able to take advantage of thena bundant natural gas as well as new generating technology such as combined cycle plants that use hot gases from combustion turbines to generate additiona l power these technologies lowered the financial threshold for entrance into the electricity generation business as well as shortened the lead time for constructing new plants fua was repealed in 1987 but by that time qfs and small power produ cers had gained portion of the total electricity supply this influx of qf power challenged the costbased rates that previously guided wholesale transactions before imple mentation of purp ferc approved wholesale interstate electricity transactions based on the sellers costs to generate and transmit the power since nonutility generato rs typically do not have enough market power to influence the rates they charge ferc began approving certain wholesale transactions whose rates were result of competitive bidding process these rates are called marketbased rates httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33302crs81 21 pl 102486this first incremental change to traditional electricity regulation started movement toward marketori ented approach to electricity supply following the enactment of purpa two basic issues stimulated calls for further change whether to encourage nonutility generation and whet her to permit utilities to diversify into nonregulated activities the energy policy act of 1992 epact removed several re gulatory barriers for entry into electricity generation to increase competition of electricity supply21 however epact does not permit ferc to mandate that utilities transmit exempt wholesale generator ewg power to re tail consumers comm only called retail wheeling or retail competition an ac tivity that remains under the jurisdiction of state public utility commissions purpa began to shift more regulatory responsibilities to the federa l government and epact c ontinued that shift away from the states by creating new options for utilities and regulators to meet electricity demand proponents of purpa repe primarily investorowned utilities ious located in the northeast and in california argued that their state regulators misguided implementation of purpa in the early 1980s has forced them to pay contractually high prices for power they do not need they argued that given the current environment for costconscious competition purpa was outdated investor owned utility interests strong ly supported repeal of 210 of purpa contending that purpas mandatory purchase obligation was anticompetitive and anticonsumer opponents of mandatory purchase re quirement repeal independent power producers industrial power customers most segments of the natural gas industry the renewable energy industry and environm ental groups had many reasons to support purpa as it stood mainly their argument was that purpa introduced competition in the electric generating s ector and at the same time helped promote wider use of cleaner alternative fuels to generate electricity since the electric generating sector is not yet fully competitive they argued repeal of purpa would decrease competition and impede the development of the renewable energy industry additionally opponents of purpa repeal argued that it would result in less competition and greater utility monopoly cont rol over the electric industry some state regulators had expressed concern that 210 repeal would prevent them from deciding matters

utilities and provided for securities and exchange commission sec regulation of mergers and diversification proposals registered holding companies of subsidiaries were required to have sec approval prior to issuing securities all loans in intercompany financial transactions were regulated by the sec holding company could have been exempt from puhca if its business operations and those of its

longterm costs 2 high threshold investment and 3 technolog ical conditions that limit the number of potential entrants in addition many regula tors have considered unified control of generation transmission and distribution as the most efficient means of providing service as result most people about 75 are currently served by vertically integrated investorowned utility as the electric utility industry has evol ved however there has been growing belief that the historic classification of electric utilities as natural monopolies has been overtaken by events and that market forces can and should replace some of the traditional economic regulatory structure for example the existence of utilities that do not own all of their generating fac ilities primarily coope ratives and publicly owned utilities has provided evidence that vertical integration has not been necessary for providing efficient elect ric service moreover recen t changes in electric utility regulation and improved tec hnologies have allowed dditional gene rating capacity to be provided by independent firms rather than utilities the public utility holding company act and the federal power act fpa of 1935 title i

the process of transformation during the past two decades there has been major change in direction concerning generation first improved technologies have reduced the cost of generating electricity as well as the size of generating facilities prior preference for largescale often nuclear or coalfired powerplan ts has been supplanted by preference for smallscale production facilities that can be brought on line more quickly and cheaply with fewer regulatory impediment s second this has lowered the entry barrier to electricity generation and pe rmitted nonutility entities to build profitable facilities one argument for additional puhca change was made by electric utilities that wanted to further diversify their assets under puhca holding company could acquire securities or utility assets only if the sec found that such purchase would improve the economic efficiency and service of an integrated public utility system it was argued that reform to allow divers ification would improve the risk profile of electric utilities in much the same way as in other businesses the risk of any one investment is diluted by the risk associated with all investments utilities also argued that diversification would lead to better use of underutilized resources due to the seasonal nature of electric demand utility holding companies that were exempt from sec regulation argued that puhca

industry has not been provided special federal ta x preferences althoug h it has benefitted significantly from 1 capital tax incentives such as accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits due to its capitalintensive produc tion process and 2 from special tax preferences for renewable electricity while many of the new electricity industry tax incentives in this subtitle originated with electricity industry restructuring proposals others were in response to specifi c electricity market conditions and negative trends in those markets particularly spiking electricity prices supply shortfalls and bottlenecks some energy market analysts believe that electricity s upply problems are due to insufficient distributiontransportation infrastructure insufficient transmission lines to deliver the supplies to meet the demands of the market investment in transmission lines the grid and other di stribution capital has not been commensurate with increases in the generation and bulk transfer of power growing spot markets that ship power supplies over ever greater distances have crammed more electrons onto wires built to serve utilities local customers but most of the grid was built in the 1950s and needs upgrading the electric power research institute palo alto californiabased i ndustry group has pegged building costs at 100 billion over the decade the electricity tax subsidies incr ease the incentives to invest in electricity generation and transmission capital incentives for utilities to construct new transmission facilities and ne w additional power lines the goals is to reduce congestion in the nations transmission grid which has been blamed for power brownouts and blackouts and for electricity price spikes the new production tax credit for nuclear power appears to be consistent with the bush administrations support for ne w nuclear power plants although the administration had not proposed such s ubsidy nuclear reactors generate about 20 of us electricity but the most recent us reactor order that was not subsequently canceled was in 1973 supporte rs of the nuclear tax credit contend that it would provide balance with the pr eviously

relatively small however and several such as the appliance credits expire in two years perhaps too brief time period to have sign ificant impact on energy demand aside from energy taxes or subsidies to correct for energy production and consumption externalities and aside from possible user charges economists generally argue there is economic justification for additional tax subsidies to encourage greater energy conservation or ergy efficiency this is because there is generally market failure in energy use or in investment in energyusing technologies at either the household or business level that requires such tax subsidies there are some market failures in energy use however that may be an economic justification for gove rnment intervention for more detail on these issues see crs report

date of the irc 179a deduction to december 31 2005 from december 31 2006 background and policy context as result of the two energy crises of the 1970s the 1973 oil embargo and th iranian revolution in 1979 which precipitated tenfold increase in crude oil prices there was shift in the focus of energy tax policy away from oil and gas toward energy conservation and toward the development of alternativ fuels and nonconventional forms of energy in the transportation sector which is the single largest petroleum consuming sector in the united states federal energy tax policies became focused on reducing petroleum consumption stimulating the produc tion and use of alternative fuels and reducing petroleum import pendence beginning in 1978 the energy tax act pl 95618 which was part of president carters nati onal energy plan provided gasohol blend of gasoline and 10 et hanol produced from corn and other grains or agricultural products total exemption from the 4 per gallon gasoline tax such tax policy approach subsidies to the s upply of fuel ethanol typically has been the way in which federal tax policy has promoted alternative fuels the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 included another policy instrument in this area 2000 tax deducti on for alternative fuel vehicles and to refueling facilities for alternative fuels thus targeting the capital stock this deduction expired at the end of 2005 and has been replaced by system of tax credits for various types of alternative technology vehicles atvs diesel hybrid advanced leanburn or fuel cell vehicles that meets certain fuel efficiency standards the atv tax credits are somewhat complicated to calculate but they are structured to give greater incentives for more energy efficient atvs for example the credit for hybrids starts at base level of 400 but may be as high as 3400 depending on fuel efficiency and estimate d lifetime fuel savi ngs lifetime fuel savings are estimated for vehicle that is assumed to travel over its lifetime 120000 miles obviously the potential tax benefit the reduction in vehicle purchase price is much greater under the new tax cr edit than under the previous tax deduction the following table shows the structur of the hybrid vehicle tax creditshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33302crs105 table 1 fuel economy credit if city fuel economy of the hybridvehicle is credit at least but less than

and light trucks weighing 8500 lbs or less which incident ally comprises the vast majority of the vehicle stock in the united states consider hybrid automobile weighing 4000 lbs and having city fuel efficiency rating of 60 milespergallon mpg further assume that comparab 2002 gasoline engine automobile has city fuel economy of 25 mpg since the fu economy of the hybrid is 240 of the base fuel economy 6 0 25 x 100 240 the purchaser of this vehicle would qualify for fuel economy tax credit of 2000 as shown in table 1 these tax credits are expected to increas the demand for hybrid vehicles which are competitively priced with conventional gasoline vehicles however the phase out of the credit that begins as soon as manufacturer sells 60000 vehicles might dampen demand partic ularly from established automakers such as toyota andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33302crs106 honda conversely it rewards those manufact urers that have recently entered the hybrid market such as domestic auto manufacturers subtitle additional energy tax incentives summary of provisions this brief subtitle expands the research and development tax credit and aut horizes two energy studies expansion of research credit sec 1351 section 1351 adds third component to the amount of the research credit 20 of the qualified energy research expenditures as defined under previously existing law that taxpayer pays or contributes to an energy research consortium in carrying on trade or business energy research consortium is defined as under previous law but with the following additions 1 the energy re search consortium must be organized and operated primarily to conduct energy research and deve lopment in the public interest 2 at least five unr elated persons must pay or incur amounts to the organization within the calendar year and 3 one pe rson may pay or incur more than 50 of the total amounts that the research consor tium receives during the calendar year this section also repeals the

into recycling study sec 1353 the secretary of the treasury in consultation with the secretary of energy is to conduct study to determine and quantify the energy savings achieved through the recycling of glass paper plastic steel aluminum and electroni c devices and to identify tax incentives that would encourage recycling of such materials the study must be submitted to congress within one year of th date of enactment background prior to the enactment of pl 10958 there were two tax incentives for research and development rd spending 20 tax credit for taxpayers qualified rd spending above base amount or alternatively deduction as current business expense for certain rd expenditures energy rd was not excluded from qualifying for these incentives but the new energy rd credit targets rd expenditures by firms specifically in the business of doing research on energy technology such as th development of alternative fuels or more fuelefficient and envir onmentally friendly atvshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33302crs107 policy context the credit has the effect of lowering the net cost to firm of conducting qualified res earch economists and policymak ers agree that without tax incentives the market economy underi nvests in rd due to the external benefit spillovers investment in rd is also critical for innovation which is precursor to economic growth the evidence suggests that the social rate of return to rd investment is greater than the private rate of return at the same time it is unclear whether new tax subsidy specifically targeted to the energy sector was necessary given that energy rd already qualified for the preexisting tax subsidies subtitle f revenue raising provisions summary of provisions pl 10958 includes 29 billion of energy tax increases and

was created as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1986 pl 99510 to finance the costs of cleaning up oil spills however the 13 tax on refineries was not collected due to the absence of authorizing legislation both the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1986 and the 1988 technical and miscella neous revenue act prohibited the tax from being collected until congress enacted au thorizing legislation for the fund the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 pl 101239 authorized collection of the tax which the law also raised to 5 barrel but the tax expired on january 1 1995 the lust trust fund was established by the comprehensive environmental response co mpensation and liability act pl 96510 all motor fuels for highway aviation and inland waterway use are assessed this 01gallon tax with the exception of propane and liquefied natura l gas the tax has been amended and reauthorized several times although the tax rate has remain ed unchanged at 01 most recently the lust fund tax expired on october 1 2005 policy context tax increases were not originally part of comprehensive energy policy legislation the first compre hensive energy policy bill to be approved by the house hr 4 107th congress contained 335 billion in energy tax cuts and energy tax increases this reflected th perceived seriousness of the countrys energy difficulties and the relatively health fiscal balance budget surpluses during 2001 and 2002 however federal budget surpluses began to decline and then turned into deficits these budgetary constraints implied that 1 any energy tax bill had to be smaller and 2 there would have to be revenue offsets to minimize the cost of the incentives the 29 billion in energy tax increases which increase the tax burden of us refineries offsets the 26 billion in tax cuts for the oil and gas industry as whole in fact focusing only on refi neries their 29 billion in tax increases far outweigh the 400 million of tax cuts provided by the act over 11

greenhouse gas emission by 2008 2012 the clinton administration signed the kyoto protocol in 1998 but never submitted it to the senate for ratification because it did not meet the conditions of sres 98 1997 sense of the senate re solution stating the united states should not sign an agreement limiting developed countries greenhouse gas emissions unless that agreement also included limitations on developing countries emissions and did not result in serious harm to the us economy in june 2001 the george w bush administration abandoned the kyoto protocol stating it was fat ally flawed in fundament ways instead in 2002 president bush proposed to shift the nati ons climate change program from goal of reducing emission per to goal of reducing greenhouse gas intensity the amount of

fuels from domestic energy sources such as coal and oil shale some major defaults resulted such as the great plains coal gasification plant in north dakota although it was technological success and is still ope rating often the loan guarantees were used in combination with price guarantees providing an especially strong incentive for privatesector participation althoug h also potentially increasing government costs without price guarantees th loan guarantees authorized by title xvii will be attractive primarily for tec hnologies that are already pr ojected to be economically competitive unless they also receive other subsidies for exam ple advanced nuclear power plants are eligible for production tax credit that may ma ke them competitive with other electricity generating technolog ies but because new nuclear plantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33302crs121 have been constructed in the united states in many years such project still would pose significant financial risks that coul d be reduced
