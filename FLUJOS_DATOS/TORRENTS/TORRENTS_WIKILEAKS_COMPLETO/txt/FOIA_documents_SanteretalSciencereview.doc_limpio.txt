review of santer et manuscript titled amplification of surface temperature trends and variability in the tropical atmosphere general this manuscript is expertly written which isnt surprise given the number of authors and the internal reviewing now applied by many of the institutions involved my comments are mainly minor ones of clarification my recommendation is that it should be accepted subject to minor revision specific comments 1 i would reiterate tropical in 4th sentence just for emphasis 2 as reference 20 is not yet out p3 second last line i would elaborate little on structural uncertainties in footnote 3 is rz the best letter to use for the scaling factor p5 third line it is ok at this point but can be confused later p6 with correlation coefficient later p78 this becomes r1 and r2 and they get called amplification factors i presume you chose r as the metrics are ratios i guess r is ok but should always keep the qualifier z r1 and r2 could become rσ and rβ should this comment lose it formatting im saying rσ and rβ but with subscripts 4 is ref 26 the correct one for the noaa ncdc surface temperature dataset i refer to this as smith and reynolds 2005 paper due out shortly in j climate check is needed with the ncdc author 5 is it worth adding comment that the sonde cooling for t4 is so at odds that recommendation should be made to determine why bottom of p6 they are clearly biased not just for this level but lower in the troposphere as well it is surprising then how their lower tropospheric trends agree with the surface from 1958 presumably this is due to fortuitous cancelling of compensating errors 6 on p9 the sentence hadat2 and ratpac r2 z values never exceed 072 and are invariably less than 10 indicating is confusing if they never exceed 072 they are always than 10 7 on p11 line 6 add surfaces after tropical land and ocean 8 in footnote 40 the result could be related to the fact stated but it could also just be due to sampling error there are so few tropical sondes 9 in figure 2 the shaded black bar is better described as grey 10 in figure 4 the ratpac and hadat2 sonde symbols fortuitously combine to give what looks like an can the symbols be juggled around to avoid this happening
