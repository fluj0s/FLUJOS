sensitive but unclassified refs berlin 169 b 08 munich 355 and previous summary 1 sbu karltheodor zu guttenberg 37 is germanys new and youngestever economics minister assuming portfolio for which he is not wholly suited academically ref but which he could master using his proven personal and political skills if he is successful he could become the poster child for renewal of horst seehofers christian social union csu now struggling to convince voters that it is modern and savvy enough to succeed and not the hidebound regional redoubt of conservatism that lost big in bavaria last fall ref b biographical data at paragraph 8 end summary 2 sbu supporters and detractors focus on the same qualities in the precocious zu guttenberg his youth charisma foreign policy experience and upward momentum supporters say he will be effective because he understands modern challenges is well known on both sides of the atlantic and is effective detractors say he has too little experience in general and that his foreign policy expertise is wrong for the economics ministry during an economic crisis 3 sbu zu guttenberg has proven record of beating the expectations of politicians and the public he unexpectedly contested and won the chairmanship of the csu in upper franconia region of bavaria in 2007 after becoming party general secretary just three months ago he used warmth charisma and direct engagement to win over party members in the provinces who were skeptical of his allegedly cool and aristocratic bearing see bio notes below at paragraph 8 politicians curious private sector upbeat 4 sbu zu guttenberg could add some gloss to the cabinet by concentrating in highprofile way on the business side of the economy leaving high finance to peer steinbrueck social democratic party spd this might be good strategy senior contacts at the bavarian economics ministry told the consulate political specialist that they are enthusiastic about zu guttenberg although he would not really have time to master the difficult ministry within the six months he has before the federal bundestag election they believed zu guttenberg was smart with quick mind and that he would definitely make himself far more visible than glos ever did embassy contacts in berlin have echoed these sentiments and think zu guttenberg is wellsuited to capitalize on opportunities with the new us administration he seems to get on well with chancellor merkel moreover business representatives and the private sector have given the new man an early round of applause for example employers association president dieter hundt said zu guttenbergs international experience political clout and contacts would all help him promote the interests of employers representatives from industry and chambers of commerce expressed the expectation that zu guttenberg would support mediumsized business and strengthen transatlantic economic ties based on his own experience in his familys enterprises zu guttenbergs tasks are manifold implementation of the savings package worth 100 billion euros negotiate with companies that have asked for state money such as continental and car manufacturer opel find solution for hypo real estate bank and tackle wealth of questions with regard to energy and ecology chancellor merkel will want zu guttenberg to strike balance between being seen as handson minister and preventing the election campaign from being fought over the financial crisis something that could weaken government prospects the new csu more attractive to voters 5 sbu with this appointment bavarian minister president horst seehofer also csu extended his radical rejuvenation strategy of the party to the federal level michael glos was the last senior csu politician from the preceding edmund stoiber generation zu guttenberg is young very young but that is exactly what i want in the process of renewal said seehofer the csu faces potentially existential challenges in the races for the german federal and european parliaments and seehofer obviously believes that only fresh faces can lead the party into brighter future after taking office as bavarian minister president last fall seehofer replaced all members of the cabinet over 60 years of age with considerably munich 00000025 002 of 002 younger people including more women seehofers departure as federal agriculture minister enabled him to install 44year old ilse aigner as his successor with zu guttenberg gone to berlin seehofer has appointed two from the younger csu generation to replace him alexander dobrindt relative unknown 38yearold bundestag deputy and dorothee baer the 30yearold who was just recently promoted to foreign policy spokesperson of the csu bundestag caucus seehofer knows that the june 7 european parliament elections and the september 27 national elections are the tests to see whether bavarians go along with his new csu comment 7 sbu the spd may hope to profit from the replacement of michael glos with the relatively inexperienced zu guttenberg this may prove difficult glos was from the start considered one of merkels weakest ministers and his departure removes favorite target of his political opponents it will be far more difficult to score points by attacking his successor who is skilled debater in the middle of serious economic and financial crisis zu guttenbergs challenge will be to convince the electorate in germany that the cducsu remains the party best able to cope with economic challenges it may not hurt that the new csu secretary general alexander dobrindt has previously served as economic spokesman of the csu caucus the economy will doubt be the overriding issue in the unfolding election campaign biographical data germanys youngest minister baron 8 the 37yearold karltheodor von und zu guttenberg was csu secretary general for only 100 days his nomination to federal economics minister had not been on his agenda however he said it was an honor he could not reject zu guttenberg descendent of nobility line dating back to the year 1149 comes from family with strong political background his grandfather was parliamentarian state secretary under chancellor konrad adenauer his father is famous conductor and his granduncle supported ns resistance fighter count von stauffenberg and was executed by the nazis his father left the csu when thenminister president streibl cancelled his participation in demonstration against antisemitism he later rejoined the party zu guttenberg is man of considerable rhetorical skills which in 2007 resulted in his election to csu district chairman of upper franconia over his rival party whip hartmut koschyk ever since he became member of the bundestag in 2002 he has proven quick study making himself name as foreign and security policy expert he draws from rich network of international contacts in europe as well as in the us right before the february 68 munich security conference he chaired roundtable on foreign policy issues attended among others by special representative richard holbrooke deputy secretary james steinberg and usnato ambassador kurt volker he is not without an economic background for
