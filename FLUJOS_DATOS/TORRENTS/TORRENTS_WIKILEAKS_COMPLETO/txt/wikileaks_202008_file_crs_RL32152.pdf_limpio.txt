responders who might be the first to encounter such weapons in an event the new department of homeland security dhs has made preparation agains t biological weapon attack priority and deployed the biowatch program to pr ovide early warning of mass pathogen release the biowatch program uses series of pathogen detectors colocated with environmental protection agency air quality monitors these detectors collect airborne particles onto filters which are s ubsequently transported to laboratories for analysis it is expected that this system will provide early warning of pathogen release alerting authorities before victims begin to show symptoms and providing the opportunity to deliver treatments earlier decreasing illness and death the biowatch program funded and overs een by dhs has three main elements each coordinated by different agencies sampling analysis and response the environmental protection agency epa maintains the sampling component the sensors that collect airborne particles the centers for disease control and prevention cdc coordinates analysis the laboratory testing of the samples though testing is actually carried out in state and local public health laboratories local jurisdictions are responsible for the public health response to positive findings the federal bureau of investigation fbi is designated as the lead agency for the law enforcement response if biot errorism event is detected the biowatch program has raised concerns in some quarters with stions about its genera l effectiveness the siting of pathogen detectors the reliability of its results its cost and workforce requirements and the ability of public he alth officials to respond to biowatch results efforts to develop integrated response plans lower the system cost and develop complementary and next generation systems continue some aspects of the biowatch program may be of particular interest to policymakers for example congress may be interested in whether these types of detection systems can substitute for or s upplement other mechanisms in protecting the general populace whether this detection system was implemented optimally how the success of this system is to be evaluated whether the implementation operational and expansion costs for the bi owatch program make it costeffective federal investment and how to optimize and streamline performance in the future since the biowatch program is federal program implemented using state infrastructure congress may wish to ex amine how this new program coordinates with already existing public health nd

with potential bi oterrorists knowing th at cities have early warning capability due to the biowatch program being deterred from using biological weapons some may conclude that this deterrent value is enhanced by the general secrecy surrounding biowatch prog ram details such as monitor locations and pathogen lists the deterrence valu may be difficult to measure and may alternately direct terrorists toward locations lacking such detectors also the general secrecy surrounding the biowatch program details may lead potential bioterrorists to underestimate the systems true cap ability decreasing the deterrent effect sensor siting issues technical issues regarding placement of biowatch monitors are raised as potential limitations to the systems effectiveness some biowatch monitors are reportedly colocated with preexisting epa air quality monitors33 though potentially the monitors could be relocated should the need arise34 regulations regarding placement of epa air quality monitors are found at 40 cfr 58 and among other criteria placement is designed to assess the impact of potential pollutant sources for given area since these criteria are different from those designed for biological detection the placement of the epa air quality monitors may not place the biowatch monitors in an optimal configuration fo r given area some outdoor pathogen releases particularly those that might be

for placing and operating biowatch monitors in clude assuring the physical security of the monitors so that tampering occurs guaranteeing that monitor filters arrive at the testing location in the same condition as when they were removed from the monitor and providing that the chain of custody for potential forensic evidence is established further concern regarding placement of some biowatch monitors near epa air quality sites is that epa monitors are not equally spaced within city or an area even if the epa monitors meet the above criteria with respect to security privacy and access the irregularity of placement and potential gaps in coverage between these sites may cause them to be not entirely appropriate as biowatch monitors it is suggested by some that an outdoor biol ogical warning system would require the placement of monitors as cl osely spaced as 300500 meters37 neither the official rationale for biowatch monitor placement nor who established the placement criteria has been disclosed it may be that the re ported choice of sites reflects an effort to provide maximal coverage fo r the population in partic ular metropolitan area an unnamed spokesman for the depa

situations including laboratory environments and ployment at the salt lake city winter olympics in 200243 it is not fully known what pot ential changes were made to the basis equipment when it was adapted to serve biowatch and how applicable previous testing results for basis are to biowatch some question the ability of the biowatch test methods to detect pathogen s in large city environment especially one with considerable pollution and airborne particulate matter that might affect analysis44 some are concerned that there may be naturallyoccurring background levels of some pathogens in surveyed cities lead ing to positiv findings in the biowatch program which do not result from bioterrorism45 while pcr is sensitive technique it reports the presence or abse nce of dna sequence

found in humans but they are diagnosed as naturally occurring infections each year in the us46 certain of these agents are considered endemic regularly present in the environment in certain parts of the country the biowatch program appears to be pre mised upon the assumption that all positive detections merit further inve stigation even if there may be detectable background level of these pathogens in some areas in this regard the biowatch program is simpler methodological design than surveilla nce systems that det ect deviations from an anticipated background event level such systems

take this possibility into account when airborne laremia bacteria was detected by biowatch sensors in houst on texas other information such as the appearance of human illness was sought to clarify the biowatch result further concerns with biowatch implementation relate to the verification of positive results and the use of further testin g to guide governmental response while the number of false positives arising with basis was determined to be very small47 it is unknown whether that rate is directly applicable to biowatch equipment the biowatch collection filters under vacuum airflow for several hours have the potential to dessicate and kill organisms collected on them yielding positive pcr results that cannot be dir ectly confirmed by growth of pathogen in culture48 pcr methods are based on the detection of dna si gnatures they do not require that the organisms be viable nor do they distingu ish whether organisms are viable or not for many pathogens of bioterrorism cern the gold standard confirmatory test is based on growth of the sample in culture besides providing clear confirmation of preliminary results growing the organism provides options for further testing for example having viable samples of the pathogen allows for molecular fingerprinting and other techniques to support epidemiologic and law enforcement investigations as well as allowing determination of antibiotic resistance there may be analytical techniques other than culture used to clarify pcr results from biowatch and other activitie s that could be undertaken to corroborate initial findings but whether protoc ols for these activities are established and communicated to the state and local authorities that w ould implement them is not publicly known the public health testing model for bioterrorism in place during the anthrax attacks of 2001 incorporates confirmatory testing as one of its operational cornerstones lrn laboratories use trai ned personnel to expedite testing that confirms or refutes preliminary findings one goal of the lrn is to minimize the time between an initial signal such as positive on fieldscreening device that is expected to yield some false positive findings and confirmed result this process is designed to launch public hea lth response swiftly when it is needed and avoid doing so when it is not larges cale aerosol release of biological agents would necessitate public hea lth emergency response of the highest order while the biowatch program is designed to detect potential aerosol release quickly if confirmatory testing is not available it could lead to triggering response activities erroneously potentially consuming limited resources nd damaging public confidence final concern is the threshold for pat hogen detection in the biowatch system since pcr can amplify very small amounts of dna such system could be very sensitive theoretically able to detect single pathogen on the other hand the pathogen deposition onto the filter depends on the rate of air flow into the monitor thus the pathogen release detection limit is combination of at least three factors the concentration of aerosols passing over the detector the duration that the aerosol mist is passing over the detector and the amount of air collected through the filtershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32152crs11 49for an overview of issues related to biological weapon

limit for biowatch is not publicly known as consequence analyst opinion is mixed as to the utility of these monitors with some expressing confidence that small releases could be detected and others expecting that smaller outdoor releases woul d fall below the detection limit50 very low detection limit is desirable because for some of th potential agents of bioterrorism the infective dose in some indivi duals may also be very low51 the biowatch program is considered labor intensive52 collection of filters from the monitors processing of the filters and laboratory analysis all require human intervention additionally the require d laboratory work regularly consumes chemical reagents and disposable equipment incurring significant operational cost finally there are additional costs in

potential restriction of movement of individuals in the case of communicable agent55 likely first step would be aimed at further sampling to quickly confirm and clarify any positive results from the biowatch system including an attempt to isolate vi able organisms but with an urgency to minimize the time spent between an initial alert and decision to launch public health response the public health respons to suspected aeros ol pathogen release is likely to be massive and difficult to implement in limited manner it is in fact the intent of the biowatch program that the public health response be launched as quickly as possible following detected release an often cited theoretical model of casualties following mass exposure to anthrax concluded that rapid distribution of antibiotics following detection of the event is critical element in reducing fatalities and could represent potentia l bottleneck in the response56 another concern is the burden on public health

detect radiation using systems distributed over geographic area in the further development of such nationallevel detec tion systems what features might potentially be addressed and the priorities assigned to them is open to debate one priority setting decision might be the extent to which the biowatch system is further deployed this deci sion may prompt additi onal policy questions will further installation of these system s occur only in metropolitan areas or will smaller urban suburban andor rural ar eas also be eventually included under biowatch coverage should more monitors be installe d in cities currently under biowatch so as to increase the likelihood of detecting small release should monitors be installed inside buildings or public transportati on where people may be concentrated some experts have criticized the biowatch program for being primarily designed to detect large releases while not detecting the potentially more likely small releases72 others point out that during the salt lake city olympics basis was successfully insta lled in sporting venues and transport hubs where small releases might be detected73 on the other hand deploying multiple sensor units within particular area may lead to sign ificant overlap between sensors providing diminishing returns per monitor complicating factor is the cost of expanding the biowatch program and the increased like lihood of false positives since biological terrorism is often considered to be low probabilityhigh consequence event the risk of an event occurring is balanced against the costs of maintaining the detection infrastructure necessary to detect the even t unlike previous investments in public health preparedness the biowatch program may not have dualuse application being predominantly applicable only as an an tibioterrorism program congress may choose to fund other programs which have greater dualuse application to gain benefit from such funds if bioterror event occurs another area of potential interest to congress may be the method dhs used to prioritize development and deployment of national monitoring systems other federal agencies have programs to deve lop biodetectors and monitoring systems these systems use variety of techniques to detect aerosolized pathogens but have often contained undesirably hi gh false positive rates or low sensitivity for

equipments use false positives requiring the donning of protective gear are more acceptable than in civilian setting further research in to such technologies and assessment of the potential performance of these military det ector systems when placed in civilian environment may be areas for future study congress may also wish to consider how dhs plans to assess the effectiveness and performance of the biowatch program since evaluations for homeland security are still being developed judging the success of the biowatch system may prove challenging in the short term deployment of other dhs programs another issue is whether the deployme nt of the biowatch program using federal government technol ogies government contr actors and providing little official information with regards to capabilities and locations is an appropriate approach to homeland security vulnerabilities while the deployment of biowatch as federal program may have increased the speed of implementation and thus enhanced homeland security question remains as to whether more effective efficient or inexpensive system might be developed or deployed if greater public and commercial input were involved other homel and security projects such as radiation detectors were developed and commercialized by engaging competitive market forces through requests for proposals76 evaluating effectiveness frequently expressed cerns about the biowatch program are its lack of ability to detect smaller outdoor releases its potentia l for false positives and its capabilities in an urban environment one way to address these concerns is by disseminating information about perform ance characteristics of the biowatch program this type of information is available for other military systems especially

health and human services through the cdc and the environmental pr otection agency which agency is best suited to provide oversight nd evaluation of the biowatch program is an unresolved question dhs funds and currently oversees the program but some may argue that the biowatch program is inherently public health program in this case the department of health and human services potentially through the cdc would be best equipped to assess the effectiveness of the program the cdc has experience in federalstate relations regarding public health and in the evaluation of public health surveillance systems also the cdc may be best qualified to judge the validity of response and consequence management plans following biowatch positive advocates for such view might point to the retention of bioterrorismrelated civilian countermeasure re search and development by hhs in the homeland security act pl 107296 as indicative of the expertise retained within that department others may ssert that the biowatch program is homeland security program in which case dhs is the logical choice for sole oversight and assessment of this program since the technolog ies involved during biowatch development originated with elements of dhs that agency may be uniquely qualified to assess the state of development and ployment of the system because this program cuts across the expertise of different federal agencies oversight and evaluation of the biowatch program will likely include the federal agencies involved the precedent set in the homeland security act pl 107296 where collaborative approach

white house noted that the biowatch program and the lrn are both earlydetection programs for bioterro rism and that federal partners are working with state and local officials to implement an effective consequence management plan that incorporates the biowatch system92 clarifying roles and responsibilities the biowatch program is federal pr ogram while first responders and some immediate decision makers are state and local officials since the results are generated from federal equipment operated by federally funded workers in state or local public health laboratory which tity bears ultimate re sponsib ility for the functioning of the system what is the chain of authority for biowatch results while it has been reported that states ar developing response plans in the case of biowatch positives93 the degree of coordination betw een federal and state officials and the mechanisms of federal assistance to states in such an event appear unclear at this point the response plans deve loped on state and local level may have significant differences in pproach depending on the par ticular resources available leading to inconsistent responses to biowatch pos itives coordination
