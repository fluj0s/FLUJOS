idenov named in his view the four most powerful gatekeepers around president nursultan nazarbayev chief of administration and general services of the presidents office sarybai kalmurzayev the presidents chief of staff aslan musin state secretaryforeign minister kanat saudabayev and the tandem of prime minister karim masimov and nazarbayevs billionaire soninlaw timur kulibayev according to idenov in kazakhstan market economy means capitalism which means big money xxxxxxxxxxxx the following details are single snapshot of one version of current reality the significant point is that nazarbayev is standing with idenov not kulibayev to maintain international standards to develop the massive kashagan and karachaganak hydrocarbon projects end summary 2 s on january 21 kazmunaigaz first vice president maksat idenov and the ambassador had oneonone dinner in nearly empty restaurant times are still hard at the radisson hotel in astana when the ambassador arrived idenov was barking into his cell phone mark mark stop the excuses mark listen to mark shut up right now and do as i say bring the letter to my office at 1000 pm and we will go together to take it to minister of energy and mineral resources memr mynbayev at his house on ending the call idenov explained he was talking to british gas bg country director for kazakhstan mark rawlings who had missed the deadline to deliver letter about arbitration on the karachaganak supergiant oilfield project reftel still clearly steamed idenov xxxxxxxxxxxx i tell him mark stop being an idiot stop tempting fate xxxxxxxxxxxx idenov asked do you know how much he rawlings makes 72000 month month plus benefits plus bonuses lives in switzerland but supposedly works in london comes here once month to check in nice life huh 3 s idenov calmed down and said lets look at the menus then he immediately started typing on his pda and turned the screen toward the ambassador saying lets look at the four courses on the screen were four names kalmurzayev musin saudabayev and masimovkulibayev idenov said the big four around number one note sarybai kalmurzayev currently the head of administration and general services in the presidential administration was among other jobs former head of the financial police and before that in the 1990s in charge of privatization aslan musin is the current chief of staff for nazarbayev kanat saudabayev personal friend of nazarbayev for nearly 40 years is minister of state and foreign minister karim masimov is prime minister and timur kulibayev is currently the favored presidential soninlaw on the forbes 500 list of billionaires as is his wife separately and the ultimate controller of 90 of the economy of kazakhstan end note in response to question idenov said that masimov has degree of freedom but never acts without permission from the hyphen kulibayev then idenov stood up abruptly and carried his pda to ledge about 20 feet from the table and asked the ambassador to turn off his cell phone 4 s idenov said he wanted to explain why he has been less visible for at least the last half year starting last spring all the big four on the menu began blocking him from seeing president nazarbayev in october kmg president astana 00000072 002 of 003 kairgeldy kabyldin told idenov kulibayev doesnt want to work with you any more idenov said he replied fine immediately returned to his office wrote his letter of resignation and packed up his personal files and photos of his family he said mynbayev immediately called and asked my dear friend what are you doing idenov said he was fed up and was going to the middle east to work i want out of here pm masimov called and said nazarbayev wants to know how youre doing hed really like to see you when you have time idenov who said hed been trying to see the president for months but had been blocked by the big four went to see the president and told him kabyldin says kulibayev doesnt want to work with any more idenov said the president told him to calm down its probably just evil gossip ill have karim masimov talk to timur kulibayev then idenov went to masimov and told him ok ill stay but how do i deal with this masimov said hed talk to both kabyldin and kulibayev 5 s soon intermediaries arranged an idenovkulibayev meeting idenov said they both pretended to ignore the core problem kulibayevs he alleged avarice for large bribes idenov averred he told kulibayev please watch your image and reputation you have real opportunity to improve your own image and the image of the nation idenov said kulibayev was like buddha with paris manicure and both understood life would continue idenov said he believes he has so far the presidents protection but the games continue he said idenov alleged that both xxxxxxxxxxxx and kulibayev is salivating to profit from them but so far idenov stands in the way so long as nazarbayev says he wants kashagan and karachaganak developed according to international standards thats what ill do 6 sbu note fugitive former ceo of bta bank mukhtar ablyazov accused of embezzling over 1 billion recently leaked documentary evidence to the international media that chinas state companies have bribed kulibayev over 100 million in recent months for oil deals end note 7 s the ambassador asked if the corruption and infighting are worse now than before idenov paused thought and then replied not really its business as usual idenov brushed off question if the current maneuverings are part of succession struggle of course not its too early for that as its always been its about big money capitalism you call it market economy means huge money listen almost everyone at the top is confused theyre confused by their soviet mentality theyre confused by the corrupt excesses of capitalism if goldman sachs executives can make 50 million year and then run americas economy in washington whats so different about what we do they ask other tidbits 8 s modest wealth idenov alleged that memrs mynbayev is among the richest in kazakhstan but flies under the radar because he is relatively modest and very hardworking technocrat his great wealth derives in part from his former ownership of kazkommerzbank but he never flaunts it 9 s vultures idenov alleged that gazprom and china national petroleum company continue to circle like vultures hoping that the kashagan and karachaganak consortia will implode and then they can pick up the pieces wont happen on my watch idenov vowed 10 c how to order lamb idenov insisted the ambassador order bottle of wine for their dinner but then never touched his first glass instead he gulped three cans of cocacola while inhaling his food when both he and the ambassador ordered lamb chops idenov advised well done astana 00000072 003 of 003 never rare this is astana not london 11 s comment idenov is effusive even theatrical by nature when he trusts he spills his heart of course theres doubt he also spins his own narrative as we all do and so this dinner is simply snapshot but we would judge relatively accurate glimpse of one version of current reality the significant point is that nazarbayev is standing with idenov not kulibayev to maintain international standards to develop the massive kashagan and karachaganak hydrocarbon projects end comment hoagland
