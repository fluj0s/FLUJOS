6412c15 shspec49 communication gradient on duplication level 0 and level i are laid out and the materials exist for levels ii iii iv and vi see hcopl 11dec64 full table of courses and classifications the pe course is back down below level 0 and the has course is in the academy with strict curriculum it includes axioms and other bits and pieces hqs is what old hcahpa was when you go all the way to the top it is then very easy to see what lies between you and the bottom that is what has happened mow we can see what an auditor has to go through and achieve to get all the way up unnecessary parts of training have been eliminated without leaving gaps that people could fall into you can tend to discount how much auditing you have had when you get up near the top that would be one reason why you would think you could take new pc and run him at once on r6 thinking that he is where you are as case when he isnt person who is perfect and has problems 1 is very delicate 2 commits overts the case who never finds anything to audit because he is perfect must be audited very delicately person may get full complement of motivators from something yet still assert that is was right if such person were to admit to or confront single little fault ie give up service fac it would be to him the final degradation he is very overty but he is at point where if he admitted that he had ever done anything wrong he would slip over the edge of degradation that he has been clinging to and start asserting his rightness by being even wronger like kid breaking windows who keeps on doing it trying to assert the rightness of what he is doing manifest insanity is confirmation of an error you have to increase the cases responsibility by series of steps the only trouble you have had with pcs has come from not going up through the steps necessary to keep the pc winning getting gains that are real to the pc the book of case remedies is the totality of level ii overts and ptps but the pc has to be gotten up to the point where he can be run on the processes in the book of case remedies there are certain things senior to the bank on which thetan would be able to be aberrated whether he had bank or not though without bank the thetan could get unaberrated again without auditing the design of the bank is what gives the thetan the dwindling spiral but if thetan werent aberrated and had designed reactive mind he could determine to spin in on spiral now that he has that skill because he has done it but he couldnt have realized how much trouble he would get into he is capable of miscalculating which is fascinating ability to have the thetan is natively capable of getting into more trouble than he can see thetan is capable of having these things happen or making things happen to himself he is capable of setting up masses to suspend in time the masses gpms create time but it is difficult for thetan to aberrate himself to such degree that he cant recover the only way he could recover is to block out duplication cf the axioms that which you dont asis will endure forever if thetan is unwilling to duplicate something it will endure the only way thetan can erase something is to be willing to duplicate it eg if you are unwilling to be like person you will get madder and madder at the person to the point where he will disappear not by being asised but because you cant see him anymore he is still there thus you have universe thetan is nothing and he is unwilling to be something so you get masses and they endure because the thetan wont asis them so he makes bank which tells him what he should and shouldnt be willing to duplicate this bank had two halves 1 the cowboys in the white hats which he was willing to duplicate so they disappeared 2 the cowboys in the black hats which he wasnt willing to duplicate so they became more real and solid this leads to the dwindling spiral communication can be lower gradient on duplication that leads to more willingness to duplicate as well as the other way around the rough part of the bank is duplication you could take some other part of the comm formula drill it and start to knock out the duplication hangup with communication you might get over the obsession not to duplicate without getting an obsession to duplicate you knock out the ferocity of dont ever be that as when you say to yourself i must never never never be bum on skid row and then you must obsessively duplicate the bum by becoming one you get out of compulsive and inhibited actions by communication if person cant stand the thought of an auto accident he wont be able to duplicate car communicate with it or control it and he will crash the remedy would be to have him touch car this shows why touch assists and processes of communication with aberrated body parts or whatever are so effective you become what you resist in other words that which you are unwilling to duplicate will persist and eventually overwhelm this is not to say that you have to obsessively duplicate either mere experiencing of something is nontherapeutic communication with something is therapeutic if you are afraid of being an alcoholic dont try it out communicate with alcoholics or with something relating to this subject then the refusal to duplicate clicks out give the alcoholic bottle or glass to communicate with but dont let him experience it run reach and withdraw on it or on photos of skidrow bums wilson newlyappeared political figure has 48 hour comm lag between his saying i will never and his doing it he is nearly nuts and never notices that he is doing this if hes agin it he is going to be doing it to be it why was i so angry about it yesterday im it the bank says that 50 of existence must be shunned and the other 50 is love it gotta be it cherish it so of course the universe will eventually become the 50 you mustnt have anything to do with you do not have to experience something in order to duplicate it the things that bug you are the things you mustnt be or have anything to do with and if you cant comm with something you cant hold it off how do you keep one boat from smashing another if you mustnt have anything to do with boat hook there are gradients in the field of duplication making drawings is duplication and telling about them is communication so that would help out kid who was having trouble you could get him up to drawing what he didnt like about school drawing school in 3d etc cf play therapy in which the kid is encouraged to demonstrate with toys the various aberrative parts of his life just dont make it too steep gradient having to experience is an outgradient you collapse terminals with the thing that you are experiencing how can you hold anything off if you cant communicate with it also if you cant duplicate something you cant handle it putting it all on communication activity would be less likely to go too steep 8c is steep process because it asks the pc to communicate with mest which is the one thing he doesnt want to duplicate also this process is run duplicatively therefore communication like with the cowboys in the black hats is the key that unlocks duplication it is what you monitor case by and what you try to solve first not only with regard to levels but also at the beginning of every session you could use gradient of duplication instead of gradient of communication though it is hard to assess the gradient properly using duplication and the pc will hit too steep gradient and blow if you approach the whole thing on communication gradient you will give the pc very gentle gradient communication as word happens to be part of the reactive bank an endword but this doesnt matter however just because you have gotten the pc past level 0 it doesnt mean that you have got rid of his reactive mind or his peculiarities as thetan you will never get rid of the latter cleared thetan without bank will still have slump spots centered around communication duplication making things unmaking things persistence any value that time might be and value there is to experience etc he will make and unmake pictures of things he will have an aberratable pattern that isnt planned then he could just look at this small aberration and it would asis he asises things very easily because he doesnt have it all hanging on earlier similars in bank there are certain factors in person regardless of his experiential track for instance the fact that communication knocks out refusals to duplicate this comes up in lot of cognitions nonduplication decision goes along with noncommunication actions 8c is hard because youre asking him to communicate with mest and that is the one thing he will not be it makes quite process 8c also handles unwillingness to duplicate clever auditor always reestablishes the pcs communication where it ought to be before going on to do anything else so if pc is not in comm you must find out why we know the key points withholds ptps and overts they all have outofcomm to them an overt is regretted communication ptp is started but not completed and thereafter refused communication withhold is an unwillingness to communicate if you partially communicate with an unwillingness to communicate youve got missed withhold this is particular kind of problem broader look at this area is given by the fact that the pc has ptp because he is unwilling to duplicate something or someone youve got to be careful not to throw the pc into the bank with gradient if the pc gets misemotional you are on an outgradient because the person is experiencing something rather than communicating push person into situation where there is noduplication decision and communication with that and powie he interiorizes into that very point this can also throw the pc into gpms and endwords of duplication and communication and their negatives communication is the solvent that handles nonduplication as you audit the pc normally youve got destimulative factor you are putting the pc more thoroughly in comm with his bank without throwing him into it ie without experiencing it if you skip the communication you will get the obsessive duplication the experiencing the dramatization you could develop process that would do this to the pc one such process would be what wouldnt you mind going out of arc with more direct one would be what dont you like duplicate it though the latter would be therapeutic on some pcs or by making guy wrong you can prove to him that he is duplicating something that he has said he would never duplicate this is the psychiatric approach you hate your father so you are being him arent you the reason why you cant just process pc all the way north with communication is that you have to pay attention to the complexity of the bank eg service facsimiles the bank is complex enough so that the pc will have to confront and undo it you have to pay attention to the pcs physical peculiarities the pc is going to run into some corner of the bank and you have to pay attention to it you must find areas that the pc can asis and walk him into them but you are not just auditing the pc vs the bank there is the environment full of other peoples banks etc so you have to make fast gain you have to have enough of gradient so that the pc knows that he has made gain and enough gain so that he wont get squashed before the next session you can get rid of bad habits in the pc not by direct attack on them but by general comm process washing out all unwillingness to duplicate if thetan could duplicate he wouldnt need habit to handle it cf earlier data on circuit as substitute for confront see p 47 above person getting extricated from his own bank is also mixed up with other banks also he is still eating dont advise people to experience life if you find some guy that is awfully slow to bring up the line why dont bring him up yourself he has had plenty of time to do himself in and some people have simply done better job of it than others
