act of 2005 pl 10958 hr 6 congress established requirement for the use of renewabl fuels and revised clean air act and underground storage tank regulatory require ments to address public health and environmental concerns associated with the use of fuels and fuel additives especially methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe much contentious debate centered on the issue of how to address water quality problems associated with mtbe use while preserving air quality benefits of refo rmulated gasoline and at the same time promoting the use of renewable fuels especi ally ethanol this report compares the renewable fuel and mtbe provisions in th house and senate versions of hr 6 with the provisions congress ultimately agreed to in title xv of pl 10958 among the key fuelrelated provisions the energy policy act of 2005 repealed the clean air act requirement that reformulated gasoline rfg contain at least 2 oxygen requirement that led refiners and importers to use mtbe and to lesser extent ethanol in their rfg this pr ovision was advanced by both the house and senate largely in response to drinking wa ter contamination probl ems associated with the use of mtbe in place of this requirement the act established renewable fuel standard rfs requiring the use of 75 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2012 this requirement is being met primarily through the use of ethanol also consistent with the house and senate bills pl 10958 requires that the reductions in emissions of toxic substances achieved by rfg be maintained and allows ethanol credit trading among refiners and importers of fuels major issues that the various versions of the bill treated differently include whether to grant mtbe producers safe harbor from product lia bility lawsuits the house version did so whereas the senate version and the enacted version did not whether to phase out continued use of mt be in motor fuels both the house and senate versions would have done so with exceptions whereas the enacted bill does not and whether to require manufacturers of fuels and fuel additives to evaluate their impacts on public health and the envi ronment the senate version and the enacted version did so th house version did not the energy policy act also amends the undergro und storage tank ust regulatory program to specifically authoriz epa and states to use funds appropriated from the leaking underground storage ta nk lust trust fund to address fuel leaks involving mtbe and other oxygenated fuel additives the law also expands the leak prevention provisions of the us t program and imposes new requirements on

requirement for the use of renewable fuels and revised clean air act and underground storage tank regulatory requi rements to address public health and environmental concerns associated with the use of fuels and fuel additives especially methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe c onsiderable debate centered on the issue of how to address drinking water quality problems associated with mtbe use while preserving air quality benefits of refo rmulated gasoline and at the same time promoting the use of renewabl fuels especially ethanol this report compares provisions concerni ng renewable fuel eg ethanol and the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in title xv of the energy policy act of 2005 with the provisions in title xv of the housepassed hr 6 and the provisions in title ii of the senatepassed hr 61 under the clean air act amendments of 1990 gasoline sold in numerous areas of the country with poor air quality was required to contain oxygenates mtbe ethanol or other substances containi ng oxygen as means of improving combustion and reducing emissions of ozoneforming compounds and carbon monoxide the act had two programs that required the use of oxygenates but the more significant of the two was the reformulated gasoline rfg program which took effect january 1 1995 under the refo rmulated gasoline program areas with severe or extreme ozone pollution 124 counties with combined population of 736 million must use reformulated gasoline areas with less vere ozone pollution may opt into the program as well and many have done so in all portions of 17 states and the district of columbia use reformulated gasoline little more than 30 of the gasoline sold in the united states is rfg since the mid1990s the addition of mtbe to rfg and its use in conventional gasoline has become increasingly controversial the additive has caused numeroushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32865crs2 2 american water works research foundation occurrence of mtbe and vocs in drinking water sources of the united states 2003 3 it should be noted that while overall requi rements for rfg formulation have significantly reduced the emissions of ozoneforming polluta nts some research indicates that these emissions reductions have resulted from rfg requirements other than the oxygenate standard and that the benefits of the oxygenate standard alone are questionable 4 this is roughly

the primary source of mtbe in groundwater and drinking water has b een petroleum releases from leaking underground storage tanks mtbe has been detected in drinking water sources in at least 36 states2 and 25 states have taken steps to ban or regulate its use the most significant of these bans in california nd new york took effect at the end of 2003 leading many to suggest that congress revisit the issue to modify the oxygenate requirement and set more uniform natio nal requirements rega rding mtbe and its potential replacements principally ethanol pl 10958 repeals the clean air act re quirement that reformulated gasoline contain at least 2 oxygen the requireme nt that forces refiners and importers to use mtbe ethanol or other oxygenates in their rfg3 in place of this requirement it provides major new stimulus to promote the use of ethanol provision that the annual production of gasoline contain at least 75 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2012 the enacted bill uses the term renewable fuel rather than ethanol so the requirement can be met by other fuels including natural gas produced from landfills sewage treatment plants feedlots and other decaying organic matter the renewable fuel definition also encompasses biodiesel which can be made from soy oil or other cooking oils however ethanol is the only renewable motor fuel currently being produced in significant quantities in 2004 roughly 34 billion gallons of ethanol were blended with gasoline4 biodiesel the next most significant renewable motor fuel is currently consumed at rate of about 50 million gallons annually less than 2 of the amount of ethanol consumed5 some provisions of the house and senatepassed bills did not survive the conference the house and senatepassed bills would have established nationwide ban on the use of mtbe alt hough the deadlines and potential exceptions differed and both bills woul d have established saf harbor from product liability lawsuits for producers of ethanol and othe r renewable fuels neither of these provisions was included in the enacted ve rsion the enacted bill also dropped the house bills safe harbor for mtbe producer s as well as the transitional assistance for merchant producers of mtbe that was included in both the house and senate passed versions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32865crs3 6 technical corrections to the energy policy act were enacted in pl 109168 on january 10 2006 the only substantial correction to title xv was the revision of the dates authorizing appropriations for subtitle i re garding the regulation of underground storage tanks from fy2005fy2009 to fy2006fy2011 the enacted bill also amends the unde rground storage tank ust regulatory program under subtitle i of th solid waste disposal act swda to better prevent leaks of petroleum and mtbe from undergr ound tanks it authorizes epa and states to use appropriations from the leaking underground storage tank lust trust fund for administering their lust cl eanup programs and enforcing tank leak prevention regulations patterned after the house bill pl 10958 as amended6 authorizes 1 billion for the cleanup of leak s of fuels containing mtbe or other oxygenates including ethanol and another 1 billion for epa and states to administer and enforce the current lust cl eanup program however the acts tax extension language 1362 prohibits the us of lust trust fund appropriations for any new purposes thus while the energy policy act of 2005 markedly expands states leak prevention responsibilities it pr ohibits the use of the trust fund money to support state implementation of the ne w requirements among other provisions the act requires epa or the state to conduc t ust compliance inspections every three years prohibits fuel delivery to ineligible tanks directs states to develop training requirements for individuals responsible for tank operation and maintenance and requires epa to establish strategy to address releases on tribal lands the remainder

to 50 billion gallons in 2012 after 2012 the percentage of renewable fuel required in the motor fuel pool must be the same as the percentage required in 2012 this standard will largely be met by ethanol but other renewable fuels such as biodiesel are eligible ethanol from cellulosic biomass including from wood and agricultural residue animal waste and municipal solid waste is granted extra credits toward fulfilling the programs requirements 1 gallon of cellulosic ethanol counts as 15 gallons of renewable fuel further the bill would establish credit trading program to provide flexibility to refiners and blenders 1501significant differences from the house version requires that 40 billion gallons of renewable fuel be used in 2006 increasing to 80 billion gallons in 2012 after 2012 the minimum requirement is the ratio of renewable fuel to gasoline in 2012 but epa has the authority to establish higher requirement gallon of cellulosic ethanol counts as 25 gallons of renewable fuel 15 gallons in the house version further after 2012 minimum of 250 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol is required in fuel annually and would not be subject to the increased credit for cellulosic ethanol 211similar to senate provision except that 40 billion gallons is required in 2006 increasing to 75 billion gallons in 2012 epa has the authority to establish the requirement in subsequent
