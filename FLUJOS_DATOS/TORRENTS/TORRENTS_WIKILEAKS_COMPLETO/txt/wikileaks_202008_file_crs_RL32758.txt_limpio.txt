australian defense minister reportedly announced that australia would send an additional 110 special forces soldiers and two helicopters in support of 190 australian troops already in afghanistan55 by

italy and spain would retain responsibility for western afghanistan58 dutch concerns over deploying to southern afghanistan the netherlands currently has approximately 625 troops currently serving in afghanistan and under natos expansion plan are due to provide an additional 1000 to 1400 troops to serve in urzuzgan province in the south59 the dutch government based on dutch intelligence service report are concerned that their forces may be operating in particularly dangerous area and have sought assurances that additional military support would be available in the event of significant levels of violence in the region60 the dutch government has given parliament who are reportedly deeply divided over the issue the authority to approve or reject the deployment and vote on the issue is scheduled for february 261 this situation is causing difficulty amongst other nato members the majority of whom suggest that they would be hardpressed to make up for the dutch shortfall should the dutch parliament vote to sending forces to the southern region62 in this event the united states already operating in the region might be required to make up for the shortfall of forces possibly affecting recently announced plans to decrease force levels by 2500 troops nato secretary general jaap hoop scheffer former dutch defense minister is reportedly putting pressure on the dutch

that nato is committed for the long term in afghanistan64 some believe that substantial us military presence will be required throughout the duration of the natoled mission to insure longterm nato commitment there are treaty requirements for nato members to contribute troops to afghanistan and nato has had difficulties in the past trying to muster sufficient troops and military resources for operations using this pass the hat approach some question how effective nato will be in its new role particularly when many of its members are unwilling to place their troops in potentially hostile situations and only few member nations are willing to commit their forces to counterterror and counterinsurgency operations if only few natos 26 members are willing to engage in counterterror and counterinsurgency operations then natos ability to sustain these operations over an extended period against an insurgency that has shown great deal of resiliency and has shown signs relenting their attacks against coalition forces could be called into question provincial reconstruction teams prts prts are small civilmilitary teams originally designed to extend the authority of the afghan central government beyond kabul and to facilitate aid and reconstruction projects prts have enabled coalition forces to extend degree of security to outlying regions and have also permitted us forces to establish personal relationships with local afghan leaders which some believe has helped to diminish insurgent influence in number of regions65 as of july 2005 there were 22 prts 13 supervised by the coalition and nine by nato66 the 13 prts run by the coalition are located in the south and east generally considered to be moderate to high threat areas twelve of the prts are us and one is run by new zealand the nine prts administered by nato are located in the north and west in low to moderate threat areas and cover approximately 50 percent of afghanistan efficacy of prts while overall the prts have been described as successful in accomplishing their main missions and have played an important supporting role in other endeavors such as training counter narcotics and election support some nato prts have been described as risk averse and overly controlled by their nations politicalmilitary leadership if all prts eventually transition to nato control some question if they can perform as well as prts run by the united states and the united kingdom one senior us defense official acknowledging the record of success of prts suggests that prts operate in muddled fashion which has prevented them from 64 judy dempsey 2 afghanistan missions to merge international herald tribune february 11 2005 65 joshua kuccera p 25 66 information in this section is taken from briefing paper by dr joseph j collins of the national defense university ndu titled provincial reconstruction teams past present and future july 2005 crs12 having much greater effect on afghanistans future67 he attributes this lack of efficacy to four basic factors inconsistent mission statements unclear roles and responsibilities ad hoc preparation and most importantly limited resources both human equipment and financial68 in order for prts to achieve their full potential the defense official suggests the following improvements either create more prts or extend the operational reach of the current 22 prts with miniprts into key districts throughout afghanistan each prt should be equipped the best communications possible additional transportation assets and receive substantially more funding for diverse array of projects prts need broad range of development and civilian governance expertise and civilians with the prts must have both the authority and resources to play leadership role the civilmilitary coordination on prts must improve significantly prts need to improve their ability to measure the effectiveness of their activities prts must determine what activities have the greatest impact on the locals by employing more rigorous cause and effect analysis and prts should place greater emphasis on capacitybuilding programs that improve local governance and help to link local officials and institutions to the afghan central government69 training the afghan national army ana training of the ana commenced shortly after us and coalition forces defeated taliban forces in early 2002 the bonn ii conference on rebuilding afghanistan in december 2002 mandated 70000 strong afghan national army70 although the afghan national army initially experienced difficulties in terms of morale and

inadequate logistics system have hampered the growth of the ana73 in february 2005 the us military doubled the number of tactical trainers that are embedded with ana units from 300 to 600 soldiers74

counternarcotics operations in afghanistan congress might act to review current administration and dod policy concerning the us military role in afghan counternarcotics operations while the insurgency remains threat the performance of the ana and the progress made toward governance suggest that the afghan national government and coalition are successfully meeting these challenges some suggest that despite the progress made to date afghanistans burgeoning drug trade has the potential to undermine the afghan government and provide the taliban with the financial resources needed to perpetuate the insurgency indefinitely the current us military role in counternarcotics operations is limited to training planning support and the transport of police and troops the rationale provided in the past for limited us military involvement in afghan counterdrug operations was that active involvement was not achievable given us force levels in afghanistan and that it could significantly undermine its counterinsurgency campaign153 while the united states has gone from participation policy to supporting role critics suggest that more active role is now essential some suggest that us strategy in this regard is contradictory senior us military leadership describes the afghan drug trade as the most significant security problem facing afghanistan yet it appears that some believe that the us is ceding

longterm strategy and command arrangements it is possible that congress may explore in greater detail how africa not only fits into the administrations long term strategy for the war on terror but also what the administrations specific strategy is for africa if such strategy exists while combined joint task force horn of africa cjtfhoa has been in existence for almost three years little is publicly known about these longterm commitments to the region in terms of overall strategy and what resources both military and financial would be required to implement such strategy particularly if the administration intends to expand operations to other african nations congress may also choose to review with dod the prospects for establishing separate regional command for africa while there appears to be number of arguments favoring such course of action there are also political and resource issues that might be examined in great detail security for such headquarters if it is placed in africa could also be significant issue for discussion given the volatile nature of the region removing africa from us centcoms and us eucoms responsibility could also have political and resource implications abu sayaaf and jemaah islamiyah reports that abu sayaaf and jemaah islamiyah are developing training relationship and operational alliance suggest to some the potential for an increase in terrorist activities throughout southeast asia while the majority of these activities would likely be against regional governments the potential exists for attacks against us concerns and citizens in the region us military presence and ongoing operations in the region are considered by some as modest at best and might do little to deter attacks or assist us regional allies in pursuing those responsible given this possibility congress might act to review the adequacy of us military forces in the region as well as their current mandate in terms of training and advising regional military forces farc operations congress may decide to examine the progress being made against the farc by the ustrained colombian military while reports of demobilization and peace talks by the other insurgent groups are considered promising by some others note that the farc continues its campaign against the colombian government adopting some of the tactics employed successfully by insurgents in afghanistan and iraq some reports also suggest that while colombian military operations against the farc have enjoyed degree of success that joint uscolombian counternarcotics operations have done little to stem the supply of cocaine154 critics note that profits from drug operations finance the farc and suggest that drastically reducing narcoticsrelated profits would have significant impact on
