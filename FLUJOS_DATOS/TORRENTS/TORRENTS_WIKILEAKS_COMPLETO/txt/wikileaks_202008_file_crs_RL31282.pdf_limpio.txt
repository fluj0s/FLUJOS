duty of loyalty duty of prudence duty to diversify investments and duty to follow plan documents to the extent that they comply with erisa6 section 404a1 reflects congress interest in incorporating the core principles of the common law of trusts7 indeed the common law of trusts requires trustee to make such investments and only such investments as prudent person would make of his own property having in view the preservation of the estate and the amount and regularity of the income to be derived 8 tittle v enron corp participants in the enron corp savings plan were permitted to contribute between 1 and 15 percent of their eligible base pay to the plan9 participants directed the investment of their contributions to various investment options available under the plan two options the enron corp stock fund and the enron oil gas stock fund invested solely in company stock enron matched participants contributions at certain percentages by making contribu tions to the participants accounts in the stock funds10 the plaintiffs in tittle allege violations of the duties of loyalty and prudence and the duty to act in accordance with plan documents they argue that officers of enron

the fiduciaries positive statements about enrons earnings prospects and business condition influenced them into maintaining and purchasing enron stock the plaintiffs allege several breaches of the duty of prudence first the plaintiffs argue that enron and the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors compensation committee failed to act prudently by appointing fiduciaries to manage the savings plan who were not qualified11 the plaintiffs also allege that enron and the compensation committee failed to monitor adequately the investment decisions of these fiduciaries second the plaintiffs contend that the administrative committee breached its duty of prudence by failing to monitor enron stock to determine whether such stock was suitable investme nt option the committee had process for actively monitoring the prudence of enron stock as an investment option for the plan or protocol for discontinuing the use of company stock upon it becoming longer prudent as an investment for plan assets12 third the plaintiffs argue that enron the administrative committee specified enron officers and the northern trust company breached their duty of prudence by failing to postpone the lockdown of the savings plan in october 200113 the plaintiffs maintain that the fiduciaries who knew some or all of the true facts concerning enrons precarious financial condition knew or should have known that it was imprudent to proceed with the lockdowns14 during the lockdown enron stock lost more than onethird of its value and plan participants suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses15 finally the plaintiffs allege that the administrative committee and the northern trust company breached their duty to act in accordance with plan documents by failing to diversify the plan investments the savings plan states that each fiduciary shall discharge his duties and responsibilities with respect to the plan by among other things diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses 16 the plaintiffs assert that because the fiduciaries did not comply with this plan requirement the plan was dangerously overweighted

and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan19 the duty of loyalty under erisa requires the fiduciary to act with an eye single to the interests of the participants and beneficiaries20 courts have concluded that deceiving participants and beneficiaries is inconsistent with the duty imposed by section 404a1 a21 in varity corporation v howe the us supreme court considered whether varity breached its duty of loyalty under erisa when it misled beneficiaries of its subsidiary s welfare benefit plan22 varity persuaded the beneficiaries to change employers and benefit plans as way of avoiding obligations arising from the plans promises to pay medical and other nonpension benefits although varity knew that the beneficiaries new employer separately incorporated subsidiary would fail it indicated that the new subsidiary had positive business outlook and offered secure employee benefits the new subsidiary suffered loss in its first year and ended its second year in receivership consequently the employees lost their nonpension benefits the court determined that varity had violated section 404a1a to participate knowingly and significantly in deceiving plans beneficiaries in order to save the employe r money at the beneficiaries expense is not to act solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiarie s23 the court maintained that such deceit is inconsistent with the duty of loyalty owed by all fiduciaries under section 404a1a24 duty of prudence section 404a1b of erisa requires

appropriate consideration to the facts and circumstances that the fiduciary knows or should know are relevant to an investment or investment course of action26 to determine whether fiduciary has acted prudently court will consider the fiduciarys conduct in arriving at an investment decision and not the actual performance of the investment in in re unisys saving plan litigation the us court of appeals for the third circuit noted if at the time an investment is made it is an investment prudent person would make there is liability if the investment later depreciates in value27 the plaintiffs in unisys alleged that the company breached its fiduciary duty of prudence by investing pension plan assets in guaranteed investment contracts gics issued by the executive life insurance company28 although unisys had been advised that such an investment was controversial it invested in executive life based on the companys high credit rating from standard poors29 unisys maintained its investments in executive life gics even after learning of the insurers declining financial condition the third circuit considered whether unisys conducted an independent investigation into the merits of the executive life gics although unisys claimed that it relied on the research of consultant to determine that executive life was financially sound the court was unconvinced the court maintained that unisys passively accepted the consultants positive appraisal of executive life30 any further investigation into executive lifes financial condition appeared to be limited to unisys confirmation of the companys high credit rating by standard poors the court observed that the thoroughn ess of fiduciarys investigation is measured not only by the actions it took in conducting it but by the facts that an adequate evaluation would have uncovered in this case the court found that more thorough investigation would have revealed that executive life was given lower credit ratings by other investment analysts further investigation would have also shown that unisys standard poors rating was questioned in some financial circles ultimately the court concluded that there were genuine issues as to whether unisys reliance on the credit ratings was justified and informed31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31282crs6 31continued to the company the third circuit remanded the case for further

investigate thoroughly the cash requirements of profit sharing plan fund32 giw industries maintained profitsharing plan which consisted of three funds trevor stewart was hired to provide investment management services for one of these funds trevor stewart was given sole authority to manage the investment of the funds assets trevor stewart invested 70 percent of the fund assets in longterm government bonds the firm claimed that this investment was based on solid market analysis and that it investigated market conditions before making the investment within year of being hired giw industries informed trevor stewart of required cash disbursal to be made from the fund to make the disbursal trevor stewart was forced to sell some of the bonds for less than their purchase price giw industries filed suit against trevor stewart alleging that the firms decision to invest in longterm government bonds was not prudent because it failed to provide the liquidity necessary to make payments to retiring employees without adversely affecting the fund33 the court agreed with this position the court noted that trevor stewart failed to determine the funds historical cash flow needs although the bonds carried minimal risk trevor stewart failed to consider the withdrawals and disbursements that were characteristic of the fund moreover the court maintained that if trevor stewart had investigated the age and projected retirement plans of employee participants it could have anticipated the need for cash and made different investment decisions34 duty to diversify investments section 404a1c of erisa requires fiduciaries to diversify the investments of plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so35 in general it is believed that fiduciaries should not invest an unreasonably large proportion of plans portfolio in single security in single type of security or in various securities dependent upon the success of single enterprise or upon conditions in single locality36 the duty to diversify investments does not apply to eligible individual account plans that acquire or hold qualifying employer real estate or qualifying employer securities37httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31282crs7 37continued based solely upon the amount contributed to the participants account and any income expenses gains and losses

court concluded that trevor stewart breached its duty to diversify investments by investing too heavily in longterm government bonds by investing 70 percent of the plans assets in longterm bonds rather than shortterm bonds the firm exposed the fund to greater degree of risk expert testimony had indicated that shortterm bonds or bonds with staggered maturity dates would have minimized exposure if the bonds were sold before maturity the court maintained that trevor stewarts investment exposed the fund to greater risk of cash outflows than was prudent38 similarly in brock v citizens bank of clovis the tenth circuit determined that trustees of the citizens bank of clovis pension plan breached their duty to diversify investments by investing over 65 percent of the plans assets in commercial real estate first mortgages39 the court maintained that the trustees significant investment in one type of security exposed the plan to multitude of risks moreover the court found that the trustees failed to establish that the investments were prudent notwithstanding the lack of diversification40 in metzler v graham the fifth circuit did not find violation of section 404a1c despite significant investment in one piece of real estate41 graham the sole trustee and administrator of pension plan invested 63 percent of the plan assets in 24251 acres of undeveloped land metzler the acting secretary of labor at the time of the suit alleged that the investment violated grahams duty to diversify investments the court maintained that grahams investment was prudent under the circumstances and thus within the exception in section 404a1c the court identified four factors that supported the position that graham did not imprudently introduce risk of large loss by purchasing the property42 first the plan was not required to make payments to beneficiaries until age 65 death or disability and the average age of the plan participants was 37 when the property was purchased remaining plan assets were available to cover projected payouts for the next twenty years second the purchase was better insulated from the possible return of high inflation when the plans holdings consisted solely of cash and short term instruments there was little hedge against inflation43 third there was significant cushion between the purchase price and the propertys appraised value

note 36 at a31 50975 f2d 1467 10th cir 1992grahams expertise in the development of industrial property supported the conclusion that the investment was prudent after considering these factors the court was persuaded that the investment did not carry risk of large loss duty to act in accordance with plan documents section 404a1d of erisa requires fiduciaries to discharge their duties in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with erisa44 courts have held that the duty imposed by section 404a1d does not require fiduciaries to resolve issues of interpretation in favor of plan fiduciaries45 in debruyne v equitable life assurance society of the united states the seventh circuit held that the investment manager of retirement plan did not violate section 404a1d by maintaining an allegedly imbalanced portfolio for one of its funds46 the plaintiffs participants in the plan argued that equitable assembled portfolio that was risky and volatile in contravention of plan documents they contended that equitables breach contributed to the funds losses particularly during the october 1987 stock market crash the court declined to find violation of section 404a1d the court observed that the language of the prospectuses and semiannual and annual reports gave equitable broad discretion to decide the mix of investments in the fund47 moreover equitable made continuous and consistent disclosures indicating that the balance in the fund could vary substantia lly48 the court concluded that the plaintiffs could not hold equitable to specific portfolio because equitable never made promises about the composition of its investments in interpreting section 404a1d courts have also held that fiduciaries do not breach the duty to act in accordance with plan documents if their failure to follow such documents results from erroneous interpretations made in good faith49 in morgan v independent drivers association pension plan the tenth circuit found that the trustees of pension plan did not violate section 404a1d because their decision to terminate the plan was considered in good faith and based on consultation with experts50 the trustees decision to terminate the plan was based on their understanding that the plan would be unable to pay required benefits following decision by the independent drivers association membership to change the way the plan was funded prior to making their decision the trustees sought advice from counsel and an outside actuary the plaintiffs participants in the plan argued that the termination was not authorized by and was contrary to the terms of the planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31282crs9 51morgan 975 f2d at 1470 52id quoting restatement second of trusts 201 cmt c 1959 when the question depends upon whether trustee has acted with proper care or caution the mere fact that he has made mistake of fact or of law in the exercise of his powers or performance of his duties does not render him liable for breach of trust in such case he is liable for breach of trust if he is negligent but not if he acts with proper care and caution 53see purcell supra note 2 describing additional pension reform measures introduced during the 107th congress hr 3762 the pension security act of 2002 was passed by the house on april 11

act of 2002the plaintiffs believed that trust law principles supported their position they argued that when trustee violates duty because of mistake as to the extent of his duties and powers he is not protected by liability even if he acts in good faith51 the court however maintained that the trustees mistake concerned the exercise of their powers or the performance of their duties rather than the extent of their powers52 the court noted that the trustees had broad authority to amend or modify the plan the trustees mistake was in their interpretation of the plan with regard to the effect of the new funding method such mistake would not result in liability if the trustees acted in good faith the court concluded that because the trustees made their decision in good faith after consulting with experts section 404a1d was not violated legislation to amend section 404a of erisa although numerous bills have been introduced to respond to concerns raised by the enron 401k plan only handful of those bills would amend section 404a the bills discussed in this section would amend section 404a to address lockdowns misrepresentations made by plan fiduciaries and investment in employer securities53 hr 3623 the employee savings protection act of 2002 would amend section 404a to prohibit misrepresentations relating to employer securities by plan fiduciaries under hr 3623 any knowing misrepresentation by fiduciary of an individual account plan concerning the present or expected valuation of an employer security that is either made during period of decisionmaking by the participant or beneficiary or potentially likely to induce decision by the participant or beneficiary would be treated as breach of fiduciary duty54 hr 3623 would ensure that employees who rely on fiduciarys misrepresentations to the detriment of their retirement savings can have legal claim that survives bankruptcy55 representative ken bentsen the bills sponsor maintains that erisa must be amended to
