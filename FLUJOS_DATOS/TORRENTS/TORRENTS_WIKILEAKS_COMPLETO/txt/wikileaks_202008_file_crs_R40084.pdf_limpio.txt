strategic arms reduction treaty in 1991 it entered into force in december 1994 and is due to expire in december 2009 the united states and russia have held several meetings to discuss options for continuing their arms control relationship but have not agreed on whether to extend start or how to replace it start counts each deployed icbm slbm bom ber as single delivery vehicle under the treaty limit of 1600 delivery vehicles and attributes an agreed number of warheads to each deployed delivery vehicle this attribution rule provides the total number of warheads that count under the 6000 warhead limit in the treaty to verify compliance with start each side monitors the numbers and locations of ballistic missiles launchers and heavy bombers deployed by the other country the parties use wide variety of means to collect informationor monitorthese forces and activities some of these monitoring systems such as overhead satellites operate outside the territories of the treaty parties they also have also been required to exchange copious amounts of data on locations operations and technical characteristics of the treatylimited items this verification regime has allowed the parties to remain confident in each others compliance with the treaty the united states and russia began to discuss their options for arms control after start expired in mid2006 they have however been unable to agree on path forward neither side wants to extend start in its current form as some of the treatys provisions have begun to interfere with some military programs on both sides russia wants to replace start with new treaty that would further reduce deployed forces while using many of the same definitions and counting rules in start the united states initially did not want to negotiate new treaty but would have been willing to extend informally some of starts monitoring provisions it has recently agreed to conclude new treaty with monitoring provisions attached but this treaty would resemble the far less formal strategic offensive reductions treaty that the two sides signed in 2002 in december 2008 the two sides agreed that they wanted to replace start before it expired but acknowledged that this task would have to be left to negotiations between russia and the obama administration the united states and russia could choose from number of options for the future of their arms control relationship they could allow start to lapse or they could extend start for five years they could extend start then amend it to ease some of the outdated provisions they could negotiate new treaty or they could pursue less formal arrangements to manage their nuclear forces moreover if new treaty included further reductions in nuclear weapons it could use some start definitions and counting rules or the less formal moscow treaty declarations this report will be updated as needed

and soviet union signed the strategic arms reduction treaty start on july 31 1991 after the demise of the soviet union in december 1991 the parties signed protocol that named the four former soviet republics with nuclear weapons on their territoryukraine belarus kazakhstan and russiaparties to the treaty1 start entered into force on december 4 1994 the treaty was to remain in force for 15 years unless replaced by subsequent agreement and therefore will expire on december 5 2009 2 according to article xvii of the treaty the parties must meet later than one year before this date to consider whether the treaty should be extended or allowed to lapse3 if the parties agree to extend the treaty the extension would last five years unless start were replaced by subsequent agreement during that time the united states and russia have held several meetings to discuss the options for continuing their bilateral arms control relationship after start but have not yet reached an agreement on whether to extend start or on how to replace it the discussions between the two parties along with the statements from members of congress and others following the process reflect not only on the specific issues that may be addressed in possible followon treaty but also on the broader question of what if any role arms control should play in future usrussian relations the united states and soviet union negotiated start between 1994 and 2001 it contains many detailed definitions and restrictions that not only limit the permitted number of nuclear warheads but also restrain the locations and movement of delivery vehicles carrying nuclear warheads and require extensive exchanges of data about them many of these provisions reflect the more competitive relationship between the united states and soviet union and the concerns that drove their inclusion in the treaty may longer seem as important to the usrussian relationship specifically some in the bush administration and the broader foreign policy community have argued that because the united states longer structures its nuclear forces in response to russian threat it longer needs treaty that restrains and reduces the weapons that make up that threat they therefore question whether the start treaty or usrussian nuclear arms control in general remain important as tools in the political relationship between the united states and russia some us critics of arms control argue that the bilateral arms control process should fade away after start expires they note that start may have served its purpose by helping to reduce the size of the russian arsenal after the demise of the soviet union and by restraining the permitted operations of the remaining forces but its reductions have been overtaken by deeper cuts mandated by the moscow treaty and the restrictions on russian forces also serve to restrict the flexibility of us forces in the current environment the united states may be better served by 1 the leaders in belarus ukraine and kazakhstan agreed to eliminate all of the nuclear wea pons on their territories and to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt as nonnuclear weapons states these three states have been nuclear free since the late 1990s all remaining sovietera nuclear warheads are deployed in russia 2 the united states and russia signed the strategic offensive reductions treaty also known as the moscow treaty on may 24 2002 they do not however consider this treaty to be successor to start article ii of the moscow treaty specifically states that the start treaty remains in force see crs report rl31448 nuclear arms control the strategic offensive reductions treaty by amy f woolf 3 the parties did not need to make decision about the future of start in december 2008 they just needed to meet to consider the question httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40084g21g157g155g138g157g142g144g146g140g561g3g155g150g156g561g5g152g151g157g155g152g149g561g3g143g157g142g155g561

nuclear forces than by retaining starts or similar restraints on us and russian forces others however argue that start remains relevant to the usrussian relationship and deserves to be either extended or replaced with similar treaty in this view the predictability created by starts welldefined restrictions on russian and us nuclear forces can benefit both countries moreover continuing this cooperation can help to restore some trust in the relationship between the two nations in addition some in russia still feel threatened by us nuclear weapons and continue to value the restraints provided by arms control treaties some members of congress have joined this debate with several endorsing the view that extending start and its monitoring and verification provisions will help improve the relationship between the united states and russia for example senator richard lugar has stated that the current usrussian relationship is complicated enough without introducing more elements of uncertainty failure to preserve the start treaty would increase the potential for distrust between the two sides 4 some also believe as senator lugar has noted that the failure to renew start will be seen worldwide as weakening the international nuclear nonproliferation regime and further sign to many foreign leaders and experts that us nonproliferation policy is adrift5 congress has limited influence on the process of seeking replacement for start if the united states and russia amend start or negotiate new treaty to replace it the senate will have to provide its advice and consent before the parties ratify the treaty however if the two parties do not reach any agreement and start lapses or if they choose simply to extend start for five years according to the provision in article xvii the senate would not have to approve or reject the outcome nevertheless congress can through resolutions hearings and consultations offer the administration its views on the future of the start treaty and the usrussian arms control process this report provides background information about the start treaty and reviews the discussions about possible successor to start it also presents range of alternatives that the united states and russia might consider if they choose to follow start with new framework for the arms control process

limits both the number of delivery systems and the number of warheads carried on these systems as table 1 below indicates each side can deploy 6000 attributed warheads on more than 1600 ballistic missiles and heavy bombers with more than 4900 attributed warheads on landbased and submarinebased ballistic missiles t able 1 central limits in st ar t deployed strategic nuclear delivery vehicles

deployed on soviet missiles when the treaty was signed within the aggregate limits on ballistic missile warheads start also limits each side to more than 1540 warheads on heavy icbms which are defined as those with throwweight greater than 4350 kilograms and 1100 warheads on mobile icbms these two limits are an added effort to restrain forces that the united states feared would provide the soviet union with an avenue to exceed the warhead limit the united states had long sought to use the arms control process to limit or eliminate the soviet monopoly on heavy icbms because it believed that the soviet union could expand the capabilities of these missiles by deploying them with more or higher yield the united states did not have any ba llistic missiles of this size and had plans to develop or deploy them the soviet union initially resisted us pressures to limit these missiles but eventually agreed to halve their force of 304 ss18 icbms each of which was deployed with 10 warheads under start as the start negotiations proceeded through the 1980s the united states also grew concerned about the soviet deployment of ballistic missil on mobile launchers the soviet union had begun to deploy singlewarhead ss25 missiles on roadmobile launchers and 10warhead ss24 missiles on railmobile launchers the united states considered these missiles both military and an arms control problem because the united states did not think it could locate and track these missiles all the time it believed it would be difficult to target them during conflict moreover because the soviet union had large land areas where it could operate and conceal these missiles us negotiators argued that the united states would not be able to monitor mobile icbm deployments well enough to count the missiles and verify soviet compliance with the limits in start the united states initially proposed that start ban mobile icbms even though it was considering the possible use of mobile launchers for its new 10warhead peacekeeper mx icbm and for prospective small singlewarhead icbm but after the united states and soviet union began to consider options for monitoring and verification regime that might track the numbers of mobile icbms they agreed to lim it rather than ban these systems the limited numbers when combined with location restrictions notifications prior to movement data

approved locations and continuous monitoring regime outside the final assembly facility for one type of mobile icbm would help each side count the number of acknow ledged mobile icbms and complicate efforts to conceal extra missiles or warheads even though the united states eventually dropped its plans to deploy mobile icbms it agreed to apply these limits and restrictions to the peacekeeper mx missiles that were deployed in silos start also limits the total amount of throwweight on each sides ballistic missiles to an amount equal to around 54 of the amount of throwweight on soviet missiles before the treaty entered into force throwweight is the combined weight of the postboost vehicle warheads guidance system penetration aids and other equipment found on the front end of missile it is considered to be measure of missiles destructive capacity because larger missiles with greater throwweight can carry larger or greater numbers of warheads hence this limit was further effort by the united states to limit the potential for the soviet union to add warheads to its missiles in violation of the treatys limits because soviet forces deployed when start was signed carried had than three times as much throwweight as us missiles the united states did not have to reduce its forces to comply with this limit however the united states could have exceeded the limit on throwweight if it had deployed new larger missiles while start remained in force g5g152g158g151g157g146g151g144g561g20g158g149g142g156g561 start counts each deployed icbm and its associated launcher each deployed slbm and its associated launcher and each deployed heavy bomber as single delivery vehicle under the treaty limit of 1600 delivery vehicles they count regardless of whether they are equipped with nuclear or conventional warheads they also continue to count under the treaty limits until the launchers or bombers are eliminated according to the treatys detailed elimination procedures for example bomber such as the b1 that has been converted to carry conventional weapons continues to count under the treaty limits moreover an empty missile launcher either on land or on ballistic missile submarine continues to count as if it still holds missile and the missile still carries the attributed number of warheads even if the missile system is deactivated or the launcher is converted to another purpose the number of warheads attributed to each type of missile or bomber is listed in an agreed data base7 for the most part the number of warheads attributed to each type of missile equals the maximum number of warheads that the missile had been tested with and could be equipped to carry when the treaty entered into force in some cases however such as for the us trident ii d5 missile the number of warheads attributed to the missile 8 fell below the maximum number the missile could carry 12 the soviet ss18 missile had also been tested with 12 or 14 warheads but the data base counted it as carrying only 10 the parties adopted this formula of counting delivery vehicles and attributing warheads to each type of delivery vehicle because although they sought to reduce warheads they could not monitor the actual numbers of warheads deployed on the delivery vehicles but could identify and count the large delivery vehicles with their monitoring systems 7 the most recent data base exchanged among the parties to the treaty can be found at us state department bureau of verification compliance and implementation start aggregate numbers of strategic offensive arms httpwwwstategovtvcir

maximum number that could be carried on those aircraft heavy bombers that are not equipped to carry longrange nucleararmed airlaunched cruise missiles alcms8such as the us b1 and b2 bombers count as only one warhead under the start limits this number applies even though these bombers can carry at least 16 bombs and shortrange missiles further heavy bombers that are equipped to carry alcms count as half of the maximum number of weapons they are permitted to carry start states that us bombers can be equipped to carry up to 20 alcms but they only count as 10 warheads under the treaty limit of 6000 warheads russian bombers can be equipped to carry up to 16 alcms and count as only 8 warheads under the treaty limit start allows the united states and soviet union to reduce the number of warheads attributed to particular type of ballistic missile through process known as downloa ding according to the treaty each party can reduce the attributed number listed in the data base for up to three types of missiles if they do this they must then reduce the number of warheads carried on each missile and if the number declines by more than 2 warheads they must replace the platform on the missile that holds the warheads so that it does not have space for the larger number of missiles this downloading process would allow each country to spread its 4900 ballistic missile warheads among greater number of missiles the countries use shortnotice onsite inspections to confirm that the number of warheads actually deployed on particular missile does not exceed the number of warheads attributed to that type of missile in the data base the united states has taken advantage of this provision with its minuteman iii and trident ii missiles existing types of missiles cannot be deployed with more warheads than the number attributed to that type of missile in the data base the number in the data base could only increase if the missile were altered to meet the definition of new type of missile start bans new types of heavy icbms for smaller missiles it contains an elaborate definition that is designed to allow the parties to distinguish between modified versions of existing ballistic missiles which would be subject to the warhead attribution numbers already in the data base and new types which would receive new warhead attribution number during the negotiations the parties agreed that the definition would reflect changes in missile characteristics such as the propellant used the number of stages its length and diameter and its throwwe ight but they differed on the magnitude of the changes that would define new type the united states feared that with smaller changes the soviet union would be able to have missile that was virtually identical to an existing missile declared new type with greater number of warheads and then might secretly backfit the older version with more warheads as well this was one of the last issues resolved in the start negotiations 9 g5g152g149g149g138g157g142g155g138g149g561g5g152g151g156g157g155g138g146g151g157g156g561 start contains detailed definitions of the items and activities limited by the treaty the parties have also been required to exchange copious amounts of detailed data on the technical characteristics of the treatylimited items the treaty mandates that the parties locate all strategic 8 longrange nucleararmed airlaunched cruise missiles are those with range of more than 600 kilometers 9 the soviet union suggested that 15 change in throwweight would be enough to distinguish new type

missile as one with 21 change in throwweight and at least 5 change in the length of the first stage this would make new types of missiles significantly different from existing types

assess whether another country is complying with an arms control agreement to verify compliance country must determine whether the forces and activities of another country are within the bounds established by the limits and obligations in the agreement treaty language forms the core of the verification regime it describes the limits and obligations the countries must observe and allows them to identify the forces and activities that comply with the terms of the treaty the identification of compliant activities also helps country focus on what it should look for when it collects information about the other countrys forces and activities verification regime can ensure the detection of all violations but the start regime is designed to ensure that parties would have high probability of detecting militarily significant violations the parties to treaty use wide variety of ans to collect informationor monitorthe forces and activities of the other parties some of these monitoring systems such as overhead satellites operate outside the territories of the treaty parties but the parties can also cooperate in providing information by exchanging data displaying treatylimited items and allowing onsite inspections once they have collected this information the parties analyze and refine the raw data to help develop meaningful picture of each others forces and activities they then evaluate the results of the monitoring process compare the observed forces and activities with the expected forces and activities and determine whether the other party has complied with its obligations under the terms of the treaty to verify compliance with start each side monitors the numbers and locations of ballistic missiles launchers and heavy bombers deployed by the other country to achieve this goal the countries have had to establish the number and location of deployed and stored ballistic missiles and deployed bombers when the treaty entered into force confirm the technical characteristics of existing types of weapons and establish the measurements for new types of weapons add the number of ballistic missiles and heavy bombers deployed after the

technical means of verification ntmto gather the vast majority of the information each needs to monitor the other countrys forces and activities and to determine whether the other country has complied with the limits in start but the treaty also contains number of specific verification provisions that are designed to he lp the parties gather and confirm the needed information for example it bans measures that would interfere with the parties ability to collect information with their ntm and requires that they use data exchanges notifications and onsite inspections to gather information about forces and activities limited by the treaty these measures do not replace monitoring with ntm but they can add detail to information collected by ntm enhance countrys confidence in the meaning and reliability of the information and help deter violations the treaty also established the joint compliance and inspection commission jcic where the parties meet to discuss treaty implementation issues

other countrys treatylimited forces these measures include ban on interference with ntmfor example the parties cannot interfere with the launch or operation of the other sides satellitesand requirement that they broadcast telemetry the technical data generated during missile flight tests over open channels start also bans efforts to conceal forces and activities from ntm and mandates that the parties display treaty limited items under certain circumstances so that ntm can confirm their locations and some characteristics the ban on data denial during missile flight tests was particularly important feature of start for the united states each nation transmits data known as telemetry during its flight tests of ballistic missiles even without start each nation monitored the others missile flight tests to gain information about characteristics such as missile throwweight launch weight and the number of reentry vehicles releases tested during the flight the nations could deny each other access to this data by encrypting it and transmitting it in coded form recording it during the flight and storing it aboard the missile for recovery after the test or by jamming and otherwise interfering with the other sides receiving instru ments because the united states believed that this information would be critical to its efforts to monitor soviet compliance with start it insisted that the treaty contain complete ban on the denial of data generated during flight tests not only must the parties broadcast unencrypted data during the tests they also agreed to exchange the tapes of data recorded during the flight tests g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561g7g161g140g145g138g151g144g142g156g561 start mandates that the parties exchange detailed information about

states and russia have conducted several different types of onsite inspections they use these inspections to collect information about permitted systems and activities at declared facilities but they are not permitted to go anywhere anytime in search of treaty violations these inspections may not provide much new information that is needed to verify compliance with the treaty but can confirm and add detail to information collected by ntm and data exchanges further with the short notice available before many of these inspections country would find it difficult to hide evidence of violation at declared facility start has permitted inspections at all the declared facilities that produce house and support ballistic missiles and heavy bombers the countries use these inspections to confirm information about the number of systems located at each facility they have also viewed treatylimited items to confirm information about their characterist ics for example they can use shortnotice inspections to confirm that the number of warheads on missile does not exceed the number attributed to that type of missile in the data base each country has also established permanent monitoring systems around final assembly facility for one of the other countrys mobile icbms to help them count mobile icbms as they enter the force each of the inspections permitted by the start treaty is governed by complex and detailed procedures that address everything about the inspection process these procedures outline among other things the airports the inspectors can use when they arrive in the country the amount of notice they need to give before the start of the inspection the amount of time the host country has to transport the inspectors to the selected site th types of equipment the inspectors can use the amount of time that can transpire during the inspection and the procedures the inspectors and hosts would use to resolve questions that came up during the visit these procedures and rules are designed to outline the rights and responsibilities of both parties and minimize any potential conflict that might occur during inspections but they also can create conflicts and of their own if questions about procedures come up during the process most analysts agree however that the start inspection process has had few significant problems over the years

designed to provide the parties with distinct source of information about the forces and activities of the other side they also mesh together in way that is designed to deter violations and increase confidence in the parties compliance with the treaty for example much of the data collected during onsite inspections can also be collected by ntm or shared during data exchanges the inspections essentially confirm expected information nevertheless this redundancy can detect inconsistencies and thereby complicate efforts to hide information and evade treaty limits for example if one party did not notify the other before it moved treatylimited item to different facility but the other partys ntm detected the movement the inconsistency might raise questions about whether the first party were trying to hide or conceal an item limited by the treaty over time the start regime has also allowed the parties to collect information that may not be central to the goals of the treaty but

year in office the bush administration conducted nuclear posture review to evaluate the size structure and role of the us nuclear arsenal as part of that review the administration determined that the united states could reduce its strategic forces to between 1700 and 2000 operationally deployed nuclear warheads during summit meeting with russias president vladimir putin in november 2001 president bush announced that the united states would pursue these reductions unilaterally in the next decade without signing formal arms control agreement president putin indicated that russia wanted to use the formal arms control process to achieve deeper reductions in nuclear arsenals and emphasized that the two sides should focus on reaching reliable and verifiable agreement 13 within the bush administration secretary of state colin powell supported the conclusion of legally binding arms control agreement he apparently prevailed over the objections of officials in the pentagon who reportedly wanted the united states to maintain the flexibility to size and structure its nuclear forces in response to its own needs14 consequently the united states and russia signed the strategic

march 6 2003 and the approval of the russian parliament on may 14 2003 it entered into force on june 1 2003 the moscow treaty states that the united states and russia will reduce their strategic nuclear warheads to between 1700 and 2200 warheads by december 31 201215 the text does not define strategic nuclear warheads and therefore does not indicate whether the parties will count only those warheads that are operationally deployed all warheads that would count under the start counting rules or some other quantity the text does refer to statements made by presidents bush and putin in november nd december 2001 when each outlined their own reduction plans as result the united states and russia each use their own definition when counting strategic nuclear warheads and neither uses the start counting rules the treaty does not limit delivery vehicles or impose sublimits on specific types of weapons systems each party shall determine its own composition and structure of its strategic offensive arms in addition the treaty does not contain any definitions or descriptions of the types missiles and bombers whose warheads count under the treaty limits in addition the moscow treaty does not contain any monitoring or verification provisions during the hearings on the resolution of ratification the bush administration noted that the united states and russia already collect information about strategic nuclear forces under start and during implementation of the nunnlugar c ooperative threat reduction program at the time some in congress questioned whether this information would be sufficient for the duration of the treaty since start expires three years ahead of the moscow treaty 16 this break in the time lines is one of the primary reasons why many analysts and members of congress believe the two sides should at least extend the monitoring and verification provisions in start through the end of the moscow treaty

kislyak met to initiate new strategic security dialogue this dialogue evolved into series of meetings that addressed range of issues start was included but was not high on the agenda of the meetings during the first meeting and at second one in december 2006 the two sides outlined their goals for the talks russia indicated that it wanted to follow start with new formal treaty that would be similar in size and complexity to start and would use many of the same definitions and counting rules as start russia also suggested that the two sides establish regular working group with meetings

relationship the united states also did not want to set up working group or negotiate new treaty to follow start and preferred to pursue broader strategic discussions within political framework18 in spite of their differences the united states and russia agreed that they should continue to implement some of the monitoring and verification provisions in start after the treaty expired russia proposed that they include these verification provisions in new legally binding treaty that would also limit the number of warheads permitted on each side according to one russian official these measures would have to be part of legally binding agreement to be permitted by domestic russian law 19 the united states however argued for less formal arrangement of transparency and confidencebuilding measures these could include voluntary notifications and site visits but would not contain the detailed procedures and provisions included in start20 although undersecretary of state joseph initially re jected the idea the two sides did hold series of meetings chaired at the assistant secretary level in search of possible monitoring and verification agreement they continued to disagree however on whether the verification measures should be voluntary or legally binding and whether they should be attached to formal treaty that would also limit the numbers of deployed warheads in addition to the periodic meetings at the undersecretary level josephkislyak then roodkislyak and the working group meetings at the assistant secretary level the united states and russia held several high level meetings that addressed the future of usrussian arms control for example secretary of state condole ezza rice met with russias foreign minister sergey lavrov in july 2007 their formal statement after the meeting said that the united states and russia reiterate their intention to carry out strategic offensive reductions to the lowest possible level consistent with their national security requirements and alliance commitments it added that the ministers discussed development of poststart arrangement to provide continuity and predictability regarding strategic offensive forces 21 but the united states still did not accept russias proposal to pursue formal treaty the us position began to shift later in 2007 secretary rice and secretary of defense robert gates held joint meetings in moscow with their counterparts in october and concluded that although the united states was still seeking some thing far less formal than major treaty it might accept according to secretary gates binding agreement preserving some of start as long as it was narrowly focused 22 nevertheless the united states continued to reject formal treaty that would limit the number of nuclear weapons when secretary gates and secretary rice traveled to moscow to discuss start again in march 2008 secretary rice argued the current usrussian relationship does not require the kind of highly articulated expensive limitations and verification procedures that attended the strategic arms relationship with the soviet union 23 18 nicholas kralev russia us to discuss start

to enact nuclear weapons reductions to the lowest possible level consistent with our national security requirements and alliance commitments they failed to agree on the way forward in their arms control relationship russia still wanted to negotiate treaty based on the start framework the united states was only willing to codify some verification measures 24 the talks continued through the spring and summer of 2008 although according to some news reports they were irregular and unproductive25 some reports suggested that the united states might suspend the talks in response to the russian incursion into georgia in august 2008 but both sides agreed the talks were important enough to continue in september and october 26 nevertheless the two sides remained far apart russia was unwilling to recede from its call for formal treaty with detailed definitions and counting rules the united states still preferred less formal agreement that outlined transparency and confidencebuilding measures the united state did however recognize that russia would not permit onsite visits without formal treaty so washington proposed in october 2008 that the two sides attach an informal transparency regime to legally binding treaty that essentially reiterated the limits and declarations outlined in the moscow treaty russia rejected this proposal in speech delivered on october 10 russian president dmitry medvedev said that russia attaches exceptional importance to concluding new legally binding russianamerican agreement on nuclear disarmament to replace start he

start treaty neither wants to continue to implement all the monitoring and verification provisions included in start the lengthy and highly detailed lists of procedures and requirements have proven costly and complicated in some cases these details were designed to address concerns about the potential for cheating and evasion that longer exist in the current environment moreover as is noted below some of the limits and restrictions have begun to interfere with ongoing weapons programs for both nations simple extension of start would not reduce these pressures and unless the parties could agree on new treaty could remain in force for five years g20g158g156g156g146g138g151g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g156g561 in speech to russian diplomats in june 2006 thenpresident vladimir putin proposed that the united states and russia begin negotiations to replace start with new treaty 30 since then russia has consistently and repeatedly insisted that the two sides replace start with treaty that would not only reduce each sides strategic offensive forces to 1500 warheads but would count the warheads on all deployed delivery vehicles as start has done31 such an agreement would maintain the predictability and the stability afforded by start an outcome that would not be possible in the absence of detailed legally binding treaty32 the new treaty would not need to keep all the provisions of start but should preserve the main systematic structure of the agreement including limitations on delivery vehicles and warhead deployments33 reports indicate that russia would like the new treaty to relax starts requirements for new types of ballistic missiles as was noted above start contains precise definition of the changes needed to have new missile counted as new type these provisions were designed to prevent russia from deploying its ss25 missile with more than one warhead but russia has developed the rs24 missile new variant of its singlewarhead ss27 missile which is itself variant of the ss25 and it plans to deploy this new missile with three warheads on each missile 34 because the missile does not satisfy the treatys new types definition it would be limited to single warhead under start and threewarhead version would violate the treaty this missile had its third successful test launch in late november 2008 and recent press reports indicate that russia now plans to deploy this missile in december 2009 as soon as start expires russian officials have indicated that this missile is critical to the future of russias strategic forces not only because it can carry up to three warheads but also because it will incorporate technologies that would allow it to penetrate us ballistic missile defenses 35 30 wade boese russia seeks new nuclear accord arms

ease some of the restrictions that start imposes on mobile icbms36 although these restrictions were intended to apply to both parties the united states has never been affected by them because it never deployed mobile icbms these provisions including limits on the size of deployment areas notifications about exercises and the rights to special onsite inspections after the missiles have dispersed for exercises were designed to complicate any effort to hide extra missiles within the legal deployments of mobile icbms but they also impinge on the operations of the permitted missiles and add to the costs of operating the systems 37 over the years russia has also expressed concerns about the us ability to add warheads to its missiles quickly by restoring warheads that had been removed under starts downloading provisions it may insist that new treaty require the united states to replace the platform on all downloaded missiles instead of just those that have had more than two warheads removed 38 russia would like to retain some of starts monitoring and verification provisions although it would like to make them less costly and cumb ersome for example the two sides could reduce the numbers of shortnotice inspections permitted each year and replace these inspections with less formal visits the parties could also reduce the number of mandatory notifications which were intended to help each side monitor the numbers and locations of treatylimited items and replace them with routine periodic data exchanges39 g23g495g21g495g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g156g561 when us and russian talks on the future of start began in 2006 the united states expected start to expire and the parties to pursue their own priorities when modernizing and modifying their nuclear forces however the participants in the us government were divided on the question of whether to extend starts monitoring provisions according to some reports us officials believed the two sides should evaluate whether they even needed to continue to implement these provisions because even without start the amount of military cooperation and transparency between them had increased over the years 40 they further argued that the inspections regime had become too costly and cumbersome for the united states and could interfere with military operations without providing certain knowledge about russians nuclear forces moreover in the new security environment the united states longer needs detailed information about russian forces it just needs to understand the general trends and pending changes in force size and structure therefore the two sides need at most an informal system with less structured visits and looser inspections others argued that the start regime provides valuable information about russian forces that is not available elsewhere while also helping to build confidence and cooperation between the two 36 anatoli diakov and eugene miasnikov restart the need for new usrussian

intelligence community have argued that without starts cooperative monitoring provisions it will not be able to assess with confidence russias compliance with the limits in the moscow treaty42 while the united states has not identified any of the central limits in start that impinge on its current plans and programs some officials have expressed concerns that an extension of these provisions or their inclusion in new treaty could affect future plans such as the possible deployment of conventional warheads on ballistic missiles and the potential deployment of these conventional missiles at sites that are not listed in the treaty 43 this concern has emerged as major roadblock in the recent usrussian discus sions about what type of treaty should follow start44 russia has insisted that the new treaty count the warheads that could be deployed on all strategic delivery vehicles as start did in part to capture the warheads that could be carried on missiles converted to carry conventional weapons it wants to count these warheads to limit the us ability to break out of the treaty by converting the missiles back to nuclear warheads 45 the united states however does not want the warheads that could be carried on these missiles to count under the treaty because it does not want any limits on conventional warheads or any forced tradeoffs between numbers of nuclear and conventional warheads us officials have also expressed concerns about some of starts monitoring and verification provisions for example the navy has indicate d that russian requests for reentry vehicle inspections on us ballistic missile submarines can interfere with the scheduled maintenance and operations of the submarines because the navy must bring the submarine into port and the missile into handling facility on the base the treatys limits on the number of warheads that can be removed or downloaded from trident submarines might also interfere with the navys deployment plans for the future particularly the united states chooses to remove more warheads from trident missiles as it continues to reduce the overall number of strategic warheads in its arsenal some in the us government have also argued that starts provisions requiring the exchange of telemetry data during flight tests of ballistic missiles will interfere with us military plans and programs 46 in particular the united states uses retired minuteman ii icbms as target vehicles during tests of its missile defense capabilities because these missiles are still limited by the start treaty the united states must provide russia with all the telemetry generated during these flights yet the data from these tests may reveal information not only about the minuteman ii icbms but also about the goals of the flight test and the characteristics of the missile defense interceptors this concern has been key issue in discussions about whether and how the united states and russia should extend some of starts monitoring

replace start with short legally binding treaty similar to the moscow treaty and longer nonbinding appendix on transparency and cooperation this transparency regime would be far less detailed and complex than start it would allow for informal visits without the detailed plans and notifications required by start and probably would relax th telemetry provisions or at least exempt minuteman ii flights during missile defense tests from the requirement to broadcast and exchange telemetry moreover as is noted above the legally binding portion of the us proposal would not contain any of the detailed definitions and counting rules of start the parties would declare their numbers of deployed warheads as they do under the moscow treaty

control process in response to questions posed by the arms control association thencandidate obama stated that he would seek russias agreement to extend essential monitoring and verification provisions of start before it expires he also said that he would seek real verifiable reductions in all us and russian nuclear weaponswhether deployed or nondeployed whether strategic or nonstrategic 47 his transition team has since reaffirmed these goals while this statement does not specify whether the new president will support an extension of start or its replacement with another agreement it indicates that he is more open to completing formal agreements with russia in general and to negotiating further reductions in us and russian nuclear forces the united states and russia have two distinct issues to consider when they contemplate the future of their arms control relationship first what if anything should they do within the next year to extend or replace start and second should they seek to negotiate new treaty to replace the moscow treaty before it expires in 2012 moreover should the provisions in new treaty focus on transparency and confidencebuilding measures or should the two nations also seek to impose deeper reductions on their strategic offensive forces it is unlikely that the united states and russia will be able to negotiate and ratify new treaty before the end of 2009 even though both sides have said they want to do so the obama administration has to name the senior state partment and defense department officials who may craft us policy on arms control and nuclear weapons develop its negotiating positions for future arms control treaty and negotiate and reach agreement on wide range of issues with russia both sides must present the treaty to their legislatures for advice and consent moreover during its first year in office the obama administration must conduct nuclear posture review 48 which could recommend changes in both us nuclear weapons policy and the us force structure these changes could affect us arms control proposals but the study will not be completed until early 2010 the united states and russia could choose from number of options for the future of their arms control relationship they could allow start to lapse or they could extend start for five 47 arms control today 2008 presidential qa democratic candidate barack

formal arrangements to manage their nuclear forces new treaty could include further reductions in nuclear weapons or it could simply establish transparency regime that called for continued cooperation in monitoring without further reductions in deployed weapons in their discussions thus far the united states and russia have agreed they do not want to extend start but they have been unable to agree on what kind of arrangement will follow start in part because they do not agree on the goals they seek to achieve in their discussions hence this paper will review some of the possible goals for the future of the usru ssian arms control relationship before it reviews the range of options g18g152g156g156g146g139g149g142g561g9g152g138g149g156g561

future of the usrussian arms control process focus on whether arms control can help the united states and russia manage and improve their broader political relationship as was noted at the beginning of this report many observers including some who served in the bush administration be lieve that the usrussian relationship has evolved to the point where the parties longer need arms control as symbol of their cooperation on resolving common security issues others however including some members of congress believe that start and the arms control process still represent the foundation of the usrussian strategic relationship and key basis for trust between the two sides 49

debate over arms control and nuclear weapons has increasingly focused on the role that the usrussi an arms control process can play in furthering broader international nuclear nonproliferation goals for example many analysts have argued that usrussian agreement to either extend or replace start can demonstrate their commitment to their arms reduction obligations under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty 50 and can therefore help strengthen the nonproliferation regime in general and help ensure successful outcome at the 2010 review conference of the npt others however argue that the nations who are currently seeking nuclear weapons would not be swayed in their decisions by any steps taken by the united states or russia as their nuclear programs derive from their own political and security concerns moreover they note that the united states and russia have already reduced their coldwar era nuclear arsenals sharply without reaping any benefits in their efforts to stem nuclear proliferation g20g142g156g157g155g138g146g151g146g151g144g561g25g142g138g153g152g151g156g561 many analysts in the united states and officials in the bush administration have argued that in the current security environment the united states and russia longer need to worry about all the details related to the size or structure of the other sides nuclear forces they just need to understand the general

therefore they longer need to negotiate formal treaties to establish and maintain balance between their two force structures moreover these treaties undermine the flexibility that each nation may need to adjusts its forces in response to future threats from emerging adversaries although russia recognizes that the relationship between the two nations is not as tense as it was during the cold war it still sees threats to its security from us policies and programs therefore russia continues to value arms control measures that restrain us forces because these measures provide both stability between the two sides forces and predictability for russia when it considers how us forces may evolve 52 many analysts in the united states also believe that the stability and predictability offered by arms control agreements are valuable enough to offset any limits the treaties may create for us flexibility some argue that the process of implementing an arms control treaty with its communication and cooperation by itself is important so that the parties can avoid misunderstandings while they work together to reduce nuclear forces and nuclear dangers others however emphasize that the actual limits and restrictions in the treaty as much as the cooperation to implement them determine the amount of stability and predictability offered by the treaty they note that the united states and soviet union included many of the detailed provisions in start because both wanted to restrain and reduce the nuclear forces of the other side to reduce the threat from those forces and both agreed to include detailed monitoring and verification provisions so that they could be more confident about achieving the goal of reducing the threat

the united states and russia should seek to replace start with regime that will ensure transparency and build confidence even if it does not mandate deeper reductions in nuclear weapons53 this type of agreement will ensure that some form of monitoring and verification provisions remains in place after start expires and while the moscow treaty remains in force confidencebuilding regime can foster cooperation between the two sides even if the data it provides is not needed to verify compliance with an arms control treaty as one observer has noted start forces the united states and russia to communicate and to interact in ways that can build trust between them54 therefore an agreement that allowed the parties to continue with data exchanges notifications and some inspections even without further reductions could prove valuable some argue that the united states and russia can promote transparency and continue their cooperation without signing formal arms control agreement they note that the two sides will continue to cooperate on reducing nuclear dangers through the nonproliferation and threat continued 2007 52 in recent interview with the arms control association russias ambassador to the united states sergey kislyak who as deputy foreign minister participated in talks on the future of start stated that the mutual constraints provided for in start should not be lost b

and eliminate weapons in russia these efforts can be bolstered by informal visits to weapons deployment areas and storage facilities moreover some have argued that the formal monitoring and verification provisions in start can create tensions and undermine cooperation with their rigid requirements and stringent rules which do not allow the parties to adapt their activities when conditions change55 g21g140g152g153g142g561 g20g142g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g156g561g159g156g495g561g22g155g138g151g156g153g138g155g142g151g140g162g561 some analysts have argued that start provides the united states and russia with the framework they could use to move quickly to negotiate comprehensive agreement that would both reduce forces below the moscow treaty limits and outline wideranging monitoring and verification regime 56 this approach would not only satisfy russias preference for pursuing deeper reductions in followon to start in the nearterm but would also allow the united states and russia to demonstrate bold leadership to the international community in the months before the 2010 npt review conference the two sides may not have time to complete this type of agreement before start expires but this could still advance the arms control agenda by highlighting their commitment to pursue treaty on deep reductions even if start were to lapse in the nearterm on the other hand some have argued that shorter less detailed document like the moscow treaty might be sufficient to foster communication and cooperation even without specific definitions and restrictions such document can still demonstrate the parties intent to reduce nuclear arms further with fewer detailed restrictions both sides would be able to maintain the flexibility they might need to alter their forces to meet unanticipated changes in the international security environment moreover the negotiations could probably proceed more quickly than those that sought to produce lengthy detailed treaty the united states and soviet union took seven years to negotiate start but the united states and russia completed the moscow treaty in less than year g14g146g151g148g138g144g142g156g561 the start treaty limits only strategic offensive delivery vehicles and the warheads carried by those forces but the history of ussoviet arms control negotiations is full of examples where one or the other side has tried to

treaty and the interim agreement on offensive arms this linkage between offenses and defense remains important to russia as is evident in its concerns about the us plans to deploy missile defense site in poland and the czech republic several analysts have also suggested that future treaties should limit not only deployed warheads but also the numbers of warheads that each side retains in its stockpile of reserve warheads58 while arms control treaty has ever sought to reduce either nations stockpile of reserve warheads as the number of deployed warheads declines further the number of warheads in storage could create an imbalance if either side could return them to deployment quickly moreover reductions in the numbers of stored warheads and their consolidation in fewer storage facilities might ease concerns about the possibility that some might be stolen from insecure storage facilities g18g138g155g157g146g140g146g153g138g151g157g156g561 although the united states and soviet union signed start as bilateral agreement it evolved into multilateral treaty when belarus ukrain russia and kazakhstan succeeded the soviet union as parties to the treaty each of the four former soviet states is subject to the limits restrictions and monitoring provisions in start even though russia is the only one with nuclear weapons left on its territory each also has voice and vote in the deliberations in the joint compliance and inspection commission established by the treaty if the parties agree to extend start ukraine belarus and kazakhstan will remain as parties to the treaty unless they agree to amend it to include only the united states and russia if the united states and russia sign new treaty these other three states probably would not be included 59 analysts have long suggested that as the united states and russia reduce their forces to ever lower levels they may eventually open up the arms control process to other nuclear weapons states this was rarely an issue during the cold war because the united states and soviet union each deployed thousands of warheads on their strategic offensive nuclear weapons france great britain and china have deployed just few hundred warheads each60 most analysts agree that these other nations should not join the process until the united states and russia reduce to 1000 or fewer warheads hence as the united states and russia decide how or whether to advance their bilateral arms control agenda they may also begin to think about when or whether to expand the process to include other nuclear nations 58

option because it did not want to continue the formal us russian arms control process at all but also believed that start could lapse without signaling the end of usrussian nuclear cooperation or even the end of formal arms control as the bush administration eventually suggested the two sides could agree without signing formal treaty to continue to implement some of the monitoring provisions in start so that they could both gather information needed to verify compliance with the moscow treaty and retain the cooperative relationship that had developed during starts verification process this path could however conflict with russias domestic law as it would need to be party to legally binding treaty before it could allow foreigners to have access to sensitive military and nuclear sites 61 to rectify this problem the parties might seek to negotiate separate executive agreement or memorandum of understanding to allow the visits alternatively they could as the bush administration suggested attach the monitoring provisions to simple treaty document that essentially restated the provisions of the moscow treaty if the parties allowed start to lapse and did not have the time to agree on replacement before december 2009 they could still pursue negotiations on treaty that would eventually replace both start and the moscow treaty concerns about the absence of any arms control limits might inspire them to press forward on this task and seek compromises in short amount of time conversely if the absence of arms control limits did not appear to upset stability or the level of cooperation between the parties then the pressure to reach new agreement might diminish hence this path may be attractive to those who believe that the united states and russia longer need formal treaties to manage their re lationship but it may appear too risky to those who believe that the arms control process remains an important part of the relationship g7g161g157g142g151g141g561g21g22g3g20g22g561 neither the bush administration nor the current russian leadership want to extend start in its present form particularly for the full five years allowed under the terms of the article xvii yet this path may be the only one available if the parties want to retain some of the start monitoring and verification provisions in the near term they could possibly agree to extend start for shorter period of time perhaps two years while they negotiate new treaty that would replace start but this option is not mentioned in the current treaty so it might need to be treated as an amendment to the treaty and require the advice and consent of both nations legislatures the us senate might not object to shortterm extension of start particularly since several members have already called on the parties to extend the treatys monitoring and verification regime but russias parliament may not be as accepting the current tensions in the usrussian relationship along with ongoing concerns about us plans to deploy missile defenses in poland and the czech republic could lead some in russia to question whether any extension of start with its limits on russias ability to modernize its forces and deploy multiple warhead ballistic missiles serves russias interests 61 alexei arbatov and rose gottemoeller new presidents new agreements advancing

might extend start according to the treaty provisions which they could do without seeking approval from their legislatures then try to amend the treaty to adjust the provisions that each finds too binding in the current environment for example russia might want to alter the new types rule in start or it might seek waiver from the rule for the rm24 missile the united states might want to alter the provision requiring the exchange of telemetry from missile flight tests or seek waiver for retired minuteman ii missiles that are used as missile defense targets both sides might want to modify the verification protocol to remove some of the more costly and intrusive requirements particularly if the parties believe the data they provide is longer critical to understanding the other sides nuclear forces consequently they might be able to craft package of amendments that would incorporate each sides highest priorities both the united states and russia would have to submit this package for approval by their legislatures some in the us senate might object to the changes that relieve russia of some of its obligations but package that addressed both nations concerns might still win the approval of the necessary 67 senators the russian parliament might object to any agreement that extended start without addressing russias concerns about us missile defense plans however it might nevertheless accept an amendment package that addressed some of russias concerns with the provisions in start in addition if the united states and russia extended start for five years before negotiating the amendments the russian parliament would have to accept either the unmodified extension or the amendment package g20g142g153g149g138g140g142g561g21g22g3g20g22g561 regardless of whether they allow start to lapse or extend it before december 2009 the united states and russia could continue negotiations on new treaty if they completed the treaty before an extended start expired the new treaty could replace start or if it were similar to the moscow treaty with aggregate limits but detailed definitions counting rules or monitoring provisions it could run concurrently without substituting for start as was noted above russia would like the new treaty to be complete package of further limits on nuclear weapons detailed definitions and counting rules and monitoring and verification provisions the bush administration on the other hand would have liked the new treaty to essentially replace the moscow treaty with some informal monitoring provisions to offer measure of transparency and cooperation future treaty could take either of these forms or it could focus solely on monitoring measures by establishing legally binding framework for transparency and cooperation

rules along with deeper reductions in the permitted numbers of warheads this combination of provisions would continue to reduce us and russian deployed forces and would also provide transparency and

reduce its forces below the moscow treaty limits of 17002200 warheads but also used the start counting rules to calculate the number of warheads attributed to deployed delivery vehicles could force the united states to make hard choices and significant changes in the structure of its nuclear forces under start all deployed delivery vehicles count under the treatys limits russia has proposed that the same be true in new agreement the parties then calculated the number of deployed warheads by multiplying the number of deployed delivery vehicles by number of warheads listed in the data base for that type of delivery vehicle the moscow treaty on the other hand does not assume all delivery vehicles carry deployed warheads and allows the parties to exclude those that do not as result the united states does not count the launchers or warheads on 2 of its 14 trident submarines because they are in overhaul and not deployed these would count under the start rules it also has removed more than 2 warheads from some trident missiles without changing the front end of the missile under start these missiles would count as 6 warheads each in its declaration under the moscow treaty the united states counts only the aggregate number of actual deployed warheads it does not even have to specify how many warheads are deployed on any given missile or submarine moreover under the moscow treaty the united states counts only the bomber weapons maintained in the active stockpile at us bomber bases under start each bomber equipped to carry cruise missiles would count as 20 warheads regardless of available weapons or actual deployments these differences produce striking differences in the number of warheads that count under each treaty in may 2008 the united states declared that it had 2871 operationally deployed strategic warheads that would count against the moscow treaty 62 at the same time when it exchanged start data with russia in july 2008 it stated that it had 5951 warheads attributed to deployed icbms deployed slbms and heavy bombers many of these attributed warheads could be eliminated with some accounting changes63 but it is clear that under start definitions the united states would have to count hundreds of warheads that it excludes from the moscow treaty total because it does not consider them to be operationally deployed to bring its warhead totals down to 1500 or less while using definitions and counting rules similar to those in start the united states could seek to deploy each of its remaining trident missiles with smaller number of warheads however if start rules apply reduction of more than 2 warheads would necessitate the costly replacement of the platform on the postboost vehicle on each missile the united states could suggest that the new treaty relax this rule but russia may object as it has been concerned about the us ability to upload its missiles and increase its warheads in crisis russia has long suggested that the parties tighten the downloading rules to minimize the possibility 62 us department of state 2008 annual report on implementation of the moscow treaty bureau of verification compliance and implementation washington dc may 13 2008 63 for example this total includes 400 warheads attributed to peacekeeper missiles these missiles have been deactivated but the united states did not eliminate the silos according to start treaty rules so the warheads still count it also excludes up to 768 warheads that could be deployed on four trident submarines the us navy has converted these submarines to carry nonnuclear cruise missiles but b ecause it did not remove the launch tubes for the trident missiles they still count under start as if each launch tube held one missile and each missile carried either six or eight warheads

warheads by eliminating some of its deployed launchers bombers icbms or slbms or even removing one leg of its strategic triad from the nuclear force however the united states probably would not want to reduce the number of b52 and b2 bombers as these fly conv entional missions in ongoing conflicts so it might have to remove them from the nuclear force altogether it also might be difficult to reduce the minuteman fleet of icbms below the current number of 450 without also reducing the number of bases and cutting into the number of personnel trained to operate the system further as the number drops it may be also be difficult to justify the costs associated with retaining the smaller force most experts agree that the trident submarines are going to be the mainstay of the us nuclear arsenal in the future but unless the united states cuts deeply into the other legs of its strategic triad deep reductions in total warheads may require reductions in the number of trident submarines if the united states were to reduce its trident fleet to 10 or fewer submarines it might not be able to operate out of two bases as it does now and retain submarines on patrol in the areas from where they would fire their missiles in both oceans changes in this deployment pattern might require changes in the missions and targets of the submarine fleet the president and the us military would probably want to consider the implications of these basing and operational changes before deciding whether to accept arms control limits that produce such changes hence if the united states agrees to replace start with new treaty that reduces warheads below the levels in the moscow treaty but retains many of the definitions and counting rules of start it will have to make difficult choices about how to structure and operate its nuclear force these decisions are not likely to come easily or quickly and could delay both the start and the finish of negotiations on new treaty

bush administration has been unwilling to follow start with similar detailed document even those in the administration who believe that the usrussian arms control process should continue argue that the two sides should pursue treaty that did not contain the level of detail in start for example during speech before the carnegie endowment for international peace in october 2008 secretary of defense robert gates said i am not sure that agreements that are the size of telephone book and take years to negotiate are in the interest of either party he went on to say i believe we should go for another agreement with russia i believe it could involve further cuts in the number of warheads i believe we do need the verification provisions but i think it ought to be an agreement that is shorter simpler and easier to adjust to realworld conditions than most of the arms control agreements ive seen over the last 40 years 64 shorter less detailed treaty may not however provide the level of transparency or predictability sought by many analysts under the moscow treaty which is short and contains few details neither the united states nor russia has to offer any transparency into the structure of its nuclear forces each simply has to declare how many warheads it has deployed on its operational forces further because the treaty includes time lines for the reduction process 64

side can predict with confidence the process or outcome of the other sides reductions as result some argue that while the shorter negotiations may seem preferable shorter treaty with an absence of

members of congress and analysts outside government have called on the united states and russia to extend the monitoring regime in start even if they cannot reach agreement on further reductions in nuclear forces in dear colleague letter circulated in july 2007 representative ellen tauscher chair of the house armed services committee subcommittee on strategic forces noted the transparency required by the start verification regime has bred confidence in both russia and the us enabling cooperation on range of nuclear arms issues 65 an agreement that established transparency regime without imposing any further reductions on nuclear weapons could allow the united states and russia to sustain their confidence in their knowledge of each others nuclear weapons deployments the start regimes extensive exchanges of data about the characteristics of each partys weapons systems provide each party with significant amounts of information that would not have been available or would have been difficult to acquire otherwise the parties can be confident in the accuracy of this data because they have the opportunity to visit the sites and view the weapons themselves moreover start required each party to notify the other when they changed the numbers or locations of strategic systems even if the parties have not agreed to limit or reduce their nuclear weapons they could continue to house their weapons at agreed sites provide data about their characteristics and capabilities and provide notifications when they moved them some have also argued that by continuing to cooperate in monitoring the locations and characteristics of deployed nuclear weapons the united states and russia would be better positioned to monitor compliance with the moscow treaty the notifications and data exchanges would continue to inform them about the numbers and locations of missiles and bombers while onsite visits would give them an opportunity to count the warheads deployed on some missile these inspections would not however provide the pa rties with an opportunity to calculate all the warheads that would count under the moscow treaty because start inspections were designed to confirm that the number of warheads deployed on particular missile did not exceed the number declared in the data base they do not provide way to count the total number warheads deployed on the entire force however by confirming that the deployed warhead number did not exceed the number in the data base the inspections could provide the parties with some confidence in the number of warheads they might then use in their calculations of deployed warheads across the force 65 representative ellen tauscher call on the president to extend the mo st significant remaining arms control agreement of our time

although presidentelect obama has stated that he would like the united states and russia to negotiate deeper reductions in their nuclear weapons the united states and russia still may not be on the same path forward in their arms control relationship they still have to decide what if anything to do about start before it expires and what if any type of treaty they should negotiate to replace start in the longer term they may agree that the treaty should contain more details than were included in the moscow treaty but they will still have to decide which of starts counting rules and definitions will continue to apply whether the new treaty would ease or tighten the rules governing the downloading of missiles and the deployment of new types of missiles and which of the treatys monitoring and verification provisions they would continue to implement moreover they would have to decide whether to include only deployed warheads or all deployed and reserve warheads and whether to link reductions in strategic weapons to other issues like nonstrategic nuclear weapons or missile defense 66 because each side would like some of start to continue and some of it to end both may find it difficult to reach an agreement on the substance of new treaty that matches their priorities on the other if they balance and offset their differing preferences and priorities they may be able to craft compromise that provides them with more transparency and predictability than the moscow treaty but less precision than the start treaty this report will be updated as the process moves forward
