109163 as amended provides the secretary of defense with new authority to train and equip foreign military forces and foreign maritime security forces this is the first major dod authority to be used expressly for the purpose of training the national military forces of foreign countries generally dod has trained and equipped foreign military forces through state department programs the bush administration requested this global train and equip authority because dod viewed the planning and implementation processes under which similar state department security assistance is provided as too slow and cumbersome1 1 state department programs under which foreign military forces are trained are the international military education and training imet and the expanded imet eimet programs equipment is provided to foreign governments through the state department foreign military salesforeign military financing fmsfmf programs according to dod this traditional security assistance takes three to four years from concept to execution while global train and equip authority allows response to emergent threats or opportunities in six months or less us department of defense fiscal year

to support military and stability operations in which us armed forces are participating dod does not use section 1206 authority for operations in iraq and afghanistan however according to dod officials in action on the duncan hunter ndaa for fy2009 pl 110417 congress rejected the administrations 2008 request to make section 1206 authority permanent law under title 10 armed services of the united states code instead it extended the temporary authority for three years ie through fy2011 in 2007 and 2008 congress turned down administration requests to extend section 1206 authority to foreign police and security forces including in 2008 gendarmerie constabulary internal defense infrastructure protection civil defense homeland defense coast guard border protection and counterterrorism forces nevertheless the fy2009 duncan hunter ndaa did expand section 1206 authority to include category not specifically mentioned in the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22855 2008

its 2008 request for permanent section 1206 authority the administration requested that spending authority be increased to 750 million but in its fy2009 budget request asked for 500 million in spending authority for that year instead in the fy2009 duncan hunter ndaa congress increased the authorized amount to 350 million in the same bill congress also provided authority for funds to be used in consecutive fiscal years ie funds made available for program begun in one fiscal year may also be used for that program in the next fiscal year the table below provides data on section 1206

among other things the program country budget and completion date as well as the source and planned expenditure of funds crs3 joint dodstate department approval process as modified by the fy2007 john warner ndaa section 1206 authority permits the secretary of defense to provide such support with the concurrence of the secretary of state according to dod and state department officials that term has been interpreted to mean the secretary of states approval section 1206 requires both secretaries to jointly formulate any program and coordinate in its implementation their respective agencies have developed an extensive joint review process that some officials see as potential model for other assistance programs section 1206 programs are developed under dualkey authority ie with the approval of both dod and department of state officials us embassies and the military combatant commands are encouraged to jointly formulate programs both parties must approve each program explicitly in writing2 before the proposal is submitted to dod and state department staff in washington dc for their concurrence and ultimately the approval of the secretaries of defense and state3 table 1 section 1206
