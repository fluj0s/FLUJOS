6110c19 shspec69 q and period flows pointers on running problems intensives any auditing command has the potentiality of flows in it if the pc is running command with the flow always from to b the pc could go into an occlusion you could then have him run it the other way few times and it will unocclude all stuck flows give stuck needles you see this in withholds too withhold is nonpermitted flow so anything going in against it sticks nothing can backflow youll see the ta rise and the needle stick the more you make him conscious of it the more tightly he squashes himself with the withhold you finally trigger it this reverses the flow and you get blowdowns in withhold the pc regrets the backflow eg he should not have backflowed the bullet when he killed the king of france he shouldnt have backflowed in the first place so he is withholding it he can receive everything you tell him about the king of france but nothing can come out about the king of france watch the needle go up and stick the more questions you flow in the more he packs it in when he stops withholding the ta goes down from reversing the flow there are lots of directions of flows but five or ten ways seems pretty adequate if you only run pc to another and another to pc you can start getting the other persons flows jamming and you will again get stuck meter this doesnt pose problem if you are running it for short time only you can overrun flow on prehav run or all flows can run out you can run flow too long in one direction and get high ta then it can blow up with blowdown you can overrun it in which case the more you run it the more stuck it is going to get the mind is capable of considerable resurgence by getting in ruds you give the mind the freedom to look at pt with that freedom comes the ability to asis this makes it possible to use fiveway bracket instead of 32way bracket auditing is not an absolute practice fortunately if everything bad that ever happened to the pc had to be audited out youd be at it forever if you pull certain pins enough will blow so that the mind can resurge if the ruds are in problems intensive is run so that the mind can resurge enough to let you run goals easily auditors can have trouble with the idea of flows if they dont realize that the mind is full of particles thoughts get connected with the particles and the particles get connected with solids and masses so the pc tries to think and runs into solids you try to audit him and run into particles theres nothing wrong with the pcs thinkingness per the trouble is that it gets joined up with energy space time and particles so he cant think of time without getting space or of thought without getting particles or masses he cant differentiate amongst these things or amongst the dynamics the preclear identifies the sixth dynamic particularly with with all the dynamics and the seventh dynamic gets identified with the reactive mind thinkingness only goes haywire when person can longer differentiate where he should or associate where he should he identifies even on semantic level eg he road boat you can get some amazing results with semantics like the airline pilot who came in looking for the phrase that gave him compulsion to have accidents while flying his mother has said hes earthly good which reactively made him fly even though he hated it leukemia was once found to be caused by the mothers phrase it would turn your blood to water but auditing by phrases requires very good auditor and it doesnt work on everybody if it worked well and easily wed still be doing it it is mistake to let the pc run only oneway flows the pc has been motivating for years and years not just in session what is holding it pinned is lack of any reverse flow it looks moral to the pc but its not its that he started an outflow along certain tone level making line along which an interchange could occur having done so he can be inflowed on at that level this is all based on the horrible fact that thetan can never be inflowed on until he has outflowed how could he have been located by someone else otherwise this leads to the safe solution of never being anywhere or saying anything of course then youll never do anything or see anything and nothing will ever happen ever the police evidently operate on this since its being there and communicating that are punished someone in apathy has solved life this way and hes easy to inflow on so he gets kicked if hes not careful though he may get reputation for being good listener yet people get taught this be good listener dont be obtrusive be little late but it backfires when making up auditing commands be sure it is understood and that it reads on the meter and that it is explicit and that you get it answered every time and dont set up stuck flow situation even flow of giving punishment to someone will violate games condition because it is giving something to an enemy so it makes one feel degraded and start figuring on it war is degrading because soldiers are always giving things to their enemies this sets up bad games conditionan auditor shouldnt run contrarytogamescondition process which is all give or one that violates flows with all receive there are wordings that allow for any flow eg what was happening or what was unknown if the pc cant run unknown you can use forgotten the lower harmonic of unknown use any of the notknow words if necessary dont leave the problem unrun if you start getting into stuck flow on process you can just end the process without too much fuss and add another flow to it eg by saying now we are going to add another side to this if your intention is to get auditing done rather than to follow ritual itll go down just fine anything that goes wrong to pc in session is registered by him on the basis of scarcity of auditing and is best remedied by giving him auditing if you run withholds lot eg unkind thoughts you can wind up with stuck flow unless you run the overt as the outflow in the problems intensive the osection is list of selfdetermined changes the pc has made in this lifetime the list is assessed out by elimination and the item is then handled in the psection the auditor gets the problem that preceded this change he runs it on what is unknown about that problem with the terminal in the problem or some such process later version omits running it then the confusion prior tc the change later prior to the problem is located and the dramatis personae of the confusion are sec checked getting off all the and ws in the area of the confusion until the problem longer reacts then another selfdetermined change is assessed out etc later version of the problems intensive is given in hcob 9nov61 the problems intensive use of the prior confusion the number of problems person has determines how fast or slow he will audit and his speed of accomplishment in life in general so hell speed up in life when you get his problems out of the way
