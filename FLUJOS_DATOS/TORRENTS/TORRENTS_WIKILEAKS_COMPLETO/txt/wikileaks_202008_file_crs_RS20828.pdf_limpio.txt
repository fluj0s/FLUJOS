starting in 1992 with new york v united states1 the supreme court began what some commentators have referred to as rebirth of federalism2 recent chapter in this rebirth involves trio of cases from

must identify conduct that violates the fourteenth amendment and must tailor its legislation to remedying or preventing such conduct 4 521 us 507 1997 5 id at 518the extent to which congress can abrogate the states sovereign immunity from suit in other words congress may statutorily allow state to be sued by individuals but this congressional power is limited and has become even more circumscribed with the courts determination in garrett the eleventh amendment states the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state the supreme court has found that the eleventh amendment applies to suits by citizens against their own states and cannot be abrogated by the use of article i powers but that section 5 of the fourteenth amendment can be used for abrogation in certain limited circumstances section 5 of the fourteenth amendment states the congress shall have the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article the circumstances where section 5 of the fourteenth amendment can be used to abrogate the eleventh amendment were discussed in the recent supreme court decisions they reiterated the principle that the congress may abrogate state immunity from suit under the fourteenth amendment and found that there were three conditions necessary for successful abrogation congressional power is limited to the enactm ent of appropriate legislation to enforce the substantive provisions of the fourteenth amendment the legislation must be remedial in nature there must be congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented and the means adopted to that end the clearest pregarrett discussion of these conditions is found in city of boerne v flores4 where the supreme court held that the religious freedom restoratio n act rfra exceeded congressional power in reaching its holding the court acknowledged that section 5 was positive grant of legislative power to congress legislation which deters or remedies constitutional violations can fall within the sweep of congress enforcement power even if in the process it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional5 the grant of authority to congress is not unlimited however acknowledging that the line between measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions and measures that make substantive change in the governing law is not easy to discern and congress must have wide latitude in determining where it lies the court emphasized that there must be congruence and proportionality between the injury to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20828crs3 6 id at 519520 7 id at

applying this analysis to factual situations the court compared and contrasted rfra and the voting rights act congress had before it record of state voting laws passed due to bigotry when it passed the voting rights act the court found such record of religious persecution occurring during the past forty years examined during the enactment of rfra but even if there had been stronger legislative record the court found that rfra could not be considered remedial rfra is so out of proportion to supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to or designed to prevent unconstitutional behavior7 the court observed that rfra would require state to demonstrate compelling interest and show that it has adopted the least restrictive means of achieving that interest test that is the most demanding test known to constitutional law8 the supreme courts decision in kimel v florida board of regents9 used the same reasoning advanced in its earlier eleventh amendment cases to conclude that the age discrimination in employment act adea exceeded congressional authority under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment the adea prohibits discrimination by an employer due to age and provides several exceptions for example where there is bona fide occupational qualification in 1974 the adea was amended to extend its discrimination prohibition to the states quoting extensively from city of boerne v flores the kimel court adhered to its conditions for abrog ation limiting congressional power to 1 the enactment of appropriate legislation 2 remedial legislation and 3 congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented and the means adopted to that end the adea requirements were not found to be appropriate the court stated that the substantive requirements the adea imposes on state and local governments are disproportionate to any unconstitutional conduct that conceivably could be targeted under the equal protection clause10 age classifications were not seen as so seldom relevant to the achievement of any legitimate state interest that laws grounded in such considerations are deemed to reflect prejudice and antipathy11 in addition the court found older persons have not been subjected to history of purposeful unequal treatment and old age does not define discrete and insular minority because all persons if they live out their normal life spans will experience it12 as consequence the adea was found to prohibit substantially more state employment decisions and practices than would likely be held unconstitutional under the applicable equal protection rational basis standard13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20828crs4 14 473 us 432 1985 in cleburne the supreme court applied the fourteenth amendment to individuals with mental retardation and found that although such individuals were not part of suspect class zoning ordinance which excluded group homes from certain locations violated the fourteenth amendment 15 slip op at

ery of monetary damages by state employees under title i of the ada garrett involved two consolidated cases brought by separate alabama employees one of the employees patricia garrett had been undergoing treatment for breast cancer when she alleged she was transferred to lesser position after having been told that her supervisor did not like sick people the second plaintiff milton ash alleged that the alabama department of human services did not enforce its nonsmoking policy and that therefore he was not able to control his asthma the eleventh circuit held that the state was not immune from suits for damages the supreme court reversed writing for the majority chief justice rehnquist briefly examined the adas statutory language and the general principles of the eleventh amendment immunity he observed that the first step in applying these principles was to identify the scope of the constitutional right at issue in other words to identify constitutional rights to individuals with disabilities have to be free from discrimination discussing cleburne v cleburne living center 14 chief justice rehnquist emphasized that discrimin ation against individuals with disabilities is entitled to only minimum rationalbasis review and stated thus the result of cleburne is that states are not required by the fourteenth amendment to make special accommodations for the disabled so long as their actions towards such individuals are rational they could quite hard headedly and perhaps hardheartedly hold to job qualification requirements which do not make allowance for the disabled if special accommodations for the disabled are to be required they have to come from positive law and not through the equal protection clause15 after examining the constitutional rights of individuals with disabilities the majority opinion in garrett examined whether congress had identified history and pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the states against individuals with disabilities chief justice rehnquist observed that the authority of congress under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment is appropriately exercised only in response to state transgressions16 he found that the legislative history of the ada did not identify such pattern although the record was replete with examples of discrimination chief justice rehnquist noted that most of these examples were drawn from units of local government and not the states and that the eleventh amendment does not extend its immunity to units of local government17 although the examples regarding state discrimination involved among others department head at the university of north carolina who refused to hire and applicant who was blind microfilmer at the kansas department of transportation who was fired due to his epilepsy and deaf workers at the university of oklahoma who were paid lower salary than those who could hear the garrett majority observed that whether such actions would rise to irrational constitutional discrimination was debatablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20828crs5 18 slip op at 13 19 slip op at 14 20 slip op at 14 21 slip op at 16 22 concurring op at 3the majority opinion went on to note that even if constitutional discrimination were assumed for these instances they do not sugges t the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination necessary for enactment of legislation under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment chief justice rehnquist further stated that had congress truly understood this information as reflecting pattern of unconstituti onal behavior by the states one would expect some mention of that conclusion in the acts legislative findings there is none18 the garrett majority observed that even if pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by states was found issues relating to whether there was congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented and the means adopted would raise concerns chief justice rehnquist observed that it would be entirely rational and therefore constitutional for state employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who are able to use existing facilities but that the ada requires that existing facilities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities19 the adas accommod ation requirements were seen as far exceeding what is constitutionally required20 the adas requirements forbidding standards criteria or methods of administration that disparately impact individuals with disabilities were also seen as inconsistent with the requirements for legislation under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment in conclusion the majority opinion stated that congress is the final authority as to desirable public policy but in order to authorize private individuals to recover money damages against the states there must be pattern of discrimination by the states which violates the fourteenth amendment and the remedy imposed by congress must be congruent and proportional to the targeted violation those requirements are not met here21 however after reaching this holding the garrett majority went on to note that it does not mean that individuals with disabilities have federal recourse the opinion was limited to the recovery of monetary damages and the standards of title i of the ada were seen as still applicable to the states in addition the court noted that the federal government could enforce those rights in actions for monetary damages and that state law would offer some means of redress in concurring opinion justices kennedy and oconnor emphasized the limited nature of the opinion stating that what is in question is not whether the congress acting pursuant to power granted to it by the constitution can compel the states to act what is involved is only the question whether the states can be subjected to liability in suits brought not be the federal government but by private persons seeking to collect moneys form the state treasury without the consent of the state22 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20828crs6 23 dissenting op at 3 24 dissenting op at 9 25 dissenting op at 14 citing katzenbach v morgan 384 us 641 648 n7 26 linda greenhouse the high courts target congress the new york times wk 3 feb 25 2001 27 idjustice breyer joined by justices stevens souter and ginsburg strongly disagreed with the majoritys opinion and stated that congress could have reasonably concluded that the title i remedies of the ada were appropriate legislation under the fourteenth amendment the emphasis in the majority opinion on the limited legislative history was described as ignoring the powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general which implicates state governments as well for state agencies form part of that same larger society23 the rules the majority used to find the legislative record inade quate were seen as flawed using standards more appropriately applied to judges than to congress in the view of the dissenters congress has broad authority to remedy violations of the fourteenth amendment there is simply reason to require congress seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its 5 authority to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect courts institutional limitations unlike courts congress can readily gather facts from across the nation assess the magnitude of problem and more easily find an appropriate remedy24 the dissent also took issue with the interpretation of the congruency and proportionality standard and compared the majoritys harsh review of congress use of its 5 power to the restrictions on the commerce power made by the supreme court in the 1930s and later rejected in conclusion just breyer stated the court through its evidentiary demands its nondeferentia l review and its failure to distinguish between judicial and legislative constitutional competencies improperly invades power that the constitution assigns to congressits decision saps 5 of independent force effectively confining the legislative powerto the insignificant role of abrogating only those state laws that the judicial branch is prepared to adjudge unconstitutional25 implications of garrett university of alabama v garrett is major decision further emphasizing the courts federalism theories and raising separation of powers issues as well26 although the majority does not rule out all legislation enacted pursuant to section 5 of the fourteenth amendment it has made the enactment of such legislation significantly less likely to withstand eleventh amendment scrutiny in addition the courts comments on disparate impact discrimination could signal challenge to other uses of this approach and some commentators have stated this could have implications for other statutes including title vii of the civil righ ts act which prohibits racial discrimination27 more specifically with regard to the ada the majority took pains to describe the limited nature of the holding it is limited to title i of the ada deals only with monetary damages and leaves open other avenues of relief such as enforcement by the equal employment opportunities commission and state laws however the absence of monetary damages does make individual suits against states much less likely and has been described as significant blow to ada enforcement
