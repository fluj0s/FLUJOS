calculated that it suited its interests to support the entry of iraqi shiite islamist factions into the usled election process because the number of shiites in iraq about 60 of the population virtually ensured shiite dominance of an elected government to this extent irans goals did not conflict with the us objective of establishing democracy iran helped assemble shiite islamist bloc united iraqi alliance encompassing the islamic supreme council of iraq isci the dawa islamic call party and the faction of the 34yearold cleric moqtada sadrthe bloc won 128 of the 275 seats in the december 15 2005 election for full term parliament dawa senior leader nuri almaliki was selected as prime minister several isci figures took other leadership positions iscis leaders including ayatollah mohammad baqr hakim who was killed in an august 2003 car bomb in najaf had spent their years of exile in iran and built ties to iranian leaders 1 iscis militia the badr brigades now renamed the badr organization had been recruited trained and armed by irans revolutionary guard the most politically powerful component of irans military during the 198088 iraniraq war in that war badr guerrillas conducted attacks from iran into southern iraq against baath party officials but did not shake the regime after saddams fall iran continued to provide political financial and military support to isci and the badr brigades militia which numbered about 15000 during 20056 with the help of isci member bayan jabr as interior minister and close ally of isci leader abd aziz alhakim younger brother of mohammad baqr the militia burrowed into the iraqi security forces isf and the interior ministry which oversees the various police forces the sadr factions political ties to iran were init ially limited because his family remained in iraq during saddams rule still the sadr clan has ideological ties to iran moqtadas cousin mohammad baqr sadr was f ounder of the dawa party political ally of ayatollah khomeini and was hung by saddam hussein in 1980 moqtada is married to daughter of mohammad baqr sadr iran later came to see political value and potential leverage in sadrs factionwhich has 30 total seats in parliament large and dedicated following among lower class iraqi shiites and which built an estimated 60000 person mahdi army jaysh almahdi or jam militia after saddams fall sadr unleashed the jam on several occasions as part of strategy of challenging what he sees as us occupation of iraq but us military operations defeated the jam in april 2004 and august 2004 in sadr city sadr stronghold in east baghdad najaf and other shiite cities in those cases fighting was ended with compromises under which jam forces stopped fighting in exchange for amnesty for sadr perceiving the jam as useful against the united states in the event of usiran confrontation in 2005 iran began arming it through the revolutionary guards qods jerusalem force the unit that assists iranian protege forces abroad during 20056 the height of sectarian conflict in iraq badr fighters in and outside the isf as well as jam militiamen were involved in sectarian killings of sunnis which accelerated after the february 2006 bombing of the askari mosque in samarra 1 in 1982 mohammad baqr was anointed by then iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini to head future islamic republic of iraq

and training of shiite militias in iraq has added to usiran tensions over irans nuclear program and irans broader regional influence such as its aid to lebanese hezbollah and the palestinian organization hamas which now controls the gaza strip by supplying armed groups in iraq us officials feared that iran sought to develop broad range of options that included pressuring us and british forces to leave iraq to bleed the united states militarily and to be positioned to retaliate in iraq should the united states take military action against irans nuclear program us officials have provided specific information on qods force and hezbollah aid to iraqi shiite militias particularly the jam firm information exists on the number of iranian agents in iraq one press report said there are 150 qods and intelligence personnel there 2 some us commanders who have served in southern iraq said they understood that there were perhaps one or two qods force personnel in each shiite province attached to or interacting with proiranian governors in those provinces qods force officers often do not wear uniforms and their main role is to identify iraqi fighters to train and to organize safe passage for weapons and iraqi militants between iran and iraq although some observers allege that iranian agents have sometimes assisted the jam in its combat operations study by the combatting terrorism center at west point published october 13 2008 iranian strategy in iraq politics and other means details this activity based on declassified interrogation and other documents on february 11 2007 us military briefers in baghdad provided what they said was specific evidence that iran had supplied armorpiercing explosively formed projectiles efps to shiite sadrist militiamen efps have been responsible for over 200 us combat deaths since 2003 in august 2007 gen raymond odierno then the second in command and who is now overall commander in iraq said that iran had supplied the shiite militias with 122 millimeter mortars that are used to fire on the green zone in baghdad on august 28 2008 the washington times reported that prosadr militias were now also using improvised rocket assisted munitionsa flying bomb carrying 100 pounds of explosives propelled by iraniansupplied 107 mm rockets on july 2 2007 brig gen kevin begner said that lebanese hezbollah was assisting the qods force in aiding iraqi shiite militias adding that iran gives about 3 million per month to these iraqi militias he based the statement on the march 2007 capture of former sadr aide qais khazali and lebanese hezbollah operative ali musa daqduq they were allegedly involved in the january 2007 killing of five us forces in karbala on october 7 2007 gen david petraeus then overall us commander in iraq told journalists that irans ambassador to iraq hassan kazemiqomi is himself member of the qods force continuing to present evidence of iranian material assistance to shiite militias gen petraeus testified on april 89 2008 that iran was continuing to arm train and direct special groups radical and possibly breakaway elements of the jamand to organize the groups into hezbollahlike force to serve irans interests and fight proxy war against the iraqi state and coalition forces the testimony was delivered amidst an isf offensive launched by maliki on 2 linzer dafna troops authorized to

area which the jam and other militias controlled and used for financial benefit in the initial assault the isf units dominated by badr loyalists failed and partly collapsed1300 of the 7000 additional isf sent in for the assault did not fight later us and british forces intervened with air strikes and military advice helping the isf gain the upper hand and restore relative normality sadr who reportedly received iranian aid during the fighting agreed to an iranbrokered ceasefire on march 30 2008 but not to disarm some fighting and jam rocketing of us installations in baghdad continued subsequently in some cases killing us soldiers and us forces continued to fight jam elements in sadr city until another sadrmaliki agreement on may 10 2008 subsequently the isf moved into amarah unopposed on june 16 2008 and quieted that city while prompting sadrists protests about isf arrests of the amarah governor and other sadrists other arrests of sadrists took place in sadrs former stronghold of diwaniyah the capital of qadisiyah province the weakening of sadrs faction facilitated the handed over of that province to iraqi control in july 2008

battles were the most dramatic manifestation of rift between maliki and sadr that had begun in 2007 maliki reportedly launched the basra offensive in part to reduce sadrist strength in provincial elections planned for the fall of 2008 but now put off until january 31 2009 in 2007 maliki and isci recognized the need to cooperate with the us troop surge launched that year by permitting us forces to place military pressure on the jam in 2006 maliki had been preventing such us operations in an effort to preserve his alliance with sadr as result of malikis shift in 2007 sadr broke with him pulled the five sadrist ministers out of the cabinet and withdrew his faction from the uia bloc th rift widened throughout 2007 as jam fighters battled badrdominated iraqi forces and us and british forces for control of such shiite cities as diwaniyah karbala hilla nassiryah basra kut and amarah this also caused backlash against sadr among iraqi shiite civilian victims particularly after the august 2007 jam attempt to take control of religious sites in karbala the backlash caused sadr to declare six month suspension of jam activities he extended the ceasefire in february 2008 for another six months the intrashiite fighting expanded as britain drew down its forces the basra area from 7000 to 4000 in concert with withdrawal from basra city to the airport and the transfer of basra province to isf control on december 16 2007 the basra battles appeared to succeed in weakening sadr politically sadr told his followers on june 13 2008 that most of the jam would now orient toward peaceful activities clarified on august 8 2008 to be social and cultural work under new movement called mumahidun or trail blazers and that small corps of special companies would be formed from the jam to actively combat us but not iraqi forces in iraq suggesting that he did not feel overly confident about sadrist prospects in the january 31 2009 elections sadr also announced in august 2008 that he would back technocrats and independents for upcoming provincial elections but not offer separate sadrist list iraqs election authorities have published candidate lists but as of early january 2009 sadr representatives have not specified who are the sadrist candidates but the prosadr risalyun mission grouping has filed candidate slates in several provinces mostly in the south two other parties competing are considered sadrist the blamelessness and reconstruction party and the sadr aliraq party us commanders in iraq including the number two commander in iraq gen lloyd austin explaining the

on august 18 2008 that us forces were increasingly uncovering arms caches and other jam weaponry and that jam fighters had gone to iran temporarily for more training and resupply in december 2008 lt gen thomas metz said that there was marked decline in the number of explosive devices coming into iraq from iran3 the relative quiescence of the jam could also explain why us briefing on new information on iranian aid to the jam first expected in may 2008 but opposed by iraqi leaders who do not want to draw iraq into usiran dispute was not held nor has there been further followup from an iraqi parliamentary group th at visited iran to discuss the issue in april 2008 or from an iraqi commission investigating irans aid to the jam at the same time irans political influence in iraq is being further unsettled in the runup to the january 31 2009 provincial elections new rift has opened up between maliki and his erstwhile political ally isci isci and malikis dawa party have long been the core of the shiite alliance that dominates iraq but they are competing against each other vigorously in the elections isci activists assert that maliki has surrounded himself with dawa veterans who have excluded isci from decisionmaking influence maliki trying to compensate for dawas organizational deficiencies has tried to align his party with tribal leaders in the south to win provincial council seats the net effect is to introduce new splits in the shiite bloc in iraq and to cause iran to have to choose among its various shiite allies in iraq
