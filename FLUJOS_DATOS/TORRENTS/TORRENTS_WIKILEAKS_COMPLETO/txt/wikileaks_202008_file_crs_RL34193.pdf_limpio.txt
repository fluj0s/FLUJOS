information publishe d or to publish only part of the facts revealed or both that if the reporter is nevertheless forced to reveal these confidences to grand jury the source so identified and other c onfidential sources of other reporters will be meas urably deterred from furnishing publishable information all to the detriment of the free flow of information protected by the first amendment the court held nonethele ss that the first amendment did not provide even qualified privile ge for journalists to refuse to appear and testify before state or federal grand juries the only situation it mentioned in which the first amendment would allow reporter to refuse to testify was in the case of grand jury investigations ins tituted or c onducted other than in good faith official harassment of the press undertaken not for purposes of law enforcement but to disrupt reporters relations hip with his news sources would have justification though the supreme court concluded that the first amendment does not provide journalists privilege in grand jury proceedings 49 states have adopted journalists privilege in vari ous types of proceedings 33 have done so by statute and 16 by court

miller to serve time in jail ms miller spent 85 days in jail she secured her release only afte r her informant i lewis libby gave her permission to reveal his identity this incident drew attention to the stion whether journalists should have right to withhold information sought in judi cial proceedings fort ynine states afford journalists some protection from compelled release of their confidential sources1 the question remains however as to whether concomitant federal privilege exists2 the supreme court has addressed the issue of journalists privilege under the first amendment only once in branzburg v hayes it held that the first amendment provided privilege to refuse to testify before grand jury but it left open the question of whether the first amendment provi des journalists with privilege in any other circumstances3 but whether or not the fi rst amendment provides privilege for journalists to refuse to reveal c onfidential sources co ngress may provide privilege through legislation overview of the law the supreme court has written only one opinion on the subject of journalists privilege branzburg v hayes in which the court decided three cases after explaining the grounds on which journalists s eek privilege the court noted that the reporters in the cases it was considering were seeking only qualified privilege not to testify although the newsmen in thes cases do not claim an absolute privilege against official interrogation in all circumst ances they assert that the reporter should not be forced either to appear or to testify before grand jury or at trial

concurring opinion id at 725 judge tatel of the dc circuit wrote though providing the majoritys essential fifth vote he powell wrote separately to outline casebycase approach that fits uncomfortably to say the least with the branzburg majoritys categorical rejection of the reporters claims in re grand jury subpoena judith miller 397 f3d continuedunless sufficient grounds are shown for believing that the reporter possesses information relevant to crime the grand jury is investigating that the information the reporter has is unavaila ble from other sources and that the need for the information is sufficiently compelling to override the claimed invasion of first amendment interests occasioned by the disclosure4 in branzburg v hayes however the court held that the first amendment did not provide even qualified privilege for jour nalists to refuse to appear and testify before state or federal grand juries5 the only situation it mentioned in which the first amendment would allow reporter to refuse to testify was in the case of grand jury investigations instituted or conduc ted other than in good faith official harassment of the press undertaken not for purposes of law enforcement but to disrupt reporters relations hip with his news sources would have justification6 the reporters in all three of the cases decided in branzburg had sought privilege not to testify befo re grand juries at one point in its opinion however the court wrote that reporters like other citizens must respond to relevant questions put to them in the course of valid grand jury investigation or criminal trial7 the reference to criminal trials should be c onsidered dictum and therefore not binding on lower courts branzburg was 54 decision and though ju stice powell was one of the five in the majority he also wrote concurri ng opinion in which he found that reporters have qualified privilege to refuse to testify regarding criminal conduct indeed if the newsman is called upon to give information bearing only remote and tenuous relationship to the subject of the investigation or if he has some other reason to believe that his testimony implicates confidential source relationships without legitimate need of law enforcement he will have access to the court on motion to quash and an appropriate protective order may be entered the asserted claim to privilege should be judged on its facts by the striking of proper balance between fr eedom of the press and the obligation of all citizens to give relevant testim ony with respect to criminal conduct8 powells opinion leaves it

been introduced in the 110th congress and are discussed below thirtythree states and the district of columbia have enacted journalists privilege statutes which are often called shield statutes12 as for federal courts fede ral rule of evidence 501 pr ovides that the privilege of witness shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the ited states in the light of reason and experience13 the federal courts have not resolved whether the common law provides journalists privilege the us court of appeals for the district of columbia for one is not of one mind on the existence of common law privilege in federal court however all three judges on the panel for the case believe that if there is any such privilege it is not absolute and may be overcome by an appropriate showing14 as for state courts those in 16 stat provide common law protection making total of 49 states plus the district of columbia that have journalists privilege15

ude as judge henderson had that the special counsels evidentiary proffer overcomes any hurdle however high federal commonlaw reporters privilege may erect requires the adoption of standard by which to determine when the privilege is overcome but to adopt standard without first determining that privilege exists would be if privilege does not exist to establish precedent potentially binding on future panels regarding the scope of the assumed privilege even though resolving that question was entirely unnecessa ry this would be an undertaking hardly consistent with principles of judicial restraint id at 989990in 1980 the department of justice adopted rule which remains in effect without amendment providing in part i n determining whether to request issuance of subpoena to member of the news dia or for telephone toll records of any member of the news media the approach in every case must be to strike the proper balance between the publics interest in effective law enforcement and the fair administration of justice16 in re grand jury subpoena judith miller in re grand jury subpoena judith miller is the federal court of appeals decision that declined to overturn the findi ng of civil contempt against journalists judith miller and matthew cooper for refu sing to give evidence in response to subpoenas served by special counsel patrick fitzgerald in his investigation of the disclosure of the identity of cia agent17 after the supreme court declined to review the decision matthew cooper agreed to testify but judith miller continued to refuse and was imprisoned as result the case was decided by threejudge panel that issued an opinion for the court written by judge sentelle w ith all three judges sent elle henderson and tatel issuing separate concurring opi nions the courts opinion citing branzburg held that the first amendment does not permit journalists to refuse to testify before grand jury and said as quoted above that the court was not of one mind on the existence of commonlaw privilege but that even if there is one the special counsel had overcome it as for the three concurring opinions j udge sentelle expressed his view that there is commonlaw privilege judge he nderson expressed her view that in the interest of judicial restra int the court should not decide anything more today than that the special counsels evidentiary proffer overcomes any hurdle however high federal commonlaw reporters privilege ma erect and judge tatel addressed the issues of both the constitutional privilege and the commonlaw privilege18 as for the constitutional privilege judge tatel said that he was uncertain in the light of justice powells enigmatic concurring opinion in branzburg that there is constitutional reporter privilege in the grand jury context even if there is however he agreed that such privilege would not benefit mille r or cooper in the case before the court as for the comm onlaw privilege judge tatel concluded

shield legislation issues and implications matthew cooper ntioned above in connection with in re grand jury subpoena judith miller reportedly testified that without whistleblowers who feel they can come forward to the reporters with degree of confidence we might never have known the extent of th watergate scandal or enrons deceptions or events that needed to be exposed20 the department of justice however opposed the legislation with deputy atto rney general jame s comey stating in written testimony that the bill is bad public policy primarily because it would bar the government from obtaining information about media sources even in the most urgent of circumstances affecting the publics health or safety or national security s 1419hr 3323 s 1419hr 3323 would establish qualifie d privilege with respect to both the identity of source and other informati on but it would impose greater limitations on the ability to compel disclosure of the identity of source than of other information we will pose and answer questions about its salient features where would the privilege apply s 1419hr 3323 would apply in any federal entity which the bill defines to include the executive branch the judicial branch and administrative agencies but not the legislative branch the bill would not apply in state courts or other state entities what would be protected from disclosure s 1419hr

ectronic or other means and that i publishes newspaper book magazine or other periodical in print or electronic form ii operates radio or levision broadcast station cable system or satellite carrier or iii operates news agency or wire service covered person under the bill would also include parent subsidiary or affiliate of such an entity to the extent that such parent subsidiary or affiliate is engaged in news gathering or the dissemination of news and in formation or an employ ee contractor or other person who gathers edits photographs reco rds prepares or disseminates news or information for such an entity the bills privilege would apply to any testimony or document that third party or federal entity seeks from communications service provider if such testimony or document consists of

company or internet service provider for example to assert privilege not to disclose the covered pers ons phone or email records the third party or federal entity seeking to compel testimony or document from communications service provider woul d have to give notice to the covered person who is party to the business transaction with the communications service provider and the covered person would be entitled to be heard by the court before the testimony or disclosure is compelled the bills requirement as to what an entity must publish or operate to be covered person would limit the bills coverage so that it apparently would not protect bloggers or others who post on the inte rnet except those who write for webzines unless blog were considered magazine it would apparently also not protect freelance reporter who gathered information while having contract with an entity to do so if he subsequently sold the information to an entity however he might be viewed as contractor or as person who gathers news or information for such an entity this would depend upon how the quoted terms are construed s 1419 apparently would also not protect people who gather news to disseminate solely on street corners or who gather news that they attempt to publish solely in letters to the editor what exceptions would permit disclosure to be compelled s 1419hr 3323s privilege would be
