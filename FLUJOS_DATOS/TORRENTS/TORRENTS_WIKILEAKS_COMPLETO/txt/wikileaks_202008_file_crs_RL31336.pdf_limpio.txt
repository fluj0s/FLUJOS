institutions is regarded as discr iminatory under specifi ed circumstances8 in light of these developments cong ress in pl 109365 explicitly expanded aoas role in promoting home and comm unitybased longterm care services in doing so the assistant secretary is requi red to among other things conduct research and demonstration projects to identify i nnovative costeffective strategies for modifying state systems of longterm care and target services to individuals at risk for institutional placement in order to per mit them to remain in home and communitybased care settings in addition the assistant secretary is to implement in all states aging and disability resource centers adrcs to serve as visible and trusted sources of information on the full range of long term care options and to

update web based decision support and enrollment tools as well as other systems to inform older people bout federal and state benefit programs among other tasks the center is also to develop and maintain an information clearinghouse on best practices and coste ffective methods to find and enroll older people who have the greatest economic need for program participation private pay agreements with profitmaking organizations under prior law area agencies on aging or tribal organizations could enter into agreements with private profitmaking organizations to provide services to older people since area agencies staff have expertise on wide range of issues that affect all older people in their planning and service ar eas they are frequently called upon by many organizations to provide information and services to many organizations including profitmaking organizations for example there have been instances where area agencies on aging have entered into agreements with profitmaking organizations to conduct activ ities to benefit employees of these organizations such as c onducting seminars on caregiving issues employees faced with caregiving responsibilities in their own families the administration proposed clarificati on and expansion of these provisions by specifying the circumstances under whic h such agreements could take place and specifically that area agenci and other grantees under the act could be reimbursed by the private profitmaking sector for carrying out these services the house education and workforce and the senate help committees generally agreed with the proposal but added stipulations that these agreements could take place only if certain safeguards including provisions re garding reimbursement of costs incurred by area agencies of providing services to the private sector were added to the provision in addition other provisions regarding aoas responsibilities for reporting to congress on the implementati on of this new provi sion were added under the provision in pl 109365 state and area agency on aging or tribal organization may enter into agreements w ith profitmaking organizations to provide services to older people if 1 all co sts of providing the services including administrative costs will be reimbursed to the agency or tribal organization 2 the organization reimburses the agency or tribal organization for the cost incurred at the fair market rate and 3 the reimbursement rates are consistent with the prevailing market rate in the geographic area where the services are provided any revenue generated through these agreements must be used to provide or support services to older people that are consistent with the act the law further stipulated that activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31336crs7 11

individual with greatest social need greatest economic need or an older individual at ri sk for institutional placement in addition the activities may not in any other way co mpromise undermine or be inconsistent with the objective of serving the needs of older people in addition the assistant secretary is required to velop and implement monitoring procedures and reporting requi rements for these

found the program plays an important role in participants overa ll nutrition and that meals consumed by participants are their primary source of daily nutrients the evaluation also found that the program leverages fairly sign ificant amount of nonfederal dollars for every federal dollar spent the program leveraged at that time on average 170 for congregate meals and 335 for homedeliv ered meals from variety of sources including state local and pr ivate funds as well as par ticipant contributions toward the cost of meals18 the law requires 15 nonfederal

income for the sixmonth period prior to application42 dol indicated that changing the period for income calculation was intended to simplify the process and obtain the most recent income43 gao found concerns among many nationa l and state grantees about dols revised guidance some noted that annualizing six months of income could distort income for people who had income only for the last six months for example seasonal farmworkers the effect could have the unintended c onsequence of making these people ineligible for title v jobs as result of these concerns congress stipulated in pl 109365 that income is to be calculated for the 12month period ending on the date an eligible individual submits an applicat ion at its opti on title v grantee may use an individuals annualized income for the sixmonth peri od ending on the date of application time limit on participant enrollment prior to passage of pl 109365 there was time limit on how long an enrollee may spend as title v participant however dol regulations allowed grantees to establish maximum duration of enrollment when authorized by dol dol data showed that the average length of time participants spend in the

grant program serves open competition is not only the pref erred vehicle for obtaining new grantees but in most cases it is the required vehicle for obtaining new granteest he department favors full

meet the age eligibility for title ii of the social security act but are not receiving benefits live in an area with persistent unemployment and are individuals with severely limited employment prospects or have limited english proficiency or low literacy skills the law also established an overall average enrollment duration cap for grantees it stipulated that grantees are subject to an average participation cap for enrollment of 27 months grantee may request an extended period of enrollment for specific area where the grantee operates up to period of not more than 36 months the secretary may approve the request if the secretary determines that extenuating circumstances exist pertaining to the following factors high rates of unemployment or poverty or participation by

scale for title v activities in the area served by the grantee competition and grantee performance indicators the 2000 reauthorization for the first time added in law set of performance indicators that were to be applied to state agency and national organization grantees at the end of each program year the secretary was directed to determine if each national grantee had met national performance measures as set forth in the statute44 if grantee failed to meet the performance standards for given year the grantee had to submit corrective action plan if the grantee failed over two or threeyear

positions among incumbent grantees47 three years later on march 2 2006 dol again called for national compe tition for the national organization portion of title v funds48 during the first national competition in 2002 many national grantees raised issues regarding dols authority to award funds on competitive basis however the act never explicitly stated whether the national grants are to be funded on competitive or noncompetitive basis the dol competitive awards process and the implementation of the performance indicators were issues discussed during the 2006 reauthorization process some organizations indicated that the threeyear competitive cycle was difficult to implement new grantees needed at least one year or more to ramp up grantee activities for example to hire staff conduct outr each to eligible individuals assess their needs and place them in subsidized jobs they would then have one or two years to operate before having to reapply for competitive funds using the dol performance indicators in addition some gr antees pointed to the time lag in dols publication of the performance indicat ors dol published the performance indicators in april 2004 but implemented the national competition in 2002 thereby according to grantees placing them at disadvantage as result of these concerns cong ress in pl 109365 made number of changes to requirements for competition nd grantee performance first the law required dol to hold national competiti on for national grantee funds every four years rather than every three years which had been dol recent practice after each year of grantee operation dol is to eval uate national organiza tion grantees based on the performance indicators established by the law see below second if national grantees fail to perform they will receive technical assistance from dol and are to take corrective action unlike prior law national grantees will not be subject to reduction or withdrawal of funds due to failure to m eet the perform ance indicators however if national organization grant ee fails to meet the performance indicators for four consecutive years it is prohibited from participating in the next competitive grant cycle if national organization grantee meets the performance standards for four consecutive years it ma continue to receive funds for an additional year the process for competition technical assistance and corrective action is similar for state agency grantees however state agency grantees are subject to realignment of funds if the secretary determines that they have failed to meet the performance indicators for three consecutive years in this case the secretary is required to have the state conduct comp etition to award its funds for the year following the secretarys determination
