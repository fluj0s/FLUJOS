collaboration wendy h schacht specialist in science and technology science technology and medicine division summary over the past 15 years congressional initiatives have created programs and policies encouraging the establishment of governmentindustryuniversity research and development rd partnerships to stimulate technological innovation and economic growth efforts to eliminate several of these activities during the 104th congress reflected opposition to certain programs designed to facilitate the commercialization of technology particularly those involving direct federal funding many of the same questions were raised in the 105th congress however established program continued to receive support within the context of budget decisions the 106th congress is expected to again debate the governments role in promoting collaborative ventures focused on generating new products and processes for the marketplace policy development there were several attempts during the 104th congress and to lesser extent in the th 105 congress to terminate government programs that provide direct and sometimes indirect federal assistance to facilitate the commercialization of technology by the private sector such efforts were based upon the rationale articulated in march 16 1995 house budget committee statement that argued that while the federal government has role in basic research it should not be engaged in applied research this was major change from various policies supported in the past by both republicans and democrats in congress and by previous administrations over the past 15 years federal programs mandated by congressional legislation have acted to expand basic research as well as encourage industry application of the results of this research traditionally the us government has extensively funded research and development to meet the mission requirements of the federal departments and agencies it also supports work in areas where there is an identified national need for research primarily basic research not being performed in the private sector federal financing is based principally upon consensus that while basic research is the foundation for many congressional research service the library of congress crs2 innovations the rate of return to society as whole generated by investments in such work is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by those performing the research this often leads to underinvestment by the private sector1 in the past government efforts to expand basic research leading to new technology development had been based upon linear model of innovation this theory viewed technological advancement as series of sequential steps starting with idea origination and moving through basic research applied research development commercialization and diffusion into the economy increases in federal funds in the basic research stage were expected to result in concomitant increases in new products and processes however the linear concept is longer considered accurate innovations often occur that do not require new basic or applied research or development in fact most innovations are incremental improvements to existing products or processes in certain areas such as biotechnology the distinctions between basic research and commercialization are small and shrinking in others the differentiation between basic and applied research is artificial for the economy the critical factor is the commercialization of the technology the speed at which product process or service is brought to the marketplace economic benefits accrue only when new or improved technologies are sold in the marketplace or when new or improved process can be utilized to increase quality and productivity it is widely accepted that technological progress is responsible for up to onehalf the growth of the us economy and is one principal driving force in longterm economic expansion and increases in the nations standard of living the dilemma faced by policymakers in the 1980s was that while the united states had strong basic research enterprise foreign firms often appeared more adept at taking the results of these scientific efforts and making commercially viable products at times us companies competed in the global marketplace against goods and services developed by foreign industries from research performed in the united states in 1985 the presidents commission on industrial competitiveness under president reagan found that foreign firms have increased the speed with which they adopt and commercialize technology developed in the united states and they have also improved their ability to develop technology on their own2 in an increasingly interconnected world it is extremely difficult to keep technologies and knowledge within domestic borders thus there was expanded congressional interest in mechanisms to accelerate the development and commercialization processes in the american industrial community by the late 1980s the changing world orderwith changing defense needs increased market competition and the globalization of the economyled congress to reassess the federal contribution to the national science and technology enterprise the traditional role of the government in supporting basic research expanded toward advancing the development of technology to meet other national needs including the economic growth that flows from the commercialization and use of new products and production processes this approach involves creation of an environment within which 1 for detailed

partnerships reflects the thesis that while commercialization is the responsibility of the private sector academia industry and government often have complementary functions and can contribute to the goal of generating new goods and services for the marketplace joint projects allow for the sharing of costs risks facilities and expertise bipartisan legislative approach evolved that was intended to facilitate collaboration among the three sectors3 this included the creation and support of various programs that provide direct federal funding on costshared basis with the private sector for governmentindustry efforts the advanced technology program atp of the national institute of standards and technology nist department of commerce provides federal seed financing matched by private sector investment to companies or consortia of universities businesses and government laboratories for development of pre competitive generic technologies that have potential application within range of industries awards are made on technical scientific and business merit new selection requirements encourage joint ventures that include both small and large firms also managed by nist the manufacturing extension partnership mep is program of regional centers designed to facilitate the movement to the private sector of knowledge and technologies developed under the auspices of nist and other federal agencies in pursuit of mission requirements the centers receive at least half their funding from us based nonprofit institutions or organizations the small business technology transfer pilot program provides federal support for research proposals that are developed and executed cooperatively between small firm and scientist in university government laboratory or nonprofit institution in addition congress has enacted various laws that offer indirect measures to encourage collaborative activities leading to technology commercialization included in this is the research and experimentation tax credit which provides credit for incremental increases in companys rd expenditures as well as for payments to universities for basic research changes to the antitrust laws are designed to clarify their application in regard to cooperative research and manufacturing ventures thereby removing certain barriers to such activities other laws facilitating technology transfer and establishing patent ownership incentives were enacted to stimulate industrial and academic use of the results of federallyfunded rd the bayhdole act has been of major significance to the evolution of cooperative rd providing title to inventions made under federal financing to small business university or nonprofit contractors has encouraged collaborative efforts to further develop products and processes based on these patents and bring them to the marketplace4 new approach the 104th congress signaled the beginning of challenge to significant part of this approach the role of government in partnerships was called into question as were activities that involve federal funding to promote collaborative ventures government 3 for additional information see congressional research service

implications for us policy by wendy h schacht crs report 98862 crs4 programs were seen by opponents as financing applied technology development and picking winners and losers for the business sector it has been argued that commercialization choices should be marketdriven and agency discretion in selecting technologies would inevitably be subjected to political pressures in march 15 1995 letter to budget committee chairman john kasich the 27 republican members of the house science committee condemned partnership activities as product development using taxpayer resources imposing federal control over market decisions 5 speaker of the house newt gingrich stated that while he favored long run increases in federal rd support the country should spend much less trying to have the us government as partner with industry6 in place of such efforts many in congress suggested the creation of tax incentives that proponents argued would provide the capital resources necessary for industry to invest in additional rd according to mr gingrich capital formation is the largest barrier to american innovation he and former house science committee chairman robert walker foresaw permanent and expanded research and experimentation tax credit as substitute for government costshared programs7 changes in the capital gains tax were also intended to increase the amount of funding available for industrial use mr walker stated that he believed changes in the capital gains tax to be more important to startup companies than the governmentindustry programs currently in operation8 opponents of plans to terminate governmentindustry partnerships argued that this reflects misunderstanding of current programs they maintained that such federal activities are industryled and support the advancement of technologies in areas chosen by the private sector which are expected to have applications across different sectors of the economy merit based awards are for work that is highrisk and past the basic research stage but not yet ready for commercialization claims have been made that manufacturing extension is response to industry needs as defined by actual private sector requests for assistance and is designed for small and medium sized companies which do not have the resources of major firms it was also argued that the government has traditionally played role in the development of critical technologies industries in which american companies enjoy favorable balance of trade eg commercial aviation pharmaceuticals weapons tend to be those which have received federal agency mission rd support over the years when statement was made at march 23 1995 hearings technology subcommittee house committee on science to the effect that ibm internally financed work on artificial intelligence because it was wise business decision then undersecretary of commerce for technology mary good responded that in actuality much of funding came from the department of defense and the national science foundation agency spokesmen have disputed the charge that these cooperative programs are corporate welfare for large companies at the same hearings arati prabhaker then 5 mcgrawhills federal technology report march 30 1995 p 6 6 new technology week march 13 1995 p 2 7 ibid p 1 8 mcgrawhills federal technology report march 30 1995 p 2 crs5 director of nist testified that while many big firms are involved in collaborative programs the cooperative nature of these efforts means that many who actually receive assistance are the smaller suppliers to these large corporations recent information provided by the national institute of standards and technology indicates that of the 413 awards made by the advanced technology program between 1990 and 1998 almost one half went to joint ventures in the last solicitation october 1998 the 79 projects receiving awards involved more than 150 companies 11 universities and several federal laboratories also at issue is the question whether tax treatments alone will achieve their goals critics charged that tax relief is at the expense of federal support for education rd training and cooperative industryuniversitygovernment ventures that are at the core of the innovation process as they see it agreeing that tax incentives can be beneficial they maintained that this approach should not be implemented to the exclusion of other activities proponents of ongoing federal programs pointed to studies they claim indicate that the re tax credit promotes continuation of research already performed by firms and does not necessarily encourage new high risk work in addition such tax credits are of little use to company which has taxable income situation often encountered when small firms are in the process of developing innovative leadingedge technologies responding to arguments that tax incentives will increase the amount of capital available to companies such that government funding for programs like atp would longer be necessary opponents maintained that venture capitalists are interested in investing in technologies which have reached the prototype stage however they noted current federal programs provide support to companies for work prior to prototype development the venture capital that would be necessary to finance this longterm high risk rd is not currently available and the assumption that pool of funds to serve this function will be created in response to these tax proposals they stated is not borne out by any evidence these deliberations were revisited in the 105th congress however there was significantly less opposition to ongoing federal activities the advanced technology program remains operational due in part to strong support by president clinton funding levels declined for fy1998 but increased 6 for fy1999 the manufacturing extension partnership also received continued funding at an increased level for fy1998 appropriations for fy1999 declined but the figure reflects decrease in the federal share of center funding not reduced support for the mep effort the research and experimentation tax credit was renewed for one year through june 30 1998 by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 and again through june 30 1999 by the omnibus consolidated appropriations act pl 105277 the small business technology transfer program has been extended through fy2001 issues for consideration an assessment of the potential impact of any changes in approach to cooperative rd is partially dependent on an understanding of the environment within which such work is performed by the private sector the focus of industrial research and development tends to be short term concentrating on rd which will bring investors quick returns small innovative firms tend to need early stage venture capital to fund work as well as business assistance to translate viable ideas into commercially acceptable crs6 goods and services larger companies may be financially capable of supporting rd but the nature of this work has changed from large centralized laboratories which performed fundamental research eg bell labs david sarnoff research laboratory to smaller decentralized facilities performing applied rd tied to operating units increasingly companies are looking to government laboratory establishments and to universities to provide the basic research needed for innovation and long term technological advances within this context what legislative initiatives might be most effective to date congress has determined that providing title to inventions made under federal funding to contractors and or collaborating parties should be used to support technology development and commercialization in return for patent ownership congress has accepted as satisfactory the anticipate payback to the country through goods and services to improve our health welfare and standard of living these benefits have been considered more important than the initial cost of the technology to the government or any potential unfair advantage of one company over another in cooperative venture however as such effort become more widespread and as new issues emerge additional decisions may need to be made on how to maintain balance between the importance of bringing new products and processes to the marketplace and protecting the public investment in rd the role of state governments in cooperative rd might be another consideration increasingly these jurisdictions are providing resources to augment local participation in related federal programs particularly the advanced technology program the manufacturing extension partnership and the small business technology transfer program to this end the us innovation partnership has been established between the national governors association and the federal departments designed to create an environment that promotes innovation creates new jobs and helps to advance 21st century technologies what might be the result of state and local activities on federal efforts to facilitate governmentindustry collaboration among the additional questions which may be addressed as this issue is debated are do programs such as atp and mep actually shift private sector decisionmaking to the public sector do they address imperfections in the marketplace what results have these programs achieved what are the benefits and costs of such efforts will companies expand their rd expenditures if the research and experimentation tax credit is made permanent if so will this additional rd support the type of longterm high risk technology development which current federal programs are designed to facilitate what will such tax credit cost the us treasury relative to current rd activities will capital gains tax changes provide increased funding for private sector research and development can andor should the capital gains tax be structured to encourage the formation of venture capital for early stage rd should it be tied to longer term investments often necessary for innovation for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95499
