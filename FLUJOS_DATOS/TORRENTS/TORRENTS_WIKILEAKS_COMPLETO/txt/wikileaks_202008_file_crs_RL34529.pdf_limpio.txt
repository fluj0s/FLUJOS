according to interviews with various partments and agencies some organizations require rating officials to meet with their employees to discuss the performance criteria other organizations make the

expected performance 9 5 cfr 430203 10 5 cfr 430203 defines performance rating as the written or otherwise recorded appraisal of performance compared to the performance standards for each critical and noncritical element on which there has been an opportunity to perform for the minimum periodappraisal is an event single moment of assessing completed job performance4 because appraisals are inhere ntly reflections on the past some public administration experts suggest not using them5 others point out however that effective appraisal criteria can help align employee performan ce with organizational goals and help create more satisfied and effective workforce by offering feedback and setting attainable goals6 ineffective criteria can prompt conflict within an organization and lead to resentment and competition among workers performance appraisals therefore should be precise and assi st managers in ongoing performance management efforts7 federal employees who undergo perform ance appraisals are often given performance plan or expecta tions of their performance at the beginning of their appraisal cycle8 the performance plan may include both critical and noncr itical performance elements which are defined in the code of fe deral regulations critical element means work assignment or responsibility of such importance that unacceptable performance on the elem ent would result in determination that an employees overall performance is unacceptable noncritical element means dimension or aspect of individual team or organizational performance exclusive of critical element that is used in assigning summary level such elements may include but are not limited to objectives goals program plans work plans and other means of expressing expected performance9 at the end of the appraisal cycle rating official and an employee may meet for performance evaluation or performance rating10 an employee may have an unlimited number of critical and noncritical cr iteria on which he or she is measured the appraisal may be written as narrative or as collection of short statements or an employee may be assessed on nominal or numeric rating scale the national credit union

characteristics relevancy and be free from extraneous or contaminating influences it should also encompass the w hole job not be deficient12 moreover the evaluation assessment should be tested to ensure that two managers evaluating the same employee create similar ratings13 this test for evaluation bias called an inter rater reliability test is essential for establishing employee trust in the assessments equity and fairness the system must also affect all employees regardless of race gender age ethnicity or sexu orientation equally even systems that indirectly affect one group more

ratings of empl oyees traits may indicate employees whose personalities are best ited to the position but may not accurately measure effective performance rating an employees behavior may capture how the employee does his or her job but may fail to measure whether the behavior leads to effective job outcomes finally measuring results may determine whether an employee completes assigned tasks but also may create work atmosphere in which employees attempt to acquire results at all cost sic17 in performance appraisals employers determine which criteria are critical18 the office of personnel management opm so suggests that criteria be specific and clearly linked to overa ll organizational goals to develop specific measures for each element you must determine how you would measure the quantity quality timeliness andor costeffectiveness of the element if it can be measured with numbers clearly define those numbers if performance only can be described ie observed and verified clarify who would be the best judge to appraise the work and what factors they sic would look for19 an organization also must decide whether the appraisal criteria will be standardized across the depa rtment or agency or if it will include individualized measures specifically tailored to each employee standardized criteria allow all employees to be evaluated on common set of goals and may facilitate clearer link between criteria and organizational mission employees can assume that standardized measures are important to the organization because the measures are included agency wide on the other hand individualized criteria can allow the rating official to capture unique job performance elements that may be essential to the organization but are not directly linked to the agencys mission and therefore may not be captured by standardized appraisal according to us merit systems protection board functions within an organization may be so diverse that it becomes appropriate in many organizations to us individual appraisal criteria20 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34529crs5 21 cynthia fisher lyle f sc hoenfeldt and james b shaw human resource management p 456 see also us office of pers

employee involvement involving employees in all parts of pe rformance appraisals can create system that is more trusted and can better motiv ate employees and help them understand the goals of the organization what needs to be done why it needs to be done and how well it should be done21 currently most federal agencies with performancebased pay systems encourage employees to speak with their managers about their rating criteria but very few agencies require employee input at the end of an appraisal year an employee may be given the opportun ity to submit selfappraisal or respond to his or her raters appraisal employees who are involved in the process usually are more satisfied with it than those who are not permitted to add input22 employers also must determine whether peers subordinates customers or other employee supervisors are permitted to add i nput to evaluations requiring peer input may offer rating officials additional insight into an employees performance but each additional assessment also carries drawback s that could contaminate the appraisal peers may not want to rate one another because they may be wary of making themselves seem inferior to those whom they rate or they may not want to jeopardize workplace cooperation by submitting poor rating23 subordinate may have an incentive to inflate the rating score of his or her supervisor if he or she believes the supervisor will know who submitted the evaluation24 by allowing additional assessments rating officials may cede some of their authority in making decisions about an employees performance and theref ore may lose some of the flexibilities in rateofpay decisions that performancebased systems are meant to increase comparison or criteria employers must determine whether to evaluate employees by comparing across colleagues or based on set performance crite ria employers may rank their employees comparatively25 create comparative forced distributions in which the evaluator has to

nearly impossible employees may not trust system in which their ratings cannot be replicated acro ss managers inte rrater reliability28 finally some critics have noted that comparative ratin gs may generate competitive workplace rather than foster teamwork because employees are competing against one another for ratings29 appraisal training once performance appraisal criteria are established both managers and employees must be trained in how to use the system managers can be taught how to reduce rating errors such as lenien cy awarding more positive ratings than deserved severity award ing more unfavorable ratings than deserved central tendency rating all employees near the dpoint of the performance scale and halo errors allowing feelings about the indivi dual to affect positivel all rating scores30 employees who will be rated by the appraisal system may be taught how it will operate to ensure their understanding of the evaluation process and to instill greater trust in the system finally organizati ons may establish formal process for employees to offer feedback or to cha llenge their appraisals training both employees and supervisors may increase the appraisal systems transparency which according to the mspb can promote sha red understanding of the employees expectations and build trust both in th system and between the supervisor and

schedule gs scale that serves as the pay structure for most federal employees those who are in performancebased system have pay bands that usually encompass wider pay range than was formerly in single gs grade the wider pay bands may allow mangers greater flexibility to hire promising employees at higher rate of pay and to retain highperforming employees by increasing their pay at faster pace th an was possible under the gs scale pay bands like gs grades cap maximum and limit minimum pay rates unlike the gs scale however most pay bands do not have automatic increases within each band instead in banded system funds that were formerly used to pay for within grade and qualitystep increases in the gene ral schedule are often pooled and used to fund the pay increases determined at th end of the performance appraisal cycle32 some agencies like the governme nt accountability office gao have included additional performance elements in th eir pay bands in two of its four pay bands gao originally established speed bum ps which are designed to intentionally slow some employees progress through pay band at about the 75 mark of the bands in one band gao required employees at or above the speed bump to receive ratings in the top 50 of averages for their band and team33 to qualify for the annual pay adjustment in the other band employees had to be in the top 80 of averages for their band and team the establishment of speed bumps was controversial and led to employee appeals and prompted federal legisla tion pl 11032334 pursuant to pl 110323 all gao employees with satisfactory performance rating are now statutorily required to receive an annual pay increase that is at least equal to that of similar employees in their geographic pay area who are on the gs pay

designing an effective pay for perfor mance compensation system p 21designing the pay structure once an organization decides whether to create pay bands before implementing performancebased pay it can begin to design the payout structure an effective merit pay system according to fisher et will incorporate three components expectancy the employees belief that he or she is capable of meeting expectations instrumentality the employees belief that his or her actual performance does prompt the reward and valence the employees belief that the reward is desirable or valued35 most effective meritpay system s attempt to maximize each of these components by clarifying criteria making the system transparent and offering consistent desirable pay increases to those who qualify for them the funding pool for most federal departments and ag encies merit pay involves taking an employees performance evaluation and using it to determine the percentage increase an employee will receive in his or her pa available performancebased pay funding is often pooled the funding may come fro m variety of sources including line item in the organizations budget termination from the organizations administration or funding formerly used to pay for withingrade and qualitystep increases pay banding may also eliminate some costs formerly used to consider promotions because employees longer need to receive promotion to secure an increase in pay the wider pay band allows employees to acquire significant pay increases without having to apply for and receive promotion this cost savings may also be added to th meritpay funding pool the size of the pool is primary consideration when determining each employees individual pay increase because the pay pools size depends on larger macroeconomic and budgetary trends perform ancebased payouts often vary in size from year to year this variability in pay increases may lead to valence problems for the meritbased pay system if employees do not believe their performance will lead to pay increase of sizeable value the system may not operate properly additionally because employee performance may stay consistent from year to year while payouts vary employees may fail to see solid link between their performance and their pay increase performancebased pay is designed to reward some employees with higher pay than others inhere nt in this design is an inequity in pay among colleagues which may lead to an atmosphere of competition rather than teamwork as the mpsb has observed th structure of performancebased pay can produce winlose situation that may create resistance among those who perceive that their incomes are falling behind and heighten competition in negative way36 in some pay systems an employees location along the payband spectrum affects his or her total pay for example at the farm credit administration fcahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34529crs9 37 information provided by telephone to the author from the fca on mar 26 2008 38 this information was provided to the author from variety of federal departments and agencies 39 many agencies like the federal housing administration and the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives have stated that their pay systems have performed well information provided to the author by telephone from the individual agencies 40 both the securities exchange commission nd gao meritbased pay systems have faced legal and public scrutiny 41 cynthia fisher lyle f sc hoenfeldt and james b shaw human resource management p 541an employee at the higher end of the pay spectrum receives lower percentage increase in pay than someone at the lower end of the pay band with an identical appraisal score the lower pay percentage increase for the employee with the higher pay occurs because the department of labor has determined that the employees basic rate of pay is already higher than the market rate for that position37 in addition higher basic pay rate will yield higher pay increase than lower pay rate multiplied by the same percentage pay raise employees who have already reached their pay bands pay cap may receive pay bonus or they may be pe rmitted to receive their pay increase as onetime lump sum that will not modify their rate of basic pay in these cases the pay increases may not be included when retirement and pension pay are calculated38 employees who have reached their pay maximum may have less financial incentive to maintain their work pace and effectiveness agencies w ith many employees at the pay cap may face higher rates of retirement leading to both recruitment and retention concerns concluding observations performancebased pay can be beneficial to both employees and the organization but it also may present new issues in an organization that has historically used more traditional pay structures in some cases performancebased pay for federal workers may have increased retention of effective employees increased overall employee productivity led to cost savings for the or ganization and aided in the attainment of organizational objectives in more eff ective manner than under the gs pay scale39 adopting merit pay however takes substantial time and additional financial resources at the beginning of the implementation in other cases performancebased pay in federal agencies has prompted lawsuits and mistrust of pay system administrators40 experts suggest that organizations need to plan carefully the performance appraisalsystem that will inform merit pay and the system must ensure that the financial rewards for effective performance are large enough to be desirable to employees with pay for performance one needs to reevaluate the motivation retention productivity and organizational objectives conti nually with the idea of finetuning the system to make sure rewards are aligned with desired performance 41 experts also observe that rating official s and employees must be trained in how best to use the performancebased pay syst em

salaries keep pace with those of colleagues both in the public sector and in comparab privatesector positions42 if an agency or department has bargaini ng unit employees the agency may observe that unions generally have disliked and litigated performancebased pay systems because they believe the structures destroy solidarity and permit arbitrary or sometimes unintentionally racist genderb iased or ageist outcomes43 some unions fear that performance pay will force return to the spoils system for federal personnel that employees may be rewarded for partisan or political behavior members of congress have expressed concern that giving agen cy managers more discretion may lead to increased misconduct by those managers44 further the constitutional design of government leaves most agencies in the position of serving many masters as public administration professor alasdair roberts has asserted the power struggle over control of executive branch agencies may be in fact major roadblock to governmentwide institution of performancebased pay45
