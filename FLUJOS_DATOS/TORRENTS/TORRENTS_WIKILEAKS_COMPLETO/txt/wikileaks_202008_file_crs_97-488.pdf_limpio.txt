natural resources policy division august 21 2008 abstract section 401 of the clean water act requires that an applicant for federal license or permit provide certiﬁcation that any discharges from the facility will comply with the act including water quality standard requirements disputes have arisen over the states exercise of this authority in protecting water quality for the most part the debate over the section 401 certiﬁcation issue has been between states and hydropower interests 1994 supreme court decision which upheld the states authority in this area dismayed development and hydropower interest groups the court revisited these issues in 2006 ruling that unanimously upheld the authority of states to condition hydropower licenses by exercising section 401 the dispute between states and industry groups about section 401 authority has been legislative issue on several occasions but congress has not modiﬁed the provisions scope in addition there has been interest in clarifying whether section 401 certiﬁcation applies to nonpoint source discharges such as rainfall runoﬀ as well as point source discharges from pipes or ditches this question was raised in lawsuit in oregon where federal court ruled that section 401 does not apply to nonpoint source discharges still some interests tinue to favor broad reading of 401 that would apply to both nonpoint and point sources of pollutant dischargeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97488 order code 97488 updated august 21 2008 clean water act section 401 background and issues claudia copeland specialist in resources and environmental

point sources of pollutant discharges background under the clean water act cwa an applicant for federal license or permit to conduct any activity that may result in disc harge to waters of the united states must provide the federal agency with secti on 401 certification the certification made by the state in which the discharge originates declares that the discharge will comply with applicable provisions of the act including water quality standards states water quality standards specify the designat ed use of stream or lake eg for water supply or recreation pollutant limits necessa ry to protect the designated use and policies to ensure that existing water uses will not be degraded by pollutant dischargeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97488crs2 1 clive j strong statement on behalf of the na tional association of attorneys general in us congress senate committee on environment and public works subcommittee on environmental protection water pollution prev ention and control act of 1991 hearings on s 1081 102d congress 1st session washington us govt pr int off 1991 shrg 102335 p 805 hereinafter 1991 senate hearingsection 401 provides states with two distin ct powers one the power indirectly to deny federal permits or licenses by withholding certification and two the power to impose conditions upon federal pe rmits by placing limitations on cer tification gene rally section 401 certificati on has been applied to hydropower projects seeking license from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and to dredgeandfill activities in wetlands and other waters that require permits from the us army corps of engineers cwa section 404 and sections 9 and 10 of th rivers and harbors act it also is applied to permit requirement s for industrial and municipa l point source dischargers cwa section 402 in addition it has the pot ential to be applied to range of other activities that could affect water quality point that has increasingly become an issue because participation by st ates in section 401 certification is optional they may waive the authority if they choose to do so state implementation s varied in recent years however many states have come to vi ew section 401 as an important tool in their overall programs to protect the physical and biological in addition to the chemical integrity of their waters so have begun using section 401 to address wide range of impacts to the quality of their waters including impacts to aquatic habitat such as wetlands where issues of nonchemical impacts arise through section 401 some states have addressed impacts of project such as in adequate river flow inundation of habitat dissolved oxygen levels and imp acts on fish and other wildlife this expanded use of section 401 has in turn led to tensions between state and federal agencies especially ferc and regulated entities over the scope of the states section 401 authority particularly the extent to which states can legally address water flow requirements in water quality standards some state c ourts have placed limitations on the use of section 401 at least for hydropower pr ojects to address only chemical impacts of projects such as dissolved oxygen or numeric chemical criteria and not physical impacts filling of aquatic habitat in streambed as result of the project or biological impacts effects on fish migration for example other courts have adopted broader view and allowed states to condition certification on compliance with all applicable water quality related laws 1990 supreme court case california v ferc 495 us 490 known as the rock creek case addressed the issue of whether hydropower projects must comply with any aspect of state water use law the court held that with regard to federally licensed hydropower facilities the federal power act pr eempts state water use law including states comprehensive arrangements for allocating water among competing uses stakeholder concerns and other court rulings for the most part the debate over the s ection 401 certification issue has centered on states and hydropower interests many stat have long favored clarifying the cwa to confirm their broad authority to impose conditions on federally permitted activities this position was described in testimony at 1991 senate subcommittee hearing1httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97488crs3 2 gail ann greely statement on behalf of th national hydropower ssociation in 1991 senate hearing p 810an overly narrow reading of section 401 would deprive the states of the ability to maintain the very beneficial uses that th clean water act was designed to protect federal agencies could permit activities that would undermine states investment in pollution control efforts and impose double st andard for different activities affecting the same instream values it makes sense to authorize states to implement clean water act programs designed to protect be neficial uses and yet leave them powerless to prevent federally permitted activity from impairing those values the comprehensive nature of state management of water quality and water quantity means that the states are best situated to determine whether federally permitted activity will fully protect beneficial uses the states have lead responsibility for protecting water quality under the clean water act and for administering laws governing allocation of water quantity water quality and quantity are inextricably linked both are essential to maintainin g the integrity of the nations waters hydropower interests favor llowing federal agencies such as ferc to determine what conditions on project are necessary for protection of water quality or to satisfy other criteria in light of the important purposes di rected by congress in other laws specifically the federal power act2 the current limitation on the role of the states in the federal hydropower licensing process is that ultimately the ferc must make the decision balancing the multitude of resource interests affected by the project the expansive reading of section 401 water quality certification being used in some states crosses this barrier using this mandatory water quality review to effectively take control of all aspects of the project expansion of 401 certifica tion places authority for an energy resource in the effective control of state water quality agen cy that is not responsible for utility rate stabilization assuring adequate water supplies promoting clean air technology or controlling floods the supreme court again considered the section 401 issue in 1994 in public utility district pud 1 of je fferson county and city of tacoma v washington department of ecology 511 us 700 1994 the court held that state may impose minimum stream flow requirements as condition in sec tion 401 certification for proposed hydropower facility because the cwa allows states to condition certification upon any effluent limitation or other appropriate state law require ment to ensure that the facility will not violate state water quality standards impositi on of the condition as part of the section 401 certification does not c onflict with fercs authority to issue license under the federal power act the court said the ruling said that states may regulate the impacts of project as whole so long as there is discha rge involved thus the conditions state may require are not confined to the discharge itsel f but can address range of conditions as part of their certifications such as the impacts of dams removal of water from river further federal agencies must include stateimposed conditions in the license or permit this decision pleased states which had sought confirmati on of their power to impose minimum stream flow and other requirements of state water quality standards environmentalists who have supported states use of s ection 401 to address aquatic habitat alteration and biological diversity of the nations waters were similarly pleasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97488crs4 development and hydropower interests on the other nd said that it would make licensing of hydropower facilities more diffi cult and costly the utility industry was concerned that state water quality agencies reflect narrow viewpoint under their mandates and could bias licensi ng policies by not adequately addressing power needs the supreme court revisited these issues in 2006 in case brought by the owner of several hydropower dams in maine who had challenged th states 401 certification for renewal of its ferc licenses for the dams arguing that the dams did not produce the requisite discharge under the cwa the c ourt unanimously held that states through section 401 certification can impose conditi ons on ferc licensing or relicensing of hydropower facilities that states find necessary to prevent adverse alteration of water quality s d warren co v maine board of environmental protection 126 s ct 1843 2006 states and environmental groups appl auded the ruling as many had feared that an adverse decision would hinder the ability of states to require measures to ameliorate the effects of hydropower dams on water quality and aqua tic life for dditional information see crs report rs22429 the state role in the federa l licensing of hydropower dams s d warren co v maine board of environmental protection section 401 and land runoff in 1996 federal district court in oreg on ruled that section 401 applies to all federally permitted activities that may result in discharge including discharges from nonpoint sources oregon natural desert association v thomas 940 fsupp 1534 dor 1996 the case sought to have the u s forest service obtain state section 401 certification that cattle grazing under forest service permit would not violate water quality standards the forest service argu ed that under the cwa only discharges from point source or nonpoint source with conveya nce ie pipe or channel outlet are regulated and while cattle grazing may cause water pollution it is not regulated discharge under the act however in its ru ling the district court distinguished the definition of discharge from discharge of pollutant from point source and said that pollution caused by cattle grazing constitutes discharge into navigable waters within the meaning of section 401 of the clean water act therefore state certification under section 401 was required before the us fore st service issued cattle grazing permit supporters said that the ruling gave states new regulatory power over federal licenses or permits that affect wate r quality by clarifying that section 401 applies to nonpoint source discharges of water po llution in addition to point source discharges point sources are discrete conveyances such as pipes or ditches from which pollu tants are discharged nonpoint source pollution is rainfall and s nowmelt runoff from far mlands ranches city streets and similar areas the ruling had the potential to give states stronger hand in determining how federa l lands should be managed if so the impact on states could be significant since cattle grazing is common activity on millions of acres of western lands managed by the forest service and the us bureau of land management and states could face substantial workload in processi ng section 401 certifications for hundreds of grazing permits annually ad ditional impacts could occur if section 401 were held to apply to other types of federally permitte d activities generally categorized as nonpoint sources such as timber harvesting or logging federal agencies disagreed over how to re spond to the oregon district courts ruling epa favored letting the decision stand on the basis that nonpoint source pollution is thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97488crs5 most significant contributor to water polluti on in many states and the decision would give states more power to manage it the agriculture department parent of the forest service on the other hand urge d the department of justice to support an industry groups appeal of the case and ultimately the government did join in appealing the decision in 1998 federal court of appeals reversed the district courts ruling finding that cattle grazing on federal lands does not fall within the type of pollution covered by section 401oregon natural desert association v dombeck 151 f3d 945 ca9 1998 the court found that congress intende d to permit direct federal re gulation of effluent flowing from point sources but to regulate nonpoint source pollution only through federal grants not through section 401 wate r quality certification in november 1999 the supreme court declined to review the case the state of oregon had responded to the 1996 district court decision by adopting rules establishing certification process for livestock grazing permits on federal lands in oregon however after the court of appeals reversed that ruling and the supreme court declined to review it the state withdrew th rules groups repres enting ranchers farmers and similar interests were pleased that the district courts ruling was overturned believing that congress did not intend section 401 to apply to nonpoint source pollution other cwa programs and tools such as financia l incentives are better means of addressing nonpoint source pollution problems some say environmentalists disagreed with the appeals courts conclusi on and the legal outcome of the cas and many continue to argue that section 401 generally supports readin g that includes nonpoint source discharges in broader context some observers had vi ewed the district courts ruling as giving boost to ongoing activities in states to develop total maximu m daily load tmdl allocations on pollutionimpaired water bodies efforts to carry out this clean water act requirement have been prompted by lawsuits in more than 35 states claiming that epa and states have failed to fulf ill mandates in the law for additional information see crs report 97831 clean water act and total maximum daily loads tmdls of pollutants in many cases tmdls are being developed that result in imposition of pollution control requirements and other measures on nonpoint sources as well as point sources in order to improve water quality and attain water quality standards while the 9th circuits ruling did not directly affect the tmdl process some persons saw the reversal of the lower courts ruling as re moving one possible argument for involving nonpoint sources in tmdl processes legislative response since the mid1990s congress has shown in terest in these issues in proposals reflecting varying perspectives but legisl ation that would modify section 401 has been enacted in the 103rd congress interest in clarifying the scope of section 401 certification authority led to several propos als the senate environm ent and public works committee included one such provision in s 2093 cw reauthorization bill it would have strengthened section 401 by clarifying that applicants for fede ral license or permit including applicants for ferc license to ope rate hydropower facilitie s must obtain state certification that the project will comply with water quality standards and will allow for attainment and maintenance of designated us included in the states standards the senate did not act on s 2093httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97488crs6 3 federal energy regulatory commission staff report to congress hydroelectric licensing policies procedures and regulations co mprehensive review and recommendations may 2001 145 pp following the supreme courts 1994 pud n 1 decision disputes over section 401 became an issue in the congress at the end of the 103rd congress legislation was introduced to amend the clean water act and overturn the decision s 2566 the sponsor of the bill senator wa llop said that the courts d ecision threatened state water law by limiting the amount of water that could be used for the project in question and thus interfering with state water rights sy stems and the integrity of the ferc hydropower licensing process the senate did not act on this bill the 104th congress addressed the issue in hr 961 cwa reauthorization bill passed by the house in 1995 section 507 woul d have made secti on 401 inapplicable to hydropower projects if ferc were to determine that the state s certification is inconsistent with the federal power act the bill also would have set up mechanism to be administered by ferc to resolve differences arising between the state and ferc on questions relating to the cons istency of the 401 certification to hydropower project that is in the event of dispute between ferc and state over 401 certification of hydropower project ferc would be authorized to resolve the dispute between itself and the state this provision in hr 961 was one of several proposed to address the issue some members favored simply exempting hydropower projects from clean water act regulation arguing that ferc project review is intended to consider inputs of state and federal agencies indian tribes and the public in connection with licensing and relicensing decisions others argued that states should continue to have authority to regulate matters related to water quality cerns section 507 attempted to balance those concerns however further action occurred on hr 961 during the 104th congress and similar legislation has not been proposed subsequently most recently legislative interest in section 401 occurred in connection with recommendations on national ener gy policy by vice president cheneys national energy policy development group in 2001 it r ecommended that the hydropower licensing process administered by ferc undergo adminis trative and legislative reform so that hydropower can contribute to meeting the nati ons energy needs at the same time ferc report concluded that the most comm on cause of delayed hydropower licensing proceedings is untimely receipt of state wa ter quality certification under the clean water act3 responding to these concerns legislati on was proposed that would give applicants for hydropower licenses increased flexib ility in complying with c onditions imposed by federal agencies such as the department of the interior concerning for example the need for passageways through which fish can travel around dam another issue raised in the ferc report the 109th congress enacted the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 with provision section 241 requiring federa l agencies to consider alternative license conditions proposed by the license applicant while this provision onl addresses the roles of federal agencies in hydropower licensi ng not state certification under cwa section 401 these water quality issues remain of interest to some stakeholders
