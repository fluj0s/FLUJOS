addressing survivors mental health and substance abuse treatment needs introduction hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast in late august 2005 causing catastrophic wind damage and flooding in veral states and massive dislocation of victims across the country according to government sources the storm one of the worst natural disasters in the nati ons history killed at least 1464 people in louisiana1 more than 200 in mississippi and about 20 more in alabama florida and georgia2 hurricane rita made landfall along the gulf coast in late september 2005 while not as deadly rita refloode d new orleans and impacted other areas where katrina evacuees were struggling to recover rita was directly responsible for seven deaths and 55 i ndirect deaths some during the prestorm evacuation hurricane wilma made landfall in south florida in late october 2005 killing five people and also causing extensive damage3 these three hurricanes as well as hurricanes dennis and ophelia and tropical storm cindy each resulted in federal disaster declarations fo r affected areas in 20054 previous research has shown that subs tance abuse and various manifestations of mental illness including anxiety depression posttrauma tic stress disorder ptsd and suicidality often occur or worsen following disasters and that some effects may persist for years5 early studies suggest similar trend in the

the medi cal records of victims with preexisting conditions and the loss of infrastructure and healthcare workers to support the response it is reported for example that new orleans now has only about onethird of the 462 ps ychiatric beds it had before hurricane katrina though the remaining population is at more than lf of the citys pr estorm level and by some accounts has an even greater need for

ccp programmatic and fiscal accountability with one party fema responsible for ccp funding another s amhsa responsible for approval and oversight of proposals and activities and the third the state responsible for implementation accountability for problems with the program may not always be clear fema does not provide scientific technical or medical expertise to support the delivery of mental health or substance abuse services that expertise at the federal level clearly resides with hhs and samhsa establishing authority for ccp in the stafford act which is administered by fema is means to provide funding for crisis counseling services quickly and as needed through the drf assuring that such services can be provide d without regard to constraints that may be imposed by hhss or samhsas annual appr opriations it has the effect however of placing fema in the position of fiscal responsibility for program for which it lacks the requisite technical expertise mechanisms for shared federal

reducing the burdens of postdisaster mental illness if spent differently ongoing debate bout the appropriate scope and duration of services provided under ccp discussed later in this re port see scope of mental health services under ccp and duration of mental health services under ccp reflect ongoing uncertainty about the best way to craft the program to meet statutory objectives unfortunately th discussions are hobbled by weak knowledge base research in this area is ch allenging for several reasons first there are technical challenges in mental health research in general including limited suite of standardized measurement tools limited information on the baseline prevalence of mental illness in populations and difficulty in comparing studies that use different measurement tools or followup times sec ond disasters are by their nature episodic varying in type severity and location making comparisons difficult finally different types of disasters may affect the mental health of victims in different ways for example some experts feel that vi ctims responses to war or terrorism are substantially different from their responses to natural disasters samhsa reports that it will be

that go beyond those provided for by ccp which only provides referral to mental health services neither the stafford act nor femas regulations clearly articulate or restrict the scope of professional counse ling services as stated in the act or individual and group treatment procedures as stated in the regulations53 these terms do not clearly relate to specific services delivered in the field of mental health however samhsa makes matters more clear in its guidance explaining that ccp is not intended to provide mental health treatment which it describes in clinicolegal terms as involving diagnosis and other activitie s that may only be carried out by state licensed providers according to samhsa in contrast to the crisis counseling services provided through the ccp mental health treatment implies the provisi on of assistance to individuals for an existing pathological condition or disorder in this context it involves providing variety of interventions following the assignment of diagnosis this diagnosis is made following an evalua tion andor psychological testing by licensed mental health professional du ring treatment the provider maintains documented treatment plan and recor d the mental health professional is licensed by the state and is protected by nd is subject to wide variety of legal matters including malpractice informed consent to treatment confidentiality and patienttherapist privilege54 samhsa notes that the thrust of th ccp since its inception has been to serve people responding normally to an bnormal experience and that the services funded focus on

for more comprehensive description of the services and treatme nt venues included under the term mental health treatment see appendix c in recent news story psychologist in florida questioned whether ccp counselors who were not formally traine d in diagnosis could accurately screen disaster victims and whether their lack of professional expertise could at times jeopardize the welfare of those receiving services59 however assuming that ccp services are potentially beneficial limiting services to those provided by licensed professionals would likely ma ke the program more costly and be hampered by the limited numbers of these professionals in project liberty ccp services were expanded to provide enhanced screening methods and broader array of brief c ounseling approaches for

individuals who need mental health care are also in need of treatment for substance abuse however ccp funding does not support substance abuse treatment services thus separating treatment for ntal health and substance abuse problems samhsas guidance reco mmends referring people with substance abuse disorders to specialized providers because the mental health system of which crisis counseling is part may not be the most appropr iate and qualif ied to provide these services in 2000 congress direct ed samhsa to report on prevention and treatment services for individuals who have cooccurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders and to realign its block grant programs to better meet the needs of these individuals70 while the effort to coordinate routine services in the states could lead to better coordinati on when states set up postdisaster ccp programs as of 2005 only 14 states and th district of columbia had received samhsa grants to address cooccurring disorders71 some have recommended that ccp outreach workers be trained to work with individuals with substance abuse disorder s training ccp workers in substance abuse treatment would enable individuals with cooccurring disorders to receive both services simultaneously and in the same location howe ver the substance abuse treatment services they receive from ccp workers who are not specialists in the area may not be

response to disasters federal authority and funding by sarah lister fiscal year limits on availability of serg funds in creating authority for emergency mental health and substance abuse serg grants in 2000 congress authorized samhsa to reallocate up to 25 of its discretionary appropriations fo r this purpose in given fiscal year the agency may determine based on its pla nned obligations for fiscal year that the actual amount it could make available may be less than the 25 permitted also as fiscal year progresses the agency would have av ailable to it fewer funds from which reallocation could be made because hurrican katrina and rita occurred at the end of fy2005 samhsa had only 600000 that it could make av ailable for serg grants as the timing of the emergencies for which the program is designed are often unpredictable congress may consider options to give samhsa more fiscal flexibility in making serg grants these include giving the agency the authority to fund in advance up to the 25 ceiling based on the total appropriation for the current fiscal year and clarifying mechanism by which serg awards could be made when the agency was functioning unde r continuing appropriations resolution each approach carries the ri sk that the awards made could erode the agencys budget for the subsequent fiscal year samhsa could also finance emergenc response grants through

the application for ccp funds stat are required in their isp and rsp applications to document that their capacity is inadequate to meet the needs created by the disaster also for the rsp the guidance requires that states incorporate fema damage assessments into their assessments of mental health and crisis counseling needs75 several initial needs assessments were conducted in the aftermath of the hurricanes following hurricane katrina samhsa streamlined the needs assessment requirement for states applying for ccp funding as part of this streamlined process states used only preliminary data to submit needs and resources assessment for counseling services as part of their ccp application in two separate surveys in october 2005 samhsa projected the potential overall mental health needs of those impacted by the hurricanes and the cdc conducted survey of returning new orleans re sidents samhsa estimated th at 500000 residents may have needed mental h ealth assistance and cdc found that

assessments and develop stra tegies to address mental health and substance abuse service needs following disasters ther has been corresponding legislation introduced in the house s 3721 would so expand ccp to cover substance abuse services see the prior s ection scope of mental h ealth services under ccp conclusion hurricane katrina was one of the most devastating natural disasters in the nations history one year later congress and others continue to study the adequacy of the response and approaches for future improvement the field of disaster mental health continues to evolve with lessons learned from the 2005 hurricanes and their aftermath the 2005 hurricanes prompted once again familiar set of questions what types of mental health and substance abuse problems are victims likely to face after disaster how long might these problem s last and how might they change over time are there interventions that are likely to be of benefit if so when should they be delivered and by whom how can victims who would benefit from assistance be identified and how should they be monito red what can the federal government offer through assistance to states indivi duals and others that would be helpful to victims in enabling them to recover and move on with their lives the federal programs set up to address mental health and substance abuse problems in those affected by the 2005 hurricanes offer opport unities for scrutiny careful study of these programs and those established af ter the oklahoma city bombing and the 2001 terrorist attacks could lend clarity to and
