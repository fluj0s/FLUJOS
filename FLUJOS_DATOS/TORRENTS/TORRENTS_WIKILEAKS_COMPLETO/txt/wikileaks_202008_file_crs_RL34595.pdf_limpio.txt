alternatives alfred cumming specialist in intelligence and national security december 5 2008 abstract after the repeated urging of the department of energy doe congress in 2006 agreed to temporarily consolidate separate counterintelligence ci oﬃces at the department of energy and the national security administration nnsa into single ci oﬃce under doe control doe had complained that the dual oﬃce structure was ineﬀective in permitting doe to consolidate the two oﬃces congress reversed its 1999 authorization to establish separate nnsa ci oﬃcea decision that at the time was prompted by congressional concerns over repeated departmental security and counterintelligence lapses at the same time in 2006 doe combined its separate oﬃces of intelligence and counterintelligence into new doe oﬃce called the oﬃce of intelligence and counterintelligence the department reasoned that combining the disciplines of counterintelligence and foreign intelligence under one integrated oﬃce would foster synergistic cooperation that would lead to more strategic and ultimately more eﬀective counterintelligence program this report analyzes both consolidationsthe ﬁrst authorized by congress at does request the second initiated by doeand examines the impact of each on the eﬀectiveness of the departments ci program major oversight issue for congress is whether either or both organizational changes will strengthen the departments ci program as intended some observers are concerned that the two consolidations may have undercut ci

establishment in 1977 doe has been repeatedly criticized for its security and counterintelligence effortsviewed as being so seriously deficient that some observers believe doe through its actions has invited attack by foreign intelligence services1 the general accounting office2 the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board and the intelligence community as well as does own inspector general and security experts collectively have issued numerous classified and public reportsaccording to some estimates more than 100in the last 30 years that have highlighted litany of doe security and counterintelligence vulnerabilities because of these vulnerabilities many believe that sensitive nuclear weapons information has certainly been lost to espionage in countless other instances such information has been left vulnerable to theft and duplication 3 although the damage to national security resulting from such lapses has been difficult to calculate doe has been warned on many occasions that its lackadaisical oversight could ad to an increase in the nuclear threat to the united states4 according to some analysts given does unwieldy bureaucratic structure security lapses should not be viewed with surprise doe was established in 1977 by combining 40 diverse government organizations the intention was to harness the nations research laboratories as part of coordinated government effort to confront an energy crisis brought on in part by creation of opec5 each agency however came with its own bure aucratic structure and culture and many had different if not conflicting missions the agencies also differed in the importance they attached to security and ci some such as the energy research and development administration home to the nations highly sensitive nuclear weapons program viewed such matters as being relatively more important others such as the as the interior departments power marketing administrations attached low priority to such matters these sometimes starkly diverging views although having moderated over time arguably contribute to the crosscurrents and conflicting pressures that have bedeviled does security program and contributed to its lapses from the outset these varying views in turn may stem from certain builtin and enduring tensions which to large degree are inherent in does four principal missions three of those missions fundamental science energy resources and environmental qualitythrive indeed depend on open scientific inquiry it is does fourth mission national security that demands that security be 1 see presidents

g344g561the backdrop for scientific inquiry6 the result is an everpresent potential for conflict and an enduring challenge to strike the right balance between open collaboration and partnership and security so serious have been the ramifications of this challenge that one study has concluded doe has never fully recovered from some of the internal contradictions growing out of its own complicated creation7

although many critics blame does security pr oblems generally on the tension within doe between open scientific inquiry and security they tend to focus on what they characterize as inter alia three specific issues high turnover of inexperienced top leadership bloated and dysfunctional management and an agency culture that views the discipline of counterintelligence with disdain high leadership turnover has been an enduring problem according to department critics they point to the eleven secretaries who have led the department over an almost 30year period although some secretaries have pushed aggressive security reforms they often have left office before having fully implemented their proposals following their departures the proposed reforms may be discarded or forgotten another cited problem has been lack of experience in national security among some of those who have served as secretary although doe spends almost third of its budgetroughly 30 percenton nuclear related functions many of its top leadership have lacked prior experience in such matters as result security and ci problems may often have been seen as lesser priorities and decisions on such matters left to lowerranking officials who often have lacked either the incentive or authority to take quick decisive action 8 second factor cited related to does security record is the departments management structure which has been characterized by critics as bloated and dysfunctional multiple bureaucratic layers reportedly have so diffused authority and left accountability so erratic that it accountability is now almost impossible to find 9 consequently security and ci shortcomings appear to have gone unaddressed finally critics blame does culture for contributing to an environment in which legitimate ci concerns are viewed with ambivalence at best and open hostility at worse the environment it is suggested is in large measure natural and somewhat ironic outgrowth of brilliance from doe scientists some of whom bridle under the restraints and regulations imposed by administrators and bureaucrats who do not entirely comprehend the precise nature of the operation being managed 10 thus to some extent the very brilliance of its employees is cited as significant contributing factor to bureaucratic culture which they say is thoroughly saturated with cynicism and disregard for authority and cavalier in its attitude toward security 11 6 does national security program also depends on open scientific inquiry and international collaboration but in secure and classified environment 7 presidents foreign intelligence advisory board science at its bestsecurity at its worst june 1999 p 8 8 ibid p 5 9 ibid p 4 10 ibid p 11 11 ibid p 6

does ci program received particular serious jolt in 1998 when intelligence evidence surfaced that indicated the peoples republic of china prc had successfully stolen nuclear weapons secrets from the departments weapons complex this information led the clinton administration to conclude that the departments ci program wa s in serious trouble and that program overhaul could not be put off in february 1998 president clinton issued decision directive pdd61 instructing doe to implement 13 reforms the balance of which was geared to strengthening the departments ci program among the most significant of the reforms was one that required doe to establish its firstever independent counterintelligence officeknown formally as the office of counterintelligence oci the mission of the new office was to develop and implement coherent and comprehensive ci policy senior federal bureau of investigation fbi executive with access to the energy secretary was put in charge the presidents directive contained several additional initiatives one authorized the oci director to oversee and fund all does ci functions including all direct ci operations and all of does laboratorybased ci field offices 12 second initiative required that doe laboratories be contractually obligated to meet certain ci goals objectives and performance standards and lastly senior laboratory ci personnel were given direct access to laboratory directors under 1999 followon implementation plan the oci directors authority was expanded to include control over all ci programming funding and personnel matters at doe field offices pdd61 represented an effort to address longs tanding weaknesses in does ci program does ci program historically had never had bureaucratic home of its own instead the program invariably characterized as junior partner was component of larger office in the 1980s the office of security which was tasked with physically protecting doe facilities and in the 1990s the office of intelligence whose principal mission was to assess foreign weapons of mass destruction programs in each instance the offices principal respective missions did not include the development of an aggressive unified and comprehensive ci program aimed at preventing espionage and the development of such program is generally considered not to have begun until president clinton issued pdd61 pdd61 addressed other perceived weaknesses as well among them insufficient ci funding inadequate headquarters control and authority over its ci field offices uneven and irregular access by the departments ci officials to seniorlevel doe management inadequately trained doe ci employees and strained relationship with the fbi the agency doe relied on for much of its counterintelligence investigative expertise and resources 13 12 according to doe the department currently operates 19 ci field offices which are located at its laboratories science centers plants and site offices throughout the complex ci field offices are headed by senior counterintelligence officers seven of whom are senior fede ral officers with the balance being laboratory contract workers with extensive ci experience the mission of ci field office is to develop and implement ci program doe also operates cyber operational analysis center oac which is managed by senior federal ci officer 13 for more detailed

vulnerabilities14 in march of that year allegations surfaced that scientist employed by the alamos national security laboratory had failed to notify doe officials of his contacts officials of the peoples republic of china prc it also was alleged that the scientist taiwaneseborn american named wen ho lee had failed to properly safeguard classified material and had refused to cooperate with authorities with regard to certain security matters lee was fired from his research position at alamos national laboratory after allegedly failing polygraph examination he later pleaded guilty to one felony count of unlawful retention of national defense information 15 in may 1999 bipartisan house select commission16 charged that the prc had stolen design information on the united states most advanced thermonuclear weapons and was using the information to speed the building of its next generation of thermonuclear weapons the commission concluded that the prc had been penetrating us national weapons laboratories for years and continued to do so17 in june 1999 the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board pfiab issued an extraordinarily harsh assessment of does security practices the board criticized doe for the worst security record on secrecy that members said they had ever encountered18 it also reported that its examination had revealed department in denial over its security and counterintelligence vulnerabilities and failures and blamed does decadeslong record of security failures on poor organization and failure of accountability the board concluded that with regard to security matters doe was dysfunctional and incapable of reform19 despite its harsh criticism the pfiab dismisse d assertions that doe had suffered wholesale losses of nuclear weapons technology as result of espionage the board concurred however with an earlier us intelligence community assessment that had concluded the prc had stolen 14 media reports of recent allegation of espionage with doe connection involved prc spy katrina m leung who the fbi reportedly said was 20year bureau informant they now suspect was double agent who provided classified material to the prc leung allegedly had affairs with two former fbi agents william cleveland jr who until he resigned his post on april 10 2003 was director of security at does lawrence livermore national laboratory and

consider two options the first option called for the creation of semiautonomous agency within doe that would be strictly segregated from the rest of the department be more mission focused and bureaucratically streamlined and that would be devoted principally to nuclear weapons and national security matters the board cited the national security agency and defense advanced research projects agency both elements of the fense department as models of this approach second option called for the creation of new agency that would be entirely independent of doe and would be headed by an administrator w ho would report directly to the president the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation were cited as models of this approach

pdd61 offered the best approach to resolving does security problems by mandating the establishment of single unified office of counterintelligencecongress approved the pfiabs first option and created semi autonomous agency within doe designated the national nuclear security administration nnsa21 nnsa was placed in charge of all doe national securityrelated nuclear programs22 in establishing the new agency congress also created two separate counterintelligence offices placing the first one at nnsa and the second at doe thus essentially codifying the office of counterintelligence initially established under pdd61 does office was made responsible for developing overall ci policy for both doe and nnsa but implementing that policy only at non weapons facilities nnsas ci office designated the office of defense nuclear counterintelligence odnci was given responsibility for implementing ocideveloped policy at nnsas facilities principally at the doe weapons laboratories the nnsa ci office was to focus on protecting classified nuclear and related defense technology at nnsa facilities while does ci office was to concentrate on safeguardi ng all other technology and doe sites the two offices were to share analytic and investigative resources leading some observers to characterize the arrangement as partially bifurcated ci program 20 ibid p4 21 nnsa facilities include the national

questioned its effectiveness and in 2002 the commission on science and security23 issued report criticizing the bifurcated program the commissions report recommended that doe reestablish single unified program under the departments control that would be responsible for counterintelligence across the doe complex including nnsa the commissions report stated counterintelligence must be an enterprisewide function responsible for counterintelligence issues anywhere within the doe complex furthermore counterintelligence investigations analysis and all other counterintelligence information must be developed within unified organization and provided to the secretary and other senior officials without bureaucratic delays this vital function necessitates one organization with one chief of counterintelligence reporting to the office of the secretary 24 in urging the adoption of unified ci program the commission said foreign adversaries do not limit their espionage efforts to nnsa but search out attractive targets across the doennsa complex moreover they stated that visiting foreign scientists many from countries thought to be interested in conducting espionage at doe facilities often travel to both doe and nnsa sites second study issued in 2003 by the office of the national counterintelligence executive ncix25 similarly concluded that the bifurcated structure not only served to further complicate the formidable challenge of managing ci at doe but also endangered the goals and implementation of an effective ci program26 the ncix report also stated that in light of the history of ci investigations that foundered because of miscommunications within wellestablished agencies the twooffice arrangement has raised the odds of missteps and problems 27 ncix blamed the dualoffice structure for numerous daytoday problems including duplicative and at times contradictory messages to field sites misrouted sensitive ci information related to investigations uncoordinated communications to the fbi and the intelligence community and dual sometimes inconsistent program tasking28 23 the commission on science and security was established in october 2000 at the request of

g349g561according to one law enforcement officer interviewed by ncix during the preparation of its report the twooffice configuration might some day lead the department to miss serious ci breach or prevent the conduct of an effective investigation29 ncix recommended that the two ci offices be consolidated within doe under one senior counterintelligence officer who would be responsible for departmentwide ci program and report directly to the energy secretary30 the directors of central intelligence and the fbi endorsed the ncix findings in separate letters to the chairman and vice chairman of the senate select committee on intelligence31 in 2003 doe secretary spencer abraham publicly joined the debate arguing that partially bifurcated structure was not optimal doe had continued to complain that the structure impeded the smoother functioning of the departments security operations the secretary recommended that the two offices be combined nd placed under the control and authority of doe32

criticism proponents of the new ci structure touted its effectiveness arguing that the nnsa office was focusing the kind of sustained attention on ci at the laboratories that congress had been demanding they argued that nnsas separate dedicated ci office was vital if ci at nnsas weapons laboratories was to receive the sustained attention congress expected they also said that the bifurcated structure had proven successful in other doe programs that shared jurisdiction they instead blamed any significant problems on ineffective and noncooperating program managers rather than on the structure itself as each of the offices began to take on their own identities members of congress also appeared to develop diverse views of the effectiveness of the two office structure rather than recombine the two offices under doe control as secretary abraham had recommended the senate armed services committee approved the establishment of single ci office but placed it under nnsa control the house armed services committee objected and the senates proposal died in conference but the conferees did agree to urge the two offices to improve cooperation noting in their report that the nnsa was originally set up as semiautonomous agency in large part to ensure that there would be adequate focus and priori ty placed on counterintelligence activities the conferees urge the counterintelligence

two ci offices into single office within doe34 in agreeing to does recommendation however congress said it remained unpersuaded the department had fully and faithfully implemented the counterintelligence structure authorized in 1999 and it stated that any of the perceived problems thought to stem from having two ci offices coul d have been resolved by applying greater management resourcefulness 35 congress said it remained skeptical that doe could implement strong security program alluding to the wen ho lee case the conference warned that reconsolidation together with does internal decision to combine its own offices of intelligence and counterintelligence under new office of intelligence and counterintelligence would leave does counterintelligence functions organized as they were when the department experienced significant counterintelligence problems 36 congress adopted legislation that included some safeguards first the legislation contained sunset provision that effectively would re establish nnsas ci office in 2010 second the legislation established an intelligence executive committee within doe to develop and promulgate ci policies the nnsa administrator was designated committee member third the legislation established new positionthe intelligence and counterintelligence liaison within the staff of the nnsa administrator to act as liaison between nnsa and does office of intelligence and counterintelligence lastly the legislation required that doe detail in its annual congressional budget submission the level of funding requested for counterintelligence activities overall and the amount of such counterintelligence funding requested by nnsa 37

g351g561administrator now can hold single individual ultimately accountable for single unified departmentwide ci program another benefit proponents citeone that the co mmission on science and security underscored in its reported in 2002 reportis that consolidation has provided doe unified bureaucratic structure through which the department can more effectively centralize control over ci programming across the doe complex under the previous partially bifurcated structure responsibility for ci was shared between the two offices does office of counterintelligence developed ci policy which nnsas ci office then implemented at nnsa facilities the arrangement was said to lead to disagreements between the two offices and does ci officials questioned whether its nnsa counterparts were exceeding their mission and developing their own ci policies on this point nnsa officials countered that doe failed to develop comprehensive and effective policies and they therefore were left with choice but to develop their policies when necessary proponents and critics appear to agree that the bifurcated structure contributed to the development of divergent management philosophies priorities and interpretations and implementation of doe ci guidance and resulted in inconsistent ci practices across the doennsa complex 38 third benefit one highlighted by ncix in its 2003 report is that consolidation has eliminated or certainly reduced the occurrence of certain daytoday problems that stemmed from twooffice structure in which responsibilities sometimes overlap these problems reportedly included duplicative and at times contradictory messages issued to field sites misrouted sensitive investigative ci information and uncoordinated communications to the fbi and the intelligence community finally consolidation it is argued has provided the official in charge of does ci programthe secretary of energys senior intelligence officer sioexclusive authority to develop and implement more strategicallyoriented doewide ci policy this is particularly important it is suggested given that nnsas program was perceived as largely tactical reactive and ultimately geared to uncovering espionage after the fact according to proponents consolidation has resulted in the development of more strategic and therefore stronger ci programone that focuses predominantly on using foreign intelligence to determine what doe information and computer networks are most at risk of espionage equipped with this knowledge ci officials the argument goes increasingly have been able to construct an aggressive ci program focused on preventing espionage before it occurs we want to harness foreign intelligence to support counterintelligence said one ci official if we can understand the offense the plans and intentions of foreign intelligence services we can harness it 39 proponents point to the development of the common operational picture tool as an example of the kind integrative initiatives that have been launched as result of consolidation this particular tool provides ci officials method by which to represent the ci threat geospatially permitting that ci analysis can be captured collaboratively and comprehensively across the doennsa complex in pointing to the benefits of the nnsadoe consolidation however proponents caution that recent decision to transfer substantial number of ci headquarters staff to another location within the washington metropolitan area could have the effect of undercutting some of those benefits 38 interviews with doe officials

consolidation critics do not dispute that unified office and single chain of command improves accountability but they cite several reasons why doennsa consolidation has undercut the ci capabilities first nnsas ci office focused exclusively on count erintelligence in contrast doe treats ci as component of larger integrated officethe office of intelligence and counterintelligence that also includes foreign intelligence directorate fi which among other tasks assesses intelligence in order to identify those doe technologies most likely to be the target of espionage40 as result of placing ci within larger structure according to critics doe is unable to match nnsa s more focused treatment on this point consolidation proponents argue that doe has always used all appropriate information and resources from the intelligence security and law enforcement communities to address ci concerns compounding what they view as structural bi as is does decision to devote comparatively more time attention and resources to developing its foreign intelligence capabilities this critics suggest has come at the expense of ci capabilities critics describe an emerging programmatic imbalance between foreign intelligence fi and ci they point to does history which is one in which ci often has been relegated to secondary or supporting role first to the does physical security program in the 1980s and 90s and now possibly to its fi program these critics argue that it is this historic trend that prompted congress to establish nnsas ci office in the first place it was not lost on congress according to one senior ci official that doe headquarters was detached from the field reality when it came to dealing with ci issues doe headquarters officials concede they have decided to increase the focus on fi but that they are doing so as part of an overarching strategic effort the goal of which is to more effectively harness fi to support of ci they dispute that such support has come at the expense of counterintelligence second nnsa ci managers some suggest simply were more effective than their doe counterparts have been under the consolidated arrangement it is suggested that nnsa managers developed and implemented number of laudable practices among them frequent communication between nnsa headquarters and field personnel regular laboratory visits by nnsa headquarter ci officials consensus building on ci tactics and strategy effective follow up and relatively quick decisionmaking even in the one area some critics credit does consolidated program for emphasizingstrategic cithey fault doe for what they argue has been its failure to take and resolve some of strategic issues that are integral to any successful strategic plan third nnsa s ci methods and techniques were generally more effective than those now being employed by doe critics say the difference is one of emphasis nnsa placed greater reliance on nonconfrontational briefings and debriefings of laboratory employees an approach that 40 the intelligence directorate operates field intelligence elements which are located at some doe laboratories and assess intelligence related to science and technology trends and foreign nuclear weapons systems httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34595g11g151g157g142g149g149g146g144g142g151g140g142g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561g138g157g561g157g145g142g561g6g142g153

g343g343g561consolidation critics contend is more effective in ferreting out espionage doe it is suggested is taking harderedged investigative approach one critic for example compares does approach to dragnet tactics that assume folks are guilty until proven innocent41 nnsa according to this critic pursued investigations when necessary but generally relied on less aggressive techniques in the belief that such an approach would generate more useful information about possible espionage nnsas philosophy relied on the workforce to help you this observer suggested on this point consolidation proponents contend that does ci program has always employed multidisciplined approach incorporating various ci tools such as investigations analysis cyber activities and ci training and awareness they also argue that both programs were mandated to follow the same ci procedures despite these disagreements critics and proponents appear to agree that unified ci program under single chain of command is preferable consolidation critics however suggest that the ultimate success of any ci program depends more on effective leadership than its does on any particular bureaucratic structure in this regard they state that doe in the past has overseen consolidated program and argue that program effectiveness was undermined by ineffective leadership one consolidation critic conceded that the establishment of nnsas ci office may have represented little more than an effort to work around what some viewed as does historically weak ci management 42 consolidation proponents counter that the doenns consolidation has been in place only since the beginning of 2007 and that it is taking r oot in the aftermath of prolonged period of organizational turmoil characterized in part by high management turnover43 as result they argue efforts to build consensus improve communication and foster collaboration are still in their infancy they also question the quality of some of the ci evaluation assessments conducted by nnsa ci office and say that such assessments are now being undertaken in accordance with doe and ic ci standards

proponents of this consolidation say that by establishing intelligence and counterintelligences directorates in single office doe has strengthened its ci program45 specifically proponents contend more integrated fici structure will make it easier for the departments senior intelligence officer to fost er cooperation between the two disciplines and to develop and implement ci program that is both more synergistic and strategic in approach previously the two programs worked together but on more independent basis that consolidation proponents argued was detrimental to both under the new arrangement they say communication cooperation and collaboration between two disciplines already have improved as result officials have been able to more effectively harness foreign intelligence analysis and use it to fashion more strategically focused ci plans that concentrate on what doe information and computer networks are most at risk of espionage specifically proponents point to increases in ci and fi collection the number of investigative cases opened and in the pace of offensive operations against national security targets further doe officials say the consolidation program conforms with the intent of the fy2004 intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act major goal of which was to encourage the intelligence community to adopt more integrated corporate approach proponents also say that fici consolidation has helped to correct prevailing misperception within the intelligence community that doe had two senior intelligence officersone for intelligence and one for counterintelligence although the department always has had single sio the organizational confusion reportedly contributed to weakening the sios overall program authority which in turn undercut accountability and the operational cohesion between fi and ci can we do the mission if ci and fi are separate one official asked im convinced you cannot 46 proponents further suggest that consolidation has enabled doe to begin the process of establishing an intelligence brand thus simplifying the challenge of distinguishing does intelligence products from those of other intelligence community agencies doing so according to these proponents will help to reverse commonly held intelligence community view that does fi program is mere extension of the cia and that its ci program an extension of the fbi since detailees from the cia and fbi respectively historically headed the two doe programs the argument is that establishing branding will enable doe to more effectively highlight does unique contributions to policymakers 45 doe has proposed that the office of intelligence and counterintelligence be relocated from doe headquarters to site in virginia it has been asserted that before proceeding with such relocation doe must provide congress with written notification of its intentions 46 interview with senior doe official july 17 2007

consolidation has undercut counterintelligence capabilities and authorities first critics insist that ci resources at some laboratories have been cut and they blame the reductions in part on increased fi spending they point to at least two fi initiativesthe energy attache program48 and the collection management initiative49and suggest that funding for both has been provided at the expense of the ci program they also point to ci budget constraints citing several other factors among them continuing resolution that kept ci spending flat despite doe requests for increase50 the transition of some doe laboratories from nonprofit to forprofit status which has resulted in higher payroll and other costs and reported doe headquarters ci contingency fund which has resulted in 10 percent of the overall ci budget being held in reserve to cover unexpected costs51 doe headquarters officials deny that ci funding has been diverted to support fi rather they say they have increased spending for ci but that those increases have gone unrealized because doe has operated under shortterm continuing resolutions since 2006 but they appear to generally agree with consolidation critics who attribute at least some of the blame for budget constraints on the nonprofit to forprofit transition that is underway at some laboratories and the ci contingency fund they contend however that laboratory ci office is doing with less but that each office has gotten little more than the year before 52 critics counter that ci offices at each of the six largest laboratorieslos alamos lawrence livermore argonne pacific northwest oak ridge and sandiahave absorbed 10 percent funding cuts over the last year despite increases in the doe headquarters ci budget and despite the fact that the department is longer operating under continuing resolution53 second critics say the authorities of ci deputy di rector have been eroded since the previously existing independent ci office was eliminated and absorbed by the office of intelligence and 47 interview with senior doe official july 17 2007 48 this initiative is designed to place overt doe intelligence attaches in us embassies where they will focus on energy security issues 49 the collection management initiative involves the production and dissemination of increased quantities of intelligence information reports raw intelligence reports derived from doe intelligence collected passively from doe personnel by doe ci personnel 50 critics assert that any lingering impact of the continuing resolution is long over and yet field ci office has received any budget relief they further contend that does overall level of ci effort is decreasing including at the nnsa laboratories 51 doe ci and fi budget data are classified preventing more detailed

not and that control resides with the deputy dire ctor of administration and while the deputy director like his independent office predecessor continues to have access to the energy secretarygenerally viewed as one of pdd61s more significant provisionshis access to the secretary appears to be at the pleasure of the director of intelligence and counterintelligence to whom the deputy director now reports third critics say they are concerned by suggestions made to senior doe officials that pdd61 is dated and should therefore be placed on an inactive status critics contend that some of the directives most important provisions have been ignored allowing the document to be characterized as dated they cite as an example the elimination of independent office of counterintelligence principal provision original ly contained in the directive critics believe certain provisions however remain in effect and should be preserved one such provision requires that does laboratory contracts cont ain certain ci program goals objectives and performance measures another requires senior ci officials at the laboratories to have direct access to laboratory directors those advocating that pdd61 should be placed on an inactive status say they embrace the ci vision embodied in the directive but insist that some of its key provisions have been superseded by changes in law 54 one change is that the role of the fbi director in selecting doe ci chief has been eliminated see appendix for general di scussion of the fbis role in doe ci under current law the secretary of energy has that authority another change is that there is longer requirement that the ci chief be senior fbi executive which pdd61 required finally in another change the secretary is expected to coordinate his selection with the director of national intelligence relatively new position which was created under the fy2004 intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act and which did not exist at the time pdd61 was issued in 1998 under pdd61 the fbi director recommended selection to the attorney general despite these concerns critics say they agree that communication between fi and ci officials could be improved but they question whether this goal could have been achieved through means other than wholesale reorganization which they characterize as highly disruptive concerns of some ci officials that fici consolidation has weakened ci capabilities and authorities appear to run deep 55 one senior ci official has reportedly resigned because of cuts to his laboratorys ci program according to anothe r ci official budgets for ci programs at does six largest laboratories were cut at the beginning of fy2008 despite doubledigit increase in the departments overall ci budget 56 these funds according to this official are being used to fund projects at doe headquarters as result of the cuts this official said ci analytic capability has been degraded some ci officials argue that ci program managers increasingly are being asked to carry out fi assignments the result of which in some cases is to reduce the time and resources devoted to ci we watched this deemphasis of ci go into peaks and valleysit is huge mistake to demote 54 interview with senior doe official july 17 2007 55 this impression was derived from series of interviews conducted with senior doe officials in october of 2007

the cifi reorganization i spent 10 percent of my time on headquarters stuff now its reversed he said the cifi consolidation itself was unraveling doe headquarters doesnt appreciate how deep the field concerns are another said referring the views of ci officials at does weapons laboratories58 these officials contend that communication between headquarters and the laboratoriesnever very goodhas been made worse by the consolidation finally some officials complain that although one of the principal objectives of consolidation was to foster more strategic approach to ci that certain strategic goals are not being met they cite as examples does inability to adequately address issues of personnel security clearances and the ci implications of doe interactions with foreign scientists whether such interactions occur with visiting scientists in the departments laboratories or when doe laboratory employees travel overseas consolidation proponents acknowledge such criticisms but suggest they underscore continuing communication problems between doe headquarters and ci field offices rather than an actual diminishment in ci operational capabilities59 they also suggest that there are misperceptions about how doe headquarters is managing overall ci spending but insist that the each of does six largest laboratories has received budgetspending authority increases in fy200860 finally they concede that some observers could conclude that some ci funding is being used to support fi effortscritics have cited ci spending in support of the new collection management initiativebut argue

structure opponents could contend that such an approach could disrupt does continuing efforts to construct strategic ci program within the department and jeopardize the gains that have been achieved they also could argue that nnsa s previously existing ci office was overly tactical in its approach to ci and failed to place sufficient emphasis on strategic issues with regard to does consolidated

approach congress could eliminate doe s ci program altogether and place it under the fbis authority although the fbi currently has special agents colocated at certain laboratories under this alternative these agents would take on more assertive leadership roles an advantage of such an alternative is that the fbi is the governments premiere ci organization and therefore is arguably uniquely suited by training and experience to undertake this task disadvantage could be that an fbicontrolled ci program could have chilling effect on the possible cooperation of doe employees particularly scientists and engineers who historically have chaffed at fbis involvement in does ci program

accountability and overall ci program effectiveness with regard to does consolidated fici program they could argue that gains made as result of consolidation could be preserved and expanded by retaining the current structure opponents could argue that nnsas ci program was effective and should be reestablished with regard to does combined fici program they could argue that consolidation has undermined ci authorities and capabilities and had the effect of relegating ci to secondclass status within the department

alternatives the range of alternatives includes 1 instituting classified ci briefings 2 commissioning formal assessment of the benefits derived from does fici consolidation 3 ensuring doe compliance with current law and 4 codifying portions of pdd61

congress could require that doe brief the appropriate congressional committee or committees on the types of ci methods being used especially on the departments most significant pending ci cases an advantage of such an approach would be that it could provide congress with significant new insight into does overall ci efforts such briefings could also lead to better understanding of the strategic interests of certain foreign powers and could provide insights into how effectively doe is interacting and cooperating with the intelligence community at large disadvantage of this alternative would be that such briefings could be considerably time consuming the number of such cases can be numerous detailed and complicated such cases

g5g152g151g156g152g149g146g141g138g157g146g152g151g561 second approach would be for congress to commi ssion an assessment of any benefits that have been derived from the doe fici consolidation such an assessment could enable congress to better evaluate whether the consolidation has indeed improved communication between the two disciplines as doe has suggested as part of such an assessment the departments senior intelligence officer could be requested to demonstrate with concrete examples how the departments fici consolidated program has d to certain program synergies which could not have otherwise been achieved through greater management resourcefulness other than the cost that may be associated with conducting such an assessment there is apparent disadvantage to such approach

another approach congress could pursue is to sure that doe complied with the law when it consolidated the office of intelligence and counterintelligence under the new office of intelligence and counterintelligence some have questioned whether the consolidation is consistent with current law suggesting that consolidation amounted to transfer of function from the office of counterintelligence or the office of intelligence to new layer of bureaucracy within the office of intelligence and counterintelligence 63

approach congress could codify certain pdd61 provisions two such provisions could be viewed as being particularly relevant the first requires that does laboratory contracts contain specific ci goals objectives and performance standards the second provision stipulates that senior laboratory ci personnel be granted direct access to laboratory directors codifying these provisions would ensure that they are legally binding and not subject to termination by administration fiat possible disadvantage of such approach is that it could limit certain executive branch flexibility 63 for more detailed treatment of this issue see srept 109259 which accompanied s 3237 the fy2007 intelligence authorization act pp 4445 the senate select committee asserted that does consolidation effort is arguably inconsistent with current law the committee said th at such an inconsistency woul d exist if the consolidation amounted to transfer of function from the office of c ounterintelligence or the office of

in supporting does ci program64 the directive established an independent office of counterintelligence and directed that the fbi director select and place in charge of the office senior fbi representative more recent example of the fbis formal role is the joint fbidoe agentsinthe labs ail program the ail program is designed to support the fbi counterintelligence divisions strategic priorities which include 1 preventing or neutralizing the foreign acquisition of weapons of mass destruction wmd technology or equipment 2 preventing the penetration of the intelligence community us government or contractors 3 preventing the compromise of us critical national assets and 4 conducting aggressive ci operations against most significant threat nations 65 under this program the fbi has 16 special agen ts at 12 doe locations working with doe ci professionals to execute the ci mission66 despite its expanded role the fbi has more recently lost some of its authority over the program congress eliminated the fbi directors authority to select director for does ci program and the individual serving in that role is long er required to be senior fbi executive under current law the secretary of energy now exercises the selection authority see table a1 below whether the congressional action eliminating the fbis role in the selection process will result in the diminishment of the fbis role in does ci program continues to be the debated whether fbi assumes diminished role turns in part on whether doe develops the capability to recruit train and retain its own ci professionals and thus reduce its historical reliance on the fbi if it is unable to do so fbis potentially diminishing ro could be viewed in less positive light 64 the fbi has played and continues to play an important role in the ci program because it is lead agency for counterintelligence within the united states where all doe labs are located it should be noted however that even within the discipline of counterintelligence there are differ ing approaches arguably the fbis approach relies heavily although not exclusively on ci investig ations and operations to prevent espionage while foreign intelligence agencies recognize the importance of investigations generally their ci focus is on understanding how the adversary operates to collect intelligence and proactively engaging in tactics to prevent the adversarys techniques from being successful military ci organizations generally tend to view ci through the prism of force protection an d use variety of ci tools to reach that end crs is unaware of any empirical studies which have assessed how these approaches have performed relative to one another 65 interview with fbi officials november 6 2007 66 ibid
