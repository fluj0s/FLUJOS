generally requires that any legislation projected to increase direct spending or reduce revenues must also include equivalent amounts of direct spending cuts revenue increases or combination of the two so that the legislation does not increase the onbudget deficit over sixyear period and an 11year period without such offsetting provisions the legislation would require the approval of at least 60 senators to waive the rule and be considered on the senate floor the senate paygo rule does not apply to direct spending or revenues generated under existing law it applies only to legislation considered by the senate consequently direct spending may increase and revenues may decline in any fiscal year due to factors beyond the control of the paygo rule the senate paygo rule differs from the nowexpired statutory paygo requirement established by the budget enforcement act of 1990 in that it is enforced by point of order during consideration of legislation instead of by sequestr ation after legislation is enacted into law in addition the senate paygo rule requires deficit neutrality in sixyear period and an 11year period whereas the statutory paygo rule required deficit neutrality in each year covering sixyear period through fy2006 the statutory paygo re quirement effectively expired at the end of fy2002 ie september 30 2002 the senate paygo rule originated in budget resolution in 1993 as originally established the rule prohibited the consideration of any direct sp ending and revenue legislation that was projected to increase the deficit over 10year period it has been modified and extended five times in subsequent budget resolutions and once in senate simple resolution most recently the senate modified and extended the rule through september 30 2017 by agreeing to the fy2008 budget resolution sconres 21 110 th congress this latest modification brought the senate paygo rule section 201 of sconres 21 in line with the house paygo rule rule xxi clause 10 which was adopted as part of the openingday rules package of the 110th congress since the paygo rule was established in 1993 27 points of order under the rule have been raised of these 27 points of order 24 were sustained and three fell upon the adoption of waiver motion this report will be updated as developments warrant

payasyougo or paygo rule generally requires that any legislation projected to increase direct spending or reduce revenues must also include equivalent amounts of direct spending cuts revenue increases or combination of the two so that the legislation does not increase the onbudget deficit over sixyear period and an 11year period1 without such offsetting provisions the legislation would require the approval of at least 60 senators to waive the rule and be considered on the senate floor direct spending also referred to as mandatory spending is provided or controlled by laws other than appropriations acts generally continues without any annual legislative action and provides spending authority for such programs as medicare unemployment compensation and federal retirement programs 2 it is distinguished from discretionary spending which is controlled through the annual appropriations process furthermore direct spending is under the jurisdiction of the respective authorizing committees while discretionary spending is under the jurisdiction of the senate committee on appropriations revenues which are under the jurisdiction of the senate committee on finance are the funds collected from the public primarily as result of the federal governments exercise of its sovereign powers3 they consist of receipts from individual income taxes social insurance taxes or payroll taxes such as social security and medicare taxes corporate income taxes excise taxes duties gifts and miscellaneous receipts the senate paygo rule does not apply to direct spending or revenues generated under existing law it applies only to legislation considered by the senate consequently direct spending may increase and revenues may decline in any fiscal year due to factors beyond the control of the paygo rule similar statutory paygo requirement as well as limits on discretionary spending was established by the budget enforcement act of 1990 bea title x iii of pl 101508 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 104 stat 13885731388630 and was extended twice in 1993 and 19974 under the statutory paygo requirement the projected net effect of new direct spending and revenue legislation enac ted during each session of congress could not cause positive balance reflecting an increase in the deficit or reduction in the surplus on multiyear pa ygo scorecard for each fiscal year c overing rolling sixyear period through fy2006 this scorecard maintained the balances of the accumulated budgetary effects of laws enacted during the session and prior years the statutory paygo requirement was enforced by sequestration which involved automatic largely acrosstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt 1 the onbudget deficit excludes the social security trust fund surpluses and the net cash flow of the us postal service 2 the rule refers to direct spending as that term is defined by and interpreted for purposes of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 2 usc 900 et seq commonly known as the grammrudmanhollings act as amended section 250c8 of the act states that direct spending meansa budget authority provided by law other than appropriations acts b entitlement authority and c the food stamp program 3 other legislative committees may have jurisdiction over legislation affecting small portion of revenues 4 the bea amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act title ii of pl 99177 99 stat 1038 1101 commonly known as the grammrudm anhollings act the 1993 and 1997 extensions were included in title xiv of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 107 stat 683685 and the budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of pl 10533 111 stat 677712 respectively

instead of by sequestration after legislation is enacted into law in addition the senate paygo rule requires deficit neutrality in sixyear period and an 11year period whereas the statutory paygo rule

consideration of direct spending or revenue legislation that is projected to increase or cause an onbudget deficit in either of two time periods 1 the sixyear period consisting of the current fiscal year the budget year and the four ensuing fiscal years and 2 the 11year period consisting of the current year the budget year and the ensuing nine fiscal years 8 the rule generally requires that each measure including amendments affecting direct spending and revenues not increase the onbudget deficit in either of the two time periods specified9 that is to comply with the rule each measure projected to increase direct spending or reduce revenues must also include changes to existing law that would result in reduction in direct spending an increase in revenues or both by equivalent amounts the full text of the senate paygo rule in its current form is provided in appendix 5 for further information on the statutory paygo requirement see crs report 98721 introduction to the federal budget process by robert keith and crs report rl31194 payasyougo requirement for fy2002 procedural assessment by robert keith 6 at the end of the 107th congress the house and senate passed and president george w bush signed legislation pl 107312 116 stat 2456 that removed the positive balances on the paygo scorecard through fy2006 thereby preventing any future paygo sequestration unless the budget enforcement mechanism is restored for further information see crs report rs21378 termination of the payasyougo paygo requirement for fy2003 and later years by robert keith 7 for discussion of other issues related to paygo rules see crs report rl32835 paygo rules for budget enforcement in the house and senate by robert keith and bill heniff jr 8 the budget year refers to the fiscal year that begins on october 1 of the calendar year in which the session of congress begins the current fiscal year is the fiscal year immediately preceding the budget year taken literally between october and december of any given year the requirement would cover fiveand 10year periods instead of the sixand 11year periods 9 the rule defines direct spending legislation as any bill joint resolution amendment motion such as motion to concur with house amendment or conference report that af fects direct spending as that term is defined by the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 section 250c8 of the deficit control act states that direct spending meansa budget authority provided by law other than appropriations acts b entitlement authority and c the food stamp program while specific provision of the rule defines revenue legislation the rule presumably would apply to any bill joint resolution amendment motion or conference report that affects revenues as defined in the text above the rule explicitly excludes any direct spending and revenue provision in concurrent resolution on the budget or that affects the full funding of and continuation of the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on november 5 1990

projected deficit reduction resulting from legislation except reconciliation legislation enacted since the beginning of the calendar year and not accounted for in the baseline as defined by the rule this is presumably intended to provide some flexibility to the billbybill application of the requirement measure projected to increase the onbudget deficit may use any deficit reduction balance on this ledger as an offset to comply with the paygo rule the rule specifies that the levels of new direct spending and revenues for fiscal year must be determined on the basis of estimates made by the senate committee on the budget sbc10 generally the estimates used by the sbc would be based on the cost estimates prepared by the congressional budget office cbo and for revenue legislation the joint committee on taxation jct but the sbc has the authority to make its own estimates which may vary from the cbo and jct estimates the rule also specifies that the estimates used in determining whether or not measure increases the onbudget deficit and thus violates the paygo requirement must use the baseline surplus or deficit used for the most recently adopted budget resolution congress usually uses the baseline provided by cbo in producing its baseline estimates cbo projects revenues spending and deficit or surplus levels under existing law ie assuming legislative changes 11 for fiscal years not covered by the current budget resolution the estimates must be calculated using the rules set forth in sections 257bd of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 t itle ii of pl 99177 as amended 2 usc 900 et seq 12 the senate paygo rule may be waived or set aside by unanimous consent motion to waive the rule or to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the presiding officer on the point of order requires an affirmative vote of threefifths of the member ship duly chosen and sworn ie 60 senators if seats are vacant finally the current senate paygo rule is set to expire on september 30 2017 g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g18g3g27g9g17g561g20g158g149g142g561 the senate paygo rule originated in budget resolution in 1993 it has been modified and extended five times in subsequent budget resolutions and once in senate simple resolution13 moreover other proposed modifications to the senate paygo rule have been considered 10 this requirement is consistent with other budgetrelate d rules specifically estimates by the senate committee on the budget also must be used to determine any violations of the rules associated with the annual budget resolution see section 312 of the budget act 11 until the expiration of the provisions of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended 2 usc 900 et seq at the end of fy2006 cbo was required to follow the provisions of section 257 of the act in producing its baseline projections see

established the paygo rule as provision in the fy1994 budget resolution hconres 64 103rd congress for the purpose of preventing the deficit reduction expected to be achieved in subsequent reconciliation bill from being used to offset the costs of any new direct spending or revenue legislation 14 section 12c of hconres 64 prohibited the consideration of any direct spending and revenue legislation that would increase the deficit in the fy1994 budget resolution for any fiscal year through fy1998 or would increase the deficit for any other fiscal year through fy2003 in this initial form the senate paygo rule had expiration date following the establishment of the paygo rule in 1993 the senate has modified it several times the changes in the rule have occurred for several reasons including to establish and extend an expiration date to allow onbudget surpluses to offset revenue reductions and direct spending increases and to exempt increases in the deficit assumed by the annual budget resolution the key changes are summarized in table 1 at the end of this section in 1994 year after establishing the paygo rule the senate modified the rule to require direct spending and revenue legislation to be deficit neutral for any one of three time periods 1 the first fiscal year covered by the most recently adopted budget resolution 2 the first five fiscal years covered by the budget resolution and 3 the next five fiscal years after that 15 in addition the modification provided that direct spending and revenue legislation would violate the rule only if it increased the deficit individually and also increased the deficit when combined with any legislation enacted since the enactment of the previous years reconciliation legislation ie the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 this modification to the rule basically permitted the use of any deficit reduction provided in other legislation to be used as an offset for any subsequent deficit increasing legislation the 1994 modification also added an expiration date of september 30 1998 in 1995 the senate modified the paygo rule to allow only deficit reduction resulting from legislation enacted since the beginning of the calendar year to be used as an offset for subsequent legislation in order to comply with the rule 16 the rule however expressly prohibited the use of 14 see us congress committee of

an offset the senate also extended the rules expiration date to september 30 2002 after decades of onbudget deficits the federal government recorded small onbudget surplus for fy1999 moreover at the time baseline budget projections showed onbudget surpluses increasing each year well into the future17 subsequently in 1999 the senate modified the paygo rule to reflect this change in the federal governments budget outlook by allowing onbudget surpluses to be used to offset tax reductions or spending increases 18 that is the rule was modified to prohibit only direct spending and revenue legislation that was projected to cause an onbudget deficit or increase the onbudget deficit instead of such legislation that was projected to increase the unified budget deficit the senate retained the existing expiration date of september 30 2002 in 2002 the rule was allowed to expire on september 3019 two weeks later however on october 16 2002 the senate adopted sres 304 107th congress restoring and extending the paygo rule through april 15 2003 sres 304 retained the basic formulation of the rule with one addition it was expanded to cover any direct spending or revenues included in appropriations acts effectively curtailing the use of such measures potentially to evade the rule due to expired discretionary spending limits and the absence of budget resolution for fy2003 the following year as provision in the fy2004 budget reso lution hconres 95 108th congress the senate modified its paygo rule to exempt legislation implementing the direct spending and revenue policy changes assumed in the most recently adopted budget resolution even though it might have been projected to increase or cause an onbudget deficit20 reconciliation legislation considered in 2003 s 1054 and hr 2 108th congress for example although projected at the time to increase the onbudget deficit did not violate the rule because it was consistent with the reconciliation instructions contained in title ii of the fy2004 budget resolution the senate also extended the rule through september 30 2008 the latest key change to the senate paygo rule occurred in 2007 and reflects the rule in its current form 21 as provision to the fy2008 budget resolution the senate modified its paygo rule by eliminating the exemption for direct spending and revenue changes assumed in the budget resolution in addition consistent with the paygo rule in the house the senate changed the rules applicable time periods to prohibit an onbudget deficit increase in either of two time periods the current fiscal year

consideration of the bills to proceed all 24 points of order against amendments were sustained and thus the amendments fell lastly the point of order against the motion to concur fell upon the adoption of waiver motion as indicated in table 2 motion to waive the point of order raised under the paygo rule was made in each case except one ensign amendment to s 378 two separate waiver motions were made relating to the point of order raised against hr 3167 103rd congress47 of the 27 motions to waive the paygo point of order three motions were successful while 24 were rejected like any other senate rule the senate paygo rule is not selfenforcing senator must raise point of order under the rule in order to prevent the consideration of legislation that violates the rule it is possible therefore for the senate to consider and pass legislation even if it does not adhere to the limits of the paygo rule as long as point of order is not raised in addition during the period the rule has been in effect the senate has at times considered legislation significantly reducing revenues or increasing direct spending and thus increasing the deficit or reducing the surplus without interference from the senate paygo rule because in accordance with the provisions of the rule adopted in the fy2002 and fy2004 budget resolutions the legislation fit within the available onbudget surpluses or was assumed in the budget resolution for example in 2001 the senate considered and passed the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 which the joint committee on taxation projected would reduce revenues by 126 trillion over the 11year period of fy2001fy2011 without violating the paygo rule 48 in addition in 2003 the senate considered and passed the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 pl 108173 which the congressional budget office projected woul d increase direct spending by 395 billion over the 10year period of fy2004fy2013 without violating the paygo rule49 47 as indicated in table 2 the first waiver was rejected on 5938 vote on october 26 1993 the next day however the senate agreed to motion to reconsider the vote on this waiver motion by voice vote the senate subsequently approved the waiver motion by 6139 vote and the point of order against hr 3167 fell 48 see cbo payasyougo estimate hr 1836 economic
