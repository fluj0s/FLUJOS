provide schip funding through march 2009 the update formula for medicare physician payment would have required reduction in the f ee schedule for physician reimbursement of 101 as of january 1 2008

in addition the medicare payment advisory commission medpac will become congressional agency finally additional funds are provi ded to the current population survey to improve the collection of data on stat populations of lowincome children because the paygo rule as reestablished by the 110th congress requires all considered bills to neither have the net effect of increasing the deficit nor reducing the surplus the act includes number of offsets to pay for the aforementioned provisions these offsets include reducti on in federal payments for the medicare advantage stabilization fund in

opportunity either to receive payment usin g the asp methodology or to obtain drugs and biologicals through the caphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34360crs9 under the asp methodology medicares payment for part b equals 106 of the applicable price for multiple source dr ug or single source drug subject to the beneficiary deductible and co insurance applicable prices are derived from data reported by manufacturers unde r the medicaid program the applicable price for multiple source drugs is the volumeweighted average of the asps calculated by national drug code ndc for each calendar quarter the applicable price for single source drugs is the lesser of the volumewe ighted asp or the wholesale acquisition cost mma included language specifying how to calculate volumeweighted asp based on information reporte d by manufacturers the reporting unit was the lowest identifiable quantity of the drug eg one milliliter one tablet however the mma allowed the secretary beginning in 2004 to use different reporting unit the secretary used his discreti on and changed to the amount of the drug represented by the ndc the amount of the drug represented by one ndc may differ from the amount represented by another ndc in february 2006 the office of the insp ector general oig of the department of hhs issued report oei030500310 which stated that the method used by cms was incorrect because it did not use b illing units consistently throug hout the equation it stated that although cms used billing units to standardize asps across ndcs for each healthcare common procedure coding system hcpcs code it did not similarly standardize sales volume across ndcs the hcpcs established by the american medical association is the set of health care procedure codes used by medicare medicaid and other insure rs to process insurance claims the provision requires the secretary to use constant volume weighting in the computation of the asp using the fo rmula recommended by the february 2006 inspector generals report this requirement applies with respect to payment for multiple source and single source drugs and biologicals furnished on or after april 1 2008 for all drug products included with in the same multiple source billing and payment code the provision defines the num erator of the volumeweighted average of the average sales price as the sum of the products for each ndc assigned to such drug products of 1 the manufacturers aver age sales price as determined by the secretary without dividing such price by the total number of billing units for the ndc for the billing and payment code and 2 the total number of units sold the numerator is then divided by the denominat or which is defined as the sum of the products for each ndc assigned to such drug products of 1 the total number of units sold and 2 the total number of b illing units for the ndc for the billing and payment code the provision defines the billing unit as the identifiable quantity associated with billing and payment code as established by the secretary beginning on april 1 2008 for each multiple source drug or biological and for each single source drug or biological that is treated as multiple source drug because it is pharmaceutically equivalent or bioequivalent to anot her drug the payment amount will be the lowest price option available to the secretary section 113 payment rate for cer tain diagnostic laboratory tests glycosylated hemoglobin hba1c is used to monitor how well blood glucose levels are controlled in diabetes patients the current medicare payment rate for hba1c is tied to two hcpcs codes 83036 and 83037 hcpcs code 83037 was developed inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34360crs10 2006 to cover the testing for hba1c by device approved by the food and drug administration fda for home use 83036 is the default code used for the majority of glycosylated hemoglobin tests and not limited to specific methodology this provision changes the medicare payment rate for hcpcs code
