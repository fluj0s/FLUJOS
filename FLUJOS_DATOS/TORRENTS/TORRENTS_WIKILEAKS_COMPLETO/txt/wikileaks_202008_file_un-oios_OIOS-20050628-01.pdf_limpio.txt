ope rations in sudan the audit covered activities with total expenditure of us 192 mil lion in 2003 and 2004 five audit observations and draft audit report were shared with the repre sentative in april and june 2005 on which comments were received in may and june 2005 respect ively the representative has accepted most of the recommendations made and is in the proc ess of implementing them overall assessment oios assessed the unhcr operation in sudan as below average the weaknesses identified taken together or individually significantly impai red the overall system of internal control prompt corrective action is required to significant ly improve the application of key controls oios has taken note that the current management has prom ptly initiated such action programme management for the four partners reviewed reasonable assuranc could be taken that unhcr funds were generally properly accounted for and disbursed in ccordance with the subagreements however the decentralized manner of cors function ing continued to pose problems for accounting and timely and accurate reporting of exp enditures accounts maintenance by the cor workshop was poor and required immediate attent ion the representation has initiated corrective action the representation without obtaining headquarters approval committed unhcr to an excessively generous termination package for cor th at provides benefits far greater than those payable under sudanese law some us 600000 was paid in 2004 for some 100 staff and as much as us 5 million may be required to ter minate all cor staff the cor package was discriminatory as other partners received termi nation benefits that were far lower oios recommended review and renegotiation of the cor f ormula maintenance of accounts by the forest national corp oration required urgent improvement with oios observing absence of basic books of accou nt and instances of internal invoicing competitive procedures were not followed for procur ement totalling some us 50000 project financial and performance monitoring conduc ted by the representation was weak lacking in analysis depth and coverage the representation has taken steps to improve the quality of project control audit certificates for 2003 and 2004 subprojects h ad yet to be obtained the representation has contracted external audit company as of june 20 05 to audit all partners including government partners for the years 2003 and 2004 supply management significant failure of controls in fuel management exposed unhcr to short receipts and pilferage stock records were deficient and receipt issue procedures severely flawed unhcr erroneously paid twice for the july 2004 cons ignments resulting in an overpayment of us 58000 payments were made for fuel not rece ived excess fuel quotas were released to cor and shortage of 39000 litres was noted at so esshowak the representation has accepted the audit observations and initiated corre ctive action oios review of procurement revealed lack of planni ng noncompliance with procedures repeated disregard for established thresholds and i nadequacies in contract management leading to uneconomic acquisition of goods and serv ices and loss to the organization in 2003 and 2004 four contracts in excess of us 100000 ach and aggregating to some us 127 million were not referred to the committee of contr acts for approval productivity of the unhcr funded workshop was extre mely low with each mechanic performing on average only four maintenancerepair jobs per month contract management was poor rendering the organiza tion vulnerable to financial loss there were marked shortcomings in the repatriation transportation contract involving disbursements of us 700000 the representation di d not reject overcharges by the contractor who charged more than double the cted rates in three invoices alone the overcharges disclosed by the audit totalled us 93 000 the vehicle hire contract signed by the representation was not costeffective and some 25 per cent greater than similar contract entered into by the suboffice resulting in extra expenditure of some us 86000 asset management and warehousing required substanti improvement shortcomings noted in warehousing were promptly addressed by the repre sentation assettrak deficiencies have been acknowledged and are being addressed by the re presentation security and safety all unhcr staff in sudan had completed the basic curity training security improvements have been introduced in some locations including shatter resistant film etc further enhancements are envisaged administration in the areas of administration and finance the unh cr offices in sudan generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and proce dures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review overpayments of solardsa totalled some us 13500 and are being recovered the medical insurance plan was managed satisfactori ly and further improvements are

from 6 to 27 march 2005 oios conducted an audit of unhcrs operations in sudan focussing on operations in eastern sudan t he audit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the profession practice of internal auditing oios reviewed the activities of the unhcr representation in sudan and its suboffice so in esshowak and of four of its implementing partners 2 oios previous comprehensive audit of unhcr operations in sudan was conducted in february 2002 the review focused on the years 2000 and 2001 covering expenditure of us 245 million the operations wer assessed as below average and oios noted deficiencies with regard to the accounts main tained by the commissioner for refugees cor excessive payment of staff benefits in cor and poor vehicle management with key controls absent such as logbooks 3 the main caseloads assisted by unhcr since 1967 are eritrean refugees in eastern sudan due to funding constraints rsd activities w ere suspended in june 2004 and assistance to refugees has been declining the orga nized repatriation of eritrean refugees has also been discontinued while closure and conso lidation of the camps were achieved to an extent overall unhcrs planned exit strategy f rom eastern sudan was delayed in southern sudan operations are on the upswing follo wing the signature of the comprehensive peace agreement the operations in da rfur have also been increasing in magnitude the present audit report focuses mainly on the unhcr operations in the east 4 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with management during the exit conference held on 27 march 2005 audit observations detailing the audit findings and recommendations we re shared with the representative in april 2005 draft of this report was shared with the representative and with the director operations for the sudan situation in june 2005 t he comments which were received in may 2005 and june are reflected in the final repor t the representation has accepted most of the audit recommendations made and is in the pro cess of implementing them ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to ev aluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets and compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subagreements iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on 2003 and 2004 programm activities under projects 0304absudcm200 0304absudrp371 and 03 and 04absudls452 with 2 expenditure of us 163 million our review concent rated on the activities implemented by commissioner for refugees cor expenditure of us 46 million forest national corporation fnc expenditure of us 094 million sudanese red crescent src expenditure of 072 million and human appeal intern ational expenditure of 06 million we also reviewed activities directly implemented by unhcr with expenditure of us 59 million 7 the audit reviewed the administration of th representation in khartoum and so esshowak with administrative expenditure totalling us 29 million for the years 2003 and 2004 and assets with an acquisition value of us 287 million and current value of us 71 the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in sudan was 241 this included staff on regular posts united nations vol unteers project staff and staff on mission 8 the audit also followedup on findings and recommendations made in the 2002 oios audit regarding the state of accounts in cor vehicle management and payment of benefits in cor 9 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations programme issues project monitoring 10 project financial and performance monitori ng was weak particularly at so showak there was little evidence of systematic and regular verification of the accounts and performance of partners the verification notes wh ere available were brief limiting themselves generally to observations on budgetary c ontrol and recommendations to recover unspent balances there was analysis of the adeq uacy of the accounting system internal controls performance aspects or even proper revi ew of transactions including of large procurement monitoring visits were undertaken only on quarterly basis and their periodicity should be increased depending on the p artner the representation has initiated action in this regard by designing standard forma t for project monitoring and has already conducted the first in series of capacity buildin g training in the area of project control with the arrival of the project control officer th overview of financial and performance issues will improve b termination benefits paid to cor staff 11 the obligation to pay employee benefits in cluding termination benefits generally arises from contractual arrangements between the tity and employee legislative requirements industry practice and business practi ce the termination benefits provided to cor by unhcr in terms of the september 2003 agreeme nt are well in excess of those provided under the sudanese law and did not take i nto consideration their benchmarks average salary for the last three years number of months of pensionable service and age at retirement separation based on the agreement unhc r paid us 600000 in 2004 alone 3 for only 101 staff with additional terminations co ming up over the course of the next years the total cost of the agreement is estimated at abo ut us 5 million considering the financial value of this separation package oios wou ld have expected the bureau to be involved as well as advice sought from the legal af fairs section particularly as an mou was signed with cor committing unhcr to these payme nts it is not clear who authorized the representation to enter into such longterm commitment for unhcr 12 oios noted that the formula was first agre ed in july 2003 and based on joint technical committee comprising of unhcr staff and t he cor finance director the committee deliberated upon three formulations name ly the cor formula the unhcr proposal and the ilo proposal the benefits calcula ted according to the ilo formula were lowest followed by the unhcr estimates and the hig hest were the benefits calculated by cor it is worth mentioning that the technical comm ittee decision was sent to headquarters in july 2003 after it had been signed by cor and endorsed by the representative in other words it was sent to head quarters not as proposal for approval but as fait accompli as the agreement had already been signed the mou w as signed thereafter in september 2003 even though approv was received from the desk in oios opinion the formula for calculating the amou nt due to cor staff is flawed as it is imprudently based on the last salary drawn and not an average salary based on the length of service or portion thereof this means that each sa lary increase triggers an increase in the retirement benefits for the entire period of servic 13 oios also noted that different formulae we re used for terminating staff of partners in 2004 the 2003 formula was applicable only to co r while terminated staff of other implementing partners benevolence international an d the sudanese red cross were given benefits under the 1995 formula overall the cor f ormula obligates payments that are between four to six times more than the benefits re ceived by other implementing partners for the same period of service there is risk tha t the mou might be legally challenged by other implementing partners on the grounds of discr imination oios maintains the view that the agreement is not in the best interest of u nhcr and should be renegotiated 14 the representation recognizes the implications of t he september 2003 agreement and will seek legal advice negotiate with the impl ementing partners and propose alternatives to headquarters for approval however the termination of staff in connection with current camp closure will follow the existing agreement otherwise it would seriously jeopardize current relations with cor as well as ac tivities designed to benefit those of concern to unhcr recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sudan should review the 2003 retirement package offered to the commissioner for refugees and should renegotiate the mou on the basi s of the formula foreseen by sudanese law rec 01 c preparation of detailed budgets at the represent ation 15 the representation should reexamine the c urrent method of preparing detailed budgets for partners some of the 2004 cor detailed budgets are spread over 62 pages budgets for other partners such as the fnc are also equally lengthy such vast budgets entail equally extensive and complicated spmrs thi s also caused problems in financial 4 reporting project control and in auditing as well moreover as the budgets were very often revised the process was disorderly and ultimately resulted to certain extent in reduced levels of control over partners by unhcr more si mplified and systematic approach is justified involving consolidation of budget lines and locations the representation agreed to simplify the process of preparing detailed budge ts for partners b review of implementing partners 16 for the four partners reviewed reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were generally properly accounted for and dis bursed in accordance with the subagreements however oios did observe several lacunae in the accounting systems of partners and recommended improvements internal c ontrols for most partners were operating satisfactorily for cor there is rigid system of internal controls governing financial transactions and each payment passes thro ugh several layers of bureaucracy 17 the major implementing partners in sudan re government partners who are subject to audit by the national audit authority h owever this audit is often delayed and thus large subprojects are left unaudited for year s this presents risk and the representation is now in the process of shortlisti ng firms to carry out the audit of all partners including cor the representation has contracted an international auditing firm to audit all unhcr partners in sudan for 2003 and 2 004 projects in accordance with specified terms of reference commissioner for refugees 18 oios reviewed cor locations at their headq uarters in khartoum assistant commissioner for refugees acor office at esshowa k central logistics unit showak cors esshowak workshop and cor girba co r continued to operate on the basis of sites with each site being responsible for their own manually prepared accounts budgetary control cashbooks preparation of spmr nd associated activities each site submits their spmr to unhcr separately which is th consolidated this system of operating through decentralized cost centres poses problems during project verification and monitoring at single place can one obtain an verview of the entire cor operations overall the manner in which cor operates is not co nducive to efficient and timely reporting of financial and physical performance oi accordingly recommended strengthening of cor headquarters supervisory role over the budgets and accounts of subordinate offices and periodical checks of field accounts the representation accepted the recommendation and also stated that from januar 2005 cor would submit only one consolidated spmr for each subproject which would simplify recording and monitoring of subprojects i state of accounts in cor offices 19 in few subprojects oios noted problems for instance in subproject 04absudrp371a the spmr could not be reconcile d with the accounts at assistant commissioner for refugees acor office as the budg ets had not been revised in the partners records and acor office was still working with the prerevision figures many budget lines still showed commitments and this cann ot be permitted in final spmr acor reported an expenditure of sdd 1736 million us 69440 against budget of sdd 10 million overspending the budget for readym ade meals by some sdd 73 million 5 us 29200 oios noted that sdd 466 million us 18640 out of the sdd 1736 million us 69000 was used to pay allowances for repatriation to acor staff as this budget line is meant for readymade meals it was n ot permissible to charge allowances to it cor claimed that this had been done with the ap proval of unhcr though written evidence could be produced the representation did not offer specific reply to the overspending or the misclassification of allowances under readymade meal budget line and whether the amount would be recovered similarly i n subproject 04absudrp371a for 2003 under the esshowak location there was budget line for sdd 2 million us 8000 for the extension of umgilja transit center this budget line was not used for the intended purpose and we observed that allow ances were paid out of it to acor staff such incorrect use of funds should have been rejected during project verification 20 at the cor workshop the general state of accounts was poor and oios was informed that the turnover of incumbents was high nd as many as four accountants had changed in recent times without proper handover f or 04absudrp371a oios could not reconcile the spmr with the accounting figures prepared by cor workshop the ledger had not been kept up to date and many entrie s were not posted therein in 2003 also for the same subproject there were wide variation s in the figures appearing in the spmr and the figures reported in the accounts this indi cates serious problem with the workshops accounts that needs to be speedily addres sed neither the cor workshop nor acor were able to explain these differences ii staff allowancesbenefits and advances to teach ers 21 oios observed that as allowances were paid under more than one subproject the likelihood of cor staff receiving allowances and be nefits from more than one subproject could not be ruled out the number of staff receivi ng the allowances was on occasion more than the figure mentioned in the detailed budgets though the allocated amounts were not exceeded oios also regretted that its 2000 audit r ecommendation regarding nonliquidation of working advances paid to teacher s in the education sector was not implemented and the same situation persisted in sub sequent years it was observed that cor continued to record advances as expenditure and some us 43000 paid in 2003 and 2004 still lacked supporting documents the representation has accepted the recommendation and assured that unsubstantiated exp enditure would be recovered iii utility bills 22 in 2004 the acor office incurred substant ial utility bills amounting to some sdd 723 millions us 28920 and benefited from b udget provisions in two subprojects the monthly expenditure was about us 2400 which is considered excessive and needs to be controlled for the central logistics unit clu we learnt that private electricity bills for houses of senior staff were also being paid thr ough the subproject such charges are not acceptable subproject expenditure and should be re jected at the cor workshop utility bills totalling some sdd 21 million us 8400 we re not supported with either the invoice or the receipt from the electricity department the representation stated that nonofficial utility bills would not be charged to unhcr in futu re 6 iv procurement by cor 23 under subproject 03absudls452 c oio s reviewed the site contracts for the construction of tukuls in various locations some sdd 493 million us 198000 was spent oios reviewed the procurement process and wa s satisfied that competitive bidding was carried out however oios suggested that for ch large contracts unhcr should also be involved in the selection process in gener however procurement required improvement as supporting documentation such as inv oices purchase orders and delivery notesgrns were often lacking at the cor workshop large quantities of lubricants were budgeted for purchase in both years but deliver notes or grns were attached to the vouchers fifty tyres purchased in 2003 were budget ed in the 2004 budget yet evidence of purchase was attached as supporting documentatio n in the 2004 accounting records some of the supporting documentation was stated to be available in cor khartoum oios is unable to accept such explanations and would ins ist that the supporting documentation be kept at the budget location where these are charged the representation has initiated the process of prequalification for all implementing p artners in sudan v functioning of workshop 24 oios reviewed the various processes within the workshop and was generally satisfied that adequate controls existed for the re pairs carried out sequential job cards were prepared and spares requisitioned from the stores w ere obtained after following the correct procedures the workshop uses the sms spareparts m anagement system which is in fact very old software quite limited in its capabilitie s this software is unable to produce many of the required reports essential to proper managem ent as per closed job cards for 2004 generated through the sms the total number of re pairsmaintenance carried out in the year was some 1357 or on an average some 113 per m onth in 2004 there were 27 mechanics on the payroll and the monthly productivi ty is some 4 vehicles per month which is quite low if we consider the overall productiv ity for all the 64 staff employed at the workshop it works out to some 16 vehicles per mon th vi manpower requirements at the clu and workshop 25 between them the central logistics unit clu and the workshop employed some 168 persons with the clu accounting for 104 employ ees with the rationalization of the fleet many vehicles are longer categorized as perational the number of trucks has reduced by 66 per cent from 175 to 58 for light ve hicles the fleet size reduced by 54 per cent from 167 to 77 there are 56 drivers 17 stor ekeepers in the clu and the need for such large complement of staff in these categorie s is not justified the substantial reductions in fleet size should be taken into accou nt when the staffing strength of these two units is assessed the representation stated that the revision on the needs of manpower was ongoing and reduction of staff would be carried ut as result of the exercise recommendations head2right the unhcr representation in sudan should request th commissioner for refugees to ensure that the us 4 3000 advanced to the education sector in 20032004 and c harged as expenditure without supporting documents review ed and unsupported amounts recovered rec 02 7 head2right the unhcr representation in sudan should ensure tha t the us 18600 spent by cor on allowances on staff and misclassified as expenditure on readymade meals fo r refugees under subproject 04absudrp371 is rec overed as separate budgets were provided for allowances r ec 03 b forest national corporation 26 the forest national corporation fnc did not operate proper accounting system to account for and report on unhcr expenditures th manual accounting system used consisted of daily book and ledger where entries were to be posted per unhcr budget lines due to the lengthy budgets and numerous budg et lines the fnc was unable to cope with the volume of entries and discontinued the mai ntenance of the ledger fairly early in 2004 in the absence of basic accounting records w could not reconcile the entire spmr to the accounting records though oios did manage t reconcile some major budget lines for the fau location oios accordingly recommended that unhcr should assist the forest national corporation in developinginstalling pro per accounting and budgetary control system to ensure unhcr funds are properly controlle d monitored and reported upon the representation has accepted the recommendation and initiated action for improving the verification of spmrs i procurement and internal invoicing 27 our review of procurement showed that fnc has not yet put in place procurement procedures that are applied consistently there is need for the representation to monitor procurement undertaken by fnc to ensure compliance with unhcr ip procurement rules for instance contracts for large amounts aggregati ng to some us 50000 were awarded without competition 28 in the transactions sampled by oios instan ces of internal invoicing were noted aggregating to some us 13400 as fnc operates at more than one location oios noted that fnc fau would time and again purchase seeds fr om fnc at another location or engage another fnc unit for some work and charge such amou nts to the subproject this practice was observed in 2003 and 2004 and oios recommended that unhcr review such instances and examine whether they were acceptable and consistent with the sub agreement our concern was that goods or services p roduced or provided by units receiving unhcr assistance should not be charged as expendit ure to the subproject the representation accepted the recommendation and will take corrective action 29 payment of sdd 307 million us 12300 was made on 27 january 2004 under the 2003 subproject to the gedaref state as depo sit as the fnc wanted to avoid refunding unhcr there was evidence that this mo ney was eventually used for sub project activities this amount should have been re funded to unhcr as unspent balance the representation agreed that if the transaction w as not satisfactorily explained the amount would be recovered ii misclassification of expenditure 30 several instances of misclassifications we re noted for instance the training fund grant of sdd 45 million us 18000 was only par tially used for that purpose and oios noted that large amounts were paid for hospitality allowances bank fees mobile recharge 8 cards and other miscellaneous expenditure totally u nrelated to training the maintenance repair costs of vehicles and expenses for monitorin g evaluation were activities repeatedly charged to different budget lines having connect ion with these activities c sudanese red crescent 31 sudanese red crescent src operated man ual accounting system whereby general ledger and cashbook were maintained for wad sherife site the general ledger was maintained per unhcr coding structure on the basis of which the spmrs were prepared the system could produce satisfactory reports on hcr funds and we were able to reconcile the ledger with the spmr budgetary contr ol was however weak and in 2003 and 2004 src overspent almost all budget lines in som instances the overspending had reached nearly 63 per cent however src charged onl the approved budget to unhcr whereas the amounts in excess of the budget were t from other funding sources 32 in view of the adverse age profile and obs olescence of the fleet and the significant maintenance costs involved us 59000 in 20032004 oios recommended that src should take up the matter with unhcr to obtain bett er vehicles the representation stated that replacement would be considered in phases procurement undertaken by src required closer attention and supervision by unhcr as compet itive bidding procedures were not being followed for major procurement totalling some us 36000 the representation will monitor srcs procurement activities more closely c supply management 33 oios review of fuel management and procur ement identified fundamental problems necessitating immediate remedial action t he following paragraphs outline oios findings which showed that the representation did not follow prescribed procedures and neglected controls over fuel management and the pro curement process thus failing to ensure that funds were spent in the most costeffec tive manner given the circumstances it appears that the financial interests of the organiz ation were compromised the representation has accepted the audit findings and initiated corrective action fuel management 34 in oios assessment fuel management was highrisk area for unhcr and cor basic controls were rendered dysfunctional resultin g in short receipt of fuel excess release of quotas likelihood of pilferage and unauthorized diversion and inflated consumption levels resulting in significant loss for unhcr oi identified large overpayments and concluded after detailed review that procedures f or receipt and issue were flawed stock records were deficient rendering the system prone to inefficiencies and abuse oios identified the lack of proper and easily accessible information as the main reason for the problem besides contributing to deficiencies in ma nagement the lack of information also served to conceal inefficiencies and malpractices 35 the total expenditure on diesel petrol an d lubricants in 2003 and 2004 was some us 142 million this included around us 600000 of diesel procurement in 2004 undertaken on the basis of contract approved by t he coc under emergency procedures the estimation of quantities was inaccurate and tho ugh the yearly quantity contracted with 9 shell was some 1000 metric tonnes mt nearly 16 30 mt was actually supplied by shell thereby exceeding the contracted quantity by 63 per cent oios found that the projection of requirements was based on irrational fixing of quotas for cor and other implementing partners and not upon verifiable criteria such as area of operation number of mobile assets approximate kilometres runday and number of staff members involved in operations the representation stated that the 2005 quotas for vari ous implementing partners including cor were reviewed extensively on the basis of objec tive criteria i defective record keeping in unhcr offices 36 the representation did not maintain proper records regarding receipt of fuel the quarterly quota for unhcr khartoum was approximatel some 13500 litres and there were credible records of opening and closing bal ances or of receipts and issues the 2004 fuel records at the representation showed rece ipts of 24345 litres and issues of 66467 litres denoting thereby that they had issue d 42122 litres more than had been received oios reworked the figures taking into acc ount available delivery and issue records and computed that the receipts were some 6 9345 litres and the issues about 72205 litres oios concluded that the records were unreli able as more fuel was issued than was received the representation will examine the discrepancies and report thereon by end of july 2005 37 the discrepancy at suboffice esshowak wa s even more serious oios requested for the details of receipt and consumption of fuel during 2004 and was provided only with release orders for the year and also handwritten c onsumption records from may 2004 till december 2004 records for other months were not pr ovided there was mention of opening and closing balances in the records the mo nthly consumption was not added up nor was any other summary record on fuel consumptio n prepared oios observed that from may to december 2004 the so received some 139500 litres while the consumption for the corresponding period added up only to 100605 l itres leaving some 38895 litres cost us 11700 unaccounted for the discrepancy was so 28 per cent of the total fuel received during these eight months and the possibil ity of this quantity having been diverted cannot be ruled out the representation has noted the observations and w ill examine the records of all relevant offices and provide repor t by end of august 2005 ii flawed fuel receiving procedures in unhcr offic 38 the dipstick available at the representati on could not be used for accurate measurements as it had not been properly calibrate d in the absence of fuel flow meter the receipts from shell were acknowledged as receiv ed and paid for merely based on the invoices received from the company without any inde pendent measurement and there was internally designed document to monitor and asse ss receipts controls over fuel management at the so were also inadequate measu rement devices such as fuel flow meter or dipstick were present to measure the quant ities actually received the fuel tank itself was not kept locked and the top access cover was only loosely fastened record of opening and closing balances were maintained and th stockkeeping records were either not available or were unsatisfactory where present the monthly quota of 18000 litres 4000 imperial gallons was collected by unhcr dri vers in four or more trips from shell gedaref using the unhcr tanker capacity 4950 litr 1100 gallons the fuel tanker did not have an onboard meter and the tank was never aled during transit delivery notes were obtained for confirming the quantity lifted an d the transaction depended entirely upon 10 the word given by the unhcr driver that the request ed quantity was deposited into the fuel tank in the circumstances assurance could be btained that the requisitioned quantity had indeed been delivered 39 most payments at the representation for sshowak deliveries were based merely upon unclear and incomplete email certification of receipt provided by the sr logistics clerk at so esshowak without any reference to the release order under which the supply was received or delivery note or such other docum entation with regard to cor the largest consumer of fuel the sr logistics clerk at so esshowak relied mostly on telephonic acknowledgements of receipt given by cor effort was made to obtain written confirmation of the delivery notes dates nd quantities from cor acknowledgement of receipt was often done merely by signing and affixing the unhcr stamp on the invoices themselves without any other supporting documentation or proof that the invoiced quantities had been received 40 oios accordingly recommended that the repr esentation should immediately put in place proper procedures for the receipt issue sto cktaking and accounting of fuel at all locations in sudan this is particularly important for western and southern sudan where the operations are at their early stages the representation has accepted the observations and is implementing remedial measures iii double payment of july 2004 invoices 41 during scrutiny of payments to shell oios noted that the invoices pertaining to july 2004 totalling some us 58000 were paid in ju ly 2004 and mistakenly paid once again in december 2004 resulting in an overpayment of us 58000 the overpayment occurred due to the absence of proper system for monitoring quantities received against quota requested inefficient maintenance of records and making payments on the basis of third party documents only the lack of adequate ma nagerial supervision also contributed to the overpayment the representation accepted the overpayment but di d not take up the matter with shell to immediately recover the amount the representation added that the overpayment could be attributed to human error and oversight in oios view however due to the poor control mechanisms in place the li kelihood of other double payments cannot be ruled out the representation will take the matter up with she ll requesting refund of the overpaid amount iv unjustified release of quota to cor 42 the release of quotas was another area tha t lacked controls and was inadequately monitored and supervised by senior staff quotas w ere released indiscriminately without first assessing the consumption against the earlier releases and verifying the justification of the additional releases for instance quantity f some 92461 litres 20546 gallons was supplied to cor in december 2003 being the quota f or rsd for the months of july till december 2003 in oios assessment such authorizat ion which related to prior periods should have been released to cor only upon proof th at cor had during this period obtained fuel elsewhere and actually used such fuel for rsd operations in january 2004 once again additional quantity of some 14378 gall ons was released for various activities including rsd operations since the entire rsd quot had already been delivered the need for additional releases was unclear also the suppo rting calculation sheet was not arithmetically accurate and could not be used to ju stify additional release of fuel oios concluded that excess fuel quotas had been released to cor the representation has 11 accepted the audit observations and assured that co rrective measures had been taken in 2005 to prevent this type of incident occurring and that the quotas for implementing partners were since being determined on the basis f real operational requirements v payments for quantities not delivered 43 oios also observed instances where payment s were made for quantities that were not actually delivered in september 2004 payment w as made to shell for quantity of 104642 litres of fuel however from an attachment to the payment voucher we noted that so esshowak had acknowledged only some 90000 litr also on another occasion in 2003 payment was made for 13500 litres while onl 10472 litres were acknowledged as having been received the representation has accepted the audit observations and will identify the circumstances in which the payments to ok place vi inadequacy in contract provisions 44 the contract with shell lacked technical s pecifications regarding the equipment that should be provided by shell such as fuel flow meter s calibration of fuel tanks and dipsticks the technical performance and responsibi lities of the commercial provider should be defined in the contract to ensure that the provi der can be held accountable for lapses and shortcomings the representation has accepted deficiencies of the contract and stated that this happened as the contract was not prepared by procurement specialist vii fuel management at cor 45 controls over fuel receipt and consumption in cor were inadequate giving opportunity to the partner to inflate consumption l evels and receive excessively high quotas not justified by operational requirements the end use of fuel by cor continued to be an area that unhcr had absolutely control in the ab sence of credible and updated logbooks despite an earlier oios recommendation ma in 2002 none of the 28 logbooks produced for oios scrutiny at the clu were updated and contained only intermittent entries for april 2004 and nothing thereafter sinc the clu consumes the maximum fuel it can be stated that reliable means of monitoring fuel consumption by cor did not exist of the six logbooks submitted for scrutiny at acor s office at esshowak in many places the kilometres run fuel consumed location visited were not mentioned similarly the logbooks at cor headquarters at khartoum were defic ient in several respects oios took note that the requirement for maintaining logbooks had been reiterated to cor esshowak by so esshowak in march 2005 and that unhcr would continue to monitor this requirement also it was difficult to correlate unhcr release or ders with the actual receipt of fuel by cor cor stated that since the release orders were frequ ently delayed by unhcr they would get fuel on credit from shell though supporting documents for this assertion could be produced recommendations head2right the unhcr representation in sudan should examine th circumstances in which five july 2004 shell invoice s were paid twice resulting in overpayment of us 58000 the amounts overpaid should be recovered from shell and review initiated for all payments to 12 shell starting from 2002 to date to ensure that pay ments were correctly made rec 04 head2right the unhcr representation in sudan should examine wh in september 2004 payment was made for 14642 litres f fuel that was not received and closely review the fuel records at suboffice showak and ascertain the reasons for the shortage f nearly 39000 litres observed by oios rec 05 b procurement 46 oios review of procurement showed lack of planning noncompliance with procedures repeated disregard for established thre sholds and inadequacies in contract management leading to uneconomic acquisition of goo ds and services procurement lists properly segregated for programme and abod were not available for 20032004 and the logistics unit was unable to indicate the quantity and value of purchases undertaken during the year the procurement plan for 2005 was finalized only in late march 2005 four months after the november 2004 deadline 47 coordination between programmeadministrat ion and logistics unit required improvement as there were continual complaints abo ut delayed receipt of requisitions belated purchases and overdue payments to suppliers oios observed that its 2002 recommendation regarding sourcing largescale procu rement from abroad was not complied with and expensive largescale local procurement co ntinued to be undertaken this was the case for the local purchase of 200 tyres for tota l value of sdd 172 million us 69000 had the purchase been made through sms unhcr could have saved some us 21000 similarly spare parts were repeatedly purchased fro m the local market at prices that were 2 3 times international market prices the representation stated that in 2005 procedures had been streamlined procurement lists were prepared nd that future procurement plans would be arranged in time i noncompliance with thresholds 48 four contracts each exceeding the thresho ld of us 100000 and aggregating to us 127 million were not submitted to the coc and were thus awarded without proper authority also as assessed by oios the cumulative value of contracts in excess of us 20000 not submitted to the lcc by so esshowa k in 20032004 was some us 337000 at so esshowak several contracts wer signed without the appropriate financial delegation the representation accepted the observation and s tated that the ceilings would be complied with in the future ii contract management contract for the transport of eritrean refugees 49 some us 700000 was paid to company fro m january 2003 till december 2004 for the transportation of eritrean refugees oios r eviewed the implementation of the contract and found marked lapses in contract admini stration implementation absence of supporting documentation and repeated instances of overcharges to unhcr while the initial contract was approved by the lcc it was t submitted to the coc though its value over the course of two years significantly exceeded the stipulated threshold of us 13 100000 oios noted that the contract was first sig ned in november 2001 and extended till september 2002 when fresh bidding exercise once again found the existing provider to be competitive from september 2002 through december 2004 the contract was extended time and again without reassessing the continued co mpetitiveness of the provider even though the scope of the contract had been modified considerably 50 oios review of the implementation phase r evealed significant overcharges to unhcr and instances of unhcrs inability to hold th supplier to his contractual obligations though the rates had been mutually agr eed upon the transporter repeatedly invoiced unhcr for amounts that were substantially higher than the contracted rates in particular this was the case for trailertrucks type of vehicle not mentioned in the contract that were constantly used even though th initial rfp and the contract stipulated that only single trucks of 1520 mt were to be used when using trailertruck the supplier doubled the rate for single truck and in voiced unhcr at the higher rate however trailertruck cannot be equated to two tr ucks while it may consume more fuel than single truck only one driver is used and it is not logical to pay twice the contracted rate for truck since trailers were extensively u sed for the repatriation the cumulative financial effect in terms of additional liability f or the unhcr would be tremendous the supplier also repeatedly used minibuses even thou gh the contract specified only 46 seater buses 51 the overcharge for the december 2004 repat riations was particularly striking not only did the contractor unilaterally increase the r ates doubling and even trebling the contracted rates he also ultimately invoiced unhcr at twice the already inflated rates thus the rates actually used in some cases were nea rly five to six times the contracted rates from discussions oios understood that the rental f or trailertruck might cost up to 30 per cent more than single truck based on this estima tion oios worked out that in three invoices alone unhcr was overcharged some us 930 00 such extracontractual payments should have been rejected by unhcr unfort unately at point in time did unhcr object to such practices high convoy costs 52 in 2004 against the targeted 35000 repat riations the number of refugees actually repatriated was only 9892 the overall budgets pro jected were for the higher initial estimates of repatriation but oios did not observe any reduction in expenditure levels commensurate with lower numbers of repatriations ios analyzed the transportation costs of some convoys and found them to be excessive thi s was the case for convoy 151 where the summary sheet shows that 188 vehicles busestr uckstrailers were used for transporting some 592 refugees and their luggage at cost of some us 60000 oios assessed that each vehicle catered to the needs of only about 3 refugees and their luggage 53 the representation has noted the audit observations and stated that the operation took place under emergency circumstances and diffic ult operating conditions the representation reassured that future contracts woul d comply with unhcr rules and regulations vehicles for rsd operation 54 landcruisers were first hired in october 2 002 to transport rsd staff the selection was done by the lcc on the basis of offers received following an rfp though the rfp was 14 sent to nine companies only two companies submitte d their bids and the lower offer was selected the contract signed in october 2002 was xtended till june 2003 oios noted however that the vehicle rental continued till nove mber 2003 under the same contract without any fresh bidding exercise some us 345000 was p aid to this company in 20022003 and since this exceeded the threshold of us 100000 t he contract should have been submitted to the coc the rate of hire was some us 140day incl usive of fuel and driver though this rate was slightly reduced from july 2003 unhcr also agr eed to new conditions not mentioned in the original contract that imposed additional f inancial burden on the organization 55 in oios view the contract terms were not beneficial to unhcr oios noted that during the same period suboffice esshowak had als negotiated with khartoum based car rental company contract for rental of vehicles at us 100 per day for the same type of vehicle though this did not include the cost of fu but the cost of fuel alone cannot explain the substantial difference in the rental costs as the fuel costs per day worked out to about sdd 1000 us 4 per day for 3 gallons the contrac t negotiated by the representation for rental was some 25 per cent more expensive the exc ess expenditure incurred by unhcr due to the higher rate was some us 86250 the representation acknowledged the audit observation and will ensure compliance with unhcr r ules and procedures in future 56 oios concluded that the contracts for the transportation of eritrean refugees and for the rental of vehicles for rsd were poorly managed and did not adequately protect the financial interests of unhcr in the view of oios the acceptance of overcharges and excessive rates was bordering on gross negligence nd raises the question of accountability the representation acknowledged the importance of t he audit observation and will ensure adequate supervision and financial management iii warehousing 57 upon review of the khartoum warehous oios determined that immediate improvements were warranted while basic inventor list is maintained this is incomplete and not always accurate proper system for keepin g inventory does not exist there are stock cardsbin cards release orders etc physi cal inventory had been taken for long time and the quantity of oldobsolete and dead stock was very high the value of inventory stored was not known the existing insurance policy did t cover theftburglary and the value of the warehouse building and goods stored in the ware house was shown as us 45000 only which in oios assessment is an underestimation th stacking of goods was disorganized and better plan for storage needed to be put in p lace without delay several items in the warehouse pertain to very old periods in some case s dating back to 1980 the situation was similar in respect of the warehouses at so esshowa k 58 the representation accepted the audit bservations and promptly initiated corrective action the cts will be installed and th physical inventory has since been completed and the value of goods stored in the ware house increased to us 80000 the supply unit also undertook action to clean and orga nize the warehouse in view of the expected increase in the inflow of goods and the l ack of space in the unhcr compound the representation has advertised for commercial ware house provider 15 iv asset management 59 significant improvement was requi red to strengthen the internal controls over assets assettrak data was generally inaccurate and unreliable also assets issued to the emergency operation at darfur and southern sudan d not yet been recorded in assettrak action had been taken to address the major short comings observed by oios during the support function review in october 2004 and as of d ate assettrak data are neither updated nor accurate our review had disclosed high numbe r of assets with the default acquisition value of us 99 in other instances assets were re corded with inaccurate acquisition values based on our samples the total overstatement is timated at us 16 million while the total understatement is some us 64 million furthermore depreciation was not correctly calculated for large number of items the representation has accepted the observations an d affirmed its commitment to accurate reliable cons istent and complete asset records and to this end have put in place work plans created gs position and will also ensure followup and close supervision of the asset management activ ities for sudan operations d security and safety 60 phase iii is in place in darfur nd southern sudan while eastern sudan and khartoum are in phase ii all staff members have co mpleted the mandatory security training oios understood that the staff assigned the respons ibility of security are working closely with unsecoorddss and carrying out moss inspection s and audits number of locations in sudan are not moss compliant and actio n to increase the level of compliance has been initiated the unsecoord moss compliance review assessed that the representation is compliant esshowak is compliant to the extent of 75 per cent while offices in darfur and south sudan are not moss comp liant action has been taken to equip all vehicles in darfur with mine blankets shatter proof and blast resistant film has been installed only at the representation alone and this work is yet to be done at other offices administration 61 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr offices in sudan generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under revie w however few areas still required attention outstanding receivables 62 observing large balances in the recei vable vf accounts oios recommended that the representation speed up the clearance of the vf accounts in consultation with the other unhcr offices and headquarters outstanding operati onal advances given to offices in western and southern sudan were also to be pursued for settlement dsa advances to errec staff from eritrea on mission to sudan amount ing to some us157000 were still awaiting clearance in the khartoum vf accounts the representation responded that the advances were given in the emergencystart up phase in darfur and in southern sudan and have mostly been cleared and the balance amounts wo uld be closely pursued regarding the errec dsa advances the representation will clear t he outstanding amounts in conjunction with the representation in asmara 16 b value added tax 63 value added tax vat payments amount ed to us 40000 of which some amounts pertain to 2001 are all recorded in the vf 316 and awaiting refund from the government of sudan the representation has not obt ained any refunds for 2003 and 2004 in addition the representation did not record vat payments amounting to some us 6900 under vf 316 for eventual recovery the representation noted the observation and stated that the processing of reimbursement from the gover nment was cumbersome and lengthy process this issue has been widely discussed amon g agencies in sudan and will also be referred to the ministry of finance c overpayments of solar travel claims 64 oios identified overpayment of some us 3 000 due to incorrect computation of the 60 nights eligibility period for solar and excess d sa and hazard payments further examination by the representation revealed that the overpayment amounted to some us 13500 of which us 7700 has been already reco vered d consultancy contracts 65 consultancies were not well managed at the representation as contracts were issued locally at khartoum competitive selection w as not ensured and other instances of non compliance with procedures were observed retired unhcr representative was employed as consultant for period of three months to ass ess the impact of unhcr operations in the east at lumpsum fee of us 24000 oios noted th at the consultancy contract was not referred to headquarters and the payment involved w as more than the limit of us 22000 per year payable to former staff member in terms of chapter 6 section 1215 moreover the report was submitted after delay of one year and of doubtful value and it was never used for programme purposes as the impact of the unhcr assistance programme was not properly demonstrated the representation also enga ged the services of public information consultant from october 2002 to april 2004 without following proper procedures in another case the representation incorrectly upgraded unv as consultant team leader for the rsd project and remunerated him as consultant the re presentation did not have the authority to make such arrangements locally and should have soug ht authorization from headquarters especially as the status responsibilities and emol uments changed substantially the representation assured that in future proper proce dures would be followed and headquarters approval obtained medical insurance plan 66 mip claims were generally processed in accordance with the relevant guidelines list of recommended doctors available in khartoum nd darfur was established in march 2005 the representation also recently took steps t obtain comparative price lists from khartoum hospitals and medical institutions and fav ourable financial arrangements will be worked out with them however in cases where trea tment was obtained abroad the mip claims were not being settled in accordance with th principle of reasonable and customary charges applicable at the duty station record keep ing also required improvement and we noticed that several mip claims with medical record s were attached to payment vouchers which could result in breach of confidentiality 17 f medical evacuation 67 medevac cases at the representation were mostly reg ulated in accordance with instructions however one local staff member who wa s evacuated from the field to khartoum was paid 80 per cent of the dsa in such cases dsa will be limited to the extent of the accommodation cost provided that this does not exc eed 50 per cent of the applicable dsa moreover an advance of us 645 was not deducted wh ile settling the claim the representation has recovered the advance of us 645 in addition an overpayment of us 960 was found after recalculation of the claim and is being recovered the representation is also examining the past medevac p ayments v acknowledgement 68 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistanc and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of unhcr and implementing partners in sudan egbert c kaltenbach chief unhcr audit service office of internal oversight services
