disruption of congressional field offices in the gulf coast region due to the effects of hurricane katrina the 2001 terrori st attacks on the united states and the reliance of many organizati onal functions on advanced information technology it applications have brought re newed attention to the need for organizations to engage in continuity of operations coop pla nning interruptions of congressional operations in washington dc and across th country through both natural and man made disasters have demonstrated that these concerns and needs extend to congress as well as to other private and public institutions some private sector activities can be relocated or reconfigured to respond to continuity threats by dispersing centralized facilities installing automate d backup systems or maintaining excess capacity the task of ensuring that the 540 members of congress can continue to carry out their constitutional responsibilities in case of di sruption presents unique challenges in addition to the operational concerns co mmon to most organizations an attack against congress could result in loss of i ndividuals critical to governance destroy important symbols of govern ment and undermine the nati onal sense of safety and security continuity of operations pla nning refers to the internal effort of an organization such as an office or department to assure that the capability exists to continue essential functions in response to co mprehensive array of potential operational interruptions coop planning is an ongoing process that is driven in part by growth and change of information systems personnel and mission critical needs operational interruptions may include routine buildin g renovation or maintenance mechanical failure of heating or other building systems fire inclement weather or other acts of nature or range of threatened or actual attacks other events that may interrupt congressional activity include failu re of information technology it and telecommunications installations due to malfunction or cyber attack1 for congress these interruptions might affect an individual office building or the entire capitol complex as the anthrax incidents

for members staff and chamber officers such as the parliamentarians security officers and clerks what level of physical security exists in these facilities if congress chose to move to state

improves security or merely relocates terrorist target in practical terms what logistical and technical issues must be addressed so that relocated floor activity can be supported at an alternative site and w ithin an accelerated timeframe how would members of congress and staff be informed to meet at the alternative site how would members of congress and staff be tran sported to the alternative

congress member office information security continuity planners suggest that cr itical element of coop planning is to plan ahead and to develop clear understa nding of what materials and information are most crucial to continuing operations if regular facilities are not available41 component in this planning is the preser vation of critical info rmation maintained in computer systems congressional offices that wish to re tain control over th eir own data may prefer to develop their own plans for b ackup and subsequent recovery of critical information recorded on paper and electronic media information security professionals recommend making regular global bac kup of system files and data and more frequent daily backups of ne w and recently changed files this might include systematic scanning and retention of electronic images of irreplaceable paper documents42 backup copies then need to be st ored in secure location other thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31594crs15

the event that particular backup copy is corrupted or otherwise compromised by virus defective media or other cause43 additional considerations as coop projects move fo rward planners may also continue to consider responses to the possibility of interrupti ons affecting critical operating systems and data such as communications the legislative information system lis and individual member computer resources an electronic interruption or cyber attack could manifest itself through the spread of computer viruses or worms it could also take the form of hackers gaining access to congressional computer systems or denial ofservice dos attacks on congressional web servers44 similarly another possibility is an attack physical or electronic or other interruption to major telecommunications switching station in the washington dc area which could significantly affect the congresss ability to communicate both internally and externally some of these vulnerabilities are being addressed through the implementation of wireless devices such as the blackberry as well as the establishment of congressional alternate computing facility jointly managed by the house senate and
