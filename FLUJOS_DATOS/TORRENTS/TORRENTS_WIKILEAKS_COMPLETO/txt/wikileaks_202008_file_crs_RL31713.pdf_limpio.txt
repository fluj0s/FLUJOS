general lacked standing to sue under the principles and standards delineated in raines v byrd 15 in raines the supreme court held that six members of congress lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the line item veto act of 1996 in reaching this conclusion th court noted the restricted role for article iii courts in resolving disputes between the po litical branches and determined that the members bringing th suit had not suffered sufficient personal injury to merit finding of constitutional standing16 the court distinguished personal injury to private right from an institutional or official injury explaining that congressional plaintiff may be able to establish standing to sue in instances where the plaintiff has suffered either personal injury such as the loss of seat inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31713crs4 17id at 821 18walker 230 fsupp2d at 65 quoting raines 521 us at 819 19id at 66 20id at 66 21id at 67 quoting warth v seldin 422 us 490 499 1975 22id at 67

ultimately the court noted that the diminution of legislative power resulting from the passage of the act constituted an institutional injury affecting all members as opposed to particularized nd concrete personal injury17 applying these maxims the court in walker determined that it was required to conduct an especially rigorous standing inquiry because th case presented core separation of powers questions at the h eart of the relationship among the three branches of our government18 engaging in this calculus the court held that the injury alleged by the comptroller general was not personal stressing that his interest in the suit was solely institutional relating exclusively to his duties in his official capacity19 the court then determined that the institutional injury alleged by the comptroller general namely the vice presidents denial of information requested pursuant to gaos statutorily conferre d investigative and access enforcement authority was insufficient to establish sta nding the court predicated this finding on its conclusion that the comptroller general was acting as an agent of congress in demanding the information and bringi ng the suit and had freestanding institutional injury or personal injury of his own to assert20 the court then reiterated that the jurisdiction of the federal courts can be i nvoked only when the plaintiff himself has suffered some threatened or actual injury21 the court went on to consider the harm to the comptroller generals principal congress but found such an inquiry to be of little comfort to plaintiff22 in particular the court characterized the importance of the requested documents as relating only to congress disc harge of its general legisla tive and oversight functions and held that the alleged injury to th prerogatives was too vague and amorphous to confer standing23 the court further declared that like the injury asserted in raines the injury to congress in the current controversy concerns merely an abstract dilution of institutional legislative power damaging all members and both houses equally24 and is therefore not the kind of concrete injury that is sufficiently distinct and palpable for standing25 the court did acknowledge that the potential impact upon congress in the present case was mo re concrete than the injury alleged in raines in that any harm here relates to reasonably welldefined set of information26 the court proceeded however to discount the applicability of prior precedents establishing that house or co mmittee has standing to enforce its righthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31713crs5 27id at 68 quoting lujan v defenders of wildlife 504 us 555 560 1992 it should be noted that the court distinguished the generaliz ed harm to legislative power that may occur when documents cannot be obtained from an injury pertaining to highly specific constitutional mandate such as the duty to apportion representatives and from an injury threatening the composition of congress itself id at 68 n19 to illustrate this distinction the court pointed to united states house of repr esentatives v united states department of commerce 11 f supp 2d 76 89 ddc 1998 threejudge court where the court found that the house had standing to sue regarding the alleged refusal by the census bureau to provide proper accounti ng of the number of persons in each state because it had been deprived of informa tion to which it as legislative body was personally entitled and which it required in order to perform mandatory constitutional function the apportionment of representa tives among the states the court in walker did not explain why the grant of legislative pow er to congress by article i section 1 is not as specific as the grant of the power to apportion representatives by section 2 of the fourteenth amendment see shampansky n14 supra 28id at 68the court noted several other factors th at contributed to its holding in particular the court found it significant that congress had an alternate remedy to cure its alleged injury in that it could issue subpoena for the information id at 30 also the court gave some weight to the fact that while its cision prevented the comptroller general from gaining access to the nepdg documents private parties were seeking similar information in other suits see id at 31 n14 finally the court was further influenced by the fact that there was precedent for suit by comptr oller general for access to executive branch records and that court has ever ordere d the executive branch to produce document to congress or its agents id at 3233 29id at 69 30id at 6970 31id at 69 quoting allen v wright 468 us 737 752 1984of access to information concluding that the injury to congress right to the documents was conjectural or hypothe tical because congressional entity had requested or subpoenaed the information27 in reaching this conclusi on the court in walker found it to be of some importance that congress had not expressly authorized the present suit and determined that generalized delegation of investigative and access enforcement authority to gao was not sufficiently specifi c to provide basis for the comptroller general to seek judicial resolution of the significant constitutional issues raised by the suit28 in particular while stressing that it did not intend to direct the delegation and exercise of congress investigative powers29 the court held that the highly generalized allocation of enforcement pow er to the comptroller generalhardly gives this court confidence that the current congress has authorized this comptroller general to pursue judicial resolution of the specific issues affecting the balance of power between the article i and article ii branches that have crystalized during the course of this dispute and lawsuit30 based on these factors the court concluded that the exercise of judicial power in this case was not warranted as last resort and as necessity and declined to address the merits of the suit31 the courts decision in walker has the potential to significantly limit the ability of gao to sue the executive branch to obtain information

also important to note that the courts decision could even be interpreted as casting doubt on the ability of congress itself to bring suit to enforce subpoenas33 accordingly this report considers th potential impact of the decision on gaos investigatory and access enforcement functions and provides an overview of related statutory and constitutional issues that were not addressed by the district court gao access to executive branch information after walker if interpreted broadly the holding in walker could greatly limit the ability of gao to compel production of information from the executive branch specifically the courts decision does not clearly estab lish whether gao retains the ability to sue executive departments and agencies while it may be argued that the decision is limited to the specific scenario of an enforcement action against the president or vice president nothing in the courts decision clearly indicates that less rigorous standing inquiry may be applie d to actions against agencies34 in the event that the decision is interpreted as only applying to suits against the president or vice president its effect while palpable would not necessarily have dramatic impact on gaos efficacy given that the majority of its investigations appear to focus on agency activity however if the courts anal ysis extends to suits against agencies the strict standing requirements delineated in the decision could effectively strip 31 usc 716 of any force in the congressionalexecutive context if such an interpretation adheres gaos investigative efforts could be hampered by its inability to bring suit to compel the production of requested information specifically while the present controversy marks the first time that gao has brought suit against the executive branch it is important to note that prior investigations have been characterized by mutual efforts at negotiation and compromise presumably influenced by an awareness on the part of the executive branch that blanket refusal to provide requested informa tion could result in lawsuit modern example of this dynamic cente rs on gao efforts to obtain records for the house committee on international relations regarding the process used by the executive branch to approve peacekeeping operations35 after the departments of state and defense and the national security council failed to provide the requested

agreemen t between gao and state that provided reasonable access to the records37 the department of fense failed to respond adequately to gaos request l eading it to threaten the i ssuance of statutory report under 716b138 gao and the dod subsequently reached an accommodation regarding the records at issue after gao f iled the report indicating its willingness to sue for access the nsc responded to gaos demand tter by formally denyingfull and complete acce ss to the requested records39 this step prompted the gao to issue report again evincing its contemplation of bringing suit to compel access in this instance however the director of the office of management and budget certified pursuant to 716d1c th at disclosure of the material requested from the nsc reasonably could be expected to impair substantially the operations of the government thereby precluding the gao from bringing suit40 as this example illustrates gaos author ity to sue for access to records appears to have provided leverage in convincing executive entities to either provide requested information or to invoke the certificati on mechanism of 716d thus the courts decision could have the prac tical effect of depriving gao of its traditional point of leverage in such negotiations giving rise to the possibility that the executive branch could become less responsiv to future gao inquiries gao access to private sector information after walker while the factors mentione d above give rise to the possibility that gaos ability to exercise leverage in its oversight of executive branch entities could be significantly diminished it does not appear that the decision in walker will impair its ability to gain access to information held by privat sector entities as noted above the decision is predicated on the notion that standing inquiry must be especially rigorous in those rare cases that involve core separati on of powers questions at the heart of the relationship among the three branches of our government41 accordingly there would appear to be little basis to the argument that the courts decision somehow undermines prior preceden t establishing congress authority to delegate its investigative powers especially in instances where such separation of powers concerns are absent42 the decision not to appeal as noted above the courts decision c ould have significant impact on

gao stated that it strongly believed the courts d ecision was incorrect but that an appeal would require investment of significant time and resources over several years gao then stated that since the district court did not consider the merits of the suit its decision had ffect on gaos statutory audit rights or the obligation of agencies to provide gao w ith information gao then forwarded narrow interpretation of the c ourts holding arguing that the decision is confined to the unique circumstances posed by this particular case and does not preclude gao from filing suit on different matter involvi ng different facts and circumstances in the future44 gao then called on the administration to do the right thing and fulfill its obligations when it comes to disclosure s to gao the congress and the public not only in connection with this matter but all matters in the future45 however as was evidenced by the nature of the dispute in walker v cheney the administrations position on what constitutes proper compliance with such obligations is significantly narrower than that of gao accordingly gaos decision not to appeal the decision in walker could result in the practical curtailme nt of gao oversight of the executive branch related statutory and constitutional issues concluding the announcement of its deci sion not to appeal gao stated that it hoped it would never again be put in the position of having to resort to the courts to obtain information that congress needs to perform its constitutional duties but we will be prepared to do so in the future if necessary46 given this express declaration of gaos willingness to revisit the issue of its access enforcement authority with regard to the executive branch it is useful to consider the underlying statutory and constitutional issues that were not addressed in the decision in walker v cheney as similar issues will likely adhere to any future dispute between the two parties gaos investigat ive authority gaos

grounds that both 712 and 717b authoriz such an inquiry in response the vice president argued that neither provision imbues the gao with authority sufficient to support its position49 regarding 712 the vice president argu ed that it merely provides gao with the authority to conduct an audit of the costs incurred by the nepdg and did not provide any basis for its requests for ch information as the names of nepdg meeting attendees while this interpretation is plausible under the plain terms of the statute it s hould be noted that the express language of 712 viewed in relation to relevant legislative histor indicates that congress intended for gao to serve broad role specifically 7121 states that the comptroller genera l is to investigate all matters related to the receipt disbursement and use of public money this language as enacted in 1921 was design ed according to one member to ensure that the comptroller general shall concern himself not simply with taking in and paying out money from an accountants point of view but that he shall also concern himself with the question as to whether it is economically and efficiently applied50 this conception was reiterated in 1980 the budget and accounting act of 1921 provides sufficiently broad and comprehensive authority to inves tigate all matters relating to the receipt disbursement nd application of public funds this authority extends not only to accounting and financial auditing but also to administration operations and progra m evaluation succeeding legislation affecting gaos authority ge nerally has served to make

opposed to statute the vice president maintained that its activities did not constitute program or activity carried out under existing law for the purposes of 717 in response gao argued that the term exis ting law absent an qualifier or limitation refers to all sources of law while both positions are tenable prio r gao practice could be interpreted as supporting the notion that its statutory authority extends to entities such as the nepdg in particular gao has previously investigated similarly situated entities such as the white house china trade relations group and th presidents task

congress twenty days after the filing of the report the comptroller general is authorized to file it in the district court of the united states for the district of columbia to require the head of the

whose sole function is to advise and assist the president for information which would not be availa ble under the freedom of information act68 from this statement it appears that congress intended to imbue the comptroller general with the authority to file suit against the president and his principal advisers specifically it seems th at there would be reason for congress to provide the certification provision unle ss the president and his advisers were covered given this apparent intention it would appear that congress conceived of the term agency as used in chapter 7 of title 31 as necessarily including the president and his principal advisers furthermore the structure of the certification provision itself contemplates high level access by gao given that it enables the president to prevent access to deliberative information that could impair substantially the operati ons of the government69 thus while the president and his advisors are not expressly included in th

power to enact and ppropriate under the constitution74 also in watkins v united states the court emphasized that the power of the congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legi slative process that power is broad it encompasses inquiries concerning the ad ministration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes75 the court further stressed that congress power to investigate is at its peak when focusing on alleged waste fraud abuse or maladministration within government partment specifically the court explained that the investigative power comprehends probes into departme nts of the federal government to expose corrupti on inefficiency or waste76 the court went on to note that the first congresses held inquiri dealing with suspected corruption or mismanagement of government officials77 given these factors the court recognized the power of the congress to i nquire into and publicize corruption maladministration or inefficiencies in the agencies

compel information from the executive branch the question turns to whether this power may be delegated to an agent of the legislative branch it is well established that congress possesses the fundamental ability to delegate investigative authority to an entity such as gao in buckley v valeo for instance the supreme court while invalidating certain functi ons of the federal electi on commission on appointments clause grounds stated that insofar as the powers confided in the commission are essentially of an investigative nature falling in the same general category as those powers which congress might delegate to one of its own committees there can be question that the commission as presently constituted may exercise them81 review of the applicable law indicates that the statutory enforcement scheme of 716 appears to comport with constitutiona l requirements in pa rticular reviewing courts have determined that enforcement of subpoena through judicial process is not execution of the laws of the united states as contemplated for separation of powers purposes such dete rmination was made in mcdonnell douglas corp v united states where the court of appeals for the eighth circuit addressed challenge to the constitutionality of gaos access enforcement authority82 rejecting the argument that an enforcement suit by gao constituted execution of the law in violation of the separation of powers doctrine the cour t stated that gaos suit was far from being case in which the c omptroller general brought suit against mcdonnell douglas corporation for breachin g the law the comptroller general in this case was merely seeking information for legitimate investigative purpose83 further stressing the legitimate investigative nature of gaos suit the court went on to explain that the issuan ce of judicially enforceable subpoena was necessary to accomplish its investigative mission and that determination to the contrary would render meaningless the comptroller generals role as an investigating arm of congress84 similar conclusion was reached by the court of appeals for the federal circuit in related case the power of the executive under the constitution to execute the laws is not involved here the 1980 act does not erode the executives authority85 based on these two appeals court rulings it is possible that reviewing court would uphold gao s access enforcement authority in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31713crs17 86it should also be noted that this conclusion adheres irrespective of the supreme courts decision in bowsher v synar 478 us 714 1986 in bowsher the court addressed the constitutionality of the grammrudman deficit reduction act under the act the comptroller general was empowered to review deficit estimates from the office of management

court determined that the comptroller general legislative branch officer was performing the functions of an executive officer in executing law passed by congress duty constitutionally committed to an officer of the executive branch id at 733 this dynamic rendered the act unconstitutional according to the court since permitting the execution of the laws to be vested in an officer answerable only to co ngress would in practical terms reserve in congress control over the execution of laws in violation of the separation of powers doctrine id at 726 as the factors cited by the cour t indicate the

the president at the request of the watergate special prosecutor th supreme court found constitutional basis for the doctrine of executive privilege noting that whatever the nature of the privilege of confidentiality of presidential communications in the exercise of article ii powers the privilege can be said to derive from the supremacy of each branch within its own assigned area of constitutional duties89 the court went on to explain that while it considered presidential communications to be presumptively privileged there was support for the cont ention that the privilege was absolute precluding judicial review whenever assert ed as such conclusion would upset the constitutional balance of workable government90 in particular the court explained that when the privilege depe nds solely on the br oad undifferentiated claim of public interest in the confidentiality of such c onversations confrontation with other values arises absent national security secrets we find it difficult to accept the argument that even the very important interest in confidentiality of presidential communications is significantly diminishe d by production of materials needed to enforce criminal statutes91 upon determining that cla im of privilege is not ab solute the court weighed the presidents interest in confidentiality against the judiciarys need for the materials in criminal proceeding stating that it wa s necessary to resolve those competing interests in manner that preserves th essential functions of each branch concluding this calculus the court held that the judicial need for the tapes as established by demonstrated specific need for evidence in pending criminal trial was of greater significance than the presidents generalized interest in confidentiality92 it should be noted that the court specifically limited the scope of its decision stating that it was not c oncerned with the balance between the presidents generalized interest in c onfidentialityand congre ssional demands for information93 coupled with related nd subsequent decisions the courts decision in nixon established the contours of the presidential communications privilege94 pursuant to

circuit addressed issues regarding th scope of the privilege whet her and to what extent the privilege extends to presidential advisers whether the president must have seen or had knowledge of the material at issue and the standard of need necessary to overcome claim of privilege96 espy arose from an office of independe nt counsel oic investigation regarding allegations of impropriety by former secretary of agriculture mike espy as part of the investigation grand jury issued subpoena for all documents relating to report prepared for the president by the white house counsel s office regarding the allegations regardless of the fact that the president had not viewed any of the documents underlying the report he withheld 84 documents on the basis of executivedeliberative privilege the oi c moved to compel production of the withheld documents subsequent to in camera review the district court upheld the claims of privilege forwarded by the presid ent in its decision the court of appeals agreed generally with the district cour ts determination that the documents in question were subject to the presidential communications privilege97 however the court vacated and remanded in order to provide the oic an opportunity to provide sufficient justification for its need for certain items of evidence98 at the outset of its opinion the court distinguished between the presidential communications privilege and the deliberative process privilege noting that while the former has constitutional basis in the separation of powers doctrine the latter is common law privilege applicable to the decisionmaking of executive officials generally99 the court went on to explain that while both privileges are qualified the deliberative process privilege disappears altogether when there is any reason to believe government misconduct occurred whereas the presidential communications privilege is more diffic ult to surmount requiring focused demonstration of need even when there ar allegations of misc onduct by high level officials100 turning to the question of whether the subpoenaed documents could be claimed to be privileged even though the presiden t had never viewed them the

matters in determining whether the the presidents confidentiality interest is implicated quoting american assn of physicians and surgeons inc v clinton 997 f2d 898 910 dc cir 1993 emphasis omitted 105id at 752that the public interest is best serv ed by holding that communications made by presidential advisers in the course of preparing advice for the president come under the presidential communications privilege even when these communications are not made directly to the president101 the court based this conclusion on what it characterized as the presidents dependence on presidential advisers and the inability of the deliberative process privilege to provide advisers with adequate freedom from the public spotlight as well as the need to provide sufficient elbow room for advisers to obtain inform ation from all knowledgeable sources102 further illuminating the scope of the privilege the court stated that it must apply both to communications which these advisers solicited and received from others as well as those they authored themselves the privilege must also extend to communications authored or received in response to solicitation by members of presidential advisers staff since in many instances advisers must rely on their staff to investigate an issue and formulate the advice to be given to the president103 recognizing that decision extending the presidential communications privilege to presidential advisers could pose signif icant risk of expanding to large swath of the executive branch privilege that is bottomed on recognition of the unique role of the president the court limited th privilege to white house advisers and staff that are in operational proximity to presidential decisionmaking specifically the court stated that the privilege should not extend to staff outside the white house in executive branch agen cies instead the privilege should apply only to communications authored or solicited and received by those members of an immediate white house advisers staff who have broad and sign ificant responsibility for investigating and formulating the advice to be given to the president on the particular matter to which the communications relate only communications at that level are close enough to the president to be revelatory of his delib erations or to pose risk to the candor of his advisers104 the court went on to stress that the privilege was not applicable to information that does not call ultimately for direct decisionmaking by the president105 while the principles established above are applicable to the scenario at issue in walker v cheney it is unclear whether reviewing court would have accepted claim of privilege in the case in particular it seems evident that the vice president and the staff of the nepdg would

in the investigation and formulation of advice to be given to the president regarding national energy policy substa ntial argument could be made that such information would fall within the ambit of the presidential communications privilege107 however it should be noted that in walker v cheney any hypothetical assertion of privilege would probably have been based on broad claim of public interest in the confidentiality of the requested material specifically gaos current information request as outlined in the complaint is significantly less intrusive than the demands contained in the initial demand letter108 whereas gaos original request sought information that could be regarded as reflective of the deliberative product and processes of the nepdg the complaint as filed sought documents that describe 1 who was present at each of the meetings conducted by the nepdg including th names of the attendees their titles and the office represented 2 with w hom the vice president as chair of the and each of the nepdg support staff met to gather information for the proposed national energy policy in cluding the name title and office or clients represented and the date purpose age nda and location of the meetings 3 how the vice president the members of the nepdg or others determined who would be invited to the meetings and 4 the direct and indirect costs that were incurred in developing the proposed national energy policy109 accordingly while it is conceivable that the information requested in the complaint pertaining to the purpose and agenda of nepdg meetings with outside interests and the process by which the ne pdg determined who would be invited to such meetings could be construed as pr ivileged there is indication that the material was in any way rela ted to the types of informa tion such as national security secrets that the supreme court deemed worthy of the highest levels of protection in nixon 110 furthermore it seems unlikely that the material sought by gao would have been deemed revelatory of presidential deliberations in light of the fact that it does not appear to relate to information that would call ultimately for direct decisionmaking by the president111 rather the material sought by gao appears to have encompassed information pertaining to the scope and composition of meetings that were to provide the basis for the subsequent formulation of recommendations and advice to be presented to the presiden t regarding the development of nationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31713crs22 112in particular vice president cheney stated th at

information regarding the direct deliberations of individuals in operational proximity to the president in formulating policy advice it would not appear that the concerns voiced by the court in espy would be implicated as such it is possible that reviewing court would not have accepted hypothetical claim of privilege in walker v cheney much would have depended on reviewing courts interpretati on of the scope of gaos request for information conclusion the district court in walker v cheney predicated its decision on determination that the comptroller general had not suffered personal or institutional injury sufficient to merit judicial resolution of issues affecting the balance of power between congress and the executive branch given the broad language employed by the court it seems evident that gaos ability to exercise leverage in its oversight of the executive branch could be significantly limited especially if the decision is interpreted as prohibiting enforcement actions against executive departments and agencies as well as the president and vi ce president furthermore even if the comptroller general had pursued an appeal in an effort to obtain reversal of the district courts standing analysis there we re still host of significant statutory and constitutional issues that could have affected the outcome of the dispute as noted above while gaos investig atory and access enforcement authority have strong historical and statutory basis there are competing principles of statutory interpretation that could influence reviewing c ourts consideration of this authority in any future conflicts with the executive branch likewise the aforementioned constitutional issues regard ing the delegation of access enforcement authority to the gao and the applicab ility of the presidential communications privilege to the activities of presidential dvisors could prove to be of substantial significance in any future disputes give n the breadth and importance of the issues implicated in walker v cheney it would appear that the only certainty at this juncture is that the district courts decision will have significant impact on the future of legislative oversight in the congressionalexecutive context
