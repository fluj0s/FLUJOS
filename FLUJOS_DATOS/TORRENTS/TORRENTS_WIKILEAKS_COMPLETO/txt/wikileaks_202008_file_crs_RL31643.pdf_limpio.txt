aut horized under title vi of the higher education act the fulbrighthays act and other legislation3 distinctive elements of the nsep compared to most other fe deral programs of aid to international education or exchange include its service requirement for aid recipients administration by the department of defense dod rather than the departments of education ed or state and its support for international tr avel by american undergradua students the recent establishment of the nsep pilot program the national flagship language initiative distinguishes it even further from title vi programs forms of aid three types of assistance are authorized and currently provided by the nsea 1 david l boren scholarships for undergraduate including community college students to study abroad in critical foreign country 2 grants to institutions of higher education to establish or operate programs in critical foreign language and area st udies areas often combined with study of other disciplines related to national security and 3 david l boren fellowships to gra duate students for education abroad or in the us in critical foreign language disciplines and area studies the nsea establishes goal of awarding onethird of each years grants for each of these three forms of aid although sp ecific allocations of available funds are determined by the national security educa tion board nseb which also establishes specific criteria for awards in each category the nseb is discussed further below under program administration individual grants only united states citizens are eligible for the scholarships and fellowships which are to be awarded on the basi s of merit taking into consideration the geographic distribu tion and the cultural racial and ethnic diversity of grant recipients the nsea provides that the language skills of aid recipients are to be assessed before and af ter the period of instruction for which they receive assistance recent amendment to the nsea contained in pl 107306 also allows recipients of nsep scholar ships and fellowships to attend the dods defense language institutehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31643crs3 while financial need is not taken into account in the selection of scholarship or fellowship recipients it is considered in determining the level of individual grants undergraduate students may receive up to tw scholarships one during their first two years of study and second during their re maining years gr aduate students may receive grants for up to six semesters but may receive more in total than 20000 for study abroad 12000 for domestic study or 28000 for combined domestic abroad study program the current dollar ranges for individual grants are outlined in table 1 the number of students receiving underg raduate scholarships increased from 143 in 2001 to 194 in 2002 and has since rema ined at 194 similarly the number of graduate fellowship recipients increased from 70 in 2001 to 90 in 2002 and has since remained at 90 both scholarship and fello wship recipients have traveled to wide variety of asian african east europea n and latin american nations nesp has supported study in more than 100 countries the most frequent destinations have been russia china japan egypt and brazil for undergraduate scholarship recipients and those nations plus vietnam and thaila nd for graduate fellowship recipients nesp does not fund study in western europe aust ralia canada and new zealand the individual award recipients unde r the nsep have studied numerous languages while the most common nguages have been arabic chinese mandarin russian

as part of the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2003 pl 107306 the national flagship language in itiative provides multiyear grants to ihes to develop curricular nd instructional models for advanced study of the foreign languages considered most critical for national security5 the goal of the program is demonstrating program design and ad ministrative structures on our nations campuses that are capable of dramatically increasing the number of us students advancing to profe ssional levels of language competency6 special consideration is to be given to federal employees in the admission of students to such programs new flagship grant competitions were not conducted for fy2003 or announced for fy2004 the national flagship language in itiative responds not only to federal government needs but also perceived weaknesses in the former program of institutional grants according to statement on the nseps website past institutional grants have been shortterm and often insufficiently coordinated with individual awards they have often been focused on improving the general capacity of american ihes to provide foreign lang uage and area studies flas instruction which

service requirement and have repaid their awar d in only handful of special casesfellowship was awarded if individuals fa il to meet the service requirement they must repay the amount of their grant plus interest according to the nsea the service period is to be up to the length of time for which aid was received for scholarship reci pients and 13 times of the length of time for which aid was received for fellowship r ecipients within these limits the specific length of the service requirement is determined by the nseb in general it is approximately equal to the length of th educational program for which person receives aid under the original nsea as enacted in 1991 the service obligation was somewhat more flexible it could have been met through employment in any federal agency or position ie not just positions involved in national security or as an educator at any level of educa tion in the area of study for which the scholarship or fellowship wa s awarded the current rvice requirement provision was adopted under pl 104201 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1997 and amended by pl 107296 the homeland security act of 200210 since adoption of the current servi ce requirement approximately 73 of scholarship and fellowship recipients com bined have met th service requirement through federal employment and 27 through employment in higher education11

for fy1992 early in the 104th congress fy1995 rescissions legi slation was passed by the house which would have eliminated the program completely and retu rned all of its 150 million trust fund to the treasury the in itial amount was still available because the nsep did not begin making grants until academic year 19941995 under the final version of this legislation pl 1046 onehalf of the f unds

selected congressional committees12 report on the effectiveness of the nsep and the advisability of conversi on from trust fund mechanism to annual appropriations the authorization of 10 million per year fo r national flagship language initiative is contingent upon submission of this report with finding that the programs carried out under the david l boren national s ecurity education act of 1991 are being carried out in fiscally and programmatically sound manner httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31643crs8 pl 107306 further authorizes 300000 for the secretary of defense acting through the director of the national secur ity education program to prepare report on the feasibility of establishing civilian linguist reserve corps to be composed of us citizens with advanced foreign language skills those preparing the report are encouraged to consider the reserve co mponents of the armed forces as possible model for this corps issues selected issues that have arisen with respect to the nsep are discussed in the remainder of this report funding mechanism as noted earlier the original intention was that the nsep would be funded via the earnings of trust fund an initia l appropriation of 150 million was provided to the trust fund with the possibility of additional appr opriations being provided to the fund afterward the appa rent intention of using this funding mechanism was to help insulate the program from the uncertainties of the annual budget and appropriations processes although funds to be used for annual grants and administration must still be appropriated from the fund however the reduction of the nsetf by onehalf in subsequent rescissions legislation pl 1046 combined with d ecline in interest ra tes mean that annual nsetf earnings have been only 23 million in recent years much lower than the annual appropriations and program level of approximately 8 milli on per year thus as noted in table 2 the funds balance is steadily declining if current trends continue the fund will be depleted by fy2006 if nsep activities are to be maintained at their current or higher leve ls the size of the fund must be increased significantly alternatively the nseps f unding structure might be shifted totally to an annual appropriations basis as is the case for the majority of federal grant programs pl 107306 disc ussed above requires the secr etary of defense to study the feasibility of such shift targeting of critical languages regions and disciplines an issue which arises with respect to any federal progra m intended to support instruction in critical foreign languages regions and disciplines is whether aid awards are appropriately targeted on ch languages regions and disciplines according to the nsea critical foreign languages regions and disciplines are those in which there is major national s ecurity interest the knowledge and skills of us students and federal employees are ficient and they are infrequently taught in the nations colleges and universities and infrequently represented in other international educational exchange programs the nseb conducts an annual survey of federal agencies to identify foreign languages regions and disciplines which the agencies deem to be critical to their operations wide variety of languages that are both fre quently eg spanish and infrequently eg farsi taught are identif ied through this process however thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31643crs9 13 see crs report rl31625 foreign language and internati onal studies federal aid under title vi of the higher education act by wayne c riddlenseb identifies subset of these languages along with associated world regionsnations plus disciplines to be th focus of scholarship and fellowship awards for the succeeding year in addition the national flagship language initiative as planned by the nseb and as authorized by pl 107306 will attempt to identify the most critical languages to be the focus of all institutional grants beginning in 2003 while any process to identify critical foreign languages world regions and disciplines will be imperfect and s ubject to regular revision and past institutional grants may not always have been clearly focused on such critical subjects it appears that substantial effort is devoted toward focusing nsep grants on languages regions and disciplines which are infre quently taught in american ihes and are of national security interest particularly in comparison to most other federal foreign language and area studies programs coordination with other federal programs supporting foreign language and international studies the nseps emphasis on helpin g to meet national security needs and its service requirement for individual ai d recipients distinguish it from other federal programs of support for foreign language and area studi nevertheless the nsep shares with several other federal progra ms the goals of increasing understanding of and the availability of advanced instruction in world languages and regions which are infrequently taught in united states ihes therefore efficiency in the use of federal aid funds is likely to be enhanced th rough coordination of the nsep and such programs as eds title vi of the higher education act and the fulbrighthays act programs administered by th departments of state and education currently such coordination occurs through representation on the national security education board of designees of the secretaries of educati on and state among others however there is statutory provision for analogous repr esentation of nsep officials on decision making bodies for related programs ad ministered by other federal agencies one aspect of the nsep instituti onal grants including those under the national flagship language initiative is especially similar to activities supported under another federal progra m title vi of the higher education act hea13 both the nsep institutional grants and two programs under hea title vi national resource centers and language resource centers provide grants to united states ihes to increase their capacity to provide instruction in foreign languages and regions with special emphasis on those whic h are infrequently taught in this nation the major difference may be the degree of focus on most critical foreign languages and regions especially in view of the planned restructuring of the nsep institutional grants under the national flagship language initiative the nsep has attempted to address this concern about possible program overlap by requiring ihes to propose activities which complement but do not duplicate those supported under other fede ral programs when applying for nsep institutional grants nevertheless especially gi ven recent efforts through the annualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31643crs10 appropriations process to increase the focus of hea title vi on the most critical languages and regions plus the inefficiencies and administrative costs associated with conducting multiple federa l grant competitions for ihes as well as the concerns expressed about nsep institutional gr ants by some members of the academic community discussed later in this report the possibility of consolidating the nsep institutional grant program with the hea title vi national and language resource center programs might be considered in addition coordination with other pr ograms may be altered by proposals to move the administrative responsibility for ns ep from the secretary of defense to the director of central intelligence hr 1588 as passed by the senate or to the secretary of education as the presidents budget recommends placing responsibility for both the nsep and the hea title vi programs under the secretary of education would presumably increase th degree of coordination and decrease the amount of overlap among these programs on the other hand it is not clear how shifting responsibility for the nsep to th director of central intelligence would impact program coordination support for undergraduate travel abroad some have questioned whet her support of foreign travel grants by limited number of undergraduate student s should be priority fo r expenditure of federal funds under the nsea in the 107th congress the senatep assed version of hr 4628 would have iminated the nseps undergraduate scholarship program shifting available funds to gradua fellowships and ins titutional grants alt hough the enacted version of this legislation does not eliminate authority for undergraduate scholarships debate over this issue may continue according to the senate select committee on intelligence report on s 2506 107th congress the committee views the graduate program as the most effective way of achieving the stated goal of the program for several reasons first the graduate program reaches students after they have already selected career path also nsep officials have told the committee that graduate students are enthusiastic about serving as federal employees and generally seek employment in national security positions the committee notes that the undergraduate program while providing unique learning opportunities is an inadequate mechanism for ensuring that students will obtain employ ment with the federal government and thereby fails to meet the stated goal of producing an increased pool of applicants to serve in the federal government be cause the nsep is essentially taking risk on students by providing them with substantial amount of financial assistance the committee believes that it is in the best interest of the program to focus on those students most likely to seek and attain employment in the field of national security srept 107149 in addition to the above arguments the level of foreign nguage proficiency attained by graduate students is likely to be substantially higher than for undergraduateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31643crs11 14 this program is authorized by the international academic opportunity act of 2000 title iii of pl 106309 15 the gilman international scholarship pr ogram authorizes the appropriation of 15 million per year for scholarships of up to 5000 for us citizen undergraduate students the scholarships may be used to pay the costs of travel plus tuition and related study abroad expenses in order to be eligible students mu st be recipients of financial assistance under eds pell grant program ie undergraduate students from relatively lowincome families in the selection of grant recipien ts preference is given to those who have not previously studied abroad st udents may study any subject and travel to any region of the world except cuba or country identified in travel warning issued by the department of state unlike the nsep there is rvice requirement the gilman program is administered by the department of state via the nongovernmental institute of international educationin contrast supporters of the current nsep undergraduate sc holarship program have argued that it provides relatively rare opportunity for fe derallyfunded foreign travel at point in their educational careers at which mo st students are deciding upon the path they will follow for their graduate study and future careers only one other relatively small federal program the gilman international scholarship program14 supports foreign travel opportunities for us undergraduate st udents and it is not focused on critical foreign nguages or world regions15 in addition the argument that graduate students are more likely to pursue career in national security position with the federal government would not seem to be supported by data on the wa ys in which scholarship nd fellowship recipients have met their service requirements thus far according to cumulative data for 19962002 provided by nsep staff the percentage of undergraduate scholarship recipients who have taken federal pos itions 93 is much higher than the percentage of graduate fellowship recipients who have met their service requirement by taking federal positions 50 thus far it appears that graduate fellowship recipients are much more likely to meet their service requirement by taking positions in higher education this is most likely to occur with respect to students in doctoral as opposed to masters degree programs service requirement and li nkages to national security agencies throughout the life of the nsep nd especially after the adoption of amendments to the nsea service requirements in 1996 by pl 104201 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1997 some members of the us academic community have expressed concern about the linkages between this program and the dod central intelligence ag ency cia and other federal national security agencies this concern arises not only from the nseps service requirement the obligation to seek employment in national security position although not necessarily in national security agency but also other linkages between the program and national security agencies g administration of the program by the dod under the auspices of the national fense university and representation of national security agencies on the nsebhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31643crs12 16 the agencies at which scholarship recipien ts have most often taken positions are the department of state 27 dod 20 the congress 14 and department of commerce 8 the agencies at which fellowship recipients have most often taken positions are the us agency for international development 30 dod 18 department of state 14 nd department of commerce 8the nsea explicitly prohibits scholarship and fellowship recipients from being required to undertake any ac tivity on behalf of any fede ral agency as condition for receipt of their assistance while engaged in their subsidized education program in addition as noted earlier the service re quirement has been in terpreted relatively broadly in practice to incl ude positions in wide rang of federal agencies see footnote 9 further the length of the rvice requirement ge nerally equal to the period of time for which aid was receive d is shorter than for some other scholarship or loan forgiveness programs requiring service for only few months to two years in general further cumulative 19962002 data provided by nsep staff on federal employment of scholarship and fellowship recipients indicate that majority have met their service requireme nt by taking positions outside the dod cia and similar national security agencies first 50 of graduate fellowship recipients and 7 of undergraduate scholarship reci pients have met their serv ice requirement by taking positions in higher education institutions not the federal government second among those taking federal positions to m eet their service re quirement more than onehalf have taken positions in agenci other than the dod cia and s imilar national security agencies16 nevertheless critics of these linkages have expressed concern that participating students would be treated with suspicion and might even be in danger abroad if they are identifiable as possible future employees of us intelligence and defense agencies concern has been expressed about the safety of particip ants as well as the cooperation of foreign educa tional institutions if the nsea is perceived as being related to the us national security agencies while critics of this aspect of the nsep have expressed concerns bout all of the programs grant programs such cr iticism has most recently been focused primarily on the current and prospective institutional grant programs including the national flagship language initiative critics have argued that the linkages between the nsep and national security agencies affect only individual students under the scholarship and fellowship pr ograms while involving at least indirectly entire ihes which accept institutional grants according to statement by the board of directors of the middle east studi association mesa we have 1992 1995 noted our strong reserva tions concerning the decision to locate the nsep administration in the department of defense and the involvement of the cia on the board that oversees the nsep we believe it is essential to maintain th administrative independence of such programs from government agencies involved in nationa l security we are apprehensive that the proposed establishment of university programs will link all participating students by association with defens department language study funding through the institutional grants
