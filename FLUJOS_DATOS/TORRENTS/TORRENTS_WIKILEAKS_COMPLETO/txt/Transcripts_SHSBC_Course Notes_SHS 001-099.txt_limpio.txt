superabundance of control circuitry it is contained in the phrase im all alone paranoia has the phrase theyre all against the repeater phrase i love you gets the pc into sympathy engram prevent aberration by keeping calm around child dont quarrel pull attention units to pt by creating necessity level even if it has to be an artificial one eg person who is drowning and seeing his whole life flashing before him is coming up to pt if you can do this to kid in early life nothing will bother him later cultural patterns such as an extended period of mourning are just cultural patterns in the absence of engrams you dont get long term misemotion it should be made part of the social mores not to talk or even say shh around injured or anaten persons in industry you get the situation where an individual who has worked in one place gets chain of injuries with the same perceptics and lots of words therefore he is out of pt at work and may cause industrial accidents 100 of auto accidents are caused by engramic restimulation whether of the driver mechanic or manufacturers accident proneness is telepathic one finds that engrams are the best telepathic broadcasters this is analogous to an alarm system for the herd thus of two persons who have never met one will act out the other valence in the others engram at high tones affinity is raw cohesiveness at lower tones it is as if there is herd that must be alerted and needs shock eg fear grief anger to be broadcast to cohere the herd into fight or flight you can notice this telepathic alarm system when you enter room where people have been quarreling so when you are in the society of others you run into this all the time similarly in the vicinity of accidents other accidents occur engrams are keyed in and then acted out thus accidents come in threes if you took drivers licenses away from the 8 of people who have been involved in car accidents involving injury you could eliminate 90 of the accidents if you audit grief charges in pregnant women with sobbing or selfbeating etc you may get transmission of engrams to the child then when later you try to audit the child you may get oddities or restimulation from dianetic patter which is part of the childs incident therefore probably dianetic patter will have to be changed in 15 to 20 years so auditing pregnant woman has to be adjudicated you should go ahead if there is threat of attempted abortion or difficult birth also you should observe how the mother behaves during auditing by the way girdles etc cause more or less continuous engrams for the child so watch out for young kids or unwed mothers or anyone who would try to hide pregnancy social aberrations are fragments of old morals whose practical origin is forgotten morals in their turn are socially agreed upon attempt to handle problem for which rational answer exists its juryrigged solution thus some morals may be unethical 2 l ron hubbard type 2 idate23950 volnum0 issue1 rev0 rdate000

chemically convulsive therapy perception during surgical anesthesia old reference american journal of neurology 1914 the reactive mind and the analytical one are biochemically independent thus it is possible to inhibit one or the other independently by chemical means the reactive mind is the sole source of error cf freud the psychopathology of everyday life society as kind of organism can have engrams when cell divides it gives all its progeny its memory this can be proven by conditioning cells so the cell brings hair color instinctive behavior patterns and the genetic personality but along with this comes any moment of injury the cells have held back full power from the analytical mind in moments of danger to enforce fight flight etc there is also somatic mind containing training patterns that can easily be changed by the analytical mind and organic responses which can also be controlled analytically cf yogis but the engram bank can bypass the analytical mind and seize control

the mind would come close to perfection except for certain things which prevent perfection the mind can know without letting itself know the task of the processor is to get better working methods for others then let them help him the blind leading the blind however may fail when the blind are too blind therefore scientology could only be applied by the very sane it is concerned with the able sanity is an absolute perfection in reason that would resolve problems to the optimum good of all those concerned absolutes are not obtainable even if you were absolutely sane you would still lack

through it scientology is exact there are maybes up to the point of thought creating physical motion there is very little selfdeterminism up to the point of milestone one when you do get there you will be free of lrh and scientology too even what we call clear is not there yet when you have arguments with yourself you have different personalities in yourself arguing these may exist in different areas eg the stomach area anyone will show up on the meter as having at least three different personalities if you see two arguing there is third which is kind of noble its adjudicating or its sound asleep then there may be fourth one these are circuits but they are personalities they are always in the same place in the same people if you shift from the left side to the right to the center you get somatic in the center of the forehead could this be the third eye you as an individual an engram the proper thing to do is to run it the point is to become one person you have to run this thing before you can be you it was done by supersonic waves the engram thus created says not to know basic problem with anyones understanding of scientology is not knowing the words word is just code the

then run it out using thought emotion and effort processing the goal is to be able to run fac one the mind is an entity so is the physical universe thought is beingness it has wavelength it is true static there is limit of capacity limit of time it can record the physical universe and use it against itself it can animate and control the physical universe it is not in the physical universe since it has not the properties of the physical universe it is 4 like mirror in which room is reflected there is real room there thought can pick up energy and matter in space and time and mobilize it thought takes the laws it has learned and turns it against the physical universe like mirror the brain is to translate thought into action the mind looks at this the brain does not contain purpose thus the mind is necessary it stores past recordings of the physical universe it is the purpose or beingness that can exist without body to handle the physical universe it is hard to accomplish things in the physical universe without body the mind stores pictures of energy it can project an image into the physical universe and cause an effect pictures have effort in them in addition to perceptions the mind continuously makes conclusions from old pictures to estimate the future according to its purposes it tells answers and puts them into action it also stores conclusions another bundle of old pictures on top of this is the purpose and beingness of the person that is making him do this steps the mind takes 1 it has thought to be 2 takes pictures 3 combines these 4 records efforts 5 it takes pieces of the physical universe and combines these to make body 6 the body can then do things in the physical universe the minds purposes 1 to be 2 to conquer the physical universe thus we have three echelons 1 the physical universe 2 thought 3 who told you to survive the physical universe is characterized by motion which is matter changing in space this being the definition of time this gives you mest physics has problem with circular definition of space and time in that these are defined against each other physics view of the universe is that it consists mainly of motion this is an incomplete view thought is static of unlimited capabilities that has wavelength space or time it is impinged upon physical universe that has matter energy space and time the mission of thought is survival in the physical universe and in order to do this it is effecting conquest of the physical universe mysticism is in the second echelon the fundamental of physics is not complex but the use of it can be complex similarly with the human mind the mind is neither in nor out of the mest universe at any rate it is not in the physical universe the mind has an effect on the body one reason the body is suboptimal is because of the minds considerations about it the emeter while it does not measure the mind measures the physiological effect of the minds operation the third echelon is anything and everything that might lie north of the above it would answer the question who told you to survive you get into questions like why is nothing nothing if nothing is nothing then its motion in handling these echelons one must go on gradient getting to the top of one problem before starting on the next one we must finish one before two and two before we get into three people effectively commit suicide by starting on echelon three from the bottom of one you have to handle your aberrations first otherwise you lose your marbles 5 in scientology we try to find an effective way to handle facsimiles and memory you can eliminate them or you can file them accurately truly selfdetermined person is unlikely to be affected by facsimiles in fact only one incident was strong enough to do this

working with and he is nondimensional point in space who is an energy production unit definition spacation is process having to do with the rehabilitation of the creation of space second meaning is that spacation is the subject of space this is above the subject of energy it is dirty trick to make person into theta clear without giving him data about it he knows this data potentially but is not aware of it if he knew about it he wouldnt be in the mest universe this subject is the anatomy of universes the construction maintenance and destruction of universes of different kinds and dimensions the study of the basic structure and experience called the mest universe is basic one the laws of the mest universe or natural laws are the inevitable average of agreement starting with the study of natural law we get to the study of that which made natural law that thing capable of making agreements which become natural law in auditing pc you are undoing the agreement that makes him part of the natural law emc squared probably wasnt true 30 or 40 trillion years ago in arslycus where the pc spent 10000 lives working at the same job arslycus got bigger and bigger it was just built out in space one day people got the idea of mass agreed to it and got careful about it arslycus blew up and everybody was glad to see it go at this point the law of gravity was widely agreed upon there is natural tendency to push out of the group those individuals who dont agree with the group thus person who thinks that the mest universe is his universe gets sent to the spin bin in scientology we are not trying to disagree with the mest universe we are just taking it and making it appear and disappear at will for any individual every now and then pc in processing gets an uneasy feeling that theres some thought he doesnt dare think hes coming up against agreement and doesnt want the responsibility of undoing it because he cant handle that much energy if you could get him to where he could handle the energy hell face the thought probably all that would happen is that the mest universe would momentarily disappear for him then hed fish around to get an orientation point to get back into it you just have to know how to handle space to get into and out of the mest universe people use the old energy of the mest universe instead of creating stuff from scratch they hang onto being identities using bodies like id cards instead of being individuals this does furnish randomity and provides emotions that one can pretend to be the effect and not the cause of the identification card permits the individual to make living so he can feed the id card 6 the tarot is philosophical machine preserved as playing cards these cards represent concepts of human experience thus for instance the fool could represent person at 45 on the tone scale such person would have passed out of agreement by knowing all agreement the sequence of events relating to agreement with the mest universe is 1 agreement 2 agree or else 3 we dont care if you agree we are going to punish you anyway 4 below agreement notis of agreement mest is in complete confusion of having agreed to everything owning and controlling nothing society builds into people conditioned social tone one has the tone level of ones society as being body combination thats the tone level pcs bank will have the tone of his facsimiles and ridges as being one has different tone level one cannot study scientology from the point of view of any other system one can only study it by looking at you or the other people you know applying the definitions and seeing what is or isnt there scientology consists in the study of 1 progressive examination of the agreements that came to bring about the mest universe 2 the science of how agreements are made 3 what are the beings that make these agreements l ron hubbard type 2 idate4654 volnum0 issue6 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 6acc37 the knowtosex scale the mind and the tone scale 5406c04 6acc37 the knowtosex scale the mind and the tone scale theres line breaking existence in half above and below which is know to sex scale the upper of the two scales has something good about each level the lower one has something bad about each level see fig 1 eg person who knows sex is bad is at the bottom next they will know eating then symbols etc is bad the tone scale is logarithmically dwindling scale it has wide spaces at the top and narrow ones at the bottom the know to sex scale has distance factor to it the particles are progressively further apart as you ascend the scale until you reach know where you dont have any particles for instance at emotion the particles are twice as many and half as far apart as at look thus according to this gradient scale you cant go straight from bad sex to good sex so you have to go some to convince person who thinks sex is bad that its good or vice versa suppress condense thats why auditing appears to produce gradual results pc is fixed or dispersed about life and life is divisible into these factors before you can get an individual to change his mind about some subject you have to get him to change across lot of categories also all parts of the scale except the knowingness band contain particles as long as the individual is allergic to space and particles hell tend to crossconnect the different bands of the scale as per restimulation whenever he runs into space or particles so our procedure is to get him to change his mind about various kinds of particles gradiently until we can get him to change his mind about all particles 6a figure 1 the knowtomystery scale __ know look emote good effort think symbols eat sex _____________________________________________________________ __ mystery lower level know effort look emote bad effort think symbols eat sex 7 below sex is mystery which is like lower level knowingness in his study of dreams freud started with mystery then proceeded to sex if you could reveal to patient that mystery was not unsolvable he would improve but sometimes freud would take too many mysteries from someone who had scarcity and hed go down to lower level looking with most people freud would get them through sex up to eat theorists got stuck trying to figure whether eat or sex was the basis of everything none of them was up to effort themselves they were in awe of anyone who could indulge in sports psychologists with their intelligence tests were at the level of symbols at thinkingness man figurefigures to avoid effort engineering is the study of how to make effort use effort this is very covert and is not confront of effort psychoanalysis never got above the area of stimulusresponse with their theory of association they didnt believe in independent thinking person who reacts to op pro by dup is way down the knowsex scale he will in the course of processing go up and down the scale only hitting prominent points on his way up this is crossing barriers which the individual has put up to protect himself in the business of livingness the names of these barriers are looking emoting etc the barrier of looking is space next comes barrier of barrage of emotional states for instance of serenity or enthusiasm each lower emotion could be considered protection against the upper ones he uses boredom to protect himself from enthusiasm antagonism is barrage of particles used to fend something off anger is ridge fear is defense who wants to close terminals with someone who is in fear eg animals in fear taste bad people in fear smell bad grief goes like this im solid here i cant move take care of its barrier you mustnt do certain things to person in grief the upper edge of apathy is the barrier i dont care the lower edge is eat being sick to ones stomach is an apathy of eating vomiting this is evidence that below the band of emoting you get increasingly deeper emotions connected with each step down hence the apathy of eating vomiting the apathy of effort would be wanting to be less than inert this is what people experience who are having rough time with the mind efforting is observably barrier force used to protect thinkingness is figuring out where he will be when something else is elsewhere or where he will put something when he himself is not there hes placing things in terms of force so at this level you cant carry revolver you have to figure out where money is safe how to keep people from tripping you up predict their intentions etc if you had weapon you could protect yourself at the efforting band and you wouldnt have to think at symbols we get dont look in here it might be dangerous im really not here im elsewhere attack this symbol if you like because it isnt i eating is way of getting attention and admiration from what one eats and as such may be very satisfying sex protects one from the present by providing an escape into the future symbol that cant be in the present can appear on the future track you could process someone with get the idea of putting something there now get the idea of moving out now get the idea of coming back and finding what you have put there that is the action of sex it is very satisfying to the pc sex also says dont eat its something else to do the individual felt unsafe without these barriers when he put something out as barrier to protect him he made it senior to him hence its dwindling spiral 7a figure 2 knowtomystery scale cycles know emphasis v sex know emphasizes looking v sex know emphasizes emoting v sex know emphasizes efforting v sex know emphasizes thinking v sex know emphasizes symbolizing v sex know emphasizes eating v sex know emphasizes sexing v sex everything undifferentiated identified with everything nuts 8 so far we have discussed each of these levels as defense against motivators but we can also use each of these barriers as an overt level here we get dispersal manifestations down the line tears as defense are flow but there is an unnamed dispersal at grief that is offensive similarly there is an unnamed dispersal at apathy actually what you have is series of know to sex scales fig 2 you can see this in running op pro by dup someone might start at effort then go to emotion to knowing its silly to sex impulse then figurefigure then new know then eat emote new look etc he is hitting high points going upscale through ridges he will linger in the upper ones longer with more manifestations as he differentiates better and better at the bottom everything identifies with everything effort sex the way you look etc one could draw the scale to indicate dropping dominance at the highest level each band has about the same emphasis at the first harmonic down the emphasis will be on knowingness at the next harmonic down what you do with all the levels is look hightones thetan loves to do this at the next harmonic down the whole scale is colored by emotion at the next lower it is colored by effort as in german society as opposed to italian society which is colored by emotion next we get the figurefigure that is characteristic of latin american societies southern california or universities next we get the whole scale colored by symbols here you get erudition eg the idea that mathematicians have done it all for you theres need to think similarly with eating then sex below that level it gets undifferentiated into an identification of everything with everything it all gets very compressed effort is sex if he is below this level he is nuts this scale provides method of predicting how long

5410c20 8acc14 the parts of man this is discussion of the parts of man as understood through r261 and r262 the parts of man are related to overts and motivators this is be cause thetan as such cannot be harmed and therefore cannot receive motivator so he would have to have confusion of identity to receive motivator man consists of four distinct separate though related parts 1 thetan 2 body 3 thetan machinery 4 reactivesomatic mind dianetics covers the first four dynamics even the first dynamic can be split into these four parts when you thought you were treating the first dynamic you were actually treating the third the absolute book 1 clear would be the awareness of awareness unit around the end of 1951 lrh mentions that erasure of all facsimiles would result in demolishment of the body see advanced procedures and axioms in book 1 we were talking about engrams of this lifetime erasing these would give relative clear the only trouble was that the awareness of awareness unit after few years of this research kept insisting on exteriorizing and it turned out to be the person himself if he felt bad when he was out sort of with character he is not stabilized 9 so the first dynamic is the awareness of awareness unit as modified by various things pieces of thetan machinery are his creations hidden and forgotten by him all the energy used by the machines really comes from the thetan though for randomity he may consider that he needs to eat to keep on going he can also understand something from someone else add it to his own machinery and blame someone for giving him machine the thetan invests the body with characteristics then he is afraid of losing these characteristics but this is really problem he can invest himself with these characteristics the thetan can also duplicate himself he can create new different life unit with full determinism power personality etc it could have more power than he if it is set up that way sex is the supercondensed manytimesviad activity of creating other life forms it is only more complex because it is considered to be the thetan actually needs system to create living being thetan machinery is not intended to have life of its own but sometimes the thetan endows machinery with life in dmsmh lrh talks of the possibility of setting the mind alongside the body this was misinterpreted worst in etherapy one can do this and get himself haunted by living beings he can create them then go off and leave them this is basic life multiplication 1d creating 3d through 2d so mankind could have one common ancestor it would not make that one superior however since the offspring could just as well be the superior ones furthermore an individual could just repostulate himself back into his creative unit and thus disappear especially since in reality there is time all one could lose would be the knowingness that he had done it one would have to shut that off for oneself now do you think you understand valence little better having multiplied himself often an individual had laid aside this ability begun to hang on to the only one computation and is holding his ability to be himself closely to himself he tries hard to maintain an identity as 1d he becomes too involved in his own agreements and thinks he needs sex to create being but even that creates only body which is the granted beingness of many individualities based upon one individuality that started that genetic line the thetan got so complex with all his machinery and so interlocked with so many other individualities he granted so much beingness in all directions that he forgot who and what he was and just knew he was supposed to be this identity and repeat the manufactured creation of this identity this would make him solid and his machinery would have composited at this point he would be body and his machinery would become the reactivesomatic mind the thetan gets so solid as body that he can be taken over and controlled by another thetan and his machines the reactive mind that goes along with body cannot be controlled unless another thetan comes along and takes over the body however the body can control the reactive mind there is difference between the reactive and the somatic mind thetan can create another thetan from this we can get species which implies other species hence 5th dynamic thetans are generally not as anxious to control animal bodies as human bodies since mens affairs are complex enough to be interesting to control so animals are generally body reactive mind condensed thetan machinery by addressing the alterised complexity as in psychotherapy we would never get an asisness but just more mass the auditor thus must address the right part the thetan otherwise he might 10 as well try to process rock as body the rock is more complex being denser therefore it has more vias on the comm lines the distance from cause to effect in rock has so many vias and complexities in it that it loses both cause and effect for the rock the impulse towards religion in most people is to discover basic cause however it leads them to go through vias which gets them lost the way to find cause is to find the highest level of freedom assume it and then know because you will be cause and will therefore be capable of being an effect as processing improves we find that the better we understand something the better we can control it and the less need to process it so that it can be controlled so in modern scientology and dianetics it is only necessary to knock out the factors you dont want to process because you understand them well enough to control them the first of these is the reactive mind there is sense in processing it since we know how to control it also theres use in processing the body medicine will take care of that machinery is interesting but its not necessary so were left with only the thetan to process and we process the thetan just enough so that he can take control of his other parts having recognized them right thought as in christian science would work fine if you had clear to begin with the christian scientists have limits on what right thought is but actually right thought is optimum survival on all dynamics so in processing we can start with be three feet back of your head for those who dont respond to that the overtmotivator sequence is good place to start its the mechanical process by which thetan becomes solid enough to be body surrounded by his machinery which has become the bank behind the overtmotivator sequence lies the consideration that matches the overt and motivator you must be downstairs from pandeterminism to selfdeterminism for this to happen justifier is the mockup or overt act demanded by person guilty of an unmotivated act it is something nonexistent as an effort to justify the unmotivated act its false motivator theres nothing really wrong with the motivatorovert sequence it balances out one gets insane or even hurt by it but the unmotivated act justifier sequence is the villain thus the thetan is doomed because he can never really receive motivator thats the whole reason for the dwindling spiral thetan can never be harmed but he can consider hes been harmed act harmed and dwindle everything the pc tells you is search for justifier his search through his bank quickly asises his few true motivators so he has too many overts and must get himself sick downtrodden and betrayed motivator hunger he gives justifiers and pretends theyre motivators the way you could get him into this dwindling spiral is to define harm for him this gets into good and evil r261 and r262 it only requires the consideration that harm can take place to set off the unmotivated actjustifier sequence you just get this consideration from yourself person must have intended harmful destruction and succeeded to define the concept harmful for himself only when someone destroys something hes created does he define harm for the other fellow he had to do it first himself because he had to communicate first to be communicated to since otherwise he couldnt have been located any solidity or departure from the static is lie the way we depart from the absolute truth of static is via the lies of justifiers this is the source of all inabilities and deficiencies the thetan also has an anxiety about creating an effect another thetan can never get motivator thetan knows he can 11 never receive an effect except as he considers it and agrees so he knows he can never create an effect on another thetan so he must consider life units as solids he gets upset when he considers them thetans hence people turn away from scientology because they are afraid of exterior beings the thetan wants to create an effect but cant without being guilty of an unmotivated act all he had to do to get messed up was to discover he could harm others he then tried to justify his unmotivated acts and got solid and his whole past track would be nearly all hallucination the insane pack along an enormous number of mocked up facsimiles justifiers pictures of things that never occurred good violent fast way to handle this state of affairs is to have the pc mock up things that anything on the seventh dynamic could do to him this remedies his havingness motivator hunger you can actually use all dynamics another process the pc spots all the spots where he or anyone considered that harm could be or had been done r261 and r262 in creation of human ability pp 153154 l ron hubbard type 2 idate3655 volnum0 issue3 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000

and will get better because he wants to live insanity is death wish of great magnitude sanity returns when person decides to live psychosomatic illness is overrated being universally present as

about anything specific or 1a what will disability get you into b what will disability get you out of then when flat 2 what can you prove with it the disability here we run into the computation that any sensation is better than sensation and that he should have something to get sympathy and avoid guilt but the thetan is to be able to invent whole new category of ills before hell give up one hes got hence invent something worse than illness death was invented on the whole track as substitute for insanity which was being so irresponsible that punishment was pointless you could get anyone to

close to the top in scientology the most fundamental fundamental was invented later it appears on page 23 of the ability issue called the hca manual the rudiments 1 awareness of the auditor that an auditing room is present and that session is in progress 2 two way comm on casual basis 3 delivery of the question 4 the comm lag 5 the acknowledgement 6 duplication of the exact question by the auditor in order to make any auditing work these fundamentals must be observed if the session is not precisely conducted the processes can fail to work this even explains why one might not 13 have practice if the public couldnt find the auditor there would be practice this also explains one difficulty in auditing ones parents you need awareness of an auditor not child to start the session the pc must first find out hes pc and he must find the auditor in the auditing situation students must learn to assume the beingness of auditors and pcs not students if you exist as auditor there will be pcs this depends upon an ability to be the relationship between auditor and pc is not so much one of altitude as one of arc you must keep the r in when you are auditing an auditor for instance it doesnt inspire confidence to have to stop and look up the process theres process that makes pc into pc what are you doing run until he cognites hes being audited pc goes out of comm with an auditor before he observes that theres something wrong with the session like code break an auditors code break only occurs when the pc thinks the auditor has bad intentions and where the auditor does not repair the out comm with little two way comm the auditor may if the out arc is severe have to use another process on lower gradient until arc is restored gradient scale in auditing need not take long time for each type of processing for instance to get the pc to remedy havingness need not take 5 hours if you stay in two way comm and see what is really happening when the pc throws away mockups so as to really get rid of them this could take only 6 to 8 minutes if youve actually got an auditor and pc you must continually be aware of these rudiments since the pc can stop being pc at any time then two way comm gives out whenever two way comm gives out the session stops as far as the pc is concerned what starts this is too little two way comm and too little acknowledgement in the first place the pc will get stuck on the time track at the point where he has not been acknowledged and the session at that point is in fact over its all now in the past for the pc when he gets restuck later on in session hell blow or threaten to sometimes this can be handled merely by the auditors starting all over with the session thus subtly calling the pcs attention to the fact that hes in session pc may blow 28 minutes after failure to ack the auditor must learn to differentiate between pcs dropped willingness and an increased comm lag where willingness is not there auditing can occur the only thing there in the first place is willingness to play the game nations topple if they forget this fact willingness to work if taxed too heavily can become willingness to succumb whip extracts the last atoms of willingness but this can easily be turned around the only thing that any nation can tax that any group can exist on is the willingness to play the game to do to survive to continue if you decrease pcs willingness to play the game of auditing you can hardly expect to increase his willingness to play the game of life he must always audit better than he can live or hell never live better than he can be audited in session he should observably be getting brighter and more alert pcs always sag bit when session is over so dont be disappointed when life seems harder than the session 14 helpful hints you must duplicate the question time and time again without killing the pcs willingness to answer it this can be done by adding some dunnage but dont vary the question the dunnage consists of casual twoway communication before and after the question twoway comm is light airy it has life in it and can be terribly casual and fantastically therapeutic to remedy havingness is to remedy the need to have regret is running the time track backwards l ron hubbard type 2 idate31055 volnum0 issue2 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 4lacc2 the fundamentals of scientology the rudiments of auditing part 2 5510c03 4lacc2 the fundamentals of scientology the rudiments of auditing part 2 here are the reasons why the human mind has not been solved 1 i dont know 2 idea to know about something is is necessary to notknow it first this was an incomprehensibility to philosophers of all ages to understand the source of ideas you had to understand idea one has to be able to notknow something in order to know something about it dialectical materialism is dramatization of idea idea is workable concept but as long as the dialectical materialists are only dramatizing it and dont know it it is unworkable dialectical materialism says that all new ideas are the result of two old forces hence idea can bs really new so there is possibility of getting new idea if someone dramatizes something as with the dialectical materialists it must have existed earlier as postulate that went solid things begin with consideration and end with solidity eg dramatization or solid reality so an idea is senior to all matter and conditions above that is the thetan in his native state if thetan wishes to return to his native state he often bungles it by assuming that hs is in native state when he is actually in very bad shape this leads to the idiocy that everything that is true of thetans native state is what continues to be dramatized clear down to the bottom of the barrel and that every aberration is reflection of native state and the first and second postulate theory axioms 36 and 37 native state is having idea the thetan knows all about all he has ideas because he has all the ideas there are now he says that he will have an idea here we get axiom 36 the first postulate gives the second postulate power so the thetan in native state knows all he then makes first postulate that he has idea from here as per axiom 36 he can make the second postulate that he can have an idea this is an harmonic on native state but it is alterised so it persists and we get time the force of having an idea is the statement that he didnt have an idea before an idea is barrier stop on the track even manic idea or win can be stop so we get 0 native state the thetan knows all but has specific idea 1 first postulate idea i dont know 2 second postulate specific idea this is an harmonic on native state i know something 3 third postulate forget 4 fourth postulate remember 15 for the first time in the history of mankind it has become safe for man to know something it was not safe before because youd stick to it because every mystery could then pull you into it the more you knew about it the more you were enveloped by it this gives the manifestations of thetans blackness dropped havingness illness etc things known on second postulate basis are solid and persist studying anything will produce this phenomenon scientology has been safe subject because it has progressed toward simplicity and has never pretended to contain all knowledge theres limited amount of knowingness and unknowingness available what gets scarce is unknowingness we let unknow go on an automatic basis we dont take responsibility for it so it gets pulled in on an unknowing basis youd never get into trouble in processing if you kept on supplying lots of noidea instead of using old noideas when you keep on using old noideas to get new ideas eventually the new ideas jam into the existing noideas which have become so precious that we interiorize into them here weve ignored the first postulate which provided the power for the second postulate one gets stuck in dramatizing noidea and loses the volitional ability to postulate an idea into existence people who get stuck in know about are in the second postulate if they exteriorize its into the blackness of the third postulate which is the harmonic of the first notising the knowingness thus ive forgotten it the fourth postulate is remember an alterisness of notisness this is getting to be very persistent stuff from this sequence we get most solidities and spaces except for directly postulated solids and spaces perhaps the fifth postulate would be occlude all you need to get space is lookingness which is dramatization of knowing in lookingness space is on an automaticity thats why space continues to exist this automatic space because its automatic tends to fold up on people producing condensed spaces and figurefigure at lower levels the above was discovered by the fact of the relative effectiveness of running something you wouldnt mind forgetting compared with the bogginess of something you wouldnt mind remembering notknowingness evidently is the only solution to prevent interiorization into bodies of knowledge or solid objects per axiom 36 if you take out the first postulate you can knock out the second one for instance you realize that over there theres bus running it doesnt affect you does it until you knew there was bus over there and then you probably got picture of it or something get the trick probably countertrick would be saying i dont know whats standing right here inventing something to stand here then remembering you said you didnt know what was there so theres automatic i dont know before the knowingness running an i dont know process for two hours gives more gain than 50 hours of i know the unworkability of remember processes shows that psychoanalysis never gave stable gains it gives solid ridges if you keep remembering you can asis it by having him recall all the times he remembered or better still use forgetting to dissolve the ridge take any troublesome engram ask the pc what he doesnt know about it and it will blow in minutes it upsets the pc to have him make perfect duplicate but this way only causes fogginess if you dont acknowledge well and stay in two way comm this also solves the case with the stuck picture its also safe to use what dont you know about it on chronic somatics notknowingness is not the goal of humanity or scientology its just the barrier that has to be crossed 16 l ron hubbard type 2 idate81055 volnum0 issue1 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 lpls1 the goals of dianetics and scientology

man that one gets an idea that the subject has breadth exceeding human understanding which it did for 50000 years because people couldnt tolerate that much simplicity the thetan cant be perceived or measured because its the source of perception and measuring but an individual can exteriorize and experience being thetan not being able to perceive other thetans its easy to feel like the only one now for the first time by various manifestations and by reason of what we know we can observe this in others there are many ways of experiencing the idea of someone else exteriorizing in the first place voice tones change another thing hes liable to do is to pull his head back into his neck hes liable to do various things all of which manifest exteriorization hes liable to say lot of things none of which manifest exteriorization but sort of mystic butteredallovertheuniverse the thetan who is over there aint exteriorization is not stable fact it is the phenomenon of being in position or space dependent only on ones consideration able to view from that space the body and the room as it is one can view or control the body from distance if one has trouble controlling the body from close up he wont get out of his head because he for sure cant control it at distance therefore its only necessary for you to assume the abilities of controlling something from distance to be able to exteriorize willingly since all willingness to exteriorize is merely suppressed by this factor of control one of the early methods of exteriorizing someone was getting him to change his considerations by running him on i can control this body i cannot control this body people who have never been out of their heads will go out on that one the task in scientology today however is not getting people out of their heads you could exteriorize yourself simply by grabbing your head with your two hands and keeping your head from going away or you could grab your head and your knees and keep each alternatively from going away shifting attention so you wont get too fixated how good your perception would be is another question its matter of your willingness too if you cant 17 see your body there is scarcity of bodies if you cant see the universe there is scarcity of universes any phenomenon which occurs beyond the point of willingness to be out of the head or control the body from distance is regulated by the scarcity and abundance of bodies and universes the earliest trick still works try not to be three feet back of your head about 50 will go out on be three feet back of your head because they have been otherdetermined lot vision depends on scarcity and abundance experience depends on willingness to experience which is monitored by the amount of things available to experience culture is composite of things of which there is neither too much nor too little eg we have lot but not too many automobiles because they can be real mow this country is approaching an indialike idea of human beings the idea that there are too many of them in frontier society there are too few as you get too many people they tend to become invisible on frontier until there are almost enough people they dramatize getting rid of people in between you can have progressive society and the us was such society with 25 to 100 million people now there are too many people to observe them all even important people get overlooked person could just go out of his head without outside help if he has space and universe to get out into he must not have scarcity of spaces as result of being out of comm with them his idea of scarcity of spaces depends on his willingness to view them the auditor must get him to recognize the isness of the room around him his idea that rooms are scarce or too numerous gives him the idea that he cant see this room likewise if he has too few bodies he will be unwilling to get out of the one hes in it is the same with an overabundance of bodies so remedying his havingness on the body he is in is necessary for stable exteriorization scarcity of experience brings about retention of the mental image pictures so the mind gets overcrowded or goes black the pictures can even penetrate the blackness producing the wideopen case where the mind is in control of the thetan this is condition of overwhelm not health when the thetan obeys the records of the mind we have behavior patterns etc the mind is the record but the thetan is the needle scarcity of experience causes manufacture of pictures people that play their minds closer in havent been living an exciting enough life the workings of this mechanism depend on association and differentiation or identification and differentiation when the reactive mind can exert its influence on person better than the thetan himself he has become too associative to conceive differences he can disassociate on an inverted level where he differentiates incorrectly he gets misidentification and disassociation when insane when the mind is working optimally it never identifies but only conceives similarity lack of objects incidents and experience causes the mind to identify rather than associating it is not stress or overwork that causes this that is why problems of comparable magnitude or mock up something to confront will work relieve somatics etc things that happen to you are automatic in that you all too of ten have say in their occurrence when you run problems of comparable magnitude you not only measure up incident and add incident to the bank but you also take over the automaticity of shocking incidents that occurred to you when you have gone all the way up the line the idea of too few becomes the idea of i didnt do it then this runs out and it all becomes pandeterminism of incidents where you become convinced you can create incidents and lose scarcity of incidents in tv screen world youre apt 18 to be in trouble the tv pictures are patterns of light and shadows restimulative mechanism to shove your bank around and give you again some segment of that which youve already experienced it can only give you experience youve already if distantly had people will refuse to read about certain periods in history because of experience in those periods thetan will refuse to look at certain parts of his past and the bank but they can be gotten at if necessary only people who have had heavy problems in past life refuse to look at it but if they had scarcity of horrible incidents they could confront them better the restimulated incident is held in place for two reasons it was automatic ie the pc left large sections of it done by somebody else plus there wasnt enough of it those incidents that are most scarce tend to stick hardest anything that stands by itself doesnt get terminal against which to discharge and fly apart any old incident could react physiologically against the pc if the auditor wanted to restimulate it fully not letting the pc ever be cause on it evaluating it invalidating etc you should know how to do this as long as doing something bad to pcs doesnt become habit with you cf gestalt encounter and primal scream therapies that cause an effect so the mind is mechanism for overcoming the lack of incident and experience in present time by storing pictures of the past if you restore the pcs ability to make the pictures solid youve really done something he has some optimum randomity that would be the right amount of pictures so you have to change his idea of how much motion he needs before you can change the pc this is done with scarcity and abundance ie havingness the body is solid appendage that makes person recognizable the mind modifies the body which is mockup to change body you have to change mental structure and also the thetans willingness to have it in its present condition the body surrenders first to its own electronic structure ie the anchor points it is solid only within these spaces and will aberrate its shape in their absence so the easiest way to modify the body is to put the thetan into willingness to handle anchor points then remedy scarcity and abundance of anchor points and put the actual anchor points in optimal position mental image pictures also influence the body by influencing the anchor points facsimile imposes itself by magnetic fields and currents upon the anchor point system causing the body to change shape and size the anchor points are golden balls if person is in good shape hell have his wing anchor points out about 75 feet you can hold one pull it out of line and the person will walk in circle to fix broken arm you have to remedy the havingness of the messed up anchor points you could band an arm in the wrong place by moving its anchor points to influence the mind by influencing the body is only possible by influencing the havingness of thetan you can only influence thetan in this way tc the degree that it influences abundances and scarcities of bodies if you keep on taking things away from people theyll eventually die of loss of havingness the being lives in universe which is another monitoring influence on the mind and body not necessarily on the being when an incident happens to persons body he makes picture of it and uses it when similar situation occurs he also uses it when he has scarcity of incidents the thetans ability doesnt change 19 only his willingness to live increases or decreases in direct ratio to the scarcity or abundance of things in which they are interested these scarcities and abundances influence them and their culture the cure for it is to put the individual in communication with the isness of situation or object and let him reacquaint himself with that he is then able to conceive himself able to experience new experiences viewing something directly etc and so his life can be righted we can adjust persons havingness his ability to conceive of an isness and communicate with it by adjusting the number or scarcity of

since other know is total it is hard to describe scientology since there is other datum of comparable magnitude only one other organization of knowledge on earth has had similar goal buddhism it squirreled when it went into tibet as lamaism but there was faith in buddhism it was analytical the best refuge to take when asked what scientology is would be refuge into incomprehensibility by saying that it is epistemology buddhism and scientology both try to select out the importances of life and fill mans void of knowledge with accurate observation buddha could be called the first scientist authority has nothing to do with knowledge those things i tell you are true are not true because i tell you they are true and if anything i tell you or have ever told you is discovered to differ from the individual observation be it good observation then it isnt true we have certain positive procedures as valuable as they are if they incline us to lock at them not at what they help us to look at if they lead us to believe that they are thing not means to doing another thing we will be in the same blind condition as presentday religions and social sciences and we will have to rediscover our blindness on the way up wherever we develop an area of special knowledge such as trs and processes we must understand that they are means to an end not an end in themselves someone who forgot what trs were could in theory do them all beautifully but be unable to use them in session because he had forgotten what they were for to create the proper communication atmosphere for the session there is an enormous wonderland below blindness this keeps people from seeing their blindness using alice in wonderland in trs is joke based on this imagined knowledge the wonderland is the dispersal that results from the individuals reaction to being kicked in the teeth when he looks at something he wont look again eventually he decides not to look at anything but if he catches sight of something he will go on via and look at something else instead this is how the wonderland of the social sciences was created someone couldnt confront man so he turned around and created myth about man he must have been blind never to have noticed exteriorization or to have recorded the existence of the phenomenon somewhere thetan has the ability to create form to create universes when the ability dims out when he is not doing it very intelligently he begins to see things in the universe that he doesnt want to look at then he disperses and combines his ability to create and to notis the universe he then builds is below the level of the universe he is in you have to bring him up north for him to discover that he is in trap 20 l ron hubbard type 2 idate17757 volnum0 issue3 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 18acc3 theory and definitions of auditing 5707c17 18acc3 theory and definitions of auditing the pc is less than or equal to the bank and the auditor is less than or equal to the bank but the pc auditor is greater than the bank person cannot audit himself because the basic ingredient of all auditing is communication and person cannot really talk to himself especially in pt because talking to oneself puts half the cycle out of pt someone could mock up circuit that talks back or assume valence that feeds the past back to him where he thinks something is feeding him an effect from the past or talking to him when person selfaudits he uses these circuits to feed stuff back to him it gets him nowhere the best he could do would be to handle mental image picture which was seeking to handle him or to handle the environment the only things in the bank that give the pc trouble are the moments he didnt handle the worst moments when he gets pictures of these moments he tends to go out of control and backs off or boils off an auditor would acknowledge get him to confront it only communication got him into his mess only communication can get him out therefore there has to be another terminal for him to communicate to in 1952 we got scientology different approach to the problem of the bank instead of erasing the bank we put the person himself in good enough condition so that he can handle anything thats real clear not someone with blank bank the things that are right with person are the things that are wrong with the person what is wrong with being is what the being can do and what the being is any scale in scientology could be drawn as vactually as flare exponential perhaps figure 3 the flare in scientology scales 400 graphics inserted logarithmic flare 00 distance tolerance is the key to the affinity scales distance narrows as person gets into worse condition he has to ba closer and closer to things to know they are real high on the scale tremendous distances can be tolerated here there is also lots of trust at the bottom distance is tolerable persons ability to handle things depends on his ability to handle distance he interiorizes into those things that he cant trust until he is the thing he distrusts person can control at distance with comm as control diminishes he loses reach cant project intention cant trust etc tone goes down with competence going down auditing is an expansion of distance pc starts with inverted distance trying to escape or with close distance solid comm line as in cch1 however running away from things tends to make them stay with them body of soldiers running away from the enemy goes to pieces they dont reform regroup cant sustain discipline when you run away part of you stays there also when running away or being unable to tolerate proximity being has concept of distance theres place to hide anyhow the part that stay there is the mip if 21 one cant occupy some part of the universe the only recourse is dispersal which closes actual distance the thetan never gives up running what part of that incident could you confront loosens it up unsticks the person from it people never have trouble with situations they have confronted only with those from which they ran away this is an example of that which you resist you become the subzero tone scale shows the distance going inverted as one tries to run one thing establishes distance communication but it has to be real communication not inval and eval it has to be to the person space is viewpoint of dimension ie lookingness ie communication communication can have closure factor if it is just looking but two thetans in real two way communication can hold their distance and go upscale if you find that when two people talk the longer they talk the closer they get smashed together then one of them isnt communicating when people dont know what something is they have trouble communicating with it when someone tries to communicate with the bank it kicks back and thus gives the thetan the idea that he is punished for communicating but his facsimiles arent real in dianetics we thought person somehow took and stored all these pictures but there is not really mechanism like the file clerk of taking and storing these pictures the object is still there grown thin thats picture every consecutive moment of the universe from its beginning until now is potentially as solid as it was then the only reason it isnt as solid is that you dont to confront it so you thinned it down the only serious reactive pictures are the thinnies one made before or as one way from something unconfrontable this sounds complex but its only problem in change of space you dont carry the pictures you left viewpoint there when you didnt totally confront something and it is still looking all you need to do is to get someone to be willing to confront old universes he wouldnt confront before and you will have clear summary auditing is to raise the ability of another person so that he can handle the bank the body others etc it is communication process l ron hubbard type 2 idate22159 volnum0 issue1 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 21acc1 how process works 5901c22 21acc1 how process works the auditor has to find out what the pc did with the auditing command and what he did when he executed the command in the absence of communication nothing ever happens which is why people who are out the bottom dont communicate hoping to be safe this doesnt work if you are trying to do other things you must get the process communicated across to the pc and you must get the pc to communicate the first thing to know about pictures is that anything the pc is looking at is picture bank doesnt do anything except be there and whatever strange thing is happening in the bank is picture of whatever strange thing is happening in the bank thats all you have to know to unocclude an occluded case black fives look sane sometimes because they havent got anything to dramatize except looking at blackness not that they wouldnt dramatize if they were looking at something else when pc is stuck in too heavy picture it is impossible to turn on other pictures on the track the basic process for occlusion is come up to present time if that doesnt work there are seven other processes 22 1 there are several things person can do with pictures he may use notisness to make them disappear as soon as they show up other obsessive doingnesses can be used to get rid of ones pictures solution to pictures this case can be approached using ow selected people because if hes notising pictures hes notising people too in so doing he finds himself surrounded by ghosts first run what have you done to withheld from _______ using the person youve selected 2 then run general ow to catch some more of the automaticity of this outflow 3 arc break straightwire is used to knock out the cause of notisness all locks on the rock are arc breaks 4 next we would use notis straightwire recall time you thought something was unimportant recall time someone else thought something was important if you run it reversewise it takes away the pcs havingness and spins him in this works on notising others importances ie it asises times he did this 5 factual havingness also called third rail the vanish command of this this also handles notisness 6 what can you confront this because at this stage the person doesnt wipe something out before he looks at it 7 you make mockup for which you can be totally responsible this is top of the line process any of these processes turn on pictures these processes plus cchs handle all occluded cases l ron hubbard type 2 idate261159 volnum0 issue27 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0

principles of dianetics as expounded in 1938 foreshadowing of the 1952 principle of dichotomies is in the 1950 treatment of survivesuccumb as far as the thetan is concerned surviving is bound up with confronting in that if something is surviving he can confront it if it doesnt survive he cant confront it and sometimes something survives too damn well and he sits there confronting it for thousands of years saying i am black case youre right in the middle of the cycle of action the dynamic principle of existence of scientology is create this is the common denominator of all thetans even if they dont know it create countercreation destruction survive is continuous confronting your license to survive is license to confront you have the right to look at the environment in which you are and if you dont survive you dont have the right and if someone destroys your possessions so you cant confront them so theyre not surviving so you feel youre not surviving the word survive cant be translated smoothly into several languages suicidal races like the russians and the japanese have such languages they do confront however confronting is the action survive is the state of mind so confront gives an action process you can run confront on small children as what would you like to look at its better to run the action kids are always trying to make people confront things showing you things you can run the process nonverbally just point questioningly this lets you out of the symbol band nicely the communication process kicks in axiom 10 it vividly takes in cause and effect its best to run an assist with from where could you communicate to _______ if mass is present in the room that helps his havingness if hes too injured you could 23 have him look at confront the injured part using touch assist you could also run what body part could you confront would you dislike confronting you could also use from where could you confront _______ confront not confront reach withdraw make comm lines break comm lines the confront process produces different engram chain than the communication process communication intends to produce an effect confront lets anything happen to finish off persons victim button use what victim could you confront would you rather not confront use rather not instead of dislike because for instance the phrase dislike confronting could implant the person with dislike of confronting you could also use what part of victim could you confront for furthersouth case these victim processes tend to put person continually in winning valence it may throw him out of his normal valence if he is stuck aberratedly in losing valence but then it eases him back into his own valence what could you confront runs the pc into valence probably the lowest level thinkingness process there is is recall communication or recall communicating on psychotic it is best to mimic his orderly actions only not his disorderly ones anyone who can successfully do thinkingness process is not psychotic if person can at least be responsible for himself and his own environment he is not crazy these people are out of the realm of psychiatry normal people are not sane on all dynamics and cannot be trusted with all of them the idea of total responsibility as expounded in advanced procedures and axioms was not and is not popular one although it formed the basis of many axioms the idea of being irresponsible as in book 1 where people were all victims was what was popular person who is not responsible on dynamic has choice but to be victim on that dynamic absolute irresponsibility and absolute insanity could be defined as inability to take responsibility on any dynamic such person would be victim on all dynamics survive succumb willing to look at not willing to look at it you had someone who was willing to look at anything on all the dynamics who could escape from looking at them if he didnt want to youd have sane man it would have nothing to do with whether he was intelligent about it hes helping to put the dynamics there so he has some control over them since he is willing to look he would be intelligent about them as well intelligence is nonrestimulated stupidity one can restimulate notknowingness by educating kids to only look at things and never to take their attention off them thus you get mystery restimulated its an unbalanced thing it makes them wonder and go into mystery for instance keep your shirt clean repeated at him is the same as confront your shirt so as to prevent something this locks him into confronting his shirt fixed and unfixed attention as mentioned in elizabeth new jersey can be run with what would you like to confront rather not confront this is not as good as what could you confront etc so the fundamentals of dianetics and scientology do not change the only thing that changes is relative importances people believe they are obsessively separate so they believe that if they ran this out they would be obsessively the same person and wed get obsessive togetherness as in communism 24 but actually obsessive togetherness comes about from terror of the separateness that comes about from committing overts and becoming more and more individuated person becomes more and more individuated until he finds himself doing flip and getting drawn into mass which for him doesnt exist so you get back and forth movements between these two points thus obsessive individuation and obsessive togetherness are much the same thing the world is in these conditions so much that its become almost impossible to prove that everyone is separate individual this is scientologys unsolved question is everyone separate or all one we suspect that people are separate but theres proof experimental

washington university he conducted tests and found that poetry gives the same wavelengths in all languages he went to the psychology department with this discovery got rebuffed and found that none of them understood the mind he calculated that there cannot be enough bits of information carried on the protein molecules in the brain to store all the memories that men have in austria this got published as this is how man remembers lrh was well known at the explorers club for his ethnological studies in 1938 he got to survival as the common denominator to all races and possibly all life at this point in his studies he met commissar golinski from amtorg diplomatic trade channel with russia he offered lrh job in pavlovs lab 200000 plus expenses for research etc lrh refused about two years later they broke into my quarters or some unknown people did and stole the original manuscripts i have flimsy copy of the research but its not complete in 1946 and 1947 lrh did the research that culminated in dmsmh at this time highranking naval officer offered him job with the office of naval research he was to find ways to use his knowledge of the mind to make people more suggestible when he was refused he was threatened with being pulled back into military service he figured out way to resign from the service this was the end of beautiful friendship with the american government they didnt make up their minds that we were men until lrh said any government is interested in how the mind works but against anyone that knows more about it than they do this has left us the only free

scientology has succeeded in bringing the predictability of the natural sciences into the humanities practically every natural scientist before lrh has attempted this but none has succeeded before now there are 20 separate items in scientology and dianetics that are as solid as one of these test tubes this has nothing to do with ivory tower figure figure scientology is practical subject that has nothing to do with anyones beliefs 25 policing of behavior is the rule today it is based on what one knows about people become slaves to their ignorance of right and wrong in such time one needs practical wisdom whole countries have gone by the boards because their wisdom wasnt practical for instance india and china their wisdom always went with poverty and degradation peoples woes difficulties and failures stem from their ignorance their darkness about the mind they had knowledge of the rules the world needs practical science the parts of which are clearly visible having this one can see into mens hearts know them and live one of the twenty things is the brain it is shock absorber which prevents electronic currents from injuring the beingness of the person it has less to do with controlling motor actions than commonly believed people with brain damage have had function restored with dianetics another of the things is the human nervous system the nervous system also serves for warning control and arrest of pain or absorbtion of pain another couple of things are the human body and the physical universe also lock secondary and engram real things another thing is the overtmotivator sequence it is very loworder sequence this falls out when person ceases to be reactive because it is based on and is q and with newtons law of interaction second law of motion it is more serious than if you do something to joe he will do something to you it is used by people who are into big q and with mest it justifies stockpiling abombs etc theres more to the overtmotivator sequence than newtons law if joe hits bill he will believe he should be or has been hit by bill and gets somatic to prove it so if someone does an overt he will get or believe he has already gotten the motivator the scales and cycles of dianetics and scientology are things not figurefigure theres the cycle of action create survive and destroy in its most crude form it is an apparency but

fundamentals of auditing joburg the fundamentals of auditing are designed to handle fixations and changes of attention attention is fixated or in constant state of flux to the degree that person is creating and countercreating thats what thetans attention gets fixed on the creates or the countercreates all other things ruds havingness processes etc fall into line on that understanding the case is fixed on or fluctuating amongst the masses and energies it has created the things that put them out of existence or make them unreal are of course created by the case the person is at war with himself thats why an attack process works its countercreate most cases especially downscale are more dedicated to countercreation than creation the case is in state of unreality about the fact that hes doing it mocking up things on which he is then fixing his attention sometimes person may know hes doing it or not doing it but often thetans dont know that they are creating what they are fighting so you could have level of processing of doingness on creating eg what wouldnt you mind creating would you rather not create 26 were dealing strongly with havingness these days with success the axiom of aberration is all doingness harms self doingness processes address this fact you could ask what liability would there be to doing something or what could you do which wouldnt be harmful to you this could fall flat because the person is doing so many more complicated things that he has to come up to these basics this process is too high for most cases beingness processes are relatively easy to run you could run an engram with what in that incident would you be willing to be the pc must have the ability to be something before this would be workable process some people cant be anything so you have to test for this with look around here and find something you could be you could develop the whole rationale of processing at the level of beingness or doingness or havingness though they must eventually merge all three are needed if pc doesnt move just with elementary rudiments ta change of case its probable that the pc is withholding some big recent overt or the pc may have some unusual or secret goal not imparted to the auditor or the trouble may be big ptp so in going over case on the basis of rudiments one takes it easy until one finds out that the havingness scale as you have been taught to use it doesnt move the ta why ask for trouble before youve got it you go over the ruds pretty well wild drops go on in search of the prehav level find where the pc lives get one of his principal goals aligned convert it into terminal which drops as well as the goal dropped assess the prehav scale with that terminal then run anything that fits that level the commands are what was _______ for positive and what _______ failed for negative for terminal its eg what terminal was _______ and what terminal failed to _______ or what terminal was not these are the allbracket commands they could be repeated for each level you could run 15 brackets against the prehav scale when has terminalactionterminal there are possibilities of 32way brackets but fiveway is enough more details on prehav running if pc isnt interested in the process the ruds are out as its an interesting process so beat the ruds to death if you cant solve it with ruds run cchs the pc needs this when he cant control attention and your command isnt reaching him noeffect case on whom command has anything to do with him etc totally on automatic etc so use cchs to give them an example that control and duplication can exist and to increase their alertness havingness and effectiveness ten to twentyfive hours of cchs must be done with good auditor control and presence if the auditor cant impinge on the pc however and has auditor presence even cchs wont work since they depend on impingement lrh impinges more than most auditors because of his certainty that something will happen and his not being scared to confront the pc to lrh its personal affront if the pc isnt moving he can even get bad research results because even when using process that shouldnt work his postulate that the case should change and his wanting to do something for the pc will cause the process to work so he depends on hgc results etc to test processes just asking the pc questions can do tremendous amount for the pc dont underestimate what auditor presence confidence and interest can do 27 cchs depend on auditor presence more than any other process maybe 6 percent wont get gains because of needing cchs the rest have ruds out if they dont win on goals and prehav more data on goals and prehav running the havingness processes are arranged in order of their frequency of effectiveness command that works on cases that have relatively uncontrolled banks and cant run engrams is where is _______ frequently person with low havingness is in universe of objects that are mad at him etc as you run what is the emotion of that object the object goes downscale and the pc cuts in across the bottom and goes upscale when hes upscale about the object the process is flat this havingness process can change when emotion disappears out of the physical universe to what is the condition of that object if the havingness process stops loosening the needle first check to see if there is an arcb about the command and then if not find new havingness process other processes are tr10 notice that indicated object what arent you putting into it good outside process is what is the condition of that person when you get rise on can squeeze the pc may have heavy withholds maybe inverted interest and wont liecheck perhaps the havingness test would be how much less does the needle rise in this case if the case arcbs all the time you can run who would i have to be to audit you the prehav scale running runs subjective havingness the hav processes run objective havingness the objective havingness determines his havingness of the physical universe the prehav scale determines his havingness of the subjective universe you only run enough objective havingness to keep the pc in pt and loosen his needle end of preshsbc tapes

reassess the list until only one goal continues to read now list all the terminals for the goal all the terminals which would represent that goal until the meter goes flat null the list until only one terminal reads falls on the meter sop goals is the entirety of data needed to clear all cases this is unlike the situation earlier when lrh would develop regimen to handle one pcs case then develop the theory which matched it sometimes this was picked up by others and whole school of therapy was based on it for instance the dianetic tech used to handle one individual altman later became gestalt therapy the emeter is tension machine the more tense the individual the more offbeat is the read clearing is taking the tension off the meter at the lowest level of tension theres point in doing anything about anything youve got dead thetan totally incapable of influencing the machine he reads as clear but this kind of case can still be detected because the needle is tense it doesnt react favorably at all the person cannot answer to his satisfaction or yours any questions about help the needle also shows reaction to anything even kick the sensitivity has to be way up to get third of dial drop on can squeeze the guy can be machinemotivated feels he had bad luck doesnt believe anything can be done so he can get help etc hes very obvious cant do case doingness is the common denominator of the prehav scale someone who cant do isnt even on the scale the best case detector is the sensitivity knob not the ta or needle the worst case is where person is super tense but doesnt know it this guy would be long job to sec check rock slam is stronger indication than fall it shows that you are on the chain of the first time the person ever decided to be another valence the theta bop is diagnostic it has to do with leaving and death the thetan moving in and out like yoyo it can be dial wide or small it can be repetitive or even at an extreme one cycle this is not very useful returning will also give you theta bop the rise means the pc isnt confronting we used to be concerned about what stopped the rise which was what was producing it or rather the pcs nonconfront of that thing caused it stage four needle is an indicator of total noeffect case it can be very tiny it always has stick at the top of the rise unlike the theta bop the bottom of it is very relaxed it just means lousy case shape sometimes you see the needle vibrate this means that the pc has an alternating current ridge 45 means crowd if hes stuck there hes afraid of people or stuck with people stuck at 25 means robot machine theres seven on the ta dial that cant be read on the meter as person develops responsibility say hes dead thetan at 20 hell go down to 15 then go out the bottom through 7 to 65 5 4 etc to in range 29 pc can have consistent pattern he can even repeat the same fall in this case change of characteristic is diagnostic when the pc has charged question in his level of reality you get change of pattern the meter that would be used above clear would be an oscilloscope meter an ometer or theta meter which registers flows this is not comfortable to audit with the meter has to be very sensitive someone could be clear and still have bugs because hes still using body the emeter measures the games condition called the physical universe you need something which shades the tiniest

in scientology are of course picking up fundamental which sits right in the middle of anyones case and you tend to blow off little confusion in trying to get ahold of it it would be easy to teach you to run diesel engine but the data were teaching goes straight into the middle of reactive computation sop goals does this exact thing exactly reversing how the mind got aberrated the most hidden factors of mind were the things that aberrated mind because ones ever freed mind before so they must have been the most concealed or they would have asised sop goals undoes all the things that plowed someone in it consists of all the solutions person adopted to fix all the oddball circumstances he got into ever that longer apply who wouldnt want to have the kind of mind that could be happy doing something simple basically what youre afraid of is getting bored this happens because what you are doing is somehow inadequate to the demands of the environment if ones simple game gets invalidated one looks for more complicated one this could only happen if one had invalidated someone else already to get kicked in the butt you must have kicked someone in the butt and postulated that its bad to get kicked in the butt if the way to do perfect assessment were put on paper theres high probability that it wouldnt be followed because were dealing with the basic stuff of which the reactive mind is composed and on this subject more than any other youll find more confusion more silly questions the datum restimulates the whole confounded bank what happens is that the guy does something which eventually recoils on him in way which gives him new problem he gets his motivator and gets new beingness to have new game but hes now not being himself hes being solution to the problem of livingness the solution eventually ends him up with new problem which he solves with some new beingness some new game every time he gets overwhelmed in some game he shifts beingness to the new game which solves the old one if you clear someone without clearing up his bedohave condition hell realize he has game and hell recreate his old condition or be bored or worried hell go unclear he thinks its less dangerous to be aberrated than to have game if you clear erase his games conditions across the boards hell do this the essence of all games is beingness and doingness towards havingness the problem is that they get jammed into cant have must have situation in games condition the person has to be something but he cant be it there is something wrong with being 30 what he is being so he cant be it and he dare not be it and yet he must be it and this emerges when you are auditing sop goals game or goal is abandoned because it was invalidated too many times guy goes into new game and valence and ends up not being himself in assessment you are backtracking these valences expressed as goals since by this time the pcs comm with the world is very poor you have to handle whats real to the pc so thats what you handle whats odd is that theres only one valence thats real to the pc at one time in life as the valence goes up the pc comes down this ends up with serene valence and the pc out the bottom so the individual goes around acting psychotic in serene valence this is the theetie weetie case as you audit the person the valence comes down and the pc starts taking over handling the game and the environment on his own determinism as the pc gets out of fixed games he can look around and find hes got more games if hes got more games hell go more clear if less hell go unclear the act of finishing off clearing doing more and more sop goals is what stabilizes the clear having to play the game is what prevents one from playing the game one can play the game as long as one doesnt have to details on running of sop goals any goal which is to put up mockup is liable to be false one and is dangerous one to audit it is perishable because the result of failure is to create mockup so that you get into an arts goal always be suspicious of an arts goal because theres always the thing you can do when all else fails and thats usually the arts when actual masses dont work to overwhelm the opposition they turn to aesthetic masses which are closer to the thought band if you go just little further with assessment the case will likely get into better goals channel you can ask what did you want to do before you went into the arts this also applies to professions in the thought band like philosophy and law featherweight goal denotes hell of failure just ahead of it l ron hubbard type 3

if you dont audit the hidden standard the pc will seem to progress in the session and then say he didnt make any of his goals for the session hell be putting via on every command answer to slant it

in space on mechanical level change is time time is temperature the hotter the faster this is discovery in physics it goes along with the discovery that the speed of light is not constant but depends on the velocity of emission and that zero is variable not an absolute zero time is change on mechanical level rate of change is measured by rate of change not by time but one pretends that it is measured by time if you find the right temperature you can speed time up or make something timeless for instance after the atomic bomb exploded nothing moved for twenty minutes not even the twenty minutes temperature alteration caused this there is zero there is nothing but nothing of what this is variable society at present doesnt know that it doesnt know this is dangerous scientology points this out to society which is painful to society the best approach to study is always to find out what you dont know and then to remedy the situation one should not start out study by finding out something new the gradient approach is 1 not knowing that one doesnt know 2 knowing one doesnt know but not knowing what one doesnt know 3 finding out what one doesnt know 4 remedying the situation the only thing wrong with ones case is the vast area of ones beingness that one doesnt know one doesnt know about things you do reactively produce the opposite result from what you intend gradient of states of case 1 release release is person who knows he wont get any worse he has low state of case but he is better than nonrelease since he knows he isnt there yet on meter he would give whole dial drop on lowsensitivity can squeeze and the ta would be fairly near clear read he would also have reality on scientology as way to improve the communication help and control buttons are in good shape he can asis certain things by inspection 2 stable release this is tested release he has adverse needle reactions on help communication or control life can still mess him up but he will come through better 3 mest clear this individual has an fn at sensitivity one and doesnt react to routine questions he reads at the clear read for his sex 4 stable clear this is mest clear who has run lots more sop goals where they start blowing by inspection for this individual engrams have persistence he can erase engrams or mock them up at will his healing rate is fantastic thinkingness can have an effect on the bank before clear but clear has more effect on the bank 32 in all case states up to clear thinkingness has varied effect on the bank the lower the case state the less effect ones thought has on the bank psycho is total effect of the bank and can produce effect on the bank then we go up to more and more effect of person on the bank up to bank memory trouble is withholdingness withholding from people results in withholding from self the pc lessens the overt and pushes it out of sight if you increase his responsibility he becomes aware of more overts the overts unlessen and one starts to feel bad for instance when you discover that you have been committing overts against the org that has been so nice to you this is what happens when you process person towards greater responsibility without pulling withholds the person will cave in again therefore you must pull these overts and withholds and get the charge off them as they become available this is the rationale behind interspersing sec checks with other auditing otherwise the pc becomes unwilling to make case gain and is likely to blow l ron hubbard type 3 idate1661 volnum1 issue5 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000

needs high sensitivity for third of dial drop you may not get much ta in the first three hours this can happen on sticky level at any time it is not flat or it wouldnt read in the first place so run the ta in then out if it is getting little ta and never did get much you are getting some ta and you want to continue to increase it the goal becomes less intense when you find the terminal this is because the goal is the significance that surrounds the terminal and the pcs attention has been yanked off the goal over to the terminal where it was fixed anyway so the goal after you have found the terminal will read less than the terminal theres nothing in the goal for his attention to be fixed on since the goal is just something he achieved reactively to solve problem given him by terminal that overwhelmed him the goal is the tag hanging out from the bank and can be used to get in there and handle the bank this phenomenon of tags was first noticed in 1949 with engrams for instance with boy who is always worried about red caps it turns out that red caps were in an engram about which he knows nothing goals work the same way the goal that wont null is the toughest one the one attached to the terminal that most overwhelmed the pc that he can still confront l ron hubbard type 3 idate2661 volnum1 issue6 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec6 flows prehav scale primary scale 6106c02 shspec6 flows prehav scale primary scale person that has flowed in one direction too long eg writer who has written too much shipping clerk who keeps shipping etc one day he will want to stop it is an electrical phenomenon people who are affected by gravity are affected to degree by newtons laws of motion action and reaction when thetan pushes particle out theres recoil effect the law really only applies 33 to masses of comparable magnitude the stuck flow occurs when one neglects the return flows one is in fact receiving one fails to asis it and creates ridge from the resistance if theres been too much inflow ridge may be formed from notised outpushes newtons second law is thus the reason for solidification of flows the facsimiles of back pushes are neglected therefore they stick the stuck flow is reacted to with unconsciousness which is dopeoff if you have someone run flow in one direction in mockup he can either get field in front of his face going black or an avalanche will be triggered where all the things come at him at once or reverse flow avalanche an avalanche of resistance an inversion flow too long in one direction produces reverse flow not just stuck flow this reverse flow is 1 not asised because not noticed 2 resisted then you get flow in the original direction but on an inversion on running ow we can only do this when the pc is below the ability to tolerate change ow is reach and withdraw but only from one terminal and it doesnt account for all the possible motions as long as the individual is below change ow only runs well on f2 see ow limited theory hcob 5jan61 ow is 100 effective below change but not effective above it cf the later order of the grades below the level of tolerating change the individuals inflow and outflow get locked up and change produces ridges on various flow lines therefore the person is individuated cant change his viewpoint resisting change he gets left on some individuated point of the bracket eg he has stuck outflow so he cant relate to people if he was so bad off as to be psycho hed maybe get upset with flow three and maybe get up to obsessive cause if one is fluid on change and doesnt resist it he wont resist the flows and therefore he wont create the ridge when he sets up newtons second law of motion he knows therell be consequence of every thing he does so he knows better than to cause or experience much the consequences of change is change when he cant stand change hell go into ow thats why running brackets is safety factor when ridge is set up it has to be taken apart on both sides alternately if person goes unconscious on running bracket it may be that one flow is overloaded or maybe he isnt really doing one leg of the bracket so you have to check and see about that by asking once on each leg did you answer that to your satisfaction the flow three on brackets is to handle his dispersal in connection with stuck flows the concept of god is interesting what kind of shape would you think god would be in if hed just been creating things and causing everything you could never reach him or say anything to him what kind of duress must he be under to propitiate to us

points in assessing 6106c07 shspec9 points in assessing the problem with communicating scientology is that there are agreedupon realities readymade in words if you give person one of these concepts and its name and definition he will recognize the truth of it but it will take awhile for him to really grasp it and he has to get the concept first this is almost like processing people read dmsmh and got an understanding that changed their physical condition but the ideas of dianetics and scientology havent been familiar to man so it takes awhile or it takes familiarity with them to grasp them you could teach someone the principles of scientology by teaching him the vocabulary youve got to get the ptp of long duration off the pcs case if he has one before you can go on with goals processing because the ptp ld is more real to the pc than anything else on his case his attention is fixed on it if the pc has his attention fixed on the hidden standard youve practically got computation right there it has to be gotten out of the way to get case gain it is always right on the goals chain or it wouldnt be ptp of long duration so when you get it out of the way youve got the case flying it has been mistake not to assess the hidden standard finding out who had it when and what this is presession 38 dianetic assist see hcob 23feb61 pt problem and goals or more certain method would be to run the hidden standard with terminals assessment by elimination whose might it be what might it be etc this line of questioning is interesting both to the pc and casewise because the hidden standard is the primary source of individuation for the pc it is what makes him different from everyone else it is the least well duplicated part of the bank so it will fire off as an automaticity because it is the area that is most out of communication and most out of control the pc could get lots of terminals from this the hidden standard is substitute for the case of the pc it is more real to him than any case or life difficulties the pc may have it is form of individuation the pc is the one with the earache this distinguishes him from others l ron hubbard type 3 idate8661 volnum1 issue10 rev0 rdate000

mind it is the reactive mind that we are interested in auditing the reactive mind is mind that acts without inspection on the basis of stimulus it puts into action solutions to problems it fancies must exist which may never have existed or which havent existed for billions of years put in any part of the problem and the reactive mind goes into forming the solution thetan is trying to survive who has necessity for trying to survive at all which is the first idiocy so the mind is trying to solve nonexistent problem then it addresses itself to the survival of form the perpetuation of an existing state which would take out all the mest in sensible state and garbleize it the reactive mind is the individuals accumulated goals for the survival of forms the reason it destroys is to get something to survive it creates to get form to survive the reactive mind is the part of the cycle of action that will never move because its keynote is survival of form so it is trying to make something survive that is already dead old bodies identities etc 36 you could remember it if you werent trying so hard to make it survive but because of the survival effort when you try to remember it

reactive mind has starvation for the other parts of his old games eg the opponents and it acts without inspection and very fast to get form to survive you cant take time for inspection this leads to such idiocies as people attacking their own planes or ships in war when theyd gotten used to attacking enemy ones the safe thing to do is not to inspect under battle conditions the jam of the time not taking time to inspect results in noinspection when you speed up things in the physical universe to too great degree on the false basis that you are prone to nonsurvival but in the interest of keeping something surviving youll run into the timeless reactivity of action without inspection so therefore what you are after is instant reads your auditing target is the reactive mind not the pc the only thing wrong with the pc is the reactive mind and there is inspection involved there so he cant see what is wrong with him if he could see it it wouldnt be wrong this is also why the reactive mind is more in control of the auditor than the pc the noinspection factor he cant think on the reactive subjects you can so if you take his instructions on what to do or handle youll always do the wrong things one of the pcs goals is to make his reactive mind survive so he wont let you near any part that should be audited it dictates to you that it must survive it throws you red herrings when you turn around and look when youre running from battle that youre losing you normally get speared therefore its very very bad to look at the things that are pursuing you so you mustnt so you had better prevent the auditor from looking at the things that are pursuing you there is another obscuring element withholdingness is the comm bridge between the pc and the reactive mind when withhold comes out of the reactive mind the pc will do what the reactive mind tells him to do which is to withhold it withholdingness is part and parcel of survival it is protection of forms from attacks and destruction its nonduplication too you withhold your form from duplicating the form of someone youve killed this sets the mechanics going for survival its actually prior to the actual idea of survival so the pc gets into withholding thought the withholding of form is superbasic to all sorts of other things eg individuating the pc also withholds his body from destruction when the pc gives up withhold hes conquered dictate of the reactive mind by being controlled by being the auditor rather than by his bank this is the mechanics by which he feels better when he gets the withholds off because withholds add up to keeping him separated from the human race he can always be counted upon to dramatize the withhold when it comes up on the meter theres first tick then fall as the pc spots it the secondary action is not to get the withhold off the pc but to keep the pc from dramatizing his reactive bank so we say what was that when withholding the pc is reactive he is dramatizing otherwise hes talking to you analytically or at the dictates of the reactive mind early in the case auditing the pc is like auditing the light bulb to fix the generators in the power plant the emeter helps you locate all the parts in the generator if the pc is left with withhold in session hell arc break half an hour later what youre trying to do is to keep the pc from being fooled about himself if you avoid the reactive mind youre just doing q and with the pc 37 l ron hubbard type 3 idate12661 volnum1 issue12 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec12 emeter actions errors in auditing 6106c12

you can audit what appears on the meter things that dont appear are beyond the pcs zone of responsibility getting new reads on sec checks is thus test of the pcs advance in responsibility if change there is some gross outness countering the auditing dont get trapped by all the little minor errors these gross efforts come from the impulse to make nothing out of something which goes back to productivity the effort to produce is one half of the dichotomy all strikes are on the other half the effort not to produce many people are dedicated to nonproduction nosurvival this comes about as reaction to stuck flow on must survive many operations would go better if just left alone todays planned balanced economies reminiscent of markab which specialized in this generally result in unbalanced messed up economics produce and nonproduce should be on the secondary prehav scale the goal could also be results here we are talking about continually recurring gross errors not just occasional errors anyone will do that dont attempt total perfection or youll never complete or accomplish anything people get so tense about doing it right that theyll never get anything done good exercise to cure perfectionism is to deliberately decide something is finished without the finishing touches when you can do perfect trs metering etc you can relax and just audit with anxiety communicating to the pc you must exude confidence in order to give people hope which is fundamental necessity to making someone well or better mainly it has to appear that you are trying to do something for the pc not that you are trying to be perfect using instant reads one gets at all the held down fives in the bank using latent reads one is handling all the pcs concerns about why the

ragged bottom in 1954 but didnt clear anyone the flows at least would stick it could produce rapid result for few minutes another rapid resultgetter is look around here and find something you could go out of arc with it makes him feel great for awhile then spins him you could find button for every cult theyre formed on monomania on single button and if you make reverse process on that button you could make that kind of person out of the pc you find what the button is that _______ would be monomanic about and run it as out of arc with stuck flow and the guy will become that _______ cf est processing this has been done on the whole track universities 38 do it for instance they tell engineering students that engineers arent wanted anymore then the student will try very hard to be good

seminar withholds you dont destroy records when you are pulling withholds and you dont agree with the pc to do this if you do it is as much as if you were telling him youll withhold for him and he wont get much gain the only liability to getting the pc to where he cant be influenced by the reactive mind is that in sense you are auditing him towards state of noeffect total serenity total noeffect the way the lamaist did it the individual must be able to experience to live it is possible to plough someone in on level and make them look good but not clear this is education by fixation see p 37 one should be able to do anything on the prehav scale repairing his ethics will eradicate his impulse to do hasty things and get action on rational basis as result of inspection not based on inhibition this is new thing on earth in human behavior theres nothing wrong in theory with native state processing as practiced in 1957 and 1958 knowingness deteriorating by postulate to notknow to must know to cant know forget to remember this processing was too simple and of too much generality to be functional an ot process tell an intention that failed tell an intention that succeeded would be onebutton clear process if that could be run since its axiom 10 factor 2 but its too simple to plumb the reactive mind with certain level of complexity is necessary to resolve cases the worse off person is or the clearer they are the more you need to run the secondary scale greater complexity how many buttons are there there are all the beingnesses ever all the doingnesses ever all the things anyone ever had or could have you cant force person to grasp reactively things which are analytically obvious because its reactive and nutty process must have some complexity to be effective at reactive level and some simplicity to make it easy to administer if one invalidates the basic agreements and identifications of the mest universe mest changes characteristics for instance if you stop agreeing that water runs downhill and challenge that itll go all gelatinous and globby security check is running all the notknow off the case that it has run on everyone and everything for god knows how long you are actually running the native state cycle of sequences not withholds at all overts consist of putting notknows into the third dynamic for instance someone robs store the storekeeper comes in and doesnt know who did it or when or when it might happen again also notknowing where the stuff is that was taken then the storekeeper runs the notknow on the police now the area 39 has notknow that accumulates in the society until people cant trust each other and cant produce and the society is aberrated someone feels better when he gets off the overt of creating ignorance eventually hell realize that this overt worried people thats another overt then eventually he cognites on the notknow overt and hell notice his memory improving his iq going up as he runs out overts of making people notknow or be stupid in other words sometimes case will recover totally by getting off one big overt auditors dont effectively run presession 37 what question shouldnt i ask you etc see hcob 15dec60 because they arent imaginative enough about all the evil in the world it also requires the auditor to create notknows about the pc it works better to give the auditor list of mean nasty vicious notknows someone might have run on the world this doesnt run notknow on the auditor this is the sec check different sec checks should be devised for different routines routine three cases need wholetrack lists otherwise their whole track memory will get occluded whole track memory depends on some kind of whole track sec check this also answers the question of why pcs feel better after giving up same withholds but not others and what is withhold its running dont know or cant know on self or others when the overt is on someone else it gives big resurge when it comes off messing up time by lying is different breed of cat its creating for one thing all of life is an invented episode writing fiction is done with the intention to amuse and inform the only notknow in it is to keep the reader from knowing the end before he gets there the only aberrating thing about it for the writer is that its creative effort which can wind someone up in the soup cf the effect on some people of step six if you tell lie to obscure your own guilt thats another notknow or false knowingness which eventually makes the person feel that all life is pretense cf the sociopath auditing then

theres mechanical side and thought side of boiloff one is prone to worry when the pc boils off but it is only matter of concern if the auditor ceases to audit because of it the mechanical definition of boiloff is stuck flow lot of stuck flows got parked on the track and when the pc hits them he boils off most of the time when the pc goes unconscious if you kept giving the auditing command the pc would keep on doing it at about the same speed or bit slower as when he was awake because the pc isnt really unconscious if he didnt hear you theres harm done it s not an implant situation he comes right through it the thought definition of boil off is that it is the accumulated notknow the pc has run on everybody unconsciousness is merely the intensification of notknowingness you could even run notknow in the course of being kind by not telling people that theyre upsetting or bugging people they will make enemies who eventually hit them surprising them because one told them they were messing people up immanuel kant introduced notknow into philosophy with his transcendentalism this killed philosophy until scientology came around the greek philosophies amounted to this if you couldnt lick them confuse them with entertainment and philosophy this outcreation with philosophy and entertainment was very effective means of conquest many philosophies have been mere dramatizations of prehav levels relying for their force on bank agreement by observing what people underline in books you can see that what people go for is what agrees with their banks 40 one gets into this frame of mind as result of thinking truth is merely subjective there is broad truth this is the philosophy of the only one solipsism also general semantics then theres dale carnegies 11ism which tries to communicate with an unreality they run notknow on people by being nice and the people sense it too where reality is not present notknow is substituted for it an unreality is created whenever you substitute an unknown for known communism does this well with the iron curtain or take someone who always says im fine when you ask how are you theyre substituting nonfact for an observable fact giving you an unreality that eventually makes then disappear curious phenomena will occur around someone who is doing this they eventually do disappear but if theres terrific notknow about someone he persists like mad for instance the monk dharma who lived 10000 years ago in india formed the basis for most indian religions but nothing is known about him or what he said the leastknown philosopher is someone whose name we dont even know hes influential in the background of laotse confucius and buddha he is held in place by the notknow this is dharma who is not even thought of now as person but as fate on personal level notknow shows up as boiloff an extreme manifestation is unconsciousness at lesser level its death notknow at its most extreme is when person cannot go unconscious we call that insanity death is state of beingness not an action unconsciousness is lower well below death one can get knocked off and go on knowing what is happening insanity is where person cannot notknow the fifteenth substitute for reality delusory state they worry about these things laying in wait for them theyre in state of combat with the unknowable this can go on the tone scale on level of notknow from serenity about the unknowable on down they may seem fairly sane at the top but they dont know what it is they dont know about and are looking for they get down to grief about not having found out what it is they dont know about the guy will also be utterly fixed on the track if you know what you are unhappy or bugged about you are not insane merely wondering the fact that you can wonder why demonstrates that you are not insane knowing this one wont be baffled about insanity for bafflement is just q and with notknowingness the reason one gets worried about the insane case is q and of trying to find out what the case doesnt know what he doesnt know is notknow if you can speculate about what you dont know you will be ok you can introduce some sanity into someone who is spinning by getting him to think of one person who doesnt think he is insane because you have introduced knowingness into his unknowingness or you could use one command look around here and find something which

on the questions do you think youll get any worse does scientology work for you how do you feel about help how do you feel about control every time you find something in the pc struggling for survival it isnt the pc because he cant do anything but survive its valence every valence fights for survival it can be such clever valence that it can fool the auditor the auditors code is there so the valence wont feel challenged so it wont kick back before you can jump it the pc gets most upset by the auditors failure to handle his case the valence says see the red herring if the auditor complies the pc will get unmanageable because hes lost confidence in the auditors control the auditor neednt apologize for positive certain control thats how to make valences lose and pcs win kindness

correctly phrased or asised this is why repetitive look at problem and rephrasing of it will cause resolution we have made recent discovery of magnitude weve known that coaudit teams tended to make less progress than hgc auditing but not why the answer is now known the first clue was the d of ps finding auditors ruds on pcs out even when the auditor found them in it turns out that the ruds werent out with the auditor 42 it was mutual ruds of the team that were out with others but not the team for instance the pair agree the pcs family are swine so it wont read on ruds but someone else who isnt in on the agreement will find the pcs out ruds the meter registers on disagreements one way to solve it is formula 13 failed help and ow on terminals alternated see hcob 1dec60 cleaning up

cchs are run is 1 2 3 4 over and over and over it is breach of the auditors code clause 13 to run process beyond the point where it is producing change or to stop running one which is producing change the words in the process have very little to do with the process theyre run with meat and motion they are all done by compulsion if necessary the pc never has an opportunity not to execute the command the consequences of letting pc out of doing the command are grave the cchs run out surgery shock etc as the pc dramatizes you should run the process flat which means the pc has the same aspect for twenty minutes matter what the aspect is and matter how nutty or unconscious as long as the pc is doing the command change means such things as somatics etc it may be necessary to run cchs for few hours before they bite you dont pay attention to what the pc says its what he does though if he communicates to you that something is happening thats change running cchs permissively will also screw up the pc you must apply control to get communication and communication to get control irresponsibility denies havingness so sec checks also raise havingness all ow running since it raises responsibility results in havingness prehav really means prevent havingness scale it consists of those things that prevent havingness this is gotten off in routine 2 see p 34 or hcob 5jun61 the fixed reactive buttons that prevent the pc from having things are gotten out of the road on routine 3 the pc gets out of the road all those unrealized goals each of which has been defeat hence denial of havingness so havingness is the end product of all this ow raises havingness because the individual individuates from things because he cant have them so he develops overts only on those things he cant have so when you get the overts off he can have if you could have the whole universe it gives you trouble its only the things you cant have that you have trouble with next time you have ptp see whats in it and what prevents you from having them individuation from the thing the dynamic the universe is what brings trouble because you get into an obsessive games condition which adds up to you cant have it and it cant have anything to do with you 43 the cchs knock out individuation from the physical beingness which has been caused from the pc to his body and apparently his body to him thats why they run out electric shocks etc and you have to let him take more responsibility or he wont improve his havingness you have to maintain control or youll show him the body cant be controlled so it can continue to overwhelm the pc also the pc will become practically unauditable misguided kindness is all that could let you allow the pc to control the session its actually vicious thing to do even if the pc is right in his advice dont follow it hell gain more from being run wrong but under your control than right under his own if youre going to err err on the side of control and toughness not sweetness and light its better to end the process wrongly on the auditors determinism than to end it rightly on the pcs if you let the pc take control youre very liable to get an arc break half hour later you may not notice that its because you lost control because of the lag but the way to handle it is to spot the point where you lost control and reassert it if the auditor is in control of the session auditing takes place if the auditor is not in control of the session reactivity takes place if you flinch from auditing its from those times when you didnt control the session and came under

people dont see objects theyve been looking at facsimiles of the objects when the facsimile asises the wall looks bright such people tend to have bad depth perception because they never see anything they are easily invalidated because the reason hes making and looking at facsimiles is that the physical universe isnt safe for him the auditor begins to be real as the pc sees that he can duplicate him so if the auditor indicates eg on cchs 3 or 4 you didnt do it the auditor ceases to be real and the pc will put pictures of him up instead overrunning the process tells the pc that he was wrong to think hed got it this makes auditing unsafe the purpose of the cchs is to make the auditor the physical universe and present time real to the pc to show him he can observe the auditor the room and pt his havingness on otherdeterminism is very low the cchs remedy it he sees somebody else exists and the universe is here you can run cchs wrong by making the pc aware that the auditor and the room are real but dangerous when running child take account of the childs shorter attention span if its biting run it at least an hour before youd expect it to flatten exteriorization as done in 19525 was unstable lrh found that before thetan could get along without body he had to be able to have body and people who exteriorize easily generally want nothing to do with one philosophies that strive for peace are covert operation towards making people succumb spots of sudden change of pace are spots which brake persons life theyve got upsets in them and advice to take it easy and from then on it goes wrong they were asked to confront motionlessness which is most difficult to do medicine and psychiatry gave drugs etc to make person be quiet unless person can confront motion hes dead he cant confront life cant work and will become criminal the natural consequence of adopting motionless philosophy is to get religion peaceful one if you enforce nomotion on 44 someone and make him think motion is bad hell get buddhistic road safety campaigns make sense because they emphasize going slowly less motion not keeping unsafe drivers off the roads or putting freight on trains the more you make population motionless the higher the crime rate tv corrupts the youth because it pins child motionless not because of the tv material the theory that people get seasick because of motion led lrh to think one should have pictures of very still scenes to counteract this he chose some thought about it and started to feel seasick he realized that whats needed is pictures of motion to accustom them to motion not motionlessness the cure for motion is motion not stillness philosophies of motion dont necessarily mean criminality eg space opera if you could keep it up with rest you might manage to be ok when you become incapable of handling the motion of life you can then start to experience pain the experience of pain comes about because of intolerance of motion you can run motion or nomotion to handle this situation predictable motion is better from the pcs viewpoint than unpredictable motion because with unpredictable motion he doesnt know what to confront when he gets the idea that its bad not to be able to confront everything at once he starts to butter all over the universe stick on the track etc also whenever person gets hit hard by life or as soon as he begins program to coerce people into working harder that person will obsessively start producing production follows defeat as in germany japan etc someone whos been defeated will produce more bank than someone whos doing well so in eradicating on the one hand persons intolerance of motion and on the other hand his failures or defeats you are causing his bank to disappear the first can be done by cchs the second by goals running everything becomes cure for past failures every goal is consequence of not having done we dont erase the bank the person gets accustomed to not needing one the person himself takes over the automaticities of beingness identities doingness creation and havingness most havingness is the result of defeat and the whole cure sequence where nearly everything in the universe is cure for past failures every goal also is the result of not having done so we get intolerance of motion feelings of defeat ability to have without having defeated anything if you can remedy those things for someone youve produced new being who is not the same as an old being whos never had the experience his knowingness of whats happened doesnt leave him but his knowledge of the consequences of what hes done lets him emerge as veteran of campaigns unscarred by his battles tough and capable that which strips all games from the universe would normally result in motionlessness but how about ending certain games for somebody who doesnt have the consequence of ending in motionlessness youve broadened the persons view of games he can play this gives him more games not less play is delusory motion about which youre not supposed to be serious so youre not supposed to asis it so person gets trapped in it because its not real play is dishonest doingness work is not serious activity person can work at sport and have fun as his job also if you dont just do what you are doing but put an i should be doing something else in youll stick in it if one just did what he did when he did it he wouldnt get stuck in it morality is nowimsupposedto which makes people not willing to do what theyre doing when they do wrong so they never asis their wrong acts so they continue to do them 45 its certainty then that one gets persistence of the things he doesnt want or tanglement of the things he does want then he wonders why he feels odd so auditing is straightening someone out so he has tolerance for motion and motionlessness and can have what he should have or not as the case might be as he wishes to do that you have to erase all the oddities of doingness all the pain and boredom of motion or nomotion the prehav scale disentangles all the doingnesses but if you make the pc intolerant of motion or be motionless when he cant or give him failures in auditing or dont make it duplicative so he cant have then you reverse the process goals are to large extent do something else or nowimsupposedto if the individual isnt doing anything he simply isnt doing anything there should be nowimsupposedto

with attacks on scientology scientology doesnt have an achilles heel so its in good position to defend itself people do get upset when confronted with new idea but new theories get accepted fairly quickly eg harvey on blood circulation socrates on the nature of man proponents of new theories dont necessarily get martyred the ones that do generally are getting motivators for their overts as tyrants also if one continually fails to advance an idea one may get suicidal and die for it eg christ and socrates lrh believes in making an idea effective not to fail at it and make everybody feel guilty because they kill you its not necessary to sacrifice oneself for new idea thats just way to protect old ideas man is great believer in nochange while he obsessively changes everything so new ideas are rejected scientology is over the top but it is still being fought because to the degree that one is right to that degree he is dangerous we threaten to upset lot of beliefs and customs its only safe for us to do it because we can undo what we do for instance we can run out bad auditing the reason there is question on sec checks about overts on lrh is that if one had lot of overts on ron and scientology one could acquire forceful overwhelming valence called scientology so this is the first time anyone has said try it and see in the early days people said we should go big on aesthetics lrh said you can always overwhelm thetan with aesthetics but its not desirable to overwhelm thetan if its true far you its true not because weve overwhelmed you were attacked because we have evil motives people get frantic because they cant figure out whats the ditch if you can make thetan commit overts against you or set him up where he can commit the overts and remove any possibility of running the overts you can overwhelm him and get him so stamped dawn with valence that he cant even wiggle in other words you set person up where he cant receive an overt from you you wont commit one and on the other hand you set him up where he can commit overts on you and cannot get them run out then youve done him in good and proper former efforts at this were entrapments it isnt really an effort towards total freedom either since it allows for games man becomes alarmed at the fact of there being this selfless philosophy that doesnt demand that one become subjugated and enslaved by it and that it doesnt say that the originator of it must be carried on an an imperishable valence that everyone should bow down to that alone is incomprehensible which alarms man and makes him think there must be some 46 when attacked all one needs to do is to take effective actions not get frantic just keep up effective pressure investigate loudly and dont feel rushed about it let it coast when people are in terror they make mistakes so let them make the mistakes for instance man called ettleman had been hired by the ama and the apa to attack scientology in this case which went on for three years when it finally came to trial his attorney didnt show so the case was dismissed all that can be zone to an organization or person is to harass them to the point where theyre too worried to do their job so keep the reaction to attack to the minimal effective actions dont waste time and keep the show on the road the more you worry about the attacks the more motion you waste and the less scientology you get done so all the enemy can do is to get negative gain by reducing your effect see if its your game before playing it nothing wastes as much time as the law because the law has overts against time if one anywhere fought scientology it would be as nothing unimportant think of all the philosophies that must have been developed in the past eleven years none of them have been fought sure sign that we have ignorance and aberration on the run is that there are attacks and fights the process is biting start worrying when there are more attacks also note that our comm lines

talking to the entities in body you could start talking to the pcs circuit but it hooks in harder and harder it hooks in on drop of havingness and you are making comm line talk across to his circuit youre validating the circuit and lowering the pcs havingness if the pc has problem and you try to run think of solution repetitively the pc caves in you are running off the core of an area of motion leaving the motion on automatic the pc is not confronting the actuality of the thing hes not confronting whats going on at all hes confronting solution to it that is hes trying to notis what it is and the problem mass moves in on him if you get him to spot the mass connected with the problem then describe the problem then spot the mass it moves further away if you get him to think of solutions the mass will move in problems of comparable magnitude will also move the problem out this occurs because of confront if the pc avoids it it moves in you can also move the mass out with havingness solution is stable nomotion datum amidst confusion 47 circuits can be used to get data to verify answers to calculations confirm if they are right or wrong or to give you tomorrows weather the latter takes the increment of time that is tomorrow and inspects it this is possible if you can look with equanimity at tomorrow at least its insignificant aspects you can predict to the degree that you can confront people who cant confront pt obsessively try to confront tomorrow or yesterday but its not real tomorrow and probably not real yesterday either the way you go nuts on circuits is to ask yourself who put that there or who else put that there and what does it mean this gives you mystery pcs who dont control their circuits and havent inspected them for many years or eons have things popping up all the time when you audit them some get auditing answers from their circuits the circuits were put up as substitute for confronting and are so old and forgotten that now nothing about them is confronted when the pc nears one of them it tells him what to do or say since circuit is just noconfront running havingness and confront improves circuits the pc may have originally put circuit there for convenience and then come to believe that it was unconfrontable because there was circuit there you could say to the pc were going to handle your primary aberration so make picture of it and look at it tell what you see youd get amazing answers the action of taking picture of it then looking is of course an alteris of confront in auditing you want people to look directly at things circuits encourage them not to because they think they cant confront something as you audit pc these things go live as havingness drops the pc gets anxious keys in circuits to predict or confront drops or as the pc improves and circuits can be activated as the pc comes up through them so everything goes on via auditing walks him up to less and less vias more and more confidence the reason confront isnt on the prehav scale is that it isnt doingness its an ability cf p 22 where confront is described as an action also cf p 40 where confront is defined as subjective havingness or or at least the process is defined as subjective havingness process that explains oddities you get running cchs youre activating and knocking out circuits because direct control and communication brings about continuous shift of circuitry in terms of havingness then since hes been gotten to pt confronting the auditor this brings his havingness up if you talked to those circuits they might well say anything which is also true of the pc on cchs so the less attention you day to what the pc is saying or thinking the better dope off and comm lag indicate things happening to the pcs confront and havingness circuits go haywire when they contain the postulate that the thetan is unable to confront apart from that they can be useful l ron hubbard type 3 idate28661 volnum1 issue22 rev0 rdate000

it takes two to three hours to get ruds in he wants to scrap model session for processing checks this 48 is an unusual solution people are now in the same position about auditing that ron was in when he started researching life theres been so much alteris and countercreate the truth is obscured naturally in relaying comm about the simplicities of life these things get restimulated and people start looking around corners when the cop is right on the sidewalk there is secret about life it is just surrounded by alteris and obfuscations people arent doing their jobs because they are so busy doing other things for instance government is so busy doing the work or charitable organizations that it has time to administer justice protect citizens from criminals etc in good government production rises people prosper welfare state government attacks producers with taxes its all off post everything is trying to make you wear its hat so in scientology the person who is on the ground observes parkhouse by not observing caused ron to interiorize into his hat the analytical mind isnt really computing machine it is the pc when he or the analytical mind is attacked by the auditor youll get auditing done your target in the reactive mind this is why lrh can do in 5 hours what it took other auditors 25 hours to do the difference isnt that lrh is good and others are lousy it is that the other auditors reactive minds were apparently choosing the pc as their randomity attacking the pc because he was aberrated the target is the reactive mind you sit down you take the emeter you say have you ever stolen anything what you really want is for him to recall ventilate air the reactive mind you shouldnt assume he already knows and purposely wont tell you when you do sec check because of the specific question he remembers it and will ordinarily tell you if you get heavy reads and he saysno have him keep looking let him know theres something there but maintain arc the proper attitude is you couldnt possibly remember this and not tell lets just get the show on the road when they look hunted use light touch to get them to tell you if youre suspicious and accusative youre cutting comm with the pc and encouraging him to withhold assume that if he remembers it hell tell it at once it puts him in session that way the meter check is just to make sure we got all of it its up to the auditor to create an atmosphere of communication you can use some dunnage to do it this approach gets the pc comfortable relaxed confident his knowingness comes up he gets relief after all you are the auditor not the emeter the guy gets to where he feels safe his anxieties come from feeling unsafe in life so your attitude alone can produce great change in the pc if youre using the meter and he says you dont assume he knows and wont tell you but that he hasnt overwhumped the reactive mind youre disappointed but you assume he can remember this builds his confidence and gets him in hopeful frame of mind doing it this way speeds it up enormously gives faster gains its not that hes getting more confident in you its that hes getting more confident in his ability to overwhump his bank you get far more off the case faster by this method youll slow it down by making sure he wont want to tell you and has to be trapped and beaten into telling you dont ever assume games condition in auditing this will also keep the rudiments in since ruds go out with rough auditing set yourself up as someone who can be confided in rather than as cop sniffing out the crime never assume games condition in

that makes problem so deadly in processing problem is postulatecounterpostulate an indecisional proposition because the two sides are in balance one can hardly confront the two data at once the pc doesnt see the amount of confusion on it and the confusion mounts up around each side of it thus you get two separate zones of confusion each side with its stable datum because each side has yes and about it so you dont asis the problem and it persists thats its most basic characteristic people get impatient with problems so they solve them but problem solved has been notised not asised the solution of problem is of course an overt against problem everything in the universe is cure for something else solution this is one reason the universe persists cures deteriorate and solutions become new problems alcohol century ago was curing things even diseases once cured something cf sickle cell disease the bacteria that caused disease once cured something take an organization that is hammer and tongs on the subject of creativeness the catholic church they have the hatchet out on the 2d they dont think creation should be done that can be prevented they oppose vd campaigns because they think vd is good thing as cure for sex if you get vd sex stops so if sex stops you get vd sex vd because vd sex prostitution is also nosex proposition so it gives nosex disease sex is cure for bodies and bodies is cure for sex you dont get pc whose idea is horses sleep in bed who wasnt curing something with that idea every aberration hes got was cure for something his motionlessness is cure for having killed so many people if you pick up withholds on killing he will be able to move again killing too was cure for something maybe for hating people hate in its turn was cure for associating with people whom you might damage and damaging people was cure for people being people etc an aberration is cure that doesnt cure that you dont understand this all goes back to confusions and stable data if you have two confusions and two stable data opposed to each other which you dont confront you get an endurance because you never asis the thing you solve it pcs who go through vias continually on an auditing command have some problem theyve never looked at as problem when you run problems of comparable magnitude youve taken the via of curing the problem off automatic and sneakily gotten the pc to take look at the problem certain conditions that are designed to cure other conditions actually create them eg snakes venom makes snake antipathetic and snakes have venom because people and other animals dont like them the willingness to solve problems but not to asis them is the basis for q and people dont like getting the question fully duplicated as the answer this is because they are trying to solve some very fundamental confusion they have an effective method of teaching is to try to find the source of the question 50 if you try to cure confusion it continues duress and punishment are the results of despairing of solving someones problems jails and mental hospitals are the cure for confusions about people this seems awfully drastic but it is born out of despair the effect of jails is to merely educate criminals more into hating people there is way to make correct and frontal attack on these confusions they often stem from withholds so joburg will help you may note that pc may look bit confused as he tries to find the problem he was solving problem remember is multiple confusion there are two solutions or ideas involved each with its own confusion an encysted confusion so one tries to back off from it which only pulls the problem along this is why thinking of solution makes the problem mass move in you cant really escape your own ideas thought mass is basically composed of problems it endures because its not confronted given enough of this the pc will be overwhelmed and will dramatize being problem one which is insoluble so you keep worrying about the pc because the pc is problem pc who says he has had gain is saying im problem solve your chances of doing it are poor hes got two confusions and cant confront either pcs whose needles keep rising are notconfronting problem you ask how are you doing the pc says fine the needle rises you ask what happened the pc says nothing its discouraging they cant tell you what it is because they cant confront it cchs will saw through this but slowly slowgain case is heavy on comm lag or not quite on the subject when hes talking the comm lag stems from noconfront so does the alteris which is dissociation from the confusion you ask the pc if hes got problem he gets upset because he cant confront it and knows he cant and he wants to avoid it altogether phenomena observed in the field stem from problems on noconfront or inverted basis in fields of stress or duress religious cults make their finest harvest they offer an escape from problems the reason alcoholics anonymous doesnt cooperate with scientology is that they have for their very existence contrary datum alcoholism cant be cured you cant do anything about it so you might as well join aa matter where you go you can never get away from yourself if you try to pretend you are not where you are you get dispersal of location youll be buttered all aver the universe the guy who permeates everything without being anywhere is trying to escape his problems which all carry noconfront you put motion and action into thought process and they become inextricably tangled up inextricably that is short of scientology processing all this is prelude to very simple killer process for the pc for whom all life is problem the difficulty for the pc is series of ridged problems the ridges people have trouble with surrender on this one command which is horrendous to run because it moves very slowly at first and turns on fierce somatics recall problem you must be very careful to get the question answered on recall problem you should ask what problem was that and make sure he is not giving you generality instead of specific problem the pc will come up with some interesting solutions which will suddenly turn awful hell discover hes been both sides of various conflicts each side to solve losing on the other if the pc does locational on some object hes used to solve problem of boredom hell come uptone

problems and solutions 6107c04 shspec27x problems and solutions only lrh could get simplicity on auditing problems usually when one tries to look at them he just gets confused the only mistake psychiatry made about psychosis was to try to understand it since its basically incomprehensible thats its whale character then they have to use heroic measures which fail and leave them place to turn the common denominator of psychosis is problems of course when the problems cant be associated with the solutions any longer you get solutions to noproblems which is psychosis when psychosis has been objectively described theres missing datum what problems is this behavior solution to cf rd laing and j haley the lack of this datum makes the psychosis incomprehensible you cannot cure psychosis by addressing the psychosis or more generally you cant cure an aberration by addressing the aberration this is because in so doing you are running the still in the middle of the motion the stable datum in the middle of the confusion the solution youre trying to cure the solution and not looking at the confusion you are looking at the cure which wont move out unless you get the motion off it the whirlpool wouldnt whirl without the motionless center but the center is motionless only because it has motion around it you should take the whirlpool off the motionless piece not the other way around here you have confusion and the stable datum motion and motion sound and silence absolute location and change if you try to get the motionless points out all you get is new motionless points all that is wrong with thetan is what is wrong at the lower and of the scale at the highest level thetan can be motionless at the lowest level he has to be its matter of determinism at the lower levels motionlessness is not determined by postulate but by the mechanics of motion if you want to see someone stiffen and go still stand fellow up shake your hands in front of his face produce lot of motion and say theres the motion at this point the fellow will sort of freeze as he becomes stable datum but this doesnt work well as demonstration because the observers will also all go still in sort of stupidity they wont confront the motion theyll put barrier up against it and become still so the motion will duplicate them and they will butter themselves all over the universe and become agitated auditing motionlessness just makes more motionlessness in the bank stillnesses identify more rapidly than motion in psychosis the person is being stillness the worst example of this is catatonia there cant be such thing as anaverage individual there can only be someone who is trying to be lot of other individuals and is therefore buttered all over the universe in terms of beingness hell be obsessively still the next step down is going round the bend the operations this universe uses to try to make one assume the average are so numerous that one accents then as normal insanity is the adoption of solution to the exclusion of all other solutions in the absence of problem if person confronts problems takes responsibility for them and goes into being solution all problems go on automatic they just go on all around him there can be million problems but theres only one solution him psychiatrist is being an obsessive solution also he never really cures anything he just persists with his ineffective solutions which just hold the problem in place he isnt aware that psychosis is problem hes handling people who are being obsessive solutions so he 52 becomes one too the psychiatrist is the societys solution just as his solution is shock treatment psychotics dont realize others have problems or that theyre being problems to others psychiatrys research has been search for solutions but they hate solutions and they dont recognize the problem man has made the mistake all along the track of not realizing that if theres solution there must have been problem look at the ten commandments actually theres 162 pages of them these are moral codes and moral codes are series of solutions to problems which are neither confronted nor analyzed almost all the bibles commandments are prompted by the obsessive crimes of the time several are solutions to vd that was problem that descended on them that they knew nothing about so they looked for solutions they already had various areas of nosex they had already prevented true ethicality by inventing immorality with bunch of new morals lot of religions also encourage facing motionlessness eg by getting you to turn inward contemplate the stillness within meditate face mecca etc this is the basic operation of the track i believe its perfectly all right to do anything you want to to people as long as you dont say its something else or try to convince people youre doing something else as long as other people are not completely ploughed under by it the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics gives lot of lattitude the main crime is the entering in of notknow thats the only real evil there is when person reaches stage of being an obsessive solution with total notknow on what hes being solution to or when one is to being terribly still he doesnt know what motion hes being still to counteract obsessive stillness enters the bug factor here is the notknow in all this where you have someone solving problems you dont have an evil its ok to solve problems but an individual who has put all problems on automatic cant solve problems except with some fantastic liability of cavein terror stomach etc he doesnt dare solve problem there are gradients of this there are people who can salve minor problem but not major one theyll try to protect you from problem by preventing you from solving problem by feeding you extraneous data this is not to confuse you its to protect you eg the pedant who doesnt want to make mistake and doesnt want you to make mistake either when you see someone sitting in the middle of catastrophe one of two things is happening either the stuff is avalanching in faster than he can cope with it but hes trying to cope or he doesnt even know its catastrophe he doesnt even see all the papers all over the floor and the account book being used far doormat thats the condition of the thetan sitting in his bank he feels hes got it all straight and the trouble is all over there since you cant see the clutter you say well hes behaving oddly but thats not the situation hes confronting noly it is all notised when you run something in an orderly fashion you will at once get something done in the first place youre giving the pc an orderliness to confront and he finds out theres some motion that can be confronted where you have individuals who are totally insane you have confront of problems so routine 1a wont work it doesnt go as far south as the cchs but it works on most people including the guy who thinks hes is such good shape that he doesnt need any auditing if you run problems on him hell go hm ridges where did this come from the bank starts going solid somatics turn on hell see there were some problems around their masses start showing up 53 this is the first time weve had good cure for this type of mass it bypasses the liability of curing it were enough on top of the mechanisms of existence to pull the overtmotivator sequence without falling athwart

may fall on question but it might not be the question you asked it might be protest or something else find what the meter did fall on and clean that up notice that when you run description processing on problem the problem keeps changing thats one reason we dont do any fancy problems process on rudiments we just keep the pc on the one he brought up otherwise we start to get into all this alteris change as level in the prehav scale was developed to cure alteris it turns out that this was stopgap what cures alteris is problems pcs who obsessively alteris will run problems like rocket since the solution is an alteris of the problem you can check every once in while with the pc how did you get that answer what are you doing on running problems you have to strongly do this you have to be sure he really did recall problem and didnt just get notion of foggy confusion you dont have to check every command just every few randomly you have to use tr4 if he repeats the command after you hes set up circuit so you repeat the command dont do it if the pc has had cognition since in that case it can seem invalidative let the pc stay in communication dont be robotic about using the repeat statement but stay in pt and dont put the command on circuit the acks are halfacks not full stops to the cycle and you can put little insistence on the command when you repeat it this keeps it from sounding like new command always get the command you asked answered you can ask him if he still has the command if hes commlagging and drifting use this rarely and sparingly since it does distract the pc thats the common denominator of pcs arc breaks with auditors sudden change of attention is associated in all minds with accidents pain etc so the auditor shifting the pcs attention suddenly makes the pc feel hit you should wait until he looks vaguely in your direction dont jump on him the meter action will also tell you if the pc is doing the command if it stops registering you can suspect hes lost the command the auditing command is what it is and doesnt have any understood additional agreements in it so if you say recall problem it doesnt include tell about it or dont tell about it and you cant make agreements with the pc that he should tell you and let it be understood for the rest of the process other arc breakers are the auditor giving you five commands without letting you answer any of them or the auditor saying nothing giving new command when the pc is waiting for it you cannot tell the pc how to do the command in addition to giving the command he must understand the command but to give advice on how to do it is evaluation also if the pc makes contract with the auditor for session length that can get tacitly into every command the pc will get stuck in the first command of the session if you start with some agreement that wasnt repeated the auditing track will bunch the only understanding you have with the pc is the command given at the moment given the auditors 54 control of the pc extends to one command at time the auditor does control the session and not with kindness or social niceties you can tell the pc youre answering things i havent asked you recall problem theres polite way of telling pc to shut up good solid nice acknowledgement as soon as the pc starts to diverge the mistake is not to control the pc but note that when youve announced yourself as control unit youd better stay one since the valence will immediately test you to see if you will if you chicken out youll get an arc broken pc arc breaks proceed from lack of control ie from lack of auditing what you can get away with is what impingement you can make on the pc but it must not be misemotional impingement or youll bolster up the valence the pc is dramatizing which is always misemotional entity under the surface youll cave the pc in so exert tone 40 control with arc theres difference between overwhelming the pc and controlling the pc if you dont shoot misemotion at the pc you can say anything to him its mistake to make any comment on anything the pc said or did even if the pc asks for evaluation its not up to the auditor to comment just to acknowledge the auditors opinion otherwise becomes stable datum to the pc and you are going to have to audit out the stable data you put in dont even imply by your acknowledgements that you agree youre not in or out of

the cure for step 6 phenomena or creative processing ill effects is six way confront bracket on the pictures and responsibility on pictures people who go solid on step 6 type processes have an automaticity where if they create anything everything theyve ever created gets created hence since the bank is an individual creation the bank beefs up if you use these remedies and you keep these things in mind it would be safe to do creative processing you can prove this by taking picture improving it then looking at picture b you will find that picture b has also improved if you improve the pcs ability to perceive you improve his ability to create and it is only because the pc is doing it all himself that you can clear him however if you improve the pcs ability to create without improving his ability to confront youve done him in art school does this same with technical schools if you make sure the school has only text diagrams and real objects being studied youll cave the students in everything he doesnt like about the subject will eventually come to the fore because you are running cant have on him its games condition you are fixing it so he cant have what hes being educated in the more theory on the mind you give someone unaccompanied by an ability or opportunity to confront the substance of minds thinkingness and the beingness of life the less reality they will have on it so youd do better to leave them alone in their present confusion all training must be accompanied by confronting particularly in the creative fields the cure for obsessive create is confront if the guy is creating his own aberrations it must be that the road out would be confront that would be the secret of clearing mind is an obsessive unknowing creation into which only few important factors enter create problems confront change responsibility notknow goals prevent the pc from looking at anything hes always 55 looking at tomorrow not looking at what hes looking at theres nothing wrong with having goals but what you are looking for is the obsessive goal of the case theres only one of these and it prevents the pc from looking at any part of that goals chain because the goal is so obsessive that it removes his attention from that chain to something that isnt yet in the chain when you find the terminal that represents that goal youll have found the terminal theyve never looked at or inspected but have been with an obsessive goal the pc isnt in pt hes down the future track at an imagined future point so of course he isnt confronting where he is one of the pcs goals leads to the person who most obsessively had that goal which is the valence the pc is in and of course this is the total noconfront of the bank all bunched up in that spot if you only looked at tomorrow and never observed the immediacy of the situation you would eventually have asised any future of it at all so it hangs in time 100 youve never asised any immediacy of the situation so it is all there on that chain and all the future of it is asised goals processing undoes this mechanism of noconfront you are taking off all the futures if you did goals processing crudely and peculiarly you could get the pc totally regressed so that only some back point of the track has any reality to him and present point does if you arc broke him didnt keep him moving on the track this could happen rightnowness of moments on the track those points are on the goals chain theyre moments where the pc wished to god he were somewhere else but he cant be somewhere else so all hes got left to escape to is future this solid scene hes looking at part of it is actually observed its total overwhelm and hes got future there future postulate so it stays on the track as solidity since he cant confront it hell hit these and bounce into the future this could happen quite early in sop goals running the more hes confronted elsewheres than the unwanted incident the more they have asised and the more hes fixed in the incident where he didnt want to be when you run creative processing these points come up easily because hes obsessively creating them all the time problem is the least confrontable thing there is being composed of unconfrontable confusions some pcs will run total irresponsibility on problems of any kind they will perceive connection between having trouble in life and not confronting problems in their lives this is the clue to slow clearing profiles dont change when ptps exist clue to cases is the magnitude of problem the pc comes up with it can drive kids buggy when their parents idea of what problem is is grossly different from theirs you may see someone sitting in the middle of disaster of dramatic or quiet sort who is worrying about the fact that the lady next door has bought new hat thats the level of problem which that person can confront and the things connected with the disaster are not problems in fact theyre not even there someone could say to this lady why dont you straighten all this out and shell think theyre nuts that theres nothing to look at or if there was something there there would be nothing you could do about it you could probably do sanity and ability test by making list of problems by dynamics prepared list in gradients of magnitude you could then have the test taker just check the problems in each dynamic what he checks would tell you

postulatecounterpostulate resulting in indecision any time you have fixed stable postulate it accumulates or came about because of confusion problem has at least two stable data the two opposed postulates each surrounded by confusion so at mesty level it looks like confusion counterconfusion situation war is one of these twenty years after world war ii traces of it persist as nato the common market etc as for the bank someone set up some idea that he should oppose to some other idea however the idea that he set up to oppose the other idea commits overts against the other idea in that it confuses the other idea then it in turn gets back confusion and the other idea attacks his idea so you wind up with two opposed confusions which then gather more confusion this then goes down the ages as one aspect of the reactive mind problems have duration thus the reactive mind has duration how many ways could you take problem apart as motion as looking at two things as getting confusions of comparable magnitude all without adding new solution solving problems without being stuck with new solution has never been done before psychoanalysis by contrast lays in new solution that produces new confusions then more solutions thus you get branches and schools of psychoanalysis if someone has to have solution he didnt confront and asis the problem solution is always noconfront confronting produces vanishment of the problem if you want something to persist just dont confront it this gets us back to the original mechanism of structure in this universe preventing solution of the problems of the universe to guarantee the persistence of the universe so anybody who solved problems with regard to the universe was persona non grata with anyone who was trying to get total persistence of the universe the problem is that it is impossible to create and at the same time to say that something will persist things created tend to asis so if we want things persisting around us if we cant create weve got to preserve what was created the way to preserve it is to get in this mechanism of noconfront and solutions that we are now trying to undo in the reactive mind this is the idea that anyone who solves problems is dead duck horrible things will happen to anyone who solves problems and everybody agrees 100 and everybody does it to everyone and you get physical universe fact that enters the mental field with reference to the above quote i think hubbard means by solve asis this is where structure and mind take their first divergence if you want shakily persisting universe to persist forevermore youve got to prevent solution asising of its mysteries youve got to prevent it from being confronted so you say anyone who tries to solve this thing is gonna get it this goes over into pcs trying to solve their problems from day to day the terrors of having solutions asisings then bring about all these other mechanisms 57 the universe poses lot of problems why is it here why does time go clicketyclick etc and person who could be tremendous mystery thought he could guarantee to himself tremendous persistence obviously the way to live was to be mysterious and if you confronted nothing youd live on and on so we developed whole genus of thetan who had decided not to solve anything because to solve something is dangerous if you just ask pc to solve something repetitively masses close in on him he dramatizes the cure of the impersistence of universes basically theres nothing wrong with solving asising problems but when youve got tremendous overts against people who were trying to solve problems of course it becomes impossible to solve problems the persistence of the reactive mind is q and aing with the physical universe so you find that most physical universe principles that affect the mind are in the area of problems gravity being trapped stillness etc the person gets threatened you solve asis problem and well put you in jail so the fellow has problem doesnt solve problem doesnt confront the problem doesnt create space between himself and the problem and of course he gets embedded in sort of black basalt of energy he solves the problem and jails himself he knows if you confront problem you get confused all this is protective mechanism resulting from an upperlevel creative failure the consequences of creating showed up with step six so after the universe was figured out on the basis of if you create one there are terrible consequences therefore its impossible to create another one so your havingness would be shot to pieces if you knocked out the one youve got because you couldnt create another one youve already had earlier on the track tremendous problems on the subject of creation it isnt enough to just create something and say thats it you have to agree its valuable and one can ever create another one like it etc you make something valuable by protecting it and by never being able to replace it these are all mechanisms of value by which people try to get you to lay off mest so everyone is convinced that creation carries penalties and that you have to protect creations against being asised and you get the problem sequence going we have legends against looking medusa pandora etc another threat would be you realize that if you solved the problem of time all time would cease actually if you could solve the problem of time the worst that would happen would be having to put it there for yourself again and mass without time probably wouldnt entrap anybody anyhow if you told the pc face solution repetitively hed get upset in the first place solutions are the easiest things thetan does and the easiest things to create and hed practically get his head knocked off with the confusion surrounding the solutions you didnt have him looking at the confusions only the solutions so the confusions just get more confused not confronting the confusions you have reason why any of the solutions ever occurred if we say look at the confusion they havent much inkling where to look whats communicable is the package of confusion solution which is the problem when he looks at problems he looks at future solutions too so it asises things bit youre not trying to get the fellow to solve or erase problems but to get him over his horror of problems and the piability of solving things youre trying to get him to recover from these things which were set up on the very earliest part of the track person who cant confront problems hasnt much judgment so this is the clue to judgment judgment can only take place in the presence of observation we can observe synthetically 58 when using mathematics or when mocking something up judgment is absent in person who cant confront problem the auditor who cannot confront the problems of the pc wont see them as problems wont handle them and the pc wont make progress so this resolves auditing too the more confrontingness person has the better his judgment an auditor with judgment is valuable auditor so we want to get someone familiar with problems we start with reach and withdraw on the mest he has problems with any number of processes will increase the pcs familiarity with problems people go off onto the collection of solutions for which problems exist eg decorative knot tying or botany then there are people who will have nothing to do with problems but are overwhelmed with problems most of these problems wouldnt seem like real problems to you just facts as he describes them eg tell problem ok the sidewalk as you enter the area of problems with pc youll find him in one of these two conditions if its problem hes never been able to handle 1 pc in an obsessive automaticity of solutions 2 pc totally immersed in the problem as fact hell never be in the center line of these are problems until he wakes up to it when you run problems on someone he first starts coming up with solutions then on gradient he starts to relate them to the facts which for him appear to be problems or he goes into the processing announcing facts not solutions so it doesnt seem to you the auditor that you are listening to problems its not that he hasnt told you the whole story the fact hes given you is to him problem it starts peeling back onionlike until you find eventually there was some problem it was involved in usually with an overt in it and he can see it all and it blows the way to get the pc more familiar with problems is to get him to look at them recall problem is one way 6way confront bracket is another the two can be combined with profit you can also use recall ptp this situated him in the time of the problem its headon type of process with alteris of time for 6way confront see hcob 6jul61 routine 1a in view of the fact that the aberration about problems was originated to protect the universe and creations you find the early end of problems run appearing to run forever since it was put there to insure persistence however you will notice that the ta is active this then starts deteriorating and hell pass to either side either facts or solutions or cognitions he can alternate between facts and solutions too l ron hubbard type 3 idate12761 volnum1 issue28 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec28 q and period 6107c12 shspec28 q and period continuous lack of cognitions on the part of the pc means hes hung up in fantastic maybes the way to take it apart as per the anatomy of maybe as set forth in scientology 880 is on the plusminus side how have you done it how have you not done it maybe does not have any reality in fact its manifestation of positive and negative this is also the anatomy of problems maybe is counterbalanced insistence on it is it isnt or mustmust not since it is not fact it must be taken apart on the basis of the two sides this handles the subject of anxiety which is mustmust not isisnt it is frantic state of maybe so such case should be run on positivenegative bracketing everything you run on such pc should be run plus and minus even rudiments the case will change and never seem to notice it 59 its not impossible to run solutions just dont prevent the pc from examining the problem eg sop goals runs solutions the universe has been boobytrapped with ease of getting in and difficulty of getting out eg marriage the army etc scientology even does it to degree discouraging people from squirrelling etc because its rigged this way the way out has to approximate the way in all resistance is to prevent oneself from going any further down if you can resolve the resistance to getting worse the pc will get better hes preventing deteriorating but this can produce deterioration however that is not his intention all the auditor has to do is to convince the pc that hes not going to push him further down nor to cure him then to dissolve his resistance to getting worse which is pinning him down and the pc can then spring back if the pc didnt make his goal for the session you can ask what didnt happen and sometimes you will get his hidden standard various details about running processes l ron hubbard type 3 idate14761 volnum1 issue29 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0

just dropped body has to get another one before we can clear him when columns b c and d consistently register low after processing you know the pc hasnt found the auditor this is due either to an auditor who doesnt impinge or pc who cant tolerate being effect or control case that hangs fire has an automatic notis which can wipe out the needle read hell tell you all sorts of overts on sec check but not consider them bad he doesnt think its real he knows about it but its all notised dont get outraged with the auditor who missed it he didnt really miss it all the time you are checking the pc over you ask about the auditing so as to unearth the moment of notis youll make it safe by putting it on via eg have you ever thought it wouldnt hold up your case if you didnt tell your auditor did you ever have objections to the auditing room and just fail to mention it is there any time in your life when you felt completely beyond help did you ever tell your auditor these are tricky questions but youre counting on the fact that during that fifty hours something did get brought to view that can be reexamined when spotted it requires bit of cleverness to spot it theres sense in trying this technique before hes has any auditing the ground hasnt been plowed yet hes been like this all his life and thinks its normal the meter registers on disagreement and he doesnt have any yet in fact you can use disagreement as broadsweep ruds question when nothing else will register the this is normal is in dianetics the evolution of science as the everyone knows the pc really knows its not normal but the valence hes in considers its ok you could ask what is life really like to find out what normalis to him when we say its below his level of reality we mean he has some specialized compartmented values of existence which really have nothing to do with existence his level of reality has nothing to do with other people this is his reality so it doesnt register when you ask for differences for instance you ask for critical thoughts he says and it doesnt register because its all justified that he natters continually the disagreement is in total agreement with 60 his reality they have everything identified with everything so there is sense in disagreement the complexity of disagreement with everything is such that the disagreement is just the way things should be thus there is read an automatic notis is an automatic disagree you have to be clever to unveil it all the pc has opted out of life because it was too much but he knows he shouldnt have he will perhaps tell you that he has led calm orderly life that nothing much has happened actually he just hopes he has past how do you get him back into the mainstream of life the meanest thing you can do is to ask him have you ever left anyplace he answers then you hit him with why now you are asking for the points of departure from the main highway you are asking what didnt you confront that you feel you should have confronted now the meter gets active it can be summed up in this way did you ever have anybody demand that you put your attention on something have you ever had anybody tell you that youre wrong not to have had your attention on something thats the basic trick this comes up on problems the basic trick of life making people confront is the overt and having to confront is the motivator all deaths and the whole mechanism of death comes from unwillingness to confront so when people leave and feel they shouldnt have left it is because there was something there that was too threatening and it keyed in death so they did q and on death and opted out of life they were running noconfront on people giving people things that couldnt be confronted if you do that you get the idea that you cant confront after you get that idea you can only leave and when you cant even leave any more all you can do is to go nuts when you get the why of leaving you can ask if thats been problem to him at any other time you could get his ptp that way you can ask have you ever thought of blowing session why what youve done here is to walk around cleverly using all the buttons that he is using to lie there quietly unchanged the buttons of the prehav scale can be used in this line eg prevent which has to do with problems the surprise element is effective in all this so it shouldnt be rote the pc must realize that he is being interrogated by an intelligence control is associated with intelligence the labor management situation stems from suspiciousness of cleverness when people are unclever they are easily overwhelmed by cleverness they can protest it with strike labors basic yap is against the intelligence of management but management is never bright enough to use intelligence as counterweapon intelligence is an altitude factor this applies very strongly in sec checking you wont get anywhere operating as robot similarly with ruds if you know there is something wrong because the pc hasnt responded to the correct processes then there has got to be something wrong with rudiments if you cant get the pc to respond well its not that he is trying to hide from you consciously he is being dead body up in gully covered with leaves and youve got to work around cleverly to communicate with him so he can be gotten back into life the trouble is that he thinks he is just lying there quietly and he isnt he is shooting guns and making all kinds of fuss on the other hand you dont want to get so helpful that he comes to rely on you totally and never looks 61 l ron hubbard type 3 idate18761 volnum1 issue30 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec30 cant have create 6107c18 shspec30 cant have create in 1952 the philadelphia doctorate course and scientology 88008 were the basic texts on havingness havingness is dominant thing it is part of games conditions now we are back to games conditions and its relation to havingness in scientology 88008 we had the principle that the goal of processing is to remedy the scarcity and abundance of all things but all that we previously had to do this was creative processing and lot of people couldnt run it now we have come up with new way to do this and thus clear someone fast there is new datum on havingness its relation to create after you create something you may have it or not create doesnt necessarily mean that youll have all of auditing could be considered prehavingness hence the prehav scale the relationship between creating and havingness has to do with the fundamental formation of the reactive bank and is very important what person cant have he creates that is the law on which man operates it is the most fundamental law of the bank that has yet been discovered this is how the bank is formed eg whenever italy gets beaten they have renaissance or like when you abuse plant it blooms lrh wanted ship and couldnt buy one so he started to build one if rosebush cant have rose if you trim it off it creates roses if shipyard cant have ships it builds ships that wear out in twenty years so you cant have the ships either probably the government punishes everyone for producing in order to make them produce on reactive basis theres evidently some crossrelationship that goes further than the ow mechanism it was described in theory in scientology 88008 plus in the discussion of games conditions in the fundamentals of thought games conditions concern preventing people from having things things of all sorts are havingness the thetan is only unhappy when he cant have his idea of quality could be reformed if you deny him anything hell try to obtain it eg the prohibition now lrh knows how to make civilization decide what would be good things to have and create knuckleheaded bureaus to prevent each one of them the trouble with economics is that it tries to create demand with supply it should use scarcity how do you create creation run broad cant have the games condition can get so bad that if you insist on people having something they dont want it police action creates crime bbc creates rock and roll as long as you arent in games condition with the people around you as long as you dont run cant have or must have on them and still have control all will be smooth sailing its supposed to be good thing on this planet to run cant have eg with strictness but this is the way you create problems problems may appear to be dont haves but how did the pc get into the condition of dont have actually dont have is the last ditch of cant have because even with cant have you could materialize what you dont have maybe even build one but the way you got into dont have was the overtmotivator sequence first you run cant have on others then they dont have then you dont have so if the pc doesnt have anything it must be because he denied it if hes got low quality of something he gets it thus he cant have good one but nobody wants bad one so hes got bad one the test of his havingness is that he has it because nobody wants it if nobody wants it he can have it 62 total lack of something doesnt mean that the thetan is without it itll still be obsessively created in his reactive bank the covert creativity of the bank is remedy of havingness thats all it is now say you run cant have on somebody on sex then you find people running cant have on you on the subject of sex and youre puzzled youll find 2d activities are impossible so youre likely to do flip to go off in some different direction and build up various sorts of 2d activities you could have when these also fail you end up with them hidden from yourself but still created in the bank so we get the downgrading quality the degrade is on the basis of what he can have common denominator of pcs at the bottom is the complaint of not being able to feel bit higher they complain of not feeling as much as theyd like about things thats cant have on feelings also the feelings degrade and go on down the tone scale serenity is impossible so the thetan becomes enthusiastic but thats an overt so he goes down to conservatism but thats for bank managers so he gets bored but people wont let you be bored so down to feelings but of course all these feelings are being mocked up at the back of the bank at the first st hill acc lrh talked about two routes experience and the auditing route used at that time they are now combined because the experiential factor is havingness experience is havingness so all experience can be restored beingness and doingness can be junior to havingness but cf p 42 at upper level strata beingness is higher than doingness which is higher than havingness so maybe lrh is talking about lower level stratum here but beingness and doingness operate on the same cant have mechanism when you hit bottom on your own beingness youll mock up some very desirable beingness and you will be that except that you are not really being that for instance kid isnt permitted to be pilot and fly airplanes so he mocks up being an ace aviator person may end up settling for lesser and lesser beingness finally he is not being much so he mocks up substitute reactive beingness little kids are not permitted to fly planes so what do they do they become aviators what confuses people is that while cant have produces create at reactive level all this can take place at an analytical level not all cant haves trigger the obsessive create but if you communicate the cant have in an unacceptable cant have way in good games condition the guy may well slip into the reactive create absence of arc is almost requisite for reactive creation by reason of cant have if you run strong cant have on war in the interests of peace war will result keeping the peace is not done by running cant have on war by propaganda etc for instance at the outset of world war ii information was given out about the war it was not considered ok to attack the enemy yet we did get ourselves into it when people run cant have on things that do exist we get delusory state christian science does this try running 8c on christian scientist the insistence of thetan on axiom 1 is fantastic on some people if you try to run think process they cant do it these people must have an ow games condition on thoughts because they cant have thought if someone withholds thought hes running games condition on you on the subject of you cant have it this will put him in condition where he has less of it if you can get off his withholds ie get him to give you the thought youve stopped him from playing that game condition 63 and hell feel better but why does he have these discreditable things anyway because they are scarce if thought is scarce there has been cutdown of thought of activity so the person withholds telling you about actions agains the mores of society because such actions are scarce if you can get hold of one its his jewel scarcity he also holds onto it because he doesnt want you to have bad thoughts about him this is another games condition to handle this you could run cant have process on thoughts theoretically 1 what thought havent you permitted another to have 2 what thought hasnt another permitted you to have you could see another mechanism from another theoretical process you run think of say woman at first he gets generality or nothing then he thinks of specific departed women then dead women sick women funerals too you are making him examine the scarcity of women and it runs backwards to the point where he could think of present woman with perfect ease and get 3d picture of her whatever it is you find him inverted or nonexistent on you develop process by which you can discharge his propensity for using that item in games condition on others and they on him because you are running out stable data on this you add confusion problem or motion along with it for instance you could use when have you denied another woman when has another denied you woman what problem about women is not present now the not present now is because it is the notis version of problem confront this is murderous process because it unnotises everything involved games condition is unnatural since in such condition the person becomes convinced that there is only that game so they run the cant have and the more they do this the less they have of it eventually it disappears from view and they have gotten worse not better way back people wouldnt clear because they thought it meant losing their game when cleared they promptly went out and aberrated themselves again to have game they expressed it as i didnt want to be detached from existence what pinned it down was scarcity of games they thought being aberrated was the only game going the remedy of havingness of games is broadening the pcs view on the subject of games all you have to do is knock out his fixed attention on aberrated games so that he can look around at all the other games if you do this the pc will blow clear almost at once l ron hubbard

energy you are seeing something like an ac motor feeding its current on surge and then reversing its flow repetitively this is charge line the only thing that can change it is auditing the person is total noresponsibility case he knows he can have effect on 64 anything cchs undercut it best think processes are not very effective because this kind of pcs thought has effect on the bank the common denominator of all cases is the degree of effect the thetan has on his bank this ranges from absolute zero to total easy effect on the bank the stage four needle is retreat from the bottom some buttons are still open problems confusion motion leaving or something on such case all you have to do is to trigger one of his automaticities and let it run off the case giving the guy more control over his bank you are not at this stage really asking the pc to do anything there such thing as spook stage four needle turned on by the auditors statement it doesnt matter what the auditor says this is very common third of pcs have it thats you energizing the bank you can have more effect on the bank than the pc has this is something auditors find hard to duplicate being sold on the idea that the pc is responsible for it all they cant see the pcs pictures so they dont believe it sometimes the spook stage four needle confuses you when doing sec check the impact of your thinkingness and speakingness will activate the bank this is the lowest reaction below lie reaction or reverse lie reaction if youre sec checking pc his level of interest rises and creates an emergency level so dont avoid reaction on the needle just because the pc has one of these automatic reactions on the needle at first when you ask meaty questions hes right in there reacting so any reaction on sec check question that might be meaningful is always taken by the auditor as factual providing its an instant read stage four needle probably isnt an exception to this complicated question might not be duplicated as asked so 34 sec lag could still be an instant read anything more than one second lag is totally useless cant have is not prerequisite for creating only for unknowing creation nearly everyone whos studied the mind has studied only the analytical mind were looking at reactive mind laws but even this response was originally an analytical response all reactive responses were originally analytical one can just decide to create something knowingly this other law works this way one day you get picture of rhinoceros in front of you because someone somewhere prohibited you from having rhinoceroses but you arent aware of ever having wanted one this explains the mysterious appearance of mental image picture which has been hitherto unexplained it also explains some strange desire to make or do something someone has run cant have on you but most creativeness is spontaneous and able analytical reactive creativeness is generally terrible there is such thing as negative sec check to handle notis in the pc you can knock the withhold into existence by asking questions which asis the notis eg when havent you stolen something then you could ask the the positive question emeters can be pushed around by pcs but the reactions look different from reactive reads it looks like body motion jerky if pc is worried about pushing around the meter hes 1 not in session 2 got withholds 3 he wants to impress the auditor its what the pc doesnt know about that moves the needle the remedy is to handle ruds 65 vitamins to be taken during an intensive dianazene used for

6107c20 shspec32 games conditions games condition means an agreement of cant have amongst beings its have for self and cant have for others in true games condition but as an agreement its cant have on all flows its agreement that nails it in concrete widespread cant have agreement gives you lots of mass for instance the christian prohibition on sex which is very fundamental as cant create bodies are necessary as favorite vehicles and identities but theres penalty in the christian system for creating them this results in mustmust not it is in the field of disagreement and can be processed in various ways but how did you get suckered into position like this where you could accumulate motivators like this you must have been party to the cant have somewhere along the line you cant suffer any consequences you had hand in creating and you must have done it by agreement with lot of others with the disagreement youre objecting to the game you helped to create in the first place if you get the disagreement off you get considerable resurgence you could undercut it by getting all the agreements to have the game games condition process seeks to isolate the basic agreements on some kind of game games condition is derogatory term it means package consisting of fixated attention inability to escape coupled with inability to attack to the exclusion of other games theres nothing wrong with having games but game condition is unknown arbitrary reactive performed outside ones choice without his consent or will its sort of mental doingness trap in it youve got to do things assume certain beingness and have communication with anyone not part of the game the world thus becomes massless timeless spaceless and peopleless very rapidly most marriages that go on the rocks are in games condition where theres total agreement that neither one can have anything overlaid with another set of agreements that are in disagreement with that fundamental cant have agreement their tenderest moments are when theyre in disagreement with the basic agreement of cant have this gives us interesting maxims like hell hath fury like woman scorned which reflects the later disagreement when two people get this fixated the rest of the world ceases to exist they just stay with each other and shut out the rest of the world 66 games conditions can exist on any dynamic wars are an example on the third or fourth dynamics one can find portions of the track where one has repeatedly gotten into the same game eg defending the capitol by being part of an interceptor squadron shooting down or being shot down by the enemy right over the middle of the airport this was games condition because it was an unknowing fixated activity it did nothing effective for the society the clue to games condition is that the person is doing compulsive confront that makes it necessary for him to assume compulsive beingness in order to play this game one must deny certain havingness the us has in its last two wars demonstrated itself to be in war games condition because it cannot have the fruits of any of its victories in games condition matter what the person says he always ends up with havingness so you get an obsessive beingness and doingness and cant havingness everybody has few games conditions few have complete games conditions going the latter are in the spin bin when you see one of these games conditions it defies all logic because its obsessive it has nothing to do with the real world this is true of all aberration its out of pt the rationale which rationalizes games condition has holes in it but dont try to argue someone out of it audit him out of it you cant educate someone out of games condition because its aberrated and he cant look at it analytically the situation of person who cant influence his bank with thinkingness is interesting the gradient scale of less effectiveness in this regard ends in effectiveness if you give such person an auditing command he doesnt do it and even if he did do it it would have effect on the bank such person breaks auditors hearts and gives people loses it is of interest to understand the anatomy of this phenomenon which exists to some degree in all cases since clearing person means putting him in control of the bank weve been working on the question of how person could get into condition where they could not affect the bank since 1954 the answer is withholds the fellow is backing out of life hes withholding as part of games condition denying something to someone else the withhold gives him cant reach pullback multiply this by lot of instances and you find that eventually the person practically exits from the dynamics but this is really not possible to do so he inverts on them as far as hes concerned his effort is to leave compounded with the withhold and notreach thus you get an ineffectiveness you cant control something you cant reach and from which you are withholding yourself the mustnt reach is really mustnt be reached of course this is true especially when there is punishment involved punishment compounds withholds so as we go downscale on reach we get 1 ineffectiveness 2 destructiveness the pc cant communicate with something well enough to understand it so when he does reach he can only be destructive 3 inability even to destroy something 4 inability to have any influence at all of any kind 5 inability even to affect his own mind add up all these withholds and cant haves on all dynamics and you get someone whos totally withdrawn individuated totally ineffective on his own bank when he runs cant have on people he makes them less familiar and more withdrawn from things then by the overtmotivator sequence this reacts on him so he stops 67 reaching and starts withholding at 100 withhold or 100 withdraw he cant influence anything including his thoughts and bank if he reads on the meter you know something is effecting his bank dont be amazed if the pc has never noticed really the condition hes in he cant think or rationalize on the subject he will buy wrong whys on it readily so if you run command that you havent tested for read you are doing something adventurous since if it didnt read youre in an area where hes still totally ineffective or totally effective pc can be compulsively exterior the detached case freud could never help this kind of case thats someone who is backed out of the dynamics and backed out of his head people will tell you they feel detached that indicates games condition in the area where they feel detached most homosexuals are detached in this sense in any area person is in games condition about he is detached how do you reverse the games condition find something that reads on the emeter and is therefore something he can effect ie something real to the pc real means can the pc be effective in that sphere get the pcs withholds and cant have off the subject on gradient scale you take off the games condition and the pc can now reach in the area and regain effectiveness its basically idiotically simple but if you violate that doingness you dont get results in auditing say you want to cure psychosomatics with auditing you can find people who are so much the effect of their psychosomatics you can have more effect on them than the they can you can make them well but they dont know it so they never thank you for getting well what you should do to avoid this situation is to assess all the persons difficulties get the best read get off all the persons withholds on the area get the games conditions in the area cured and the difficulty will right itself you can eradicate illness and upsets but you have to assess them first the fact that the pc complains about something all the time doesnt prove anything it could be circuit or mechanism or it could be part of some other games condition there is gradient scale of difficulties the pc may have lots of them but may be effective only in one area thats where you must start thats been the barriered line on healing and help if you run command that doesnt read the pc is ineffective in the area therefore its auditor vs the pcs bank with help from the pc hell be arc breaky hard to audit because youre just auditing bank and the pc isnt there this violates the basic auditing principle auditor plus pc is greater than the bank l ron hubbard type 3 idate3861 volnum1

production mechanically of course its something he hasnt asised because its unpleasant etc but why did he agree to those mechanics in the first place he makes an original agreement then revolts against it maybe hes been made to produce lots of good things so he revolts with this mechanism so when hes called upon to mock up something good he mocks up something bad this may happen on 11 level this can be seen running pleasure moments when the pc slips into the badness of it all assuming that the fellow is in revolt this can be very overt hitoned or covert eg not producing but having excuses for failure or forgetting to do it at all the latter is lower harmonic of direct refusal occlusion is this level of revolt and we let people get away with it for instance hitlers around somewhere and we allow him to get away with having forgotten who hes been i cant is covert i wont the mechanism is so lost it has become way of life not revolt any more the guy just mocks up bad pictures and forgets some civilizations on the track were really productioncrazy eg arslycus where the thetans were actively producing mocking up matter you couldnt get away there were entrapment mechanisms production got bad name because it was production against power of choice over production the bank dramatizes this creation against the wish to create the fellow doesnt want to mock up the bank so he mocks up the bank his will to create has been badly overwhelmed partly because he overwhelmed others will to create arslycus eventually fell apart some worker invented disintegration so that it could happen this was the only possible response to outcreate with new idea something worse than what was happening to them creation gets bad name from enforced creation theres another side to it lrh has been unhappiest when hes produced so much that he gluts the market others decide theyve been outcreated and they get unhappy too thats not so upsetting whats so upsetting is not having any market for your creation observers audience etc and not having it wanted one does want ones creations to be admired if you are made to produce when you dont want to or if you think there will be appreciation of your production you will generally produce an overt product one can also think that good creation in some field will bring one into state of victimization or some unpleasant consequence in this case one retreats saying i cant or i dont have any talent or i havent been educated in 1948 the answer to why does thetan create bank was that he creates something with resonance between his own tone and what he creates in the bank this is not the whole story though an individual mocks up or doesnt in an effort to prevent his will from being overthrown on the subject of creation he gets mechanisms to inhibit creativeness in order to protect his selfdeterminism these mechanisms are what we run into in processing this is why creative processing works but it is also why some pcs eventually dreamed up that the bank gets solid the mechanism was already there methods of denying creation are the most fundamental thing youre dealing with in processing we have to figure out what the guys afraid of and disarm it on that angle so what is he afraid of hes afraid of being made to do you can substitute do for create to avoid some mine fields he considers there are bad consequences to doing he considers that you have to hit thetan to get him to create this is an oldold consideration 69 it explains things like the high birth rate amongst the lower classes it also explains waiting until the last moment to write paper and the artistic temperament and why artists seek out sps if someone hits you youll make picture of it this explains to everyone that hes victim he has been made to create and he is following the law that the best way to keep from being hurt is to create this keeps you from being beaten the most involved point in an engram is where the fellow thinks he has mocked up the engram in full which should keep him from further injury then gets hit again by something else so he mocks that up too and then theres more injury or something which defeats him his best answer to blow was to create that used to get him off the hook then he suffers defeat and an invalidation of the mechanism of creation as defense then comes total notis of engrams which is another defeat and the disappearance of earlier engrams people with invisible fields have gotten to chronic state of believing it wont do any good to create this all sums up to the thetans responses to the accumulation of all the times his choice was overwhelmed someones choice is overwhelmed so he responds in some way in downscale attempt to make his postulates stick which he never gives up trying to do the basic assumption of thetan and the first thing he wants to do is the communication formula axiom 10 its the most fundamental game in the interrelationship of thetans anyway from there on he just wants to make his postulates stick when he fails to create an effect he will still try to create an effect by mocking stuff up routine 3 goals processing is effective because you are looking over all the powers of choice he has hoped to effect most of which have failed and running out his failed powers of choice running goals is sneaky way of getting at what postulates he would like to make stick by asking what conditions he was trying to bring about the bank is the mechanisms of all sorts that tend to defend his assertions of self though the effect of these mechanisms is to make mess of the pc the disintegration of his postulates is whats wrong with him his reaction to this is surprisingly extreme but the bank is still trying to have the effect the basic of the chain is an overt which is why overts work so well in processing someone who is obsessively protecting anything has overts on it he is still trying to make his basic postulate of effect on stick however why does he make the original overt postulate he has gotten into games condition on creation thats why he has been creating against someone else gets lose on making nothing of the opponents creation so he overts against it early on the track thetans specialized in goofy games and got into forgetting what they were doing so there seems to be something wrong in the field of postulates theoretically you could run pc on what effect could you actually create this doesnt work because it is too direct it goes straight through the mine field to the pc it seems unreal he cant do it modifying it to what decision would it be all right for you to make would be more workable thetan must have feeling that there are motions and confusions he cannot tolerate so he avoids them with mechanisms of creation if persons tolerance for motion and randomity is raised his fears of consequences of the overthrow of his power of choice are reduced most fundamentally obtaining tolerance for motion and catastrophe would wash away the fear of fear 70 the creation of confusion is the last echelon of postulate the last echelon of confusion is the creation of confusion by omission so were on safe ground with pcs if we stress creation of confusions especially by omissions so you could use the process if you said nothing what confusion would occur or what notdoingness would create confusion cases that dont move are the roughest ones in catatonia we have the last desperate effort of thetan to make postulate stick somewhere its notdoingness theres probably such thing as thetan whod not trying to do something all thetans are busy if only trying to do things through omission thus in asking for goals we should ask for failed goals secret goals withheld goals etc since that leads straight to old postulates pc can be so confused on the blowcreate theory that just being talked to by the auditor can cause him to create something or below that hell mock up nothing while in session and get lots of ideas about it out of session ron handled this with short sessioning the pc would hand up his case right after session then lrh would begin new session and handle it at this level the pc is on total reverse he creates when hes not supposed to and doesnt create when hes supposed to occlusion is the last answer the last attempt to create an effect an overt of omission here you could use some far south process as what confusion wouldnt occur if you forgot this might get through to him if hes on failed forget so the dwindling spiral of creation or postulates is 1 postulate 2 failed postulate 3 creation 4 failed creation 5 creation of confusion 6 creation of confusion by omission 7 notised creation of confusion by omission tolerance of confusions problems motion etc is fine but failed postulates is what you are trying to get with goals processing you can also get this effect if you ask pc what he hopes would happen if he kept on doing what he was doing if he cant answer you can undercut it with what wont happen what shows up here will be caution which seems laudatory but hell begin to realize something will happen too as you get the notis off you could run off intentional overts with what would or wouldnt be damaged if you forgot it they are both aimed at getting the effect hes trying to produce or you could use what damage would forgettingness cause youre running ow crossed with forgettingness etc this is all at high level of theory its road parallel to the one through the minefield even if you cant get the exact road l ron hubbard type 3 idate4861

impossible to have judgment in auditing if ones trs are out and one is worried about making mistakes in application of the tech on running brackets problem may be that the outer legs of the bracket may not be real to him at first reality on these legs may develop as he runs the process this happens because of the dynamics as he is audited the pc gains reality on the other dynamics besides the first dynamic the pcs ability to 71 reach is directly reflected in his ability to conceive of someone else having an idea or action so as you run the process the command you started with can be too narrow and limiting as the pcs ideas reach further and the commands could need to be enlarged more legs could be added each leg of the command stands as an individuated unit without interchange among legs each in fact could be run as an individual command in view of the fact that it doesnt harm anybody to run an unreality as long as they are moving towards reality it would be ok to run all legs of the bracket from the outset try to choose bracket and command wordings all of which fall remember that if you choose command that restricts the pc you limit his gains also the pc will tend to look at the legs not being run as his reality comes up he will have to withhold himself from those areas tending to put them on automatic an auditing command can be broadened it shouldnt be made more particular and specific if in doubt take the broadest form and run it from the outset running one which is too restricted can turn on somatics its legitimate to change the targets flows etc but not the basic form dont change how to when or could to would you can drop portions of the command too as long as in so doing you are removing particularization when the pc gets very free on flows you can drop out the legs and go to the simplicity of eg get the idea of verb an aberration is located as total imprisonment total individuation auditing commands resolve the degree of imprisonment and individuation as the degree lessens you may lose ta on one leg of the process but now have it elsewhere the ta ceases to move when the targets of the process are flat so the rule is before leaving the command check it out for all variations which might produce new action remember that the reactive mind is an idiot so you could miss something because of wrong pronoun or whatever the biggest barrier in dissemination is notdoingness and misdoingness there is an old unresolved philosophic question about the value of notdoingness to do or not to do which is better the active or the passive life if you do you get into trouble if you dont do you get into trouble theres confusion on either side for instance lrh had problem as writer whether to be super nasty if he was criticized or to be nice and let himself be criticized thus protecting his markets and friends there are contradictory lessons in this of course neither answer is right the missing datum is that they are both overts longest continuous overt is notdoingness have you ever noticed the randomity that can be produced by missing datum in problem false datum can cause some confusion but look at what missing datum on the subject of the mind has done how about missing beingness this is nearultimate in notdoingness the ultimate of course is forgetting youre not only doing nothing youre not there to do it and youve forgotten this really produces confusion thetan never ceases to try to have an effect on something to put axiom 10 in effect matter how many trillenia have gone by you are trying to process someone who is in the middle of 10000 continuous overts of omission doing something is apparently the least damaging type of overt thus withhold seems to be the more therapeutic side of ow its his notdoingness which weighs on his case 72 doingness and notdoingness are not data of comparable magnitude notdo is enormously greater thats why people who stop doing even if what they have been doing is nasty crash when they stop thats also why men die before women underneath it all thetan knows hes important to life and knows its an overt not to participate the only greater overt is to forget this is still an attempt to create an effect so theres gradient scale of effect creation 1 you do something to have an effect axiom 10 2 you create an effect by not doing something 3 you create an effect by being absent 4 you create an effect by forgetting what degree of randomity could you produce by forgetting whole lifetime quite bit and its an overt and the fellow realizes its an overt thats the reason for whole track occlusion the overt of forgetting the law behind all this is that the thetan never ceases to have an effect on those targets he has chosen and the only thing that could ever pry him loose from those fixated effects is something like scientology he is imprisoned to the degree that he is still trying to have hopeless effect on something he is his own jailer forgetting it prevents it from ever being asised if ow can stall case how much more can it be stalled by not being there the withhold of self how much can it be stalled by withhold from self and being there and from doingness and from the subject and from any knowledge of the subject and from any communication with any beingness of the subject etc thats why the more occluded case is the harder it is to audit so you run cases on what wouldnt you mind forgetting this gets off withholds or as general pattern for command what confusion wouldcould forgettingness create weve looked on forgettingness as sort of passive thing weve looked on notdoingness as the natural state of beingness seeing them as overts opens up new zones for processing l ron hubbard type 3 idate8861 volnum1 issue35 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec35 forgettingness 6108c08 shspec35 forgettingness the reactive mind is basically that area of occlusion which the pc is unable to contact and which contains total identification of all things with all things and until released into the realm of havingness continues to react upon the person compelling him into actions dramatizations and computations which are not optimum to survival we find in the reactive mind all the residual not asised material which the individual is seeking to avoid all the discreditable things of his existence are then contained in this area he hangs onto them the knucklehead he has various mechanisms of survival connected with this one being the justification of the aberrations he has psychology makes the error of saying that one is only able to create by virtue of ones reactive mind faculty psychology c the 1500s was an attempt to understand perception and the mind they didnt get anywhere because they dealt with the analytical sphere and got confused by the fact that men dont always react rationally behaviorism overlooks the unpredictabilities of men when they dont follow the stimulusresponse mechanisms until scientology theory about man was too precious not to be carefully guarded from attack men went to the stake to protect the theory of faculty psychology they threw away case histories to protect the theory of behaviorism the abundance or scarcity of 73 all things applies theories were terribly scarce in scientology we are looking at an abundance of theories what we care about is what works former theorists didnt care whether their theories were workable or not they just felt they should protect the theory the cure of reactive bank is knowingness because the substance of the bank is notknowingness theres fourth postulate remember the third was forget it is senior its been stressed that one should run that rather than remember in order of making the four postulates are 0 native state potentiality of knowing everything 1 first postulate not know 2 second postulate he had to know something 3 third postulate he forgot what he knew 4 fourth postulate remember thetan does this on any given subject when you enter school you start by postulating you know nothing about the subject thats really request to find something you dont know in other schools youre asked to notknow and then learn lot of nonsense the only thing that ever blows up false theory is the workability of countertheory we know more about the unpredictable side of man than any other body of people on earth so any breakthrough we make in the area is valuable the breakthrough is in the area of forgettingness and confusion man wants things to be forgotten he not only uses forgettingness as continuous overt act he wants forgettingness to occur he wants all his evil deeds to be wrapped in the stygian darkness of yesteryear man is basically good so it his deeds are considered bad then theres only one cure for them that he knows to forget them so as an auditor you can ask what should be forgotten hell recover almost at once screaming impulse to make something forgotten and that is where his volition and the reactive mind cross his volition desires occlusion back of all his confusion is knowable volition he wishes forgettingness to occur and that wish creates reactive bank that is the postulate that comes ahead of everything he must forget so it can be reached with what should be forgotten theres danger that this will become forgotten point of scientology the postulate it must be forgotten must be the most forgotten of all postulates so it must be the one least able to be asised and thus best suited to accumulate the concatenation of bank the hidden standard is cousin to this you can handle the hidden standard by asking what is hidden about it or what should be forgotten about it and it blows the pcs attention frees up and he knows processing works for him you can ask what would have to happen for you to know scientology works strip all the motion out of the needle and youll have list of hidden standards more details on running of this any psychosomatic or livingness difficulty person has is difficulty because theres something about it he doesnt want known and he wants others to forget it compulsive rememberingness brings about forgettingness one pulls it in with the must have on remembering which postulates the likelihood of forgetting and vice versa someone who goes off to the south seas so as to forget first tries to forget with women then with liquor dope then death but all his urgency to forget keeps it there he pushes one button and gets the other this develops an awful confusion which is then buried with death and occluded forming the stimulus response mechanism of the reactive 74 mind because his power of choice and his postulates are being overwhelmed even if its him whos overwhelming them restoration of memory on the whole track is the index by which you can measure case gain most easily if someone doesnt think hes lived before hes heavily plowed into forgettingness while the guy who has only delusory recall on track is doing pretended knowingness of the whole track this is games condition of magnitude its denying knowingness by giving false knowingness its forgetting and remembering at the same time very confusing and irritating to confront the irritation comes from ones awareness of the games condition putting you into the position of being an unwilling opponent if it goes on long enough your own occlusion is assisted the target is to occlude your track by giving false knowingness about theirs confusion asks itself to be forgotten because it was never remembered that is it is notknown thats what makes confusion confusion l ron hubbard type 3 idate11861 volnum1 issue38 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec38 basics of auditing matter of factness 6108c11 shspec38 basics of auditing matter of factness lot of auditors are doing something besides auditing they are pressing through introducing something in an effort of make auditing work probably its because of lrh saying that the auditor has to make the auditing work that he should be on the ball etc certain apathy about results creates in itself grind atmosphere desperation or apathy alike are counterproductive lrh audits with doubt about what hes doing withdraw question about purpose his auditing is very matteroffact because he has doubt that he can help the pc doubt about the effectiveness of the process hes going to run doubt about the fact that the process is working so he has relaxedness about auditing that gives him results five times as fast because he doesnt get in his own road the reason an auditor doesnt flatten process is anxiety to get the job done which gets in the way of getting the job done lrh doesnt artificialize the way he feels about the pc he keeps it real unlike other auditors whom he heard being stilted and artificial be effective help the pc dont be hidebound this should give faster results more easily notknow and forget would have run out engrams in 1950 if they had been used then this would have avoided lot of grinding and sweat youd use command form which includes as many dynamics as necessary eg what should remain unknown about this to the public the government family your superiors etc the occlusions that auditors were struggling with were the result of selfmotivated efforts to withhold the hangups in any engrams are from desire to make these things parts of the engram unknown or forgotten the pretense of knowing about it dubin also blows on the notknow processing running engrams should not be discounted as of benefit to the case if you get someone clear and stable they may still find themselves with an engram there it wont take long to run it since hes clear during stabilization theyre unsnarling track they are still bumping into things which can be run using notknow on it makes it run even faster since it pops the sticky point into view application of notknow to goals processing 75 l ron hubbard type 3 idate17861 volnum1 issue41 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec41 rudiments and valences 6108c17 shspec41 rudiments and valences an emeter ceases to register in the presence of an outrudiment this may fool you into thinking process is flat if you get the rudiments in the process will again move the ta and needle keeping rudiments in is the most important part of auditing you can find the rudiment because only the out rud will move the meter details on goals running valence is synthetic beingness or beingness which pc is not but thinks he is it can be duplicate of any existing beingness or synthetic beingness created by what others have said about the other beingness there is such thing really as ones own valence his own valence is just himself hes either himself or in valence valence is package graph is picture of valence and any change you got was because you shifted his valence this is very important datum the pc will not gain in any way through any effort to alter the characteristics of valence hes in the pc will only change if you change the valence as whole package because the pc takes responsibility for any of the nowimsupposedtos or the package of characteristics which is the valence all the person can reach is knowingness of the identity of the valence what does the pc use the valence for survival the road out surmounted by knowingness valence is solid knowingness body is solid knowingness valence is an effort to get someone to know you are there to get someone to recognize something therefore they are road out of unwanted areas say soldier gets hit with mortar shell he doesnt want to be there hes in the wrong valence that knowingness valence is now invalidated and becomes notknowingness so he exteriorizes and decides that the only way to fight war is to be general or war correspondent if he cant be that hell keep on trying war after war life after life finally he gets it together and becomes very successful at it then he finds all war correspondents being shot for fomenting war as he is shot he decides hell be mata hari he gets female body moves on up the line becomes mata hari in war after war then eventually he gets executed for that etc these are all efforts to solve the problem of what to do in war every valence picked up is an effort to solve problem valences are antiquated solutions so you can say these identities are antiquated solutions to confusions the goals which go towards beingness are the more definite goals they are the more profitable ones in auditing because they go toward identity person is not himself he is in different knowingness as soon as hes in valence you can fix up valences broken leg as long as its valence that isnt supposed to have broken leg which is why you can do assists on almost anyone the only person it will fail on is someone who has nowimsupposedto of valence the pc has control over this any pc is being dominatedly in given valence but may be tortured or upset by other valences which are only really the concern of the valence he is mainly in so any pcs troubles are only the troubles of the valence hes in the troubles are part of the nowimsupposedtos of this valence so theres way to remedy the difficulties on the valence because they are outside the power of the pc to touch here you get the oddity of please audit but youd better not make well thats what it looks like 76 the valence may have somatics turning on and off as part of the package which keep the valence from becoming something else the pc will keep the somatics to prevent himself from becoming an unworkable solution to future problem dont try to take that solution away from the pc so long as it seems vital that it be solution what youve got to do is to get the pc to face up to the various factors that make that valence you cant make valence well you can move valence so any process run at random on pc has very small chance of success this preselects our bag of tricks to small bag you must ask yourself is this process going to change familiarize accustom the person to identity or is it going to handle environments which make identities vital or is it going to alter valences if so it will work and stay working if not it wont what makes valence stick the way it sticks lets newly define psychotic as someone who doesnt know whats going on in his environment and who doesnt know what is going on inside himself its all unknown and unobserved neurosis is when hes got some idea of whats happening in his environment and where he is but this is overbalanced by unknowingness upscale from that you know whats happening where you are but not whats happening inside someone else few feet away you dont always know whats going on with everybody that makes slight unknowingness the stuck parts of your track are the points where you knew what was going on where you were but not what was going on around you because there are points of disagreement there was know facing an unknow the unknow can get so overwhelming that one adopts valence to solve it you pick up valence which knows about these things many scientists are solely being valences of scientists theyve got it confused with the whole track beingness of technician when you see the level of pretense of valence it becomes spotted for you it seems artificial anyone whos identified himself by some set of tricks has thereby put himself in valence the fact that hes in body is an obvious valence but its the valence that hes using the body to be thats the auditing target just having body isnt necessarily valence if hes aware of having body not ploughed in below his level of consciousness as an auditing target valence is the mip package person has composed to solve the problems of existence which he knows nothing about its always easier to pick up weaker valence than stronger one so your logical target in auditing is the weaker one if your pc has bunch of chronic somatics theyre part of the valence picture not part of the pc hes got to have two counteropposed identities in order to feel pain 1957 was when this was worked out to have experience hed have to survive to survive he has to be something other than himself otherwise he cant survive experience and live you havent chance in handling this person until he realizes that he can live without the valence hes been in games condition as valence against some environment which probably longer exists women are particularly confused here because at the present time the society is in flux and has really clear idea of where women fit in so women have more problems finding the valence to solve the problem of situations theyre not really in anyway identity crisis to straighten out case youve got to move valence say fellow has toothache youve got to find out who had toothache c 1950 tech and split the valences this is more effective than putting him in comm with the tooth since its not 77 his tooth whatever his difficulties find out who had it or would do it cf xdn wants handled rundown you could say what beingness would be good solution for tough environment you process whos valences if you want to cure toothache run it back and forth with who would want to cure toothache who would have toothache and get terminal to cure the toothache you already have the goal of course you can also use this technique for the hidden standard for long time we had the question should we handle solids or significances the answer is solids but the further answer is that you shouldnt handle conditions of valence handle the valence this is the limitation of touch assist always handle the terminal this brings prehav 13 into the limelight prehav 13 process which takes list of charged terminals and combines overt running with prehav assessment and running of brackets on levels assessed out see 6106c21 shspec17 or p 42 these notes prehav 13 will also fix

auditing as having hundreds of rules as long as you think of it that way you arent auditing these rules are only guideposts back of them your good heart will carry the day you are trying to help the person out all right there are certain things his mind will and wont do if that is what your rules are youre fine rituals as developed by religions represent their failure to communicate the basic truths here is what pc will not do he will not go into session with his attention fixated on something else nor will you have his interest in what you are doing all the rudiments can be covered with is your attention fixated on something is there any reason you wont talk to since these questions are little too broad you have the rudiments he can have fixation on ptp of short duration where his attention is fixed on the immediate environment in the ptp ld the pc also has his attention fixed on something in pt but he also has something subjective holding his attention something very real to him when you dont parallel what the mind is doing with auditing you fail in auditing the rate of change of attention defines relative pain and the common features of every stuck point on the track is sudden shift of attention this has been known since 1950 at least the processes being used are sufficiently strong that matter what the pcs attention is fixed on you can yank it away but doing so will result in an arc break furthermore his attention wont totally come off what it was on so you will create new identification of what he was looking at and what you pull his attention to you can of course go too far in paralleling the mind and wind up in q and lrh has never seen case progress when the pcs attention on ptps of short or long duration isnt handled if you dont handle attention fixation you eventually get an unexpected attention shift that produces an arc break it isnt the minor flub you make that really causes the arc break though it triggers it the arc break is really caused by yanking the pcs attention off his ptp and you wont find it by running ow on the auditor willing to talk to the auditor is the other requirement for the pc to be in session if the pc has an arc break or withhold his willingness is out with withhold theres 78 another factor the pc is sitting with known where he is and an unknown where the auditor is so the auditing session is ridge in view of the fact that the pcs attention is fixed on the withhold even if only at subawareness level if you audit over it youre guilty of an attention shift the attention fix in withhold is complicated by being an outward fix with an inward pull to keep it from getting out these mechanisms take priority over all of the pcs considerations and postulates so matter what he says you cant go ahead and audit over it i order to audit him youve got to be able to put his attention where you want it if theres distracting noise outside its waste of time to ask if it bothered him you can assume it shifted his attention so ask what were you thinking of when the noise occurred until theres read and the pc feels ok about it anything that happens in the auditing session is the auditors fault if anything goes wrong in session its never the pcs fault if the auditor doesnt tell him how to get his attention off something by some acceptable gradient its not the pcs fault if he cant put it where you want it because you didnt put his attention on the things its on when he comes into session youre slow to take responsibility for taking it off but if the pc doesnt make gains its the auditors fault just as the pc must be gotten to the point where he is at cause over his life because you can get him to erase all the aberrated points in an auditing session there is another cause the auditor this is in violation of the idea that the pc is cause of all effects so youve got to be slippy because you are being cause over section of the pcs track the only way it can happen is for him to have some willingness to do what you want him to do so his cause must still be there and your direction of his cause must be acceptable to him otherwise he wont be cause over that section of track called an auditing session and if he isnt cause over it hell make gain so to keep him at cause you audit him with all his attention on the auditing not splintered elsewhere he must willingly follow your direction and have clear view of what hes doing you assume incorrectly that the pc is delicate but in fact the only thing you can really do to pc thats bad is not to give him win which can only be done by violating his attention factors auditing in the absence of the pcs attention is noauditing how do you keep his attention keep the ruds in the earliest method of clearing was highly permissive and very delicate it amounts to this repetitive question what picture would it be safe to look at the reason it was longer being done by 1950 was this attention factor it hadnt been isolated so it couldnt be articulated also everybody kept dictating what picture the pc should look at but you could clear someone with that process and it would not be long route you can speed it up by getting him to use other perceptics eg what sound would it be safe for you to hear etc people who dont get any pictures are just stuck in pt to avoid looking at the disaster just earlier but you can work him around until he can confront the bank this approach didnt run into the attention problem because its so permissive it lets the pc put his attention where it already is it does take gentle smooth auditing and it takes quite awhile the engram necessary to resolve the case is actually just the picture the pc is stuck in so you are essentially running what picture would it be safe to look at 79 now it goes faster you handle his attention gently unstick it from ptps and arc breaks give him wins and confidence dont get into games conditions with him on goals or terminals if the session goes awry its because you missed an attention factor try to get subjective reality on this if the pc says yow yow yow arc break you say what was your ptp l ron hubbard type 3 idate22861 volnum1 issue43

undetected ptps which he will notis in order to get auditing the auditor should suspect it for instance when auditing an executive it is problems alone which give you this terrific timelessness they show up as sticky meter an unchanging graph slow reaction time not moving around much in life problems stick and float forward in time and the guy is stuck in past moment another useful definition of problem is unknown problem is an accumulation of notknowingnesses and consideration of the person as to the value of the notknownnesses remember that the thetan is stuck to his bank valences etc by mystery mystery is the glue of life if you want freedom you must restore knowledge if you want slavery establish ignorance create notknows so common denominator of all problems is an unknown problem cannot exist in the absence of unknowingness as the dianetic axiom puts it randomity can be caused by missing datum axiom 105 an unknown datum can produce data of plus or minus randomity axiom 107 data of plus or minus randomity depends for its confusion on former plus or minus randomity or absent data mans difficulties were getting more and more involved because of the missing data technology about man based on the fundamental missing datum what is mans nature or what is man trying to do when the pc runs describe the problem he may well be giving lots of aspects of the basic unknown problem if you run unknownness on the subject of problems you cut through to this central problem rapidly thetan is mystery sandwich two way comm is an inquiry of the pc as to what is going on and an invitation for him to look at it it should be limited to such questions as how are you doing whats worrying you what is that all about processes arent two way comm process is involved in two way comm except 2wc if you start process be sure you flatten it this datum has never varied it applies to running unknownness of problems its ok to handle ptp by asking what unknown is connected with it this runs ptps fast use any version of the oddnumbered postulates notknow forget doubted pretended dont use 2wc to handle problems you dont have to be repetitive get all versions of notknow off of it more details on running of ptps routine 1a consists of everything you can think of in terms of problems processes it gives total ability to confront problems without being upset by the unknownness of them man doesnt like having to confront the unknowns of life its hard to do because there is nothing there to confront were back to processing loss when you process unknowns since loss is notknow so someone with lots of problems experiences sense of loss what is so maddening about loss is that you dont know what is happening with the thing lost the pc will misassign causes of loss too because some terminal is gone and there is lots of unknownness on it the guy will go to the bottom of the prehav scale and pretend some knowingness and pretend cause the two are closely 80 associated it makes someone who is real inventor feel strange when he gets down to the inventors club and the others know all about it and invented it two years earlier someone in that state cant duplicate if they were asked what did you invent theyd answer with some irrelevance so thats good rebuttal pretended knowingness and pretended cause are blood brothers and continually come up together this is at the bottom of the notknow scale because it is substitute know the way you handle it is not direct you go at it by way of problems the guy has had so many problems he has begun to substitute false solutions those are the pretended knowingnesses you see on the case so you dont process the pretended knowingnesses you process the problems and the pc will fly you enter at the level of reality of what problem is and the false solutions and pretended cause fade out flattening routine 1a means getting the guy comfortable confronting unknowns then he wont be obsessively escaping from them and longer experiencing lot of anxiety about them cf alan watts the wisdom of insecurity jealousy is basically an inability to confront the unknown the sickness one experiences with it is not because of betrayal it is just another aspect of the unknown of faithfulunfaithful or something they know that i dont etc why does case suddenly dive into the middle of the bank and refuse to come out the guy is unable to not ask why theres an unknown in the incident the guy gets some glimmer of the unknown and he dives into it he cannot confront an unknown and becomes hectic at the idea that an unknown exists the oddity is that all knowingnesses are invented knowingnesses with sn inability to confront the unknown you eventually get an inability to confront the known then this goes down to an inability to confront at all so any little tiny incident of the day becomes problem he dwells on so dont judge by the apparent size of the problem whether he will be stuck on it if he cant confront the unknown at all he will be totally glued into all his unknowns all along the track you could run what unknown about an auditing session could you confront would you rather not confront you will solve anybodys difficulties with auditing you could run it on an old timer who doesnt much like auditing anymore or on someone who is having trouble learning to audit etc one old timer would get every pcs somatic because its mystery he instantly snaps terminals with these unknowns this process would blow him out it is very workable specific process it could be used for anyone who has left off doing some formerly successful activity or someone who is having trouble learning something eg language what is unknown about german would handle problems with the german language the treatment of condition is an attempt to alter valence without addressing the valence and this just doesnt work so some process addressed directly at the condition unless it aimed at solids like engrams wont do it address the valence find whose condition it is handle the terminal cf again xdn wants handled rundown long lists of goals wont be that useful but long lists of valences could be out of this you could get process for ptps of long duration ww would have condition what isnt known about that person what might you have done to him what might you have withheld from him you would strip off valences and get off problems and ow at the same time if you run lots of notknow youve got to remedy havingness because the whole bank is coming unglued 81 l ron hubbard type 3 idate23861 volnum1 issue44 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec44 basics of auditing 6108c23 shspec44 basics of auditing the constants of an auditing session are there you must start the session get all the rudiments in at sensitivity 16 we dont use the third of dial drop rule anymore now flatten the process you start and end the session to do this you need to have trs metering etc for pc to be in comm with the auditor it is necessary for the auditor to be in comm with the pc an auditor who would make invalidative comments or not get command across is not there giving session and isnt someone the pc can be in comm with so add to the in session definition that the auditor has to be giving session ie actually running session the way to run session is to run session the limitation on telling someone how to run session involves the amount of disagreement the auditor has with the forms and actions hes using to run the session ones disagreement with handling rudiments could be because of the relative ineffectiveness of the processes but one could also have far more fundamental disagreements eg that the pc shouldnt need auditing it works this way you using the elements of auditing could make anybody an arc breaky pc by running him with ruds out you could get lower scale pc and have propitiative pc if you have difficulty or disagreement with ruds you could produce considerable randomity the key rudiment is the ptp its sneaky because it doesnt necessarily fall at first the pc may have reality on something being ptp to him there is an interesting limiting factor on cases as result of auditing the pc goes into action in his life he then accumulates problems and now is being audited with ptps one of the primary characteristics of case gain is the pc going into action he may lose interest in auditing as result you could expect him to get more problems not less this is the same as with getting more withholds that is another indicator of case advance so dont be lulled by the quiet pc as auditing progresses he may well start having more problems which the auditor must not neglect the mitigating factor here is that as the pc increases his ability he blows these things faster if that isnt happening it must be because ruds are out an auditor who expects the pc to be doing something besides being pc is in trouble you must grant the pc his pc beingness its ok for him to have his case in session all pc is supposed to do is follow the session as given by the auditor this is what the auditor expects of him thats all if you grant the pc this beingness youll find auditing simplified because you wont expect him to report on how things are going or whatever its necessary for you to find out whats going on scientologists are understandably prone to run big oughttobe this is fine anywhere but in session the oughttobe gets joined up with probably is supposition which interferes with seeing where the pc really is at the pc could be in sweet old lady mockup but in the valence of space commander if the mockup is factual and the case isnt advancing the factual presentation must have some unknowns in it which must be in wild disagreement cases resolve on the isness of the case not on the oughttobes the isness of the case must be totally unknown if the case isnt resolving and its not what the pc is telling you that is causing his noprogress if you just keep auditing that you are in q and and you wont get result you should question the pc on the basis of what exactly are you complaining about what is 82 the isness of it if something isnt resolving you havent gotten the isness of it the first isnesses you have are 1 session 2 ruds 3 what you are addressing on the case if youve got the isness of the session and the isness of the rudiments and the person continues to complain and you try to help them with certain isness its just probably and isnt the isness if it doesnt help rapidly the most trouble youll have is with ptp ld it can be tricky to get the isness of it we now have test to tell us if process is working anything except 2wc which is just to find out where the pc is at not the 2wc process but just staying in 2wc with the pc is process and you are committed to flattening what you started whether it was in model session or not whether its rudiment or anything else so youd better have good grip on what you start before you start it otherwise youll get unfinished cycles on the pc if you see this you could run prehav 13 on auditors but theres the liability of livening up levels which means youre running terminal which is in wild disagreement with the pcs case and livening up the whole prehav scale details on setting the pc up for goals running the second rudiment is the auditor ninety percent of the charge will be blown on routine 1a but to get the rest you could take up the subject of the auditor if these things are that important to case theyre all worth handling theyre preliminary to clearing as well as to the individual session l ron hubbard type 3 idate24861 volnum1 issue45 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec45 rudiments 6108c24 shspec45 rudiments valence does not respond well to rudiments processing since the rudiments are addressed to changing the conditions of the valence thats limitation of ruds thats one reason its tough to keep the rudiments in its next to impossible since the characteristics of the valence are not owned by the pc none of the valences postulates are his postulates how do you get around this the functional ruds processes are those which can shift or lighten valences the pc long ago lost faith in himself as himself and adopted other beingnesses he reposed his hopes for survival in these other beingnesses and cannot change the conditions of these other beingnesses hes unpredictable to himself because of the valence problem process or routine 1a would have prayer of handling this situation because all valences are accepted by the pc as solutions to some overwhelming problems thats why routine 1a works every rudiments process that separates valences will tend to work you can also use tr1c just to get him in comm with the environment otherwise what will you do youd have to clear him to get ruds in you have to get ruds in to clear him tr 10 would help but very slowly so good valence process for getting in ruds would be who cancant be audited in this room or what couldcouldnt be done in this room also who should you be to be audited or who should i be to audit you these processes key the valences out temporarily its an uphill action but it does shake up or remedy havingness on valences withholds caused him to pick up valences so withholds work on valences pretty directly but you should whipsaw the withhold question around in ruds in the effort to make the pc able to talk to the auditor not just willing to talk so see if the pc feels 83 able to talk to you or unable to and why if it is sticky find ww would be able to communicate with an auditor finding the pcs havingness process can help somewhat common denominator of valences is matter energy space and time so any approach to mest eg havingness has some slight power of shifting valence the only way pc can get upset with you on sec check is to leave something incomplete by bypassing question with something still on it youll lose the pcs respect lose your altitude you should always tell the pc the question is hot so that even if you do leave it unflat the pc knows you know so theres missed withhold if you cant strip down question by the end of session let the pc know that you know its not clean if you let him go with the impression that you have let him get away with something hell be arc broken and hard to control interestingly despite the games condition the pc knows that when you lose he loses so use promptertype questions to get the pc really able to talk to the auditor on who would i have to be to audit you and what are you doing you may find the pc doing something else than following the command what you want to find out is whether the pc is willing to be pc and follow the commands or is he going to add something else to it during session you may observe the pc doing something bit odd so you should use some little rudiment like what are you doing or are you willing to be audited pc doesnt mind being nagged its all interest all havingness when it gets grindy in auditing find out what the pc is doing and what is happening you have to avoid upsetting pc who is interiorized but if hes all snarled up in something about the session youd better handle it also pcs sometimes do selfaudit so especially with an old time auditor ask which process you were auditing yourself on is unflat if its very difficult to keep the ruds in ask yourself if you are real to the pc or if he feels theres something else in the session he knows nothing about for instance let the pc know if you missed lunch and that its ok etc its up to the auditor to make himself real to the pc when the rfactor starts to break the pc will start to ask the auditor question about the auditor this shows hes out of session the fastest way to handle the rfactor is to put in the r its almost always all right with the pc when the r disappears its because the auditor is out of session the pc frequently notices it and may well comment then the auditor had better put it right at once it comes as surprise to the auditor to learn that he should be real with the pc all the rules seem to indicate that he should be unreal but there has to be person auditing the pc l ron hubbard type 3 idate29861 volnum1 issue46 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec46 basics of auditing 6108c29 shspec46 basics of auditing good auditing is not question of memorizing the rules of auditing if you are worried about the rules of auditing theres something basically wrong per the original thesis auditor pc is greater than the bank and the auditor is there to see that auditing gets done to direct the pcs attention so as to confront unknowns to straighten out the bank the less auditing you do or the less effective auditing you do the more upset the pc will be when the auditor sits down in the auditing chair and the pc in the pc chair what contract exists very simple the pc sits down to be audited ie to get on towards clear even if he doesnt 84 know it consciously hes not there to have arc breaks run ptps handled or to straighten out his rudiments in fact ruds go out to the degree that auditing doesnt get done if you use the whole session to put ruds in or if you spend time on it little or auditing gets done somewhere in here is the optimum amount of time spent on ruds say five minutes if you spend most of the session getting ruds in hes got new ptp how to get auditing he doesnt consider ruds to be auditing so hes out of session he thinks auditing is things getting done towards going clear so your main chance is to audit the pc if it gets to choice between auditing and some obscure rud that his attention isnt on to the pc auditing is handling anything his attention is fixed on eg the hidden standard chronic ptps goals etc if you endlessly handle arc breaks you get more because you are creating ptp violating the contract with the pc he will sit there and endlessly run routine 1a because its in the direction of his problems do keep the ruds in but dont make session out of them the pc will protest strongly against handling his minor ptps he assigns high value to his auditing time and wants to use it towards his goal of going clear if an auditor takes positive controlling downtobusiness approach his pcs will swear by him because he audits escape as philosophy is complicated subject it has to do with the orientation of an auditor its the only thing that can get in his road as long as he follows scientology and goes on auditing all the levels of the prehav scale have to do with escape if any of them is hot or unflat on auditor youll get the auditor letting the pc escape because its his modus operandi of handling situations its totally wrongheaded as far as getting the pc clear is concerned this is why an auditor doesnt control session when he doesnt he thinks hes being nice to the pc under the same heading comes subjective case reality that is necessary in an auditor what are we looking at when we find scientologist who has never seen or gone through an engram never collided with ridge is not aware of the thenness of incidents if he is not aware of those things he will continue to make mistakes and amount of training will overcome it just knowing this will overcome it if he has never been stuck on the track has never seen ridges its because his basic philosophy of life is escape he doesnt have case reality because hes running from his case his way to handle case is to get out of it so thats all he does with pc so the pc is never in session its pure kindness from the auditors point of view one way to do this is to change the process another is to q and the auditor shortsightedly gives the pc freedom at the price of not getting him clear the auditor who has case reality dramatizes the engram hes stuck in and which hes trying to escape by not confronting when he gets into the engram what hell see is what he looked at to avoid confronting the pain or unpleasantness which he suppressed to escape from it he escapes mentally unconsciousness is an escape it works cf red blanchard and his blackouts this person will have odd somatics and difficulties that he cant account for he cant see the pictures because hes putting his attention on the solution escape all the mechanisms of notis will be present here if he contacts the engram at all itll be very brief he pulls his attention right off of it but he will have somatic that doesnt notis hes stuck in pt which is really the ends of all his engrams so he will keep his pc in pt at all times because the auditor is in pt he wont guide the pcs attention through an engram because escape is the better philosophy 85 theres direct cure for this oneshot process that gives these auditors an enormous reality on what were running namely what unknown might you be trying to escape from this unstacks all those notised engrams youre running the reverse of escape which is confront you dont have to erase the whole bank you can just get familiarity with it the mechanism of escape is one used widely by thetans of course thetan would be in bad way if when his body dies he couldnt exteriorize its not bad thing to be able to escape but when someone is compulsively escaping he never escapes escape as philosophy gets in the road of auditing case reality is necessary in the auditor ie willingness to stay there and take look person who doesnt have reality on the bank has consistently escaped from bank he of course does odd things in auditing when he audits pc he doesnt know what the pc is doing or thinks he shouldnt be doing it so we get clearing if you as an auditor pull the pcs attention away from the incident hes running he gets confused sticks there feels betrayed you could educate that auditor endlessly without producing any change in that philosophy unless you hit the philosophy itself you cannot educate an auditor who has that philosophy into giving smooth session keeping the pc in session with his attention on his bank when an auditor makes consistent mistakes does lot of q and yanks the pcs attention to pt we assume that that auditor has the philosophy of escape theres sense in putting up laws to counter it just spot it and handle it about responsibility for the session from the original thesis you have the law of auditor pc greater than the bank and pc less than the bank thus for instance selfauditing produces minor results at best it just remedies havingness on auditing selfauditing tends to happen when true auditing is scarce for instance by having an auditor whose philosophy is escape to handle this just audit reestablish the pcs confidence in the fact that he is being audited and will be audited if the preclear werent less than the bank the bank wouldnt give him any trouble even though hes creating the bank hes created something out of control someone whos aberrated is less than the bank someone whos psychotic is the bank being totally overwhelmed by the bank recognizing that one is auditing someone who is to degree overwhelmed by his bank and realizing the laws from the original thesis we should realize that the auditor has got to be running the pc at his bank to get anything done when the auditor withdraws from doing this he collapses the pcs bank back on the pc way to get major collapse of the pcs bank is to take direction of the pcs and follow it there are two reasons for this 1 the auditor is taking directions from the bank 2 the auditor has subtracted himself from the basic equation it looks to the pc as if only he is confronting the bank he loses the illusion that the auditor is confronting it too and his bank collapses on him the pc is now just selfauditing pcs do this out of anxiety to get auditing they take over responsibility and try to take control if you take one direction from the pc his bank collapses on him matter how reasonable his direction may seem this is the first time weve really looked at this mechanism its the primary method by which the auditor ceases to take responsibility for the session this may mean model session should be rewritten its there to give the illusion of courtesy 86 thats all if the auditor doesnt want the pc to be butchered by the bank hed better stick by his ideas of what he should be doing matter how wrongheaded or upsetting those ideas may appear to be never do what the pc says matter how right he may be or how wrong you are if you take the pcs advice on some direction youve given him matter how screwy and uncompliable with your direction was youve made very major error and collapsed the pcs bank in on him you can also put pc at responsibility for the session by considering that pcs ought to do such and such that makes the pc responsible for the condition hes in in session this makes for the equation auditor pc is less than the bank this is failure to grant beingness to the pc in session pc is doing what he is doing and he should be doing what he is doing auditors code 14 considerations on top of this about what the pc should be doing interrupt responsibility for making the pc do something as long as your intentions are wrapped up with what the pc ought to be doing in inspecting pictures and so on you are making this occur the error is that instead of making the pc do or become what you want him to you add the sneak consideration the pc ought to this faintly implies im not responsible this winds up with collapsed bank the most prevalent kind of q and is where every time the pc says something you follow it this lets the pc spot what you should be auditing you are thus dropping your responsibility and you have permitted him to escape from the original question the pc never wants to handle what you want him to handle but he has been running away for trillions of years and knows quite well that he has to face up he just needs some backup on it this doesnt mean you must be totally unreasonable if the pc wants to go to the bathroom you can let him its not session direction but if he wants to go again five minutes later its an escape so you say invalidation is the basic overwhelm the pc says its my father you say it cant be you could run whole case probably with who has been invalidated what is death sickness or punishment but invalidation you are taking him on tour of the bank getting him familiar hell come out the other end not afraid dont let him escape with ruds or his own directions about what to do etc an auditor would win even if ignorant of fine points of tech if he followed these principles the pc must feel able to talk to the auditor so you dont shut him up when he tells you that something is wrong with the process or whatever auditors code 16 l ron hubbard type 3 idate30861 volnum1 issue47 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec47 auditing quality 6108c30 shspec47 auditing quality if you pass up any reading rudiment and try to go on with the session when the pc has his attention on something else even if it is notised you will set up trouble in session youll get arc breaks stemming from the ptp it may not be ptp stemming from the environment sessions can be ptps also asking for ptps can restimulate one that had been dormant until looked for so rudiments can be dangerous ground if the pcs ptp is the session he has already postulated that he cant have session otherwise hed just relax about it and not have the ptp hes got such scarcity of auditing that he has to get the most session he can in that unit of time he presses at it gives himself more commands substitutes process he can do for one he cant in all this the pc is just trying to make session out of it this creates ptp for the pc new pcs especially have scarcity of 87 any treatment because theyve had so much ineffective treatment they feel treatment is being offered anywhere so they get cant have on treatment this gets carried over into auditing it produces scarcity the pc will demand auditing and wont have it when he gets it this all stems from the ptp of scarcity of treatment handle it with any ptp process once you get the pc to see that he has it using innuendo to get him to cognite that auditing is scarce use something like what auditing sessions have you been unable to confront or when has there been auditing or what unknown in an auditing session would you want to escape from this would cure the phenomenon the pc who has continual ptps has obviously not told you anything about his ptp because those things that are known are not aberrative so if he says i know whats wrong with its my mother you can write it off those things that are halfknown can still make trouble from the unknown half so the second the pc says i know all about it that does not necessarily mean hes recovered from it if he found out about it in auditing it may not be fully known never believe pc except on goals and terminals to the pc auditing is handling of his fixed attention on the track so you neednt quail at getting in rudiment if thats where the pcs attention is fixed you do have to find the root of it the thing hes really stuck on auditing is what the pc considers frees up his attention so ask enough questions to find out what hes doing and where his attention is if the auditor sits there running the process and doesnt know whats happening with the pc he has big notknow on the session the pc can also notknow what the auditor is doing he can feel hes got withhold because the auditor never asks whats going on you can ask pertinent questions in any number get very certain on what hes doing how what hes looking at etc etc it keeps the pcs attention on his case to keep asking about it it also keeps his comm in and it gives you chance to guide him into doing the command the way you want him to pc who goes anaten has suffered drop in havingness his primary havingness is havingness of an auditor so if hes gone anaten hes lost the auditor you could ask when is the first time you lost the auditor if you dont give him back an auditor hell continue to go anaten the pc with the most anaten has the least auditor the things that cause him to lose the auditor could be what the auditor does eg an error or just the pc hitting some incidents and losing the auditor the pc starts going anaten and the pc is alone thats all find out where he is hes doing retreat anaten and boiloff on the part of the pc indicate that from the point of view of the pc the auditor isnt there if you find out where the pcs attention is you free it which is the goal of auditing if you are interested in the pcs case it helps hip to be interested in it you can just sit back and give the command and never find out what the pc is doing and it will work but compared to what happens if you really do cooks tour of the bank getting the pc to tell you whats going on all the time its an inferior type of auditing if you dont do it that way the pc will hit the thing and bounce hit and bounce leaving bit stuck here and there the pc will eventually come out fine it just takes longer the reason lrh hasnt insisted on auditors doing it this way is that they can be so knuckleheaded about it they dc some escape mechanism by asking dumb question as long as an auditor experiences impulses matter how obscure to rescue the pc from the dangers of the bank by pulling him 88 away from it its not safe to have him asking questions thats the bug in back of it the bank is as it is because of the confusion and randomity in it if you dont keep the pc confronting the randomity he wont clear up thats all thats the source of the 51 ratio in length of time needed to produce an auditing result between others and lrh ron has allergy to action but has musthave on it either you dont audit the quiet points of the track although scarcity of action is what is wrong with the pc we have to ask how did this scarcity of action occur it occurred because of the unpalatability of action stillness is preferred because it keeps you from getting hurt you may find the pc complaining of the boredom of life if you suggest lets go join the marines the pc will say well action has become discreditable society at this time has the opinion that action is bad idea at least as represented in literature why should this be if pc is so starved for action you would think that the scarcity of action just stemmed from his situation in life but how did he get himself in that situation the faster you get him over the idea of the discreditable nature of action the sooner youll get him unstuck from the quiet areas of his track the blood and guts are there moment before and after its fascinating to find out what pcs think pictures should be too they may have weird ideas about what they should have all backed up with the discreditability of action you can direct the pcs attention by asking him questions as long as your questions do not yank his attention off the subject on which it is operating hell get into trouble at all finding out what hes doing what hes looking at etc is beneficial and whenever it seems hes just escaped find out about what is unknown about what he just left cog this would also be the mechanism of blows on misunderstoods person cannot confront the unknown or if theres anything else in that keep putting his attention back on the thing he bounced out of dont do this forcefully but use pointed questions eventually the whole thing is sorted out and hes not stuck on it by all the effort to escape and the mystery and the unconfronted action furthermore he knows hes getting auditing because he gets his attention freed from the spot where it was stuck he winds up with action not being discreditable and being able to have it l ron hubbard type 3 idate31861 volnum1 issue48 rev0

audits all thumbs with the rules eventually the rules fall back to where they belong and he does fine the basics of auditing are what they are you are auditing human being the auditing is addressed to case auditing must be done what is auditing auditing is the pc in session willing to talk to the auditor and interested in his own case and able to talk to the auditor interested in own case does not mean interested in session the session itself should never be interesting witch doctors maintained such compelling presence that the patient couldnt help being interested in the session this was the wrong way to operate there was such complexity in the tech that it took half lifetime to learn eg the technique of piercing scream followed by silence then an hypnotic command then resuming 89 the scream at the same pitch and volume or the ability to leap with back somersault through the smoke hole of wigwam or lodge and sit on the trees so as to apparently disappear then talk down through the hole in spirit voices this would be so interesting that the patient would come back to life in scientology you walk into these expectations of what healer is supposed to be and do but the fake is the guy who doesnt know model session and cant do this or that so he isnt an auditor youve got the nowimsupposedtos theyve got potent reasons in back of them but they also become badge of being pro his ease in handling the form impresses the pc and has magical effect omit some of the forms and the pc suspects that theres something wrong with your auditing this can be ridiculous form for the sake of form and magical effect its good to know and use the forms but auditing comes back to something else running cases its always more important to run cases than to run according to form the form just makes it easier as guideline when youre really expert the form wont even be apparent itll just look like youre doing something effective this requires real skill you have to be completely comfortable with what you are doing making it look utterly natural while doing it utterly by the rules in this respect auditing is like doing japanese paintings doing it by the rules makes it harder because you have to be natural while doing it by the form which is artificial if you fall short of appearing totally natural you will fall short of total control there is real art in using rudiments without the pc noticing the order youre using so he complies because its so natural that it must be addressed to him it is communication that is compelling it must sound so casual that it sounds perfectly relaxed and theres question in your mind about what you are doing or where you are going or what you are going to achieve and this very casualness seems to speak of reserved power like rolls royce idling at the curb ease is power strain is never power quiet voice is more commanding than loud one this is based on the effect scale naturally its easy for you to audit pc with tremendous control if you yourself are not anxious if you are confident you can control any part of the situation you are not trying to interest him in the session and he feels theres nothing for him to look at but the bank nothing to see but his case the ease with which you can do it is based on confidence which is based on wins and ability when you have ideas that you wont win your confidence drops the reality factor has to be in and if you are anxious about somebodys case youll appear anxious about his case i handle it another way i say gee i sure am worried about your case these days the pc says really i havent been worried about my case why are you well you never say gee whiz i just realized you just keep on running this thing this creates much higher reality than robotic iamgoingtoaudityounowdofishfly if you look confident but feel unconfident hes likely to respond to your anxiety the more he withholds this the less hell go into session it doesnt help the pc for the auditor to be an unknown factor to the pc as long as the auditor stops short of eval or inval or q and the auditor should keep the rfactor in the reality factor begins in your command of your information if you dont feel you have command of the information and you pretend to have command of your information your session will come cropper every time you cannot help it matter how hard you try session goes to pieces only on these points of 90 unreality in the auditor in the auditor you can find the points of unreality by asking what did you disagree with in that session youll find thats where things go awry because theres r in the session if theres r theres or c dont think there is any lag on this when the r goes the others drop at once you may become aware of them later the unreality entered into the session by the auditor causes the auditor to get peeved with the pc session is basically an arc activity if theres been high arc in the auditor it will materialize in the pc pc can look at his bank as well as he can communicate good auditor has highly perceptive pc the same pc audited by another auditor with low arc is not as perceptive these factors have always existed if you feel annoyance or anxiety with the pc that will drop the r and cut c this can be destructive to the pc because the auditor projects low perceptivity this is one of the first factors that got in the road of dianetics auditor presence in the session varied an auditor who is confident creates an auditing environment in which it is safe to depart into the nevernever land of the unknown so its the auditor and the emotional tone of the session which determine what takes place when youve been auditing long time and havent cleared somebody you arent operating on very high level of confidence when youve seen somebody get cleared your confidence level goes up to hopeful when youve cleared somebody you get confident when youve cleared string of them you get insouciant but that in itself is reality when youve not gotten results you feel less confident about pcs so youre auditing in an environment which has low arc in it false note in the auditors confidence is always detectable the pcs attention goes off his case onto the auditor because he feels theres something here he doesnt know and theres something unknown in the session unknownness is the keynote here the auditor doesnt know whether he can produce result or what he can do or whether hell get the pc through etc he has determination of the final result to the pc it adds up as the auditor not knowing so theres mystery in the session the pc may try arduously to spot the notknow because of the mystery which sticks him the auditor cant keep the pc in session because the pcs attention is on the auditor how much mystery does he smell lrh would disabuse him of any mystery he can how long the session will be if thats relevant any mystery about whats going on just destroy it you tell him what you are going to run if youre going to ignore something etc the arc break disappears because so much r has been thrown into the session always try to make the pc right never make the pc wrong but dont make the pc right at the expense of making yourself wrong if challenged because of legitimate flub lrh would normally catch it before the pc does if he doesnt he figures hes slipping you should know more about whats going on in the session at any given moment than the pc does therefore you have more r therefore more control if the pc is telling you whats going on something is seriously out and probably has been for weeks the pc is not always right but the auditor doesnt have to tell him hes wrong theres need to prove anything to the pc to prove is one of the basic games of the thetan so the pc can easily get into this games condition but if he does something earlier is out some rfactor i would never audit someone to electrify the community weve done it and its never 91 been effective its the old prove game you dont use scientology to prove it works because youve gotten into games condition before you start and an auditing session is not games condition and you should know it every homo sapiens is in games condition this could easily take precedence over session so just dont play because if you let it be games condition youll both lose since the pc wont let you get him better at the least whiff of games condition the pc will take off in that direction as soon as you agree to have game with the pc auditing does not exist when you drop out r youve entered an ingredient which can lead to games condition youre withholding something from the pc so obviously theres game just the fact that you are doing this causes this atmosphere auditing is an activity of an auditor taking over control of and shepherding the attention of pc so as to bring about higher level of confront ability he has got to be able to confront more of what he has done and is doing etc youre not really changing the pc you may remove valences etc which makes him appear to have changed but what you are really doing is to extend the pc and to familiarize him with himself and his bank and the universe on various dynamics so his attention has to be shepherded and not all by the automaticity of the auditing command because the pc is going to duck you can count on the fact that every stuck picture is in some degree held there but the pc can look at the action surrounding the stuck point if he can look at the stuck picture the indication that he can regard the action is that he can regard the stuck picture which is blanking it out the pc is the one who brought up the stuck picture changes on cases which are rapid and beneficial frequently come from shepherding the pcs attention not from permissive grind grind grind if the pc offers up something his attention is on and the auditor refuses to help him look at it the pc can get upset the pc doesnt know what hes looking at he needs to be guided into looking at what he hasnt confronted the pc often indicates hes in trouble by sweating screaming writhing etc the only fast way the auditor can get him out is by not letting him escape the auditor shouldnt dress for anything except case gain dont change process because it isnt going fast enough change the pcs attention the way out is the way through so if hes stuck in something move him through it an auditor cant do this if he has reality on what the pc is doing if the pc is looking fixedly the way to handle it is to get him to look little further the stuck picture is stable datum which hes busily looking at to avoid looking at the confusion around it when you get him to look at the confusion the stable datum can blow with case that has black field ask whats on the other side of it with an invisible field or an invisible case with pictures get which way he is looking and get him to look in different direction its up to you to direct the pcs attention why because he himself in that very bank he has been in has his attention fixed on these objects solely for one reason because he has been powerless to direct his own attention in that particular bank and in those particular situations if an auditor doesnt do any attentiondirecting the command alone will do it but far more slowly but there will be arc if the pc believes the auditor doesnt care if you want fast clearing youll just have to get down to the fundamental which is that the auditor is someone who directs the pcs attention through his bank 92 l ron hubbard type 3 idate5961 volnum1 issue49 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec49 principles of auditing 6109c05 shspec49 principles of auditing there is substitute for understanding and there is understanding without experience in an auditing situation where there is understanding or familiarity there is likely to be established only the reality of war and if the auditor does not have understanding of and familiarity with the pc and his bank he will be at war whether he likes it or not the anatomy of hatred is based on the anatomy of noncomprehension noncomprehension is based on lack of familiarity and observation if you want to not comprehend something by all means dont look at it another condition applies tremendous amount of pretended knowingness and pretended understanding can arise after one has not observed psychiatry and psychology got nowhere because they mostly observed dead tissue when they observed anything the reason lrh made progress in the field of the study of the mind was his novel introduction of the study of living beings youd have to be able to confront motion to do that and you would have to be man of action an auditor has two sources of familiarity in processing 1 subjective reality 2 observation of the pc and meter behavior while he audits he can also live and observe life though this universe is rigged so that if you do too much living in this particular society you wind up with too many withholds and after that your auditor has lot of trouble trying to get you in session there possibly is some phase of life that is not punished but if so lrh hasnt discovered what it is yet certain rules govern auditing but they can go only so far in guiding you along the road to making clears the great oddity is that it can be done at all number of rules can give you familiarity with what is going on in the pc at any given moment you should experience it yourself to gain knowingness on it at that point you will see the reasons value and importance of the rules about 30 of all cases in scientology have never seen mind thats the only source of bad auditing why are auditors difficult to train theyre only difficult to train in those areas where they dont have familiarity so whats needed is process which gives familiarity with the bank and all its aspects and at the same time youd pick up all the hangfired clear cases they are hanging fire because they are not going along the line they should in auditing theyre walking the far edge of the crater so as not to fall in an auditor who doesnt have familiarity with the mind will applaud this tightrope walk and makes sure the pc never falls in because the thing to do is to keep out of trouble all of mans wars sicknesses economic disasters political chaos etc come entirely from one thing keeping out of trouble you are not supposed to keep the pc out of trouble if the trouble is in his bank pc never protests at getting into trouble if it gives him potential familiarity with the bank he protests measures that prevent him from becoming familiar with his bank he protests auditing to audit without curiosity about where the pc is and what he is doing is surefire way to keep him from getting into any trouble if you never find out whats going on you never have to confront his bank and he doesnt have to confront his bank the time can go up to light years and nobody gets any auditing done as general rule any mechanism you introduce into session which permits pc to avoid confronting his bank or takes the pc out of session is going to produce arc breaks heavy problems etc all pc ever objects to is not 93 being audited it has to be the pc getting none not thinking he isnt say the pc has continual ptp with his wife who denies him auditing this creates the arc break how she denies him auditing can vary but the prevention of auditing makes the upset the reason she does it is interesting it is because she cant have auditing so the grades of cases are 1 those that cant have any auditing 2 those that consider their auditing is being prevented 3 those that can have auditing on the first two classes you wont get any clearing so you must remedy havingness of auditing some of the prevention of auditing can result from noncomprehension of what it is missing data of one kind or another those who cant have auditing come under the same heading of scarcity of auditing either it doesnt exist because they have understanding and therefore it isnt anything or if it did occur there would be too many social repercussions because they have too many withholds the pc who is arc breaky or who has ptps is being denied auditing in some way this sounds very monocentric since auditing is new subject but adequate treatment has not hitherto existed on this planet everyones reaction to getting sick or injured is oh ill have to get treatment god forbid the only place where regard for treatment has been lower is in the markab confederacy where medicine was taught with dried tissue samples as the only mass there it got so bad that you werent ever permitted to get new body this was typical of many spaceopera societies this society is moving in the direction of replacing parts with mechanical substitutes because treatment is so ineffective it has to be delivered by callous people who make nothing out of their patients otherwise the treatment would be an overt they are lessening the overt and preclears have been educated into the attitude that there is effective treatment nevertheless large percentage still hopes treatment can take place amazingly the hope must be rather thin by now so if the auditor makes move in the direction of treatment the pc arc breaks so at first you are doing cheerleaders job then when you have him in session let him have treatment how could you prevent him from getting treatment first dont let him put his attention on his case he never protests crude fumbling with his case as long as you do guide him into it all protests and difficulties of the pc stem from treatment auditing you get the violence of an arc break if you prevent the pc from getting auditing because auditing is painful and the basis of the pain is that there is auditing so irreparable damage might occur the pc believes now that auditing can cure any damage but if there is to be auditing then the damage isnt curable so he is in state of anxiety as soon as you violate insessionness another phenomenon is involved in this he is looking at an engram the only space in the engram is brought about by his attention on the engram and until the engram is desensitized he will have to keep some space in it to keep the engram off the end of his nose so if you distract him suddenly from an engram the space may disappear from out of the engram and he finds that engram on the end of his nose you let the engram bite him by taking his attention off the engram he can get somatics then he compounds it with an overt against the auditor 94 there are many ways one can let the pcs attention be yanked out of session one is choosing an auditing room which has action of activity in its vicinity because you then set up auditing as the stable datum around which action is occurring you can get away with lot of this but dont try to audit in the middle of busy street you can run out past auditing in busy areas by asking what has been unknown about the activity of an auditing area this is to handle the 50 cubic yards he was aware of whose motion pinned him down into the half cubic yard of the session so ensure that the session wont be interrupted an auditor who chatters at pc about other things than the session is setting the pc up to pull his attention off his case in the session itself an ineffective process is auditing almost anything we have now run smoothly would keep him in session tech is not source of auditing bustups since it is auditing but the administration of it is the important one the prediction factor involves surprise what is surprise people with low tolerance of unknowns can be surprised more easily than youd think and the degree that person can be surprised is in proportion to his tolerance of unknownnesses the less he tolerates the unknown the more be can be surprised surprise is not having known past tense unknownness what isnt known doesnt run surprises what wasnt known runs surprises the fact had existence before he found out about it and he is shocked that he didnt know about it when it was going on the anatomy of surprise is unpredicted change it registers in the mind only if there was knownness present which the pc didnt know and then finds out later he tries to go backtrack into all that unknownness and gets the impression of floundering around during that time in notknownness which is an invalidation of his knowingness and his permeation that is the only thing thetan ever objects to an invalidation of knowingness he objects on the basis of surprise so he gets future which looks like this all sorts of things going on in his vicinity which he doesnt know about that he will maybe find out about and they will be terrible shock to him so he starts living in state of anxiety because hes had it demonstrated that facts not known to him which are quite destructive can exist in his environment without his awareness hes sucked back into the whirlpool of unknown yesterdays the truth is he knew his environment in those yesterdays but he looks back on it as not knowing his environment so things of horrible portent could be going on at this very moment so thats what anxiety and nervousness is he gets very alert so as not to be surprised this destroys iq iq goes down in direct proportion to the amount of unknownness he conceives the environment to hold this will apply to subject too someone who gets more unknownness in the environment than he can tolerate may manifest the insanity of putting known delusory terminal there thats pretended knowingness on the environment this applies directly to sessions most of what pc is going through is accumulation of unknownnesses that he suddenly found out and nearly everything hes got in the bank is prevention against being caught unawares again so when pc finds out something from the auditor which existed before he discovered it heres what could happen hes interiorized into his bank and the auditor fiddles with the cans and says the meter is out so well have to stop the session the pc is given the data that the meter was out when he didnt know it so there wasnt session when he thought there was one he doesnt know how long this was the case and the mystery pins him in the session or the auditor stops the when the pc thought he was doing all right that gives him an unknown 95 surprise is based on change were interested in the unknown factor which is what sticks pcs in it you can change process fifteen times an hour on pc without damaging him but you can suddenly change process on some consideration he doesnt know about and arc break him across the boards the pc will accuse the auditor in an effort to solve the unknownness which existed before the change you could advise the pc well in advance of what you intented to do so long as you dont yank his attention off what hes looking at if you start running process without clearing it first or letting him know youre going to do it youll probably get away with it unless the process doesnt work well in which case hell think you are impetuous pc is only one kind of victim victim of auditing matter how many motivators show up on his case thats the only one that can cause auditing difficulties he feels an unknown exists he doesnt know about in the session thats why youve got to keep the rfactor up and the knowingness factor in pcs sense the unknowns when one is about to occur turn it into known warn him dont try to gain auditing time by omitting these things you can audit pc without his agreement but you cant audit him without his knowingness arc breaks clear up most rapidly on notknow processing run it always in the past tense not the present because thats where there was an element of surprise the unknown which preceded the found outs model session also provides known structure you can jump it as long as you tell him the unknownness of the pcs bank really impinges on him if you the auditor have reality on its components knownness on its components hell sense you dont know your business your ability to control the session depends directly on your knowingness of the parts of the mind this is of course why lrh audits so effectively the pc feels you see all know all when you seeing where he isnt looking direct his attention to it get familiar with the mind and make the session familiar to the pc and youll be bearcat of an auditor to handle arc breaks you can ask what didnt i know about what you were doing l ron hubbard type 3 idate6961 volnum1 issue50 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec50 subjective reality 6109c06 shspec50 subjective reality an auditor who believes there are engrams who has an intellectual understanding of the time track who has the idea that there are such things as masses and who is aware of pcs having been out of present time but himself has slightest idea of ever being in another time stream than now that auditor is dangerous auditor because he is escaping from then now is only an escape from then by definition this auditor will allow pcs to escape from then this is directly opposed to clearing which is showing someone he doesnt have to escape from then because he can confront then and when he confronts then he is longer stuck in then he must see that he can survive in spite of his demons that they were the shadows of life not its substance if you are showing him how to escape from life youre teaching him to be worse off an auditor who is letting the pc escape from the bank will make mistakes in auditing this is the most fruitful source of mistakes the pc feeling confidence arc breaking etc the pc knows down deep that its wrong not to confront the bank so he objects because he vaguely knows hes not getting auditing 96 understanding is built on observation and familiarity person who has had experience of reactive mind trying to get someone to handle reactive mind makes dogs breakfast out of it you hear at times that scientologist is harder to audit than rawmeat pc there are several reasons for this he knows how it ought to go he is accustomed to handling an auditing session so as pc he is more accustomed to handling the session than an inexperienced pc would be he audits faster but he also arc breaks more he is more critical as pc because he cannot permit himself to duplicate bad session all his training tells him not to duplicate bad sessions so his havingness of the session vanishes when he recognizes it to be different from what he conceives it should be the amount of arc break here is not case indicator nothing shows up faster in an auditor than unfamiliarity with the bank and if the scientologist who is familiar with the bank is being audited by someone who isnt youll never get session theres outr so you get arc breaks one way to audit out bad session is what about the session the auditor etc would you be willing to be not be willing to be it is this unwillingness to be that makes it impossible for the session to occur if an auditor who is familiar with the bank flubs hell know what occurred so he can repair it and the arc break doesnt last long an auditor who has familiarity with the bank will put the pcs attention on the flub wont find what the pc is looking at on the backtrack so in trying to handle what he thinks wrongly is important he will pile up more noauditing thus creating more arc breaks he thinks the pc is just sitting in chair in pt nastily having an arc break you can make lots of flubs if you have an understanding of the pcs reality because you can fix them but person with subjective reality on the track wont realize that the pc isnt in pt and will drag him up to pt collapsing the track in pt and disorienting him disorientation is for one thing source of dreams and delusions the thetan in the skull cant find out where he is when the body is asleep so he puts up some false knowingnesses of where he is making dream or nightmare thats all dream is when you disorient thetan you have given him the only real shock he can get you have chosen him out for your randomity and told him to get lost and get confused in auditing you are in direct communication with the thetan he has problems most of which are disorientation problems he is down the track trying to find out where he has been if you spring surprise on him his first reaction is not to know where he is his next action is delusory knowingness he will tell you he doesnt know something like what you are doing he actually means that he doesnt know where he is he will put up delusory arguments to account for the shift the real reason for it is the auditors lack of reality on the pcs bank the pc is putting up delusory knowingness when he criticizes your auditing he is trying to find his unknown but of course he is in the unknown of thinkingness because he is confused enough not to be able to confront the unknownness of whereness unknownness of where requires more of the pc than the unknownness of idea because solids take more confront than ideas if you dont put him where he is in hurry he will keep adding delusion and significances in an effort to orient himself all the auditor has to do to shut it off is to find out where the pc has been and where he is but the auditor would have to have reality on the isness of the bank to know that thats the obvious thing to do dont pull the pcs attention to the arc break it just disorients him more and arc breaks him more 97 if you have trouble with nightmares figure out how the nightmare located you and figure out where you are locate yourself or run locational if you give the wrong command let the pc answer it then ask him the right command dont yank the pc up to pt to give an auditor reality on the bank you could run what unknown would you escape from attack use any verb form that gives reach and withdraw as valence process you could run think of an unknown who would escape from it attack it or think of being what unknown would he escape from attack when you find person who has somatics and has reality on the bank he is of course not in pt he has escaped by total withdrawal from some ancient environment this process gets them to do what they are doing escape from and attack what they are in which is the unconfrontable past environment you could use another process who would escape from attack things you can run who would you be willing to be rather not be the reason why beingness is functional is that part of valence package is track so every now and then someone runs on track thats not his own he sees himself always from the outside and gets thin impressions of himself he has the bank of each person into whose valence hes gone this is disorienting it gives him an unreality of location valence has bank skills disabilities etc the person entered it on the basis of being unable to control the valence or terminal so of course he cant have or control any of the mechanisms of the valence so you cannot move that bank he hasnt enough ownership of it to run engrams etc there was point where the pc got the valence thats the only point where the valence will break by auditing beings not ideas or pictures youll get the valences blowing off routine three is very effective but shortcut would be any beingness process eg think of being this will give his his own track back sometimes youll have pcs with tremendous numbers of pictures they dimly recognize as not theirs the pictures are not familiar they are thin this gives an unreality on past lives when thats the quality of the pictures off the track of course in his past life he was another beingness people who have had valence trouble go out of valence easily so they have lots of wrong pictures so you take an incident of vast confusion and motion one is not willing to tolerate because it occurs with target that isnt appropriate to the motion and it causes disorientation as you protest valence could occur in that way ordinarily one who was there would pick up the valence of someone else so that all subsequent track is seen from the wrong point of view and it all stems from total disorientation an auditor who has too much valence trouble has great reality on somebody elses bank because his bank isnt really his its very thin set of pictures run him back and youll hit some tremendous explosion when twenty spaceships collided thats the type of incident which makes valence transfer not some mind incident an auditor who has reality on past lives hasnt collided with his bank very hard its not reprehensible its just symptom of valence and bank trouble so the guy doesnt get his own pictures and has conception of being stuck in pictures hell worry about his auditing flubs and why he cant quite handle his pcs hell worry about his ability to audit hes trying to orient himself with datum the datum hes looking for is this 98 as long as he has low subjective reality of bank when pc gets into one his reality is not instantaneous so he will do little fumble or comm lag which causes an arc break because the pc loses confidence in the auditors ability to run the session its not that the person was trying to do something bad to the pc or that he didnt know scientology its just that his mechanisms of handling life have been escape from self into others and not getting in contact with the horrors of thenness the difficulties you encounter all come under the heading of auditor comm lag an auditors fumble is the unreality he has on what the pc is doing or going through you dont have time to remember the datum you have to know it and act instantaneously the only thing that teaches this is experiencing fumbling is not overcomable with rules and texts drill might help but it probably wouldnt because of outreality the only real cure is to audit the person enough to give him the reality however an auditor doesnt have to be cleared to learn to audit it would be nice but its not absolutely necessary the escape mechanism where person never tours the track surrenders fairly easily to auditing because it is based on another idea than that which degrades or aberrates thetan escape is simply method of handling bank not method of getting aberrated case deteriorates when the individual longer has confidence in himself as himself and thus adopts another packaged beingness to handle the situation then this beingness turns out not to be solution so he gets another etc etc and your backtrack of clearing could not be followed by the idea of escape because thats much too simple statement of the situation person can find himself inadequate in numerous ways besides the fact that they are trying to escape also there are situations when escape is wise but deterioration of confidence in ones own ability to handle life leads one to believe he must have another beingness in order to handle things for him now he starts living life on an irresponsibility eventually his adoption of new identities goes into the lifedeath cycle which is not at all usual in the life of thetans life invalidating the body and the valences gets down to the idea that the best thing to do is to chuck the mockup that just makes failure person ages to the degree that he feels invalidated the age of man in any lifetime is directly proportional to the accumulation of unknowns which of course is invalidation children probably grow up fast because they are moving through so much unknownness they have hope and confidence because they are growing up this hope is not necessarily justified person with valence trouble is especially effected by invalidation and is likely to have long lists of goals and terminals or to have more submerged goal there is positive correlation between the roughness of case and the length of time it would take you to find goal if you didnt take up the inval with rudiments invalidation could be said to be the basis of aberration how much inval person feels determines how aberrated he is give the auditor with slight reality on the track some auditing aimed at fixing his reality and his auditing will get better his invalidatability will decrease now he knows what hes doing and it was that which was in his road
