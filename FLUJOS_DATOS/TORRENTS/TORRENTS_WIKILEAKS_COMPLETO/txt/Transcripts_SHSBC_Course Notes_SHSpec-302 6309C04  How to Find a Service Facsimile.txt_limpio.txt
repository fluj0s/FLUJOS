6309c04 shspec302 how to find service facsimile apparently there is more to know about service facs than has been relayed probably because it is so simple pcs dont defend their service facs against discovery if you point the pc in the right direction he will go right to the service fac unless you prevent it so dont prevent it in assessing for service facs there is substitute for knowing what service fac is service fac is first tremendous solution always aberrated in pt as part of the pcs environment which the pc believes would result in his survival being threatened if it were disturbed it is something which others keep telling the pc is wrong causing him to assert that it is right this assertion of rightness is very integral and important to the service fac it makes the pc unauditable to the degree that he is getting auditing only to prove that it is right it sticks out like sore thumb one could have more trouble labeling it than finding it the human body is service fac but if we used that we would be going for ot and we arent shooting for that we are just using the service fac on this lifetime to get the pc auditable so the body isnt the service fac that we are trying to target having found service fac we dont use it to make an ot we are only trying to get someone auditable and to get the constantly restimulated solutions out of the way to clear this lifetime on the whole track obviously having bank is service facsimile that accounts for the reluctance to go clear noticed earlier while finding goals being incapable could still be service fac at an ot level if say the ot couldnt tilt planet but attacking this kind of service fac directly is too steep gradient you could run service facs at all different levels the concept of service fac is based on confusion and stable datum theory in running service fac we are attacking solution that is barrier to getting rid of confusion you can pluck the stable datum out of the center of confusion and thus get discharge of the energy of the confusion stable datum holds confusion in place this is the reverse of using stable datum to handle confusion charge is an electrical confusion as long as stable datum holds confusion in place the confusion will not discharge confusions are tolerable and are not always aberrative most have aberrative value eg in card game life is not in itself an aberrative action there has to be some force and violence involved in the confusion or at least fairly real threat to survival for it to be aberrative the thetan knows that if he ceases to dramatize service fac he will die the immediate thing someone is worried about may not be the service facsimile itself it could be the consequence of something else that is service fac the consequence could be very hidden the two things could have at best faint connection as you take off service facs the central one on which they all lean eventually comes off as you audit the case you could get off several before the central one comes to view the apparent service facs lean on the main service fac rote procedure to apply to this would be logical solution to very illogical area but it is better to understand what you are doing if the case has been audited you could collect list of things that have been found on the pc eg old lists r212 assessments etc by discussing them with the pc and following the pcs interest you could find some service facs you might have to reword some of the things you come up with the rightwrong bracket is always the same the question is how would the condition or thing found make you right and make others wrong the service fac is the pc it is something he has it is not like an oppterm it is something he has to make him right and others wrong the pc will slop on the auditing command eg the pc may misduplicate the auditing command as what would be made wrong by it you dont worry about this let the automaticity run out then reask your original question and get it answered service facsimile is not an action an action would be the result of service fac the service fac turns on automaticities because it is an automatic unanalyzed solution for this reason you dont run it as repetitive process automaticity means that more answers than the pc can articulate are arriving from the bank when this happens when words are coming too fast you know that you are getting the service fac throw the question in and let the lions tear at it for awhile let the automaticity run out let er buck when the pc starts to run then when he runs out of answers turn it around and run it the other way if he hasnt already done it himself you are trying to get rid of the avalanche of automaticity and get ta also dont overrun by insisting on more answers than the pc has or you can get stuck flow run it permissively it is sometimes difficult to keep the pc answering the question just because he is in dissociated area the solution is holding back tremendous amount of aberration which wont asis as long as the solution is there the solution just keeps accumulating mass the solution is always below 20 on the tone scale because it is perforce substitute for an itsa line the pc felt that he could not itsa the object that he was trying to make wrong so he dreamed up this solution as final solution and that is substitute for an itsa line then there is asisness or itsa on the environment since there is asisness you get an accumulation of mass since it is substitute for an itsa line the service fac is referred to whenever the pc refers to anything when the solution is below 20 it propounds the idea that to survive it is necessary to succumb that is what it boils down to aberrated though that is for instance the solution may be not eating as in anorexia nervosa the service fac doesnt even have to fit in with the guys environment it is often totally hidden you cant necessarily spot the service fac by what the person is doing it often goes underground especially the very hidden ones some are very obvious too sometimes so obvious that you miss them you could ask as an l and h question what do you think your service fac is interest is the keynote the service fac is not deliberate solution it is subawareness automatic solution which the person is on the verge of all the time that is what makes service facs easy to spot if youve got the service fac the pc cant stay out of it it has to be specific enough you can use represent on something that is too general you can assess the list according to interest the pc tends to fall into the whirlpool of the service fac if the pc has fragile tone arm easily stuck then youve got service fac solution there that is preventing the charge from running off the pc doesnt have to look at things hes got it solved once you have the service fac get the pc to tell you how in this lifetime it would make him right etc dont go for the backtrack this improves the pcs ability to get ta action the peculiarity of the action you are looking for is not particularly great compared with the peculiarity of social mores but it is posing as survival when it clearly isnt prosurvival the pc will be interested in it and it will get ta because it is fixed solution your main interest is ta action just get the mass flowing that was hanging up service fac is fixed contrasurvival solution which the person hasnt inspected it could even be fixed survival solution but then that wouldnt interfere with auditing however using conduct as criterion makes anyone liable to be put away service fac is batty when compared not to the mores of society but to actual survival so you could say the following about service fac 1 it is contrasurvival but poses as survival 2 it has the pcs interest 3 it sticks the tone arm 4 it is always protruded into pt thus any constant ptp can contain service fac for instance you could ask what did you come into scientology to resolve that is one reason that service fac processing is beneficial however it is dangerous to list too many problems on pc because you are giving the pc too much whatsit while an incomplete list will arc break the pc so you had better twoway comm it use friendly discussion so you can move out of it if it gets sticky dont list it when you find an appropriate problem find the solution in back of it and that fixed solution will give you the service fac if the discussion does get sticky you could free up the ta again by asking for solution that the pc has had to each problem he mentions getting fixed solution means that youve got the service fac notice that r1c and r2c are designed to strip away solutions and stable data therefore they are not likely to freeze up the ta find out if the pc has run r1c and r2c you can use this for data you can ask what the pc found interesting dont ask what problems would that solve that sticks the ta assess it then you can get the service fac the r3r preliminary assessment is almost deadcenter pitch at the service fac providing it winds up with statable solution this solution should be something that makes sense to you and the pc getting the item with the pcs interest will give you the service fac the level assessed will be too broad the service fac is magnet you are asking for right answers and the pc is giving you the rightest answer of all you can even get the service fac as nonsequitur item on list so watch for service facs on any list the fact that the item that is service fac is dissociated gives you clue the pc will handle your session with his service fac eventually it downs on you what he has been doing keep running service facs until you get change in the pc and free needle and good ta the service fac is the source of the ptp that the pc keeps coming to session with so getting it saves you all sorts of time and trouble when you get it out of the way get rid of the service fac and overrestimulation of the case ends this would reduce by 50 the total restimulation on the case so cases wouldnt keep dropping between sessions because of environmental restimulation having the pcs attention on disabilities keeps his attention off the bank thus good handling of service facs increases by hundred to one the runability of the case so you can now run him on steeper gradient
