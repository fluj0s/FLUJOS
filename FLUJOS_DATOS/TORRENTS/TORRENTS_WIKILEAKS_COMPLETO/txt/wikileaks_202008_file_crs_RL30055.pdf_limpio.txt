health and human services office of assistant secretary for planning and evaluation 1998 data are from the 1994 national longterm care survey nationally representative sample of functionally impaired medicare beneficiaries living in the communityinitiative included tax credit for functionally andor cognitively impaired persons of all ages and authority for the office of personnel management opm to offer group longterm care insurance for federal employees retirees and their families6 about 4 million persons age 65 and over living in the community are estimated to need longterm care assistance due to functional disability the need for long term care is measured by need for assistance with activities of daily living adl andor instrumental activities of daily living iadls functional disability is defined as the inability to perform without human andor mechanical assistance the following activities of daily living adls dressing eating bathing moving around indoors transferring from bed to chair and toileting it is also measured by the inability to perform certain instrumental activities of daily living iadls including light housekeeping meal preparation shopping taking medications and managing money among others of the 4 million older persons with any functional disability over half need assistance with one or more adls and almost 40 need assistance with iadls only research on disability and longterm care has documented the enormous responsibilities that families face in caring for relatives who are living in the community and who have significant impairments data from the 1994 national longterm care survey sponsored by the department of health and human services dhhs indicate that over 7 million persons provide 120 million hours of informal that is unpaid care to about 42 million functionally disabled older persons each week these data conclude that if the work of these caregivers were to be replaced by paid home care costs would range from 45 billion to 94 billion annually moreover research has shown that the informal or unpaid care provided by family members can prevent or delay entry into longterm care facilities7 data from the 1994 survey and previous surveys indicate that most persons who need longterm care receive formal or paid assistance most assistance they receive is provided by family members almost 60 of impaired elderly rely exclusively on informal care provided by family members typically elderly persons rely on their spouses and adult children for assistance the national family caregiver support program authorized by pl 106501 is intended to meet some of the needs of family caregivers it authorizes 125 million in grants to state agencies on aging to establish the family caregiver support program for fy2001 congress appropriated 125 million for the program the legislation authoriz the following services information to caregivers about available services assistance to caregivers in gaining access to serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30055crs5 individual counseling organization of support groups and caregiver training respite services to provide families temporary relief from caregiving responsibilities and supplemental services such as respite adult day care or home care services for example on limited basis that would complement care provided by family and other informal caregivers all caregivers eligible to receive services could receive information and assistance and individual counseling access to support groups and caregiver training services that tend to be more individualized such as respite home care and adult day care would be directed to persons who have specific care needs these are defined in the law as persons who are unable to perform at least two activities of daily living adl without substantial human assistance including verbal reminding or supervision or due to cognitive or other mental impairment require substantial supervision because of behavior that poses serious health or safety hazard to the individual or other individuals adls include bathing dressing toileting transferring from bed or chair eating and getting around inside the home priority is to be given to older persons and their families who have the greatest social and economic need with particular attention to low income individuals and to older persons who provide care and support to persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities in addition under certain circumstances grandparents and certain other caregivers of children may receive services the law allows states to establish costsharing policies for individuals who would receive respite and supplemental services provided under the program that is persons could be required to contribute toward the cost of services received funds are to be allotted to states based on states share of the total population aged 70 and over however persons under age 70 would be eligible for caregiver services the federal matching share for the specified caregiver services is 75 with the remainder to be paid by states this is lower federal matching rate than is applied to other title iii services such as congregate and homedelivered nutrition services and other supportive services where the federal matching rate is 85 in its proposal the clinton administration projected that the 125 million level would provide one or more of the caregiver support services to about 250000 families each year the number of persons served will be affected by several factors including the number of persons who meet the specified eligibility requirements and actually apply for services capabilities and readiness of service providers and relative spending by states on specific services consolidation of older americans act programs the law that existed prior to pl 106501 authorized 20 programs although some had never been funded major issue in the 106th congress but especially in the two prior congresses was congressional initiative to streamline the act in part by consolidating separately authorized programs some members of congress wanted to simplify certain requirements of law and consolidate smaller programs the house bill as originally approved by the house committee on education and labor in 1999 would have reduced the number of authorized programs to 11 amonghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30055crs6 8 for example hr 782 would have eliminated separate title authorizing appropriations for research training and demonstration activities that are the responsibility of the assistant secretary for aging instead hr 782 would have authorized these activities under title i s 1536 would have retained the separate title hr 782 would have consolidated authorizations of appropriations for the longterm care ombudsman and elder abuse prevention programs on the other hand s 1536 would have retained separate authorization of appropriations for ombudsman elder abuse prevention programsother things it would have eliminated separate title but not authorization for training research and demonstration activities in the field of aging s 1536 as approved by the senate committee on health education labor and pensions in 2000 would have reduced the number of programs to 158 both bills would have eliminated authority for number of programs that had never been funded pl 106501 did not consolidate major programs but eliminated authority for programs that had not received funding in fy2000 and prior years as well as authority for number of demonstration projects for example the law eliminated authority for the federal council on aging and assistance for special needs and separate authority for schoolbased meals and intergenerational activities also eliminated was authority for supportive activities for caregivers and inhome services for the frail elderly which may be funded under the title iii supportive services program and the family caregiver

required by appropriation committee directives for many years other issues included concerns that funding to the 10 national organizations washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30055crs9 9us general accounting office senior community service employment program delivery could be improved through legislative and administrat ive actions gaohehs964 november 1995 10this has been longstanding issue for example in the 1978 reauthorization of the older americans act the senate labor and human resources committee expressed concern about the circumvention by the appropriations committee of the authorizing committee formulaawarded by dol on noncompetitive basis and about how much funding was used by the organizations for administration general accounting office gao report completed in 1995 focused attention on these issues gao reviewed dols method of awarding funds the allocation of funds to states and grantee use of funds it concluded that the program could be improved by assuring more equitable distribution of funds nationally by enforcing statutory limits on use of funds for administration and by applying procedures for competition for funds by sponsors among other things9 like the 104th and 105th congress reauthorizat ion proposals hr 782 and s 1536 would have restructured the program in part to respond to the gao findings although they differed in approach both proposals gave states more control of the administration of the program and introduced competition for funds among prospective grantee organizations the bills made changes in 1 the distribution of funds by the federal government 2 formula allocations to grantees and 3 requirements regarding use of funds by grantees for administration and other enrollee costs these and other issues and their resolution in pl 106501 are discussed below distribution of community service employment funds by the federal govern ment for many years appropriations committee directives stipulated that national organizations were to receive 78 of the total title v funds and states 2210 the committee directives differed from the authorizing statute that was in force the statute stipulated that funds be awarded to national public and nonprofit private organizations at the level they received funds in 1978 55 of any funds in excess of the 1978 funding level was to be distributed to state agencies and 45 to national organizations however for most years since 1978 the appropriations committee directives stipulated the 7822 split of funds in its 1995 report gao noted that there is inequitable distribution of funding within some states as well as duplication of effort among national and state sponsors some state agencies have had longstanding concerns about the duplicatio n of national organizations activities that is caused by the distribution of funds to multiple organizations within state in addition states maintained that because they administer only 22 of total funds in state their ability to coordinate operations of the program is very limited in many states multiple national organizations administer programs in addition to designated state agency usually the state agency on aging for example in six states each with title v fy2000 funding of 15 million or more eight or nine national sponsors administer the program in addition to the state agency california florida new york ohio pennsylvania and texas in most states at least three or four national organizations administer the program in addition to the state agencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30055crs10 11for purposes of allocation of funds and determining the fy2000 hold harmless amount level of activities is defined as the number of authorized positions multiplied by the cost per authorized position cost per authorized position is defined as the sum of 1 the hourly minimum wage specified in the fair labor standards act of 1938 multiplied by 1092 hours 21 hours times 52 weeks 2 an amount equal to 11 of the above amount to cover federal payments for fringe benefits and 3 an amount determined by the secretary to cover federal payments for all other remaining program and administrative coststhese concerns lead to various proposals during the 104th 105th and 106th congress to restructure the program primarily by giving states more authority over the program and by increasing their share of total funding and decreasing the national organizations share proponents of shifting funds to states indicated that costs of program administration and duplication of effort would decrease since there would be fewer organizations to administer the program within state proponents also said that giving states more leverage in funding decisions would increase coordination of effort among all grantees in states the restructuring of the senior commun ity service employment program generated substantial controversy during the 104th and 105th congresses and the controversy continued during the 106th congress some national organization grantees expressed concern that their continued existence would be threatened if more program funding were to be shifted to states they were also concerned that restructuring could result in disruption of jobs for some existing enrollees number of organizations and some members of congress indicated that the program operated well under the national organizations administration and that because of their long standing association they had the needed expertise to continue administering the majority of funds both hr 782 and s 1536 would have changed the 7822 split of funds between national organizations and states and transferred more funds to states however they took different approaches hr 782 would have gradually transferred funds to states so that by fy2004 national organizations would have received 55 of total funds and state agencies would have received 45 s1536 would have applied different division of funds to national organizations and state agencies only when total funding exceeded the fy2000 appropriations level pl 106501 ultimately retains the 7822 split by requiring that state agencies and national organizations be held harmless at their fy2000 level of activities that is they are to receive less than the amount they received in fy2000 to maintain the fy2000 level of activity11 but when appropriations exceed the fy2000 level proportionately more funds are to be distributed to state grantees specifically any excess in appropriations over the fy2000 level up to the first 35 million is to be allocated so that 75 will be provided to states and 25 to national organizations funds appropriated above the first 35 million in excess of the fy2000 level are to be divided equally between state agencies and national organizations when appropriations are in excess of the amount needed to maintain the fy2000 hold harmless level the excess is to be allotted among the states according to stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30055crs11 relative population aged 55 and over and its relative per capita income the relative population and per capita income factors were contained in prior law but each state is to receive percentage increase over its fy2000 allotment that is at least 30 of the percentage increase in the total appropriation over the fy2000 amount use of funds for enrollee wagesfringe benefits administration and other enrollee costs title v funds are used for 1 enrollee wages and fringe benefits 2 administration and 3 other enrollee costs for many years dol regulations required that at least 75 of funds be used for enrollee wages and fringe benefits but this was never specified by law by law grantees are allowed to use up to 135 of federal funds for administration and up to 15 of federal funds under waiver approved by secretary of dol any remaining funds may be used for other enrollee costs including for example recruitment and orientation of enrollees and supportive services for enrollees among other things in its review of the program gao found that most national organizations and some state sponsors had budgeted administrative costs in excess of the statutory limit by inappropriately classifying them as other enrollee costs thus increasing the total amount for administration above the statutory limits during consideration of the reauthorization some members of congress noted that there should be legislative language clarifying the classification of these activities in order to avoid use of program funds for administration in excess of the statutory limit as gao found in the past in response to this concern and to clarify the various cost categories pl 106 501 defines administrative costs and programmatic costs as follows definition of administrative costs costs of administration are personnel and nonpersonnel and direct and indirect costs associated with the following accounting budgeting financial and cash management procurement and purchasing property management personnel management payroll coordinating the resolution of audits reviews investigations and incident reports audits general legal services development of systems and procedures including informati on systems required for administration and oversight and monitoring administration also includes goods and services used for administration travel and information systems related to administration pl 106501 retains the prior law limit on administrative costs that is grantee may use up to 135 of its funds with waiver up to 15 for administration the law also requires that to the maximum extent practicable title v grantees provide for payment of administrative expenses from nonfederal sourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30055crs12 programmatic activities funds not used for administration are to be used for programmatic activities this includes primarily enrollee wages and fringe benefits including physical exams the law stipulates that less than 75 of grant funds be used to pay wages and fringe benefits the remainder of funds may be used for enrollee training job placement assistance including job development and search assistance enrollee supportive services including transportation health and medical services special jobrelated or personal counseling incidentals work shoes badges uniforms eyeglasses and tools child and adult care temporary shelter and followup services and outreach recruitment and selection intake orientation and assessments performance standards one of the areas that was under discussion during the 104th and 105th congresses was the need to establish performance standards for title v grantees this discussion continued during the 106th congress and ultimately pl 106501 added new provisions requiring the secretary of labor to establish standards and performance indicators addressing the following areas number of persons served with particular consideration to individuals with greatest economic or social need poor employment history or prospects and those over the age of 60 community services provided placement and retention into unsubsidized public or private employment satisfacti on of enrollees employers and their host agencies with the experiences and services provided and any additional indicators determined appropriation by the secretary the law set up procedures for corrective action if grantee or subgrantee of the state does not achieve specified levels of performance this may include transferring funds from the granteesubgrantee under competition requirements in certain circumstances negligent or fraudulent activities of project grantees in the past gao performed audits of national organizations and found that title v funds allotted to certain national organizations were used inappropriately during the 106th congress there was concern among some members of congress about the findings of an audit of the national council of senior citizens ncsc title v grant by the inspector general ig of dol the ncsc is the second largest of the national organization recipients in fy2000 it received 643 million representing 15 of the total title v appropriation in february 1999 the ig issued final audit of ncsc and its successor grantee the national senior citizens education and research center nscerc the audit covered operations of the grantee for 19921994 it questioned more than 6 million of total of more than 180 million audited partially in response to these audit findings pl 106501 adds provisions designed to assure that title v applicants are capable of administering federal funds the law adds set of responsibility tests that applicants must meet in order to receive funds failure to meet the following two tests would establish that the applicant is not responsible to administer federal funds unsuccessful efforts by the organization tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30055crs13 recover debts established by dol and failure to comply with requirements for debt repayment and established fraud or criminal activity other responsibility tests include the presence of serious administrative deficiencies willful obstruction of the audit process and failure to correct deficiencies among other things coordination of state and national organization grantee operations recurring issue during the review of the program has been concern by some observers about the lack of coordination among project grantees within states including the distribution of employment positions within states as mentioned earlier in some states seven or eight grantees administer the program along with state agencies pl 106501 contains provisions designed to address coordination among the various grantees it adds new requirements for state senior employment services plan each governor is required to submit to the secretary of dol an annual plan that will identify the number of persons eligible for the program and their characteristics and distribution within the state the plan must also include description of the planning process used to ensure the participation of relevant agencies and organizations with an interest in employment of older persons including state and area agencies on aging national organizations administering the title v program and state and local workforce investment boards among others the secretary of dol is required to monitor state implementation of these requirements to assure that the statewide planning and coordination of title v activities are taking place placement of participants in the private sector and in other unsubsidized employment the purpose of title v is to place lowincome older individuals with poor employment prospects in subsidized employment so that they may increase their income and provide source of labor to expand community services while this goal substantially defines the program in the past legislative provisions have given some attention to placement of participants in unsubsidized employment for example amendments to the act in 1981 required dol to use some title v funds for experimental projects designed to place participants in second career training and in private business section 502e of the act in addition dol regulations have required that grantees attempt to achieve placement of enrollees in unsubsidized employment the regulations require that each grantee strive to place at least 20 of their authorized positions in unsubsidized employment generally projects have been successful at meeting or exceeding this goal pl 106501 further emphasizes the role of the program regarding unsubsidized private placement of enrollees in number of ways first it states that the purpose of title v includes not only placement of participants in community service activities but also placement of participants in the private sector second it increases the amount of funds to be spent by the secretary on projects to place participants in unsubsidized employment to 15 of total funds rather than 1 to 3 of the amount above the 1978 hold harmless amount required by prior law this would mean for example that the secretary would have to reserve 66 million of fy2000 funds 4402 million for section 502e projects rather than the 24 million that was set aside in fy2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30055crs14 12there is usually 2year time lag in availability of estimates of state population from the us census bureauthird the law codifies the regulation regarding placement of enrollees into unsubsidized employment the secretary is required to establish as part of the performance measures requirement that grantees place at least 20 of enrollees into unsubsidized employment the law defines placement into public or private unsubsidized employment as full or parttime employment in the public or private sector by an enrollee for 30 days within 90day period without using federal or state subsidy program coordination with the workforce investment system the workforce investment act wia was enacted in 1998 with the aim of consolidating and coordinating employment and training programs across the nation pl 106501 establishes number of requirements aimed at coordinating the title v program with the workforce investment system established by wia among other things it requires that title v projects to participate in onestop delivery systems in the local workforce investment area established under wia it also allows assessments of older individuals for participation in either title v projects or under wia subtitle b of title i to be used for the other program and deems title v participants to be eligible under title i of wia interstate funding formula for supportive and nutrition services the way in which the administration on aging aoa distributes nutrition and supportive funds to states continued to be of concern in the 106th congress as it was in the 104th and 105th congresses in general prior law required aoa to distribute title iii funds for supportive and nutrition services to states based on their relative share of the population aged 60 and older in addition to specifying certain minimum funding amounts the law contained hold harmless provision requiring that state receive less than it received in fy1987 pl 106501 changed the requirements regarding the formula distribution by way of background prior to the recent law change aoa distributed funds for supportive and nutrition services in the following way first states were allotted funds in an amount equal to their fy1987 allocations which were based on estimates of each states relative share of the total population age 60 and older in 198512 second the balance of the appropriation was allotted to states based on their relative share of the population aged 60 and over as derived from the most recently available estimates of state population and third state allotments were adjusted to assure that the minimum grant requirements are met the effect of this methodology was that the majority of funds were distributed according to population estimates that do not reflect the most recent populatio n trends for example for fy1999 85 of total title iii funds was distributed according to the fy1987 hold harmless the remainder of funds appropriated was distributed according to 1997 population data the method that aoa used to meet the 1987 hold harmless provision has been criticized in 1994 report gao concluded that title iii funds were not distributedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30055crs15 13us general accounting office older americans act title iii funds not distrib uted according to statute gaohehs9437 january 1994according to the requirements of the statute13 gao concluded that the method employed by aoa did not distribute funds proportionately according to states relative share of the older population based on the most recent population data and therefore negatively affected states whose older population is growing faster than others gao recommended that aoa revise its method to allot funds to states first on the basis of the most current population estimates and then adjust the allotments to meet the hold harmless and statutory minimum requirements pl 106501 followed the gao recommendation by requiring that funds be distributed according to the most recent data on states relative share of persons 60 years and older the law then stipulates that state would receive less than it received in fy2000 thereby creating fy2000 hold harmless requirement the intent of this approach is to have funding distributed first according to the most recent population data as compared to the prior methodology which distributed the majority of funds to states based on state population data that was 13 years old but at the same time assuring that individual state allotments would not go below their fy2000 levels if appropriations for title iii services increase over the fy2000 level the effect of the proposal would be that states which are gaining larger share of the total us population over 60 years compared to other states would receive proportionately larger share of the increased appropriation however the 1987 hold harmless would still affect the distribution of funds up to the current hold harmless threshold since the fy2000 hold harmless amount is effectively based on the 1987 amount congress also wanted to assure that if there were an increase in appropriations over the fy2000 level each state would receive share of the increase therefore the law requires that each state will receive at least 20 of the percentage increase in the total allotment over the fy2000 amount targeting of services to lowincome minority older persons low income minority older persons targeting of services to lowincome minority older persons continued to be subject of review during the 106th congress as it has during past reauthorizations of the act bills in the 104th and 105th congresses would have deleted either some or most of current law provisions regarding targeting services to minority older individuals the deletion of these provisions became quite controversial with some members of congress as well as with national aging organizations some members wanted deletion of the targeting provisions to create level playing field for services among all elderly but still wanted to keep references to those in greatest social and economic need others held that since minority elderly are most disadvant aged with respect to certain need characteristics such as income the special targeting provisions should have been maintainedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30055crs16 pl 106501 retained all prior law provisions regarding targeting to low income minority individuals these include requirements that state and area agencies on aging target services to persons in greatest social and economic need with particular attention on lowincome minority older persons it requires that states in developing their intrastate funding formulas take into account the distribution within the state of persons with the greatest economic and social need with particular attention to low income minority older persons it also requires that the agencies set specific objectives for serving lowincome minority older persons and that program development advocacy and outreach efforts be focused on these groups service providers are required to meet specific objectives set by area agencies for providing services to lowincome minority older persons and area agencies are required to describe in their area plans how they have met these objectives older persons residing in rural areas many advocates maintain that service needs of older persons in rural area are often overlooked delivery of social services in rural areas may be particularly difficult due to the lack of service personnel and high transportation costs among other things during the 106th congress some members of congress were concerned that the act did not place enough focus on the needs of older persons living in rural and sparsely populated areas in order to respond to this concern pl 106501 contains number of new provisions that are designed to recognize the special problems of older persons in rural areas among other things the law requires that in providing services and in developi ng planning objectives state and area agencies take into consideration the needs of persons in rural areas in addition state agencies are required to consider the needs of rural older persons when developing advocacy and systems development activities costsharing for services by older persons one of the most frequent issues to arise in past reauthorization legislation has been whether the act should allow mandatory cost sharing for certain social services under longstanding federal policy mandatory fees for older americans act services have been prohibited but nutrition and supportive services providers have always been encouraged to solicit voluntary contributions from older persons toward the costs of services congress has intended that older persons not be denied service because they will not or cannot make contribution funds collected through voluntary contributions are to be used to expand services prior to the 104th and 105th congresses members resisted proposals to allow older americans act programs to conduct costsharing for services since the late 1980s state and area agencies on aging have been in favor of policy that would allow them to impose costsharing for certain services arguing in part that such policy would eliminate barriers to coordinatio n with other state funded services programs that do require costsharing such as home care and adult day care services they also have argued that costsharing would improve targeting of services if costsharin g policies were to be applied to persons who have higher incomes while exempting low income personshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30055crs17 some representatives of aging services programs such as those representing minorityethnic elderly have been opposed to costshari ng arguing in part that mandatory costsharing policy would discourage participation by lowincome and minority older persons they have also argued that costsharing would create welfare stigma for older americans act programs which has not existed because of the absence of means testing or costsharing policies the clinton administrations proposed that state agencies be allowed to conduct costsharing for certain services with limitations it specified that certain services be exempted from costsharing policies the senate and house proposals differed on costsharing hr 782 would have retained the voluntary nature of contributions but s 1536 contained elements of the administrations proposal and added other requirements pl 106501 ultimately made distinction between costsharing for certain services and voluntary contributions by older persons the law contains the following provisions costsharing the law allows states to implement cost sharing by recipients for certain services there are exceptions however costsharing would not be permitted for the following services information and assistance outreach benefits counseling case management ombudsman elder abuse prevention legal assistance consumer protection services congregate and homedelivered nutrition services and services delivered through tribal organizations states may not apply costsharing for services to persons who have low income defined as income at or below the federal poverty level and from considering assets savings or other property owned by individuals when creating sliding scale for cost sharing or when seeking contributions in addition states may exclude from their costsharing policies other low income persons who have income above the poverty level costsharing must be applied on sliding scale based on income and the cost of services income is to be established by individuals on confidential self declaration basis with requirement for verification service providers and area agencies on aging would be prohibited from denying services to older individuals due to their income or failure to make costsharing payments the law requires the secretary to conduct an evaluation of costsharing practices that are conducted by states in order to determine the impact of these practices on participation under the act the evaluation is to be conducted at least 1 year after enactment and annually thereafter voluntary contributions the law provides that each recipient of services have an opportunity to voluntarily contribute toward the cost of all services it stipulates that voluntary contributions must be allowed and may be solicited for all services provided under the act as long as the method of solicitation is non coercive among other things older persons may not be denied services if they do not contribute toward the costs of serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30055crs18 the law requires that both the costsharing and the voluntary contributions policies protect the privacy of each recipient of services state and area agencies must establish appropriate procedures to safeguard and account for cost share payments and use funds collected through cost sharing to expand services for which payment was made
