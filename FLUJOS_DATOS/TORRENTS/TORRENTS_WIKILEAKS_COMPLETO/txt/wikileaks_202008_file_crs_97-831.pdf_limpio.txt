environment and natural resources policy division november 20 2008 abstract section 303d of the clean water act requires states to identify waters that are impaired by pollution even after application of pollution controls for those waters states must establish total maximum daily load tmdl of pollutants to ensure that water quality standards can be attained implementation was dormant until states and epa were prodded by lawsuits the tmdl program has become controversial in part because of requirements and costs now facing states to implement this 35yearold provision of the law as well as industries cities farmers and others who may be required to use new pollution controls to meet tmdl requirements in july 2000 epa issued revisions to strengthen the program the rule was widely criticized and congressional interest was high the 2000 rule did not go into eï¬€ect and in march 2003 epa withdrew the rule to consider whether to issue an entirely new rule or other options timetable has been announced consequently the program continues to operate under regulations issued in 1992 congress has several options to address tmdl issues which remain contentious but whether it will do so in the 111th congress is unknown for nowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97831 order code 97831 updated november 20 2008 clean water act and total maximum daily loads tmdls of pollutants claudia

strengthen the program the rule was widely criticized and congressional interest was high the 2000 rule did not go into effect and in march 2003 epa withdrew the rule to consider whethe r to issue an entirely new rule or other options timetable has been announced consequently the program continues to operate under regulations issued in 1992 congress has several options to address tmdl issues which remain contentious but whether it will do so in the 111th congress is unknown for now background the clean water act cwa contains number of complex elements of overall water quality management foremost is th requirement in section 303 that states establish ambient water quality standards for water bodies consisting of the designated use or uses of water body eg recreationa l public water supply or industrial water supply and the water quality criteria which ar necessary to protect the use or uses through permitting states or the envir onmental protection agency epa impose wastewater discharge limits on individual indus trial and municipal facilities to ensure that water quality standards are attained however congress recognized in the act that in many cases pollution controls implemented by industry and cities would be insufficient due to pollutant contri butions from other unregulated sources httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97831crs2 under section 303d of the act states must identify lakes rivers and streams for which wastewater discharge limits are not stri ngent enough to achieve established water quality standards after impleme ntation of technologybased controls by industrial and municipal dischargers for each water body states are required to set total maximum daily load tmdl of pollutants at level that ensures that applicable water quality standards can be attained nd maintained tmdl is ssentially pollution budget quantitative estimate of what it takes to ach ieve state water quality goals setting the maximum amount of pollution water body can receive without vi olating water quality standards including margin of safety if state fails to do this epa is required to develop priority list for the state and ma ke its own tmdl determination tmdl is both planning process for attaining water quality standards and quantitative assessment of problems pollution sources and pollutant reductions needed to restore and protect river stream or lake tm dls may address all pollution s ources including point sources such as municipal sewage or industrial plan t discharges nonpoint sources such as runoff from roads farm fields and forests and na turally occurring sources such as runoff from undisturbed lands the tmdl itself does not establish new regu latory controls on sources of pollution however when tmdls are established muni cipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants may be required to install new po llution control technology states and epa enforce the tmdls through revisions to existing permits which include the pollutant limits and schedule for compliance for waters impaired by nonpoint source runoff because there are federal controls over th sources under the clean water act the primary implementation measures are stat erun nonpoint source ma nagement programs coupled with state local and federal nd management programs and authorities and financial assistance programs for example farmers and ranchers may be asked to use alternative methods in their operations to prevent fertilizer s and pesticides from reaching streams states may requi re cities to manage or c ontrol runoff from streets implementation epa acknowledges that vigorous tmdl program is needed because significant water quality problems persist in the nations waters more than 30 years after enactment of the cwa tmdls are one element of state water quality management programs other activities include standard setting monitoring permitting and enforcement integrating them with the tmdl program is difficult because of factors such as different program purposes and schedules most stat have lacked the resources to do tmdl analyses which involve complex assessm ent in order to ascribe and quantify environmental effects for particular discharge sources baseline water quality monitoring data for the analyses to identify impaired waters and pollution sources is limited epa has both been reluctant to intervene in the states and has also lacked resources to do so itself thus there was little implementation of the provi sion which was enacted in 1972 only in 1992 did epa issue regulations requiring states every two years to list waters that do not attain water quality standards and establish tmdls to restore water quality responding to the failure of both states and epa to meet these requirements however environmental groups filed lawsuits in 38 states in the last few years environmentalists see impleme ntation of section 303d as important both to achieving the overall goals and objectives of the act nd pressuring epa and states to address nonpoint and other sources which are responsible for many water qua lity impairmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97831crs3 1 for summary of tmdl litigation by state see information on epas website http wwwepagovowowtm dllawsuithtml 2 this is longer time frame than has been ma ndated as result of some of the tmdl litigation the schedules for tmdls in lawsuits concluded by consent decrees and settlement agreements range from 4 years to 20 years most call for 10year development schedulenationwide but have not been controlled up to this point of the suits tried or settled 22 resulted in court orde rs requiring expeditious tmdl development by states or epa the tmdl litigation falls into five gene ral categories according to epa 1 situations in which stat has failed to perform any section 303d activities 2 situations in which state has engaged in some but insufficient activities to implement section 303d 3 challenges to epas listing of impaired wa ters tmdl approval decisions or epas promulgation of tmdls 4 situations in which plaintiffs are using tmdl requirements to achieve other cwa obj ectives such as forcing improved water quality monitoring programs and 5 challenges to the substance or content of tmdls1 because of the lawsuits and existing requi rements of the law in august 1997 epa issued interpretive guidance which for the first time called on states to develop longterm schedules for implementing tmdls under that guidance epa directed states to establish tmdls in order to meet water quality standards within 8 to 13 years2 development of tmdls is increasing ce 1996 states and epa have developed more than 34000 but many more remain to be co mpleted the most recent state 303d lists submitted in 2004 and 2006 identified over 41000 waterbodies as not meeting water quality standards aff ecting more than 300000 miles of rivers and shorelines and 5 million acres of lakes in august 1999 epa proposed revisions to the tmdl regulations to clarify and strengthen the program the key proposed changes included new requirement for more comprehensive list of impaired and thr eatened waterbodies new requirement that states territories and authorized indian tribes establish and submit schedules for establishing tmdls new requirement that the listing methodologies be more specific subject to public review and submitted to epa clarification that tmdls include 10 specific elements new requirement for an implementation plan in tmdls and new public participati on requirements epas proposal had few strong supporters fo r varying reasons states which would be directly affected by th proposal criticized the burdens that new requirements would place on them they are concerned that they lack the resources to meet tight deadlines for developing and implementing tmdls further states say that tmdls should not necessarily be prioritiz ed over and should be integrated with other elements of existing water quality management pr ograms industry groups ar greatly concerned about impacts of new pollution control requirements but municipa l and industrial point source groups urge states and epa to ensure that tmdl requirements do not fall disproportionately on their discharges while possibly failing to address nonpoint source contributions to impaired waters farm groups and others with nonpoint discharges question epas authority to include nonpoint source pollution in the tmdl program the forestry industry vigorously criticiz ed potential impacts of the proposal environmentalists who support the need for stronger and more comprehensive tmdlhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97831crs4 3 during the 106th congress hearings were held by the house agriculture committee house transportation and infrastructure committee senate

and revisions to the national pollutant discharge elimination system program in support of revisions to the water quality planning and management regulation final rules 65 federal register 135 july 13 2000 pp 4358643670program objected to the lengthy time pe riods in the proposal before water quality improvements are likely to occur they have criticized the lack of aggressive implementation of program that has existed in the law since 1972 congressional interest was high by the time the final rule was signed in july 2000 13 congressional hearings had b een held and number of gislative proposals to modify the clean water act or delay the rule had been introduced3 epa attempted to respond to the criticism with flexibility on some of the most contentious points while the revised rule was undergoing final review congre ss adopted provision in the fy2001 military constructionsfy2000 urgent supplemental ppropriations bill stating that funds may be used in fy2000 or fy2001 to make final determination on or implement any new rule relative to the august 1999 proposal because president clinton intended to sign the bill into law but opposed the tm dl provision the administration accelerated its review allowing the epa administrator to sign it before president clinton signed the appropriations bill on july 13 pl 106246 in the final rule epa acknowledged congresss action in the legislation and delayed the effective date of the rules changes until october 31 2001 the text of the final rule was published on july 13 20004 the final rule built on the existing regulatory program and added details specific requirements and deadlines requiring states to implement plans to clean up polluted waters it retained key elements of the 1999 proposal for more comprehensive identification of impaired waters schedules and minimum elements for tmdls and new public participation requirements for some interested parties what was most of interest was what was not included in the final rule epa dropped several provisions that were most controversial including some potentially affecting agriculture and forestry see crs report rl30611 epas tmdl program highlight s of the final revised rule the bush administration announced in oct ober 2001 that it would delay the effective date of the rule until may 2003 to allow for further review in march 2003 epa withdrew the 2000 rule in order to consider initiating an entirely new rule or other options officials said that additional time was needed to decide whether and how to revise the program nd that allowing the rule to take effect in may 2003 would disrupt the ongoing review further timetable was announced as result current program re quirements under the 1992 regula tions and cour tsanctioned tmdl schedules remain in place one epa view widely reported was that new rule is not essential because states are improving and w ill continue to improve the p ace at which tmdls are established even under exis ting rules many environmentalists say that short of retaining the 2000 rule the be st action would be to leave the 1992 rules in place because although flawed those rules ar preferable to new rule that might weaken the program other stakeholders ve urged epa to adopt different strategies states and many industries fa vor new rule with greater implementation and enforcementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97831crs5 flexibility than either the 2000 rule or exis ting regulations in mid2002 epa developed draft revised rule which it informally ci rculated among intere st groups and federal agencies for many months but epa has not proposed new ru or indicated what future actions might be taken issues for congress number of issues and options for congress are apparent do nothing at this time epa had hoped that its regulatory proposals would achieve improvements to th tmdl program and not require legislative changes to the clean water act since the outcome of the legislative process is uncertain since withdrawal of the 2000 rule in 2003 stakeholders have been aw aiting future epa decisions strengthen the current program environmentalists have long sought to strengthen the program and so favor amending the act to impose clear deadlines on states and epa to carry out section 303d as there are deadlines in current law make clear that epa has non discretionary duty to act if state fails to do so and define what epa actions would follow and ensure that states periodically update lists of impaired waters so that implementation evolves as water quality conditions change provide flexibility or limit the program the need for flexibility to develop and implement tmdls is key issue for states and industry many favor policies that would not commit them to specific timeframes for establishing and implementing tmdls but instead call for schedules to reflect the availability of sound science and resour ces water quality data are so limited partic ularly concerning nonpoint sources that many fear that tmdl decisions will be based on unsound information and will impose unneeded or inappropriate c ontrol mandates the government accountability office reported in 2000 th at inconsistent monitoring data collection and listing procedures us ed by states to identify impaired waters have hindered efforts to develop effective tmdl programs water quality key epa and state decisions limited by inconsistent and incomplete data gao0054 clarify the programs impact on nonpoint sources nonpoint sources both urban and rural cause or contribute to water quality impairments throughout the united states sec tion 303d currently does not specify whether tmdls should c over nonpoint sources but epas longstanding interpretation is that nonpoint s ources of polluted runoff should be included along with point sources epas interpreta tion was upheld in key court case pronsolino v marcus 91 fsupp2d 1 337 ndcal 2000 affd pronsolino v nastri 291 f3d 1123 ca9 2002 to limit tmdl implementation only to point sources would likely impose disproportionate requireme nts on cities and industr ies which have been the traditional focus of the cwas regulatory requirements the 2000 rule explicitly included nonpoint sour ceimpaired waters in the programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97831crs6 5 us environmental protection agency office of water the national water quality inventory report to congress 2002 reporting cycle washington october 2007 epa841r07001 report is available at httpwwwepagov305b2002reportfarming and forestry groups contend that other nonregulatory cwa programs are directed at nonpoint source pollution and they were concerned that epa intended to regulate their activities through permits they favor excluding nonpoint sources from tmdls so that they do not bear the costs of implementati on and pollution controls epa acknowledges that it lacks regulatory authority over nonpoint sources and only can influence their activities th rough use of grants and funding consider the resource question both epa and states face significant financial and technical challenges and costs of the tmdl program have been particularly controversial the agency projected that the incremental cost of the 2000 rule to states would be about 23 million per year but states argued that costs would be higher states use portion of cwa grant funds section 106 for tmdl development along with numerous other water quality management activities including standard setting permitting and enforcement si nce fy2001 appropriations for these grants have averaged 196 million per year further study and analysis epas fy2001 appropriation bill pl 106377 required studies by the nati onal academy of sciences nas and epa on the scientific basis of the program and on the costs to states and businesses of implementing the tmdl rules the nas report issued in june 2001 concluded that scientific knowledge exists to move forward with the program but reco mmended certain types of changes such as utilizing iterative adap tive implementation and revision as scientific data and information improve ep as review of the 2000 rule since 2001 was at least partly to consider how to respond to those recommendations epa issued draf t report on program costs including the 2000 rule in august 2001 estimating that average annual costs to states and epa of developing tmdls could be 6369 million while implementation costs for pollutant sources could be between 900 million and 43 billion per year pending on states actions finally the attention to the tmdl progra m raises challenging questions about the quality of the nations waters after 35plus years of implementing the cwa epa and states acknowledge that substantial portion of the nations waters still are impaired or threatened by pollution the most recent na tional inventory of wa ter quality reported that nearly 40 of surveyed water bodies rema in too polluted for fishing swimming and other designated uses5 yet those numbers only repres ent rivers streams and lakes actually surveyed by state monitoring programs typically about onet hird of all waters the tmdl assessments developed by states yield more precise water quality information and identify large numbers of waters requiring additional measures before water quality standards are attained how the obama administration will address these issues is unknown for now additional congressional oversight of these issues is likely
