constitutions and arguments as to federal counterpart robert meltz legislative attorney american law division summary the issue arises occasionally whether it might be desirable to amend the us constitution to add an environmental provision such as one declaring an individual right to clean environment some attention was given this issue during the 1970s when over dozen states adopted clean environment or other environmentally oriented provisions in their constitutions our focus here is solely personal right to clean environment provisions and the questions they raise are they selfexecuting or dependent instead on implementing legislation do they create private rights of action if so on whose behalf for what remedies and against what categories of defendants what is the standard to be enforced and the level of proof needed to show injury and so on all these issues would arise as well were federal righttoacleanenvironment provision to be proposed in addition federal provision would implicate federalism concerns if its scope exceeded that of the commerce clause from time to time the issue arises whether it might be desirable to amend the us constitution to add some sort of environmental provision for example one declaring an individual right to clean environment to be sure the heyday of this idea was the environment seventies quite some time ago when two unsuccessful efforts were made in the congress to accomplish this1 in their wake efforts to convince courts that therehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20084crs2 2see eg ely v velde 451 f2d 1130 1139 4th cir

constitutions before and during the seventies and the debate still surfaces periodically whether an analog might be appropriate for the us constitution hence this brief report our focus here is solely 1 state constitutional provisions asserting personal right to clean environment 2 the issues such provisions raise particularly in the courts and 3 arguments for and against comparable addition to the federal constitution it must be stressed that such personal right provisions are but fraction of the entire spectrum of environment and natural resourceoriented provisions in state constitutions not discussed in this report are other healthful environment constitutional provisions such as those that grant the state power to promote healthful environment3 or declare state policy or duty of the legislature to maintain healthful environment4 similarly we do not discuss state constitutional provisions geared to conservation of natural resources such as those that grant the state or state legislature power to conserve natural resources5 declare state policy or duty of the legislature to conserve natural resources6 grant citizens the personal right to preservation of natural resource values7 or to restrain violations of natural resource conservation provisions in the state constitution8 or state that public natural resources are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the people9 personal right to clean environment provisions all the state constitutional provisions creating personal right to healthful environment took effect in relatively short period between 1971 and

statutory regimes enacted by the states still these provisions have received some interpretation by the courts12 most court cases analyzing such state constitutional provisions and most scholarly commentary begin with whether the provision is selfexecuting that is whether it can be implemented in the absence of legislation this issue in turn hinges on whether the state constitution speaks directly to the selfexecuting question where the constitution is silent the decisions are mixed in pennsylvania for example the high court initially ruled by plurality that the states environment provision was not selfexecuting so as to support state effort on the authority of the provision alone to curb the property rightshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20084crs4 13commonwealth of pennsylvania v

situation that is where it was asserted against the state14 it should be noted that both these decisions focused as well on constitutional text immediately following the righttoacleanenvironment sentence quoted above affixing public trust responsibilities on the state another decision addressing virginia constitutional provision establishing commonwealth policy to conserve historical buildings opted for nonselfexecuting status15 though not dealing with right to clean environment our topic here the courts rationale was instructive constitutional provision is selfexecuting it noted when it expressly so declares in the absence of such declaration it said constitutional provisions in bills of rights those declaratory of common law and those that prohibit particular conduct are usually considered selfexecuting where the constitutional provision expressly states right to enforce that statement of course must be given effect thus courts have assumed section 2 of article xi of the illinois constitution to be selfexecuting16 contrariwise the massachusetts constitution comes close to stating that its declared right to clean air and water is not selfexecuting17 question closely related to whether the constitutional provision is selfexecuting is whether it creates private right of action or is merely declaration of intent or policy the illinois constitution while as noted above deemed to be selfexecuting has been held not to create any new remedies18 the hawaii constitutions provision also has been construed by court without discussion to create private right of action19 dubious result it would seem in light of the any person may enforce this right language following the sentence stating the right to healthful environment if the constitution is selfexecuting and creates of itself private right of action followup issues include who can sue private individuals only government agencies too and against whom the right may be enforced legislature only executive branch private polluters courts in two states have addressed whether the constitutional righttoaclean environment provision was intended to alter standing doctrine in the state

state code explains that art xi section 2 of that states constitution was only intended to enlarge standing20 it does not as noted establish new remedy more specifically it cancels the judicial requirement that the plaintiff have suffered special damage before heshe has standing to bring an action against alleged polluting activities that prerequisite foreclosed lawsuits by an individual who is among many persons similarly affected by pollution similarly the constitution of hawaii provision has been held to enlarge plaintiff standing21 potpourri of other issues that may arise in connection with righttoaclean environment provision includes does it empower administrative agencies to exceed the bounds of their statutory authority22 what is the standard to be enforced is there to be any balancing of economic concerns what is the level of proof needed to show injury what remedies are available injunctions damages is preexisting requirement that environmental impact statements be prepared given constitutional status23 one commentator suggests that constitutional righttoacleanenvironment provision might be useful for advancing the cause of environmental justice24 whether right to clean environment provision stands alone or is accompanied by related provisions may be pivotal for example montanas constitution proclaims right to clean environment but also obligates the state and each person to maintain and improve that environment read together these provisions suggest right of action against those who do not maintain and improvehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20084crs6

destruction of biodiversity on which certain interstate commerce depends cert denied 118 s ct 2340 1998amend the federal constitution plainly all the issues noted above in connection with state constitutional provisions also could be raised were right to clean environment proposed as an amendment to the federal constitution and arguably at least the major such issues should be addressed textually to spare the affected parties and the courts potentially long period of uncertainty beyond these issues arguments in favor of constitutional amendment include first its considerable symbolic value as rhetorical flourish in congressional debate even relatively undefined and nonselfexecuting right to clean environment has compelling quality such provision could also tip the balance in executive and judicial branch decision making again even were the provision but nonselfexecuting declaration rather than binding mandate how an amendment would relate to the commerce clause of the federal constitution is particularly interesting on the one hand the existence of an environmental amendment particularly one phrased as grant of congressional power as well as personal right of action might end the attenuated logic that modern courts indulge in order to find an interstate commerce nexus that supports federal environmental legislation25 on the other hand if an environmental amendment dispensed with the interstatecommerce foundation for federal environmental laws the question would arise why environmental protection should be singled out for such coveted treatment why not civil rights or consumer protection legislation as well and of course states might be quite vocal in opposing what they would doubtless perceive as federal overreaching indeed would the amendment belie assertions in federal environmental statutes that the primary responsibility for environmental protection lies with the states one might also ask what new protection broadly worded constitutional provision could add to that already contained in the thousands of pages of federal environmental statutes and regulations now on the books perhaps though it would inhibit retrenchment by some future congress finally it hardly needs to be said how difficult it is to amend the constitution as compared to statute thus an environmental amendment would have to contain some escape mechanism to ensure that it did not become an unwanted straightjacket preventing needed flexibility in dire times
