retail electricity suppliers electric utilities must provide minimum amount of electricity from renewable energy resources or purchase tradable credits that represent an equivalent amount of renewable energy production the minimum requirement is often set as percentage share of retail electricity sales more than 20 states have established an rps with most targets ranging from 10 to 20 and most target deadlines ranging from 2010 to 2025 most states have established tradable credits as way to lower costs and facilitate compliance state rps action has provided an experience base for the design of possible national requirement rps proponents contend that national system of tradable credits would enable retail suppliers in states with fewer resources to comply at the least cost by purchasing credits from organizations in states with surplus of lowcost production opponents counter that regional differences in availability amount and types of renewable energy resources would make federal rps unfair and costly in senate floor action on hr 6 in the 110 th congress samdt 1537 proposed 15 rps target the proposal triggered lively debate but was ultimately ruled nongermane in that debate opponents argued that national rps would disadvantage certain regions of the country particularly the southeastern states they contended that the south lacks sufficient amount of renewable energy resources to meet 15 renewables requirement they further concluded that an rps would cause retail electricity prices to rise for many consumers rps proponents countered by citing study by the energy information administration eia the report examined the potential impacts of the 15 rps proposed in samdt 1537 it indicated that the south has sufficient biomass generation both from dedicated biomass plants and existing coal plants cofiring with biomass fu to meet 15 rps eia noted further that the estimated net rps requirement for the south would not make it unusually dependent on other regions and was in fact below the nation average requirement regarding electricity prices eia estimated that the 15 rps would likely raise retail prices by slightly less than 1 over the 2005 to 2030 period further the rps would likely cause retail natural gas prices to fall slightly over that period in house floor action on an rps amendment hamdt 748 to hr 3221 key points and counterpoints of the senate rps debate were repeated the rps was added 220 to 190 and the bill passed the house 241 to 172 the rps amendment would set 15 target for 2020 and would allow up to 4 percentage points of the requirement to be met with energy efficiency measures after house action informal bipartisan housesenate negotiations began the house rps provision 9006 continues to be key issue on december 1 2007 the ranking member of the senate energy and natural resources committee st ated that the house leaderships intent to include an rps led him to cease negotiations further the white house has reportedly announced that it would veto the bill if it includes an rps httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34116g20g142g151g142g160g138g139g149g142g561g7g151g142g155g144g162g561g18g152g155g157g143g152g149g146g152g561g21

electricity from renewable energy resources or purchase tradable credits that represent an equivalent amount of renewable energy production the minimum requirement is often set as percentage share of retail electricity sales which is usually expressed in terms of kilowatthours kwh 1 many rps programs use tradable credits sometimes referred to as renewable energy certificates to increase flexibility and reduce the cost of compliance with the purchase mandate and to facilitate compliance tracking2 g21g157g138g157g142g561g20g18g21g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561 in the late 1990s many states began to restructure their electric utility industries to allow for increased competition some of the states with this newly restructured system established an rps as way to create continuing role for renewable energy in power production 3 some states without restructured industry also began to ad opt an rps the total number of states with an rps has grown steadily in june 2007 the federal energy regulatory commission ferc reported that 23 states and the distri ct of columbia had an rps in place4 collectively covering about 40 of the national electric load5 mandatory state rps targets range from low of 2 to high of 25 however most targets range from 10 to 20 and are scheduled to be reached between 2010 and 2025 although this emerging tapes try of state programs continues to spread to more states the majority of recent actions have been to increase and accelerate previously established standards6 most states have similar definition of eligible renewable resources that covers wind solar geothermal biomass and several forms of waterbased power including hydropower current wave tidal and ocean power7 at least 19 of the 23 states allow some form 1 most states use the percentage requirement the only exceptions are texas and iowa which have chosen to specify the minimum requirement in terms of installed capacity measured in terms of millions of watts megawatts

kwh to 55 cents per kwh there are significant regional differences in resource availability as shown in the previously cited ferc map most states in the southeast and midwest regions do not have an rps requirement several states have broadened their rps provisions to allow certain energy efficiency measures and technologies to help satisfy the requirement8

percentage of total projected electricity production9 with percentage requirement the amount of mandated renewable energy will increase or decrease in proportion to changes in enduse electricity sales in general the targets increase gradually in stepwise fashion over period of several years the scheduled rise of the annual target and its peak value are intended to create predictable longterm purchase obligations that drive new development and economies of scale the graduated schedule is intended to allow time for competition to emerge among eligible resources also to create stability that allows for longte rm contracts and financing that can help keep renewable energy costs down the peak target often is designed to remain in place for several years after it is reached most state targets include only generation from new renewable energy facilities placed in service after the rps standard is enacted 10 g22g155g138g141g138g139g149g142g561g5g155g142g141g146g157g156g561 many states have created tradable credits as way to lower costs and facilitate compliance typically the owner of qualified renewable energy facility receives one credit for each kilowatt hour of electricity produced the credits are treated as product separate from generated power credits are purely financial product that represents the attributes of electricity generated from renewable energy sources the owner may bundle the credits for sale with its electrical energy alternatively the owner may sell the credits and power separately the power would be sold in the electricity market and the credits would be sold in secondary credit trading market 11 each year rps requires all retail suppliers to show that they have acquired number of credits equivalent to the percentage target for the previous year the retail suppliers have options for meeting this requirement suppliers can choose to build renewable energy facility purchase renewable power bundled with credits or buy credits separately through the trading market they are also free to choose the types of renewable energy to acquire the price paid and the contract terms offered further they can choose whether to enter into longterm credit andor renewable power purchase contracts or to purchase these commodities on the spot market if supplier cannot obtain sufficient credits through these means it can achieve alternative compliance by purchasing additional credits from the state regulatory agency for supplier that otherwise fails continued state incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency httpwwwdsireusaorg 8 the most frequently occurring energy efficiency measures are fuel cells and combined heat and power equipment 9 some states use variation of this target for example texas uses capacity development target converted annually into percentage energy target 10 many states exclude existing hydropower and certain other renewables several states place them in separate tier 11 evolution markets an

time period can make credit trading market more flexible many credit trading systems provide trueup reconciliation period after the rps compliance year during this period retailers that are short on their obligation can buy additional credits and those with excess credits can sell them 12 credit banking can reduce retailer risk and promote economies of scale by allowing credits to be carried forward to one or more future years deficit banking allows retailer to defer making up credit shortage to future year13

introduced from the southeastern association of regulatory utility commissioners that stated the reality is that not all states are fortun ate enough to have abundant traditional renewable energy resources such as wind or have them located close enough to the load to render them costeffective this is especially true in the southeast and large parts of the midwest our retail electricity

dollars in higher electricity prices but with guarantee that additional renewable generation w ill actually be developed because many retail electric suppliers will not be able to meet an rps requirement through their own generation they will be required to purchase higher cost renewable energy from other suppliers or purchase renewable energy credits thus nationwide rps mandate will mean massive wealth transfer from electric consumers in states with little or renewable resources to the federal government or states where renewables happen to be more abundant 21 proponents counterargued that national system of tradable credits would enable retail suppliers in states with less abundant resources to comply at the least cost by purchasing credits from organizations in states with surplus of lowcost production also supporters pointed out that samdt 1537 provided that funds collected from payments for alternative compliance and penalties would be used to provide grants to states in regions which have disproportionately small share of economically sustainable renewable energy generation capacity22 the proponents also noted that in addition to many environmental and public interest groups the rps proposal was supported by some electric and natural gas utility companies as well as several corporations including bp america and general electric23 perhaps most importantly rps proponents countered by citing study prepared by the department of energys energy information administration eia the report examined the potential impacts of the 15 rps proposed in samdt 1537 24 regarding resource availability the report found that biomass generation both from dedicated biomass plants and existing coal plants cofiring with biomass fuel grows the most by 2030 more than tripling from 102 billion kilowatthours kwh in the reference case to 318 billion kwh with the rps policy 25 in followup fact sheet to that study eia noted that the south has significant biomass

exemptions for small retailers and adjusting the baseline generation for preexisting hydropower and municipal solid waste facilitieswas below the national average requirement across all regions28 regarding electricity prices rps proponents also cited findings from the eia study eia estimated that relative to its base case projections for retail electricity prices the 15 rps would likely raise retail prices by slightly less than 1 over the 2005 to 2030 period further the report estimated that relative to its base case projections for retail natural gas prices the rps would likely cause retail natural gas prices to fall slightly over the 2005 to 2030 period 29 eia qualified the reports findings on potential electricity price impacts it noted that projected impacts of an rps on expenditures for electricity and natural gas in enduse sectors are sensitive to assumptions about the projected baseline generation fuel mix in its reference case higher share of natural gas in the generation mix would allow an rps to displace proportionally more natural gas thus to the extent that natural gas contributes larger share of the future generation mix the 15 rps would have more economically fa vorable impacts to the extent that natural gas contributes smaller share the opposite effect would be more likely 30

stressed that costly new high voltage transmission lines would be needed especially for wind turbines which are often located far from population centers31 eei further notes that delays are likely and transmission in frastructure issues have posed significant challenges to the growth of renewable generation32 some analysts have suggested that even if plans and financing were in place now to develop the national transmission capacity needed to meet 15 or higher rps the construction c ould not take place quickly enough to meet the 2020 target date 33 the american wind energy association awea has acknowledged the transmission issue pointing to ongoing efforts to address it34 for example the texas rps is driving boom in wind development to address transmission constraints there the state recently established competitive renewable energy zones and directed the electric reliability council of texas ercot to develop transmission plans for up to 25000 megawatts of new wind capacity35 28

may involve shorter distances smaller volumes and lower costs than that which may be required for more remote wind farm locations in the midwest regions

opponents of rps brought an alternative measure to the senate floor that they argued would address their concerns about resource hardship transmission needs and electricity price increases that measure samdt 1538 proposed expanding the rps concept to include energy efficiency measures and other energy production facilities36 the clean portfolio standard or cps would have started the requirement at 5 in 2010 and increased to 20 by 2020 eligible resources would have been expanded beyond renewables to include energy efficiency fuel cells new nuclear power plants and new coal power pl ants that include carbon dioxide capture and storage equipment rps proponents argued against the cps proposal they asserted that the main purpose of the rps was to stimulate the market development of ne w precommercial and nearcommercial renewable energy equipment the cps they said would not require any real change in the energy mix and would mainly add an incentive to expand the use of conventional nuclear energy and fossil energy with carbon capture in conclusion rps proponents contended that the cps proposal would eliminate any real requirement to produce additional power from renewables 37 samdt 1538 was tabled by vote of 56 to 3938

programs had been major spur to wind energy growth43 on the house floor rps proponents argued that all states have sufficient renewable energy resources and that the rps had been recalibrated to include energy efficiency measures to make it even more flexible supporters also cited study by wood mackenzie corporation that showed rps would lead to net reduction in natural gas an electricity
