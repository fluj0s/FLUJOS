the report reviews her takingsrelated writings for the courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs222271 the takings clause states nor shall privat property be taken for public use without just compensation 2 both takings cases and direct condemnation cases are premised on the governments power of eminent domain the difference between the two is that takings case is brought by the property owner who argues that government action has effectively taken his property by eminent domain as by excessive regulation even though the government has not formally invoked the power by contrast direct conde mnation suit is brought by the government and expressly acknowledges that the government is invoking eminent domain to take property and must compensate congressional research service the library of congresscrs

takingsrelated writings for the court beginning in 1978 the supreme court embarked on an effort continuing to this day to lend some doctrinal clarity to the takings clause of the fifth amendment1 since the appointment of sandra day oconnor as supreme c ourt associate justice on september 25 1981 the court has decided by written opinion about 35 takings cases cases in which property owners asserted that government action had taken their property within the meaning of the clause in another five written opinions during this time the court decided claims aris ing out of direct condemnation2 this report offers an overview of justice oconnors views as to th proper application of the takings clause it then summarizes the majority opinions she herself authored plus important

transp co v new york city 438 us 104 124 1978overview having been appointed by president r eagan who explicitly championed property rights agenda many expected justice oc onnor to tilt reflexively toward the property rights side of the takings clause cases that came before the court this did not happen instead on this issue at least she established her place at the ideological center of the court often with justice kennedy acting as swing vote between the liberalmoderate bloc justices stevens ginsburg souter nd breyer and the socalled core conservatives justices rehnquist scalia and thomas of the 40 takings and direct condemnation decisions during her tenure justice oconnor voted on the winning side in 35 in doing so she voted for the propertyowner side in 15 of the 40 cases roughly the number of cases in which the propertyowner side w on notwithstanding her center position on the court justice oconnor is associated with many statements sympathetic to property owners in preseault v icc 3 she wrote in concurrence that federal programs cannot redefine property interests created under state law and th ereby deprive property owners of their takings claims in two dissents from denials of certiorari she was the only justice to join core conservative justice in stioning prior governmentfriendly takings rulings4 in suitum v tahoe regional planning agency 5 she famously exclaimed during oral argument on the question whether plaintiffs taking cl aim was ripe why not give this poor elderly woman the right to go to c ourt and have her taking s claim heard and most recently in kelo v city of new london 6 she vigorously dissented from the majoritys holding that the takings clau poses obstacle to the condemnation of private homes for transfer to private developers solely in the name of economic development justice oconnor however did not translate this asserted empathy for the property owner into espousal of bold doctrinal changes to takings law perhaps the only explanation for this and it is certainly not complete one is that in takings law as elsewhere she favored an ad hoc factintensive casebycase resolution of constitutional claims and was hesita nt to endorse broad per rules7 thus she favored the ad hoc analysis of regulatory takings claims embodied in the courts penn central test under which courts are to balance variet of amorphous factors with so far little guidance from the supreme court8 indeed an oconnor concurre nce in 2001 played pivotal rolehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22227crs3 9 see note 18 infra and accompanying text 10 467 us 229

midkiff 198410 hawaii statute sought to lessen the highly concentrated pattern of land ownership in the state it did this by allowing state agency to condemn qualified lands at the behest of the lessees of such lands whereupon the agency could sell the lands to the former tena nts landowners claimed that the privateto private transfer of their lands did not satisfy the takings clause re quirement that eminent domain be exercised only for public use on behalf of unan imous court justice oconnor disagreed the public use requireme nt she said is coterminous with the scope of sovereigns poli ce powers and reducing the evils caused by land oligopoly is classic exercise of such powers the court will not substitute its judgment as to what constitutes public use for that of the legi slature unless the use is without reasonable foundation and the mere fact that the conde mned property is transferred to private beneficiaries does not mean the taking has only private purpose hodel v

accept pur chasers of mobile homes in the park as new tenants writing for unanimous court justice oconnor disagreed she discerned physical taking by the tenants who could not be rejected because neither the state nor local laws required the landowner to dedicat his land to mobile home park use nor overly limited his ability to terminate such use because the physical occupation by the tenants was not coerced there could be physical taking and the owners regulatory takings argument was not properly before the court eastern enterprises v apfel 199813 the coal industry retiree health benefit

experience in the mining field justice kenne dy provided the fifth vote for the majority though he supported invalidating the statute s application to th petitioner based on due process not takings

taking based on state statute limiting the rent that oil companies may charge service station operators who lease stations owned by oil companies the stated purpose of the statute was to hold down retail gas prices in an opinion by justice oconnor unanimous court saw taking because the oil companys only claim before the court that the state regulation failed to substantially advance legitimate state interest holding down prices invoked an improper takings test the court admitted its error in inserting the substantially advance test into takings law quarter century previously takings law properly understood focuses on the burdens regulation imposes on property by contrast the substantially advances test targets regulations effectiveness dueprocesslike inquiry important concurrences and dissents writing in concurrences and dissents as opposed to majority opinions justice has greater freedom to offer his or her unvarnished views since there is need to make the compromises often required to attract the votes of at least four other justices in justice oconnors concurrences and dissents t hose she wrote and those she joined her sympathy for the propertyowner side of the argument is more evident connolly v pension benefit guaranty corp 198615 federal statute required that an employer withdrawing from multiemployer pension plan pay fixed debt to the plan in the amount of the employers propor tionate share of the plans unfunded vested benefits though joining the ma jority opinion in rejecting the facial taking claim justice oconnor wrote separately to emphasize the possible harsh impacts of the withdrawal liability and the appropriateness of the court considering those impacts in future as applied challenge note seven years later when an asapplied taking

converted into recreational trails despite any reversionary interest that the holder of the underlying title might have unde r state law justice oconnor joined the courts unanimous opinion that if taking occurred compensation should be sought in the us court of federal cl aims which the title owner d not done she also wrote separately however to reject the view of the court below that the icc by certifying trail conversion merely defers the ve sting of the title holders inte rest rather than defeats it she stressed that the icc could not redefine statelaw property interests so that where conversion defeated the title holders reve rsionary interest taking occurred palazzolo v rhode island 200118 in the context of taking challenge to state wetlands restriction the major ity opinion addressed the noti ce rule this rule adopted by several state supreme courts asserts that regulatory taking claim is absolutely barred when based on landuse restriction imposed under regulatory regime that existed when the land was acquired the majority opinion rejected the rule as an absolute bar but failed to say what role the preexisting regulatory regime did have in the takings analysis even if short of dispositive justice scalia in his concurrence said none at all justice oconnors concurrence by cont rast asserted her usual distas for such absolute views insisting that the preexisting regime was still relevant and that the weight to be given it depended on the pa rticular facts note year later in the takings case of tahoesierra preservation council v tahoe regional planning agency 200219 the courts majority opinion quoted at length from justice oconnors concurrence in palazzolo since then lower courts have displayed little doubt that her view not justice scalias is the reigning legal principle kelo v city of new london 200520 this muchpublicized decision involved the citys use of condemnation to further its ec onomic development plan and thus relieve its depressed economy slim 5ju stice majority found that th condemnations were for public use as the takings clause require s notwithstanding that private land would be transferred to private deve lopers in an impassioned disse nt for herself and three other justices justice oconnor re jected the view that condemnations solely for economic development satisfy the public use re quirement under the banner of economic development all private property is now vul nerable to being take n and transferred to another private owner so long as it might be upgraded the kelo dissent in particular is revealing two decades earlier justice oconnor had penned one of the c ourts major public use decisions in hawaii v midkiff recall from page 3 that justice oconnors views there were highly accommodating of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22227crs6 governments interests the public use re quirement she had sai d is coterminous with the sovereigns police powers the court should not subs titute its judgment as to what constitutes public use for that of the legislatur and the mere fact of privatetoprivate transfers need not be constitutional problem in kelo by contrast she endorsed much narrower concept of public use requiring her to rethink her midkiff discussion as wrong or at least overbroad what was the reason for the narrower view in kelo justice oconnor attempted to distinguish the two cases saying that midkiff involved affirmatively harmful uses of land while in kelo the homes to be condemned were we llmaintained that is there was blight but her effort seems less than convincing anothe r hypothesis admittedly speculative is that her analys is was affected by the fact that the oligopolistic landowners in midkiff were presumably affluent while those in kelo appeared to be of modest means indeed she stressed in kelo that the beneficiaries of the majority opinion are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influe nce and power as for the victims the government now has license to transfer property from those w ith fewer resources to those with more in her view the founders cannot have intended th is perverse result justice oconnors diffe ring conclusions in midkiff and kelo thus seemingly exemplify her general sensitivity to the facts of case and her resistance to hardandfast rules
