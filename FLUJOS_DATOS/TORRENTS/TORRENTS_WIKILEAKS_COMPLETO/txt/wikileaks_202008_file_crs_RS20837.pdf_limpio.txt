child support collections carmen solomonfears specialist in social legislation domestic social policy division summary pl 104193 the 1996 welfare reform law substantively changed the rules governing how child support collections are distributed among families states and the federal government the gene ral rules in effect as of october 1 2000 are that child support collected durin g the time family r eceives cash welfare belongs to the state current child support and arrearages pastdue payments that are owed to family that is longer receiving welfare belongs to the family and child support owed to family that never received welfare belongs to the fa mily this is referred to as the families first child support distribution policy t hese families first distribution rules do not apply to child support collections made by intercepting federal income tax refunds many policymakers contend that congress s hould simplify the child support distribution system which currently requires the tracking of six categories of arrearage payments to properly pay custodial parents legislati on that included provisions to simplify child support distribution procedures and provide more of the child support collected to custodial parents rather than the govern ment was passed by the house in the 106th and 107th congresses but not by the senate s imilar legislation has been reintroduced as part of the welfare reauthorization measure in the 108th congress this report will be updated as needed to reflect legislative activity background pl 104193 the personal responsibility nd work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 enacted august 22 1996 replaced th aid to families with dependent children afdc entitlement program with temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant and made major changes to th child support enforcement cse program the rules governing how child support collec tions are distributed among families the state and the federal governme nt have changed substantially in part cse distribution rules were changed to acknowledge the fact th at child support would be significant if not critical to helping singleparent families exit welfare and maintain selfsufficiency since the cse programs inception the rule s determining who actually gets the child support arrearage payments have been complex but not nearly as complicated as they are currently it is helpful to think of the rules in two categories first there are rules in bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20837crs2 1 the reader should note that all current child s upport payments owed to family who is not on welfare go to the family generally via the state disbursement unit 2 this is one of the following six categories of arrearages 1 permanentlyassigned arrearages 2 temporarilyassigned arrearages 3 conditionallyassigned arrearages 4 neverassigned arrearages 5 unassigned duringassistance rrearages and 6 unassigned preassistance arrearages the six categories are define d in ocse transmittal 9717 october 21 1997 instructions for the distribution of child suppor t under section 457 of the social security act p 6 httpwwwacfdhhsgovprogramscsepolat9717htm 3 the federal matching rate ranges from minimum of 50 to statutory maximum of 83 although afdc was replaced by tanf under the welfare reform law of 1996 the same continuedfederal and state law that s tipulate who has legal claim on the payments owed by the noncustodial parent these ar called assignment rules second there are rules that determine the order in which child support co llections are paid in accordance with the assignment rules these are called distribution rules when family leaves tanf1 the order of distribution of any child support collection depends on 1 when the arrearag accrued preassistance duringassistance or postassistance 2 when the child support was assigned to the state before october 1997 between october 1997 and october 2000 or after october 2000 3 how the child support arrearages were collected through th federal income tax refund offset program or by some other means 4 the amount of the unreimbursed welf are balance and 5 when the arrearages were collected before octobe r 1997 between october 1997 and october 2000 or after october 2000 some of the complexity of the distribution rules ceased on october 1 2000 when the rules were completely phasedi n but the confusion with regard to the six categories of arrearages mentioned below remains current tanf recipients as condition of tanf eligibility the custodial parent must assign to the state the right to collect both current child support pa yments and pastdue child support obligations ie arrearages which accrue while the fa mily is on the tanf rolls these are called permanentlyassigned arrearages2 the assignment requirement for tanf applicants and recipients also includes arrearage payments that accumulated before the family enrolled in tanf these are called preassistance arrearages preassistance arrearages are temporarily assigned to the state while the fa mily is receiving tanf assistance with the exception of the following preassistance arrearages which were assigned to the state before october 1 1997 are considered perman entlyassigned arrearages while the family receives tanf benefits the state is per mitted to retain any current support and any assigned arrearages it collects up to the cumulative amount of tanf benefits which has been paid to the family under old law pre1996 states were requi red to pass through the first 50 of current monthly child support payments collected on be half of an afdc family and to disregard it as income to the family so that it did not affect the familys afdc eligibility or benefit payment the remaining amount of current child support collected was divided between the state and federal governments according to the states afdc federal matching rate3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20837crs3 3 continued matching rate procedure is still used in practical terms the federal matching rate is synonymous to the term federal share the state share is defined as 100 percent minus the federal share the reader should note that states with larger federal matching rate keep smaller portion of the child support collections ie if the federal matching rate for state is 65 the federal government gets 65 of child support collected on behalf of tanf families and the state keeps or shares with the family 35 of the amount collected 4 note also that before october 1 1997 fede ral law required states to distribute all current child support payments to the family once it had left afdctanf but did not specify how arrearage payments were to be distributed however states were required to have procedures that specified the order in which child support collections were applied to satisfy arrearagesthe 1996 welfare reform law repealed the required 50 pass through and gives states the choice to decide how much if any of th state share some all none of child support collected on behalf of tanf family to send the family if state elects the passthrough option it still mu st pay the federal share of the collection to the federal government regardless of how much child support is passe d through to the family the state can then do what it wants with its share it can give all portion or none of its share to families if state passes through all of its share to families it may count that as income to the family or it may disregard all or some of the child support collection so that it does not decrease the tanf payment of the family but instead enables that family to increase its total income by the child support amount without it affecting the familys tanf eligibility status or benefit amount so states send the family two checks one reflecting the tanf benefit and another reflecting the ch ild support payment received from the noncustodial parent st ates also have the option to pass their share of arrearage collections to former tanf recipients if the arrearage occurred while the family was cash welfare recipient former tanf recipients under prior law once family went ff afdc child support arrearage payments generally were divided between the state and federal govern ments to reimburse them for afdc if any money remaine d it was given to the family in contrast under pl 104 193 payments to families who leave tanf are more generous unde r pl 104193 arrearages are to be paid to the family first unless they are collected through the federal income tax refund offset in which case reimbur sing the federal and state governments are to be given first priority for collections made before october 1 1997 if custodial parent assigned her or his child support rights to the state before october 1 1997 the parent had to assign all support rights for support payments both current and pastdue that accrued to the family during the period of afdc receipt as well as payments that had accrued before their application for afdc benefits moreover these families had to permanently assign their rights to preassistance arrearages to the state this means that once these families go off welfare any preassistance arrearages that are collected on their behalf go to the state and the federal government as reimbursement for afdc aid paid to the family4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20837crs4 5 the reader should note that the balanced b udget act of 1997 pl 10533 enacted august 5 1997 gave states the option of implementing the new distribution rules for former tanf families in one step effective october 1 1998 without regard to the phasein rulesfor collections made on or after october 1 1997 and before october 1 2000 if custodial parent assigned her or his child support rights to the state on or after october 1 1997 and before october 1 2000 the parent had to assign all support rights for both current and pastdue paymen ts accrued while the family is receiving tanf benefits unlike pre1997 assi gnments the tanf applicant or recipient only had to temporarily rather than perman ently assign to the state all rights to support that accrued to the family before it began receiving tanf benefits this temporary assignment lasts until october 1 2000 or the date on which th family stops receiving tanf benefits whichever is later these temporarilyassigned arrearages become conditionallyassigned arrearages when the family leaves the tanf rolls r on october 1 2000 whiche ver date is later they are considered conditionallyassigned becau if they are collected via the federal income tax refund offset program they are to be paid to the state and federal government rather than the family if conditionallyassi gned arrearages are collected through method other than the federa l income tax refund offset they belong to the family since october 1 1997 states have been required to distribute to former tanf families current child support nd child support arrearages that accrue after the family leaves tanf these arrearages are called ne verassigned arrearages before the state and the federal government are reimbursed for tanf payments to families however arrearages that accrued before the family bega n receiving tanf bene fits did not have to be distributed to the family first if the preassistance arrearages were collected by the cse agency before october 1 2000 as mentioned above an exception to the di stribution requirement occurs when the child support is collected via the federal inco tax refund offset pr ogram in federal income tax refund offset cases the child s upport arrearage payment up to the cumulative amount of tanf benefits which has been paid to the family is retained by the state and federal government if such arrearages were assigned to the state either temporarily or conditionally thus if child support arrearages are collected via the federal income tax refund offset program the family does not ve first claim on the arrearage payments for collections made on or after october 1 20005 if custodial parent assigns her or his child support rights to the state on or after october 1 2000 the parent has to assign all support rights that accrue while the family is recei ving tanf benefits in addition the tanf applicant must temporarily assign to the state all rights to support that accrued to the family before it began r eceiving tanf benefits this temporary assignment lasts until the family stops receiving tanf benefits for child support collections made after october 1 2000 unless the sum is collected through the federal income tax offset program the state is required to first distribute to the former welfare family the amount collect ed to satisfy the current monthly child support obligation if any money remains it is to be paid to the fa mily to satisfy never assigned arrearages which are child support arrearages that accrued after the family wenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20837crs5 6 once family leaves welfare any previouslyassigned arrearages which exceed the cumulative amount of tanf benefits which has been paid to the family and which accrued while the family was receiving tanf are called unassigned duringa ssistance arrearages these arrearages are owed to the family 7 under pl 104193 the 1996 welfare reform law if states retained less money from child support collections than they retained in fy1995 states were allowed to retain the amount of child support retained in fy1995 this was referre d to as the hold harmless provision pl 106 169 the foster care independence act of 1 999 limited the hold harmless requirement by stipulating that states would only be entitled to hold harmless funds if the states share of child support collections were less than they were in fy 1995 and the state has distributed and disregarded to title iva families at least 80 of child support collected on their behalf in the preceding fiscal year or the state had distributed to former title iva recipients the state share of child support payments collected via the federal income tax offset program if these conditions were met the states share of child support colle ctions was increased by 50 of the difference between what the state would have received in fy1995 and its share of child support collections in the pertinent fiscal year pl 106169 repeal ed the hold harmless provision effective october 1 2001off welfare or arrearages owed to families that never received welfare if there is money remaining it is to be paid to the family to satisfy unassigned preassistance arrearages ie all previously assigned arrearag which exceed the cumulative amount of unreimbursed assistance when the family leav welfare and which accrued before the family began receiving welfare and conditionallyassigned arrearages described earlier if there is still money remaining it is to be used to reimburse the state and federal government for tanf benefits paid to the family the state shall retain its share of the amount and pay to the federal g overnment the federal share of the collection to the extent necessary to reimburse amounts paid to the family as cash assistance6 if any money remains it is to be paid to the family these distribution rules do not apply to child support collections obtained by intercepting federal income ta x refunds child support arrearages collected through the federal income tax offset program are to be paid to the state and the state is to pay the federal share of the collection to the federal government the state may only retain arrearages that have been assigned to th state and only up to the amount necessary to reimburse amounts paid to the family as cash ssistance if the amount collected through the tax offset exceeds the amount retained the state must distri bute the excess to the family to reiterate effective oc tober 1 2000 the state must treat any support arrearages collected on behalf of former welfare family except for those collected through the federal income tax offset program as accruing in the following order 1 to the period after the family stopped receiving cash assist ance 2 to the period before the family received cash assistance and 3 to the period while the family was receiving cash assistance the result of these child support distribution changes is that states are now required to pay higher fraction of child s upport collections on arrearages to families that have left welfare by making these payments to families first before the state and federal government7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20837crs6 concluding remarks custodial parents and noncust odial parents alike are dissatisfied with the current child support distribution system custodial pa rents are frustrated because they view child support arrearages as belonging to them they argue that they had to rely on family and friends for financial assistan ce during periods when the noncus todial parent failed to pay child support that occurred before they went on welfare they contend that they and not the state are entitled to any prewelfare arrearage payments that are collected on their behalf noncustodial parents are annoyed because once they start paying child support they want to see that their money actually helps their children explanations that welfare benefits are in effect child support paid by taxpayers have not satisfied them moreover advocates point out that while promising fa milies priority in collecting arrearages owed to them as an inducement to encourage them to move off we lfare as soon as possible the states and the federal government keep for themselves collections made via the federal income tax refund offset programthe most lucr ative form of arrearage collection in tax year 2001 16 billion in overdue support was co llected via federal income tax refunds in contrast some observers maintain that the seemingly dual mission of the cse program on the one hand to pay back the stat for welfare costs and on the other to keep families off welfare has contributed to the complexity of the distribution system which most agree was complicated from the progra ms beginning in 1975 they note that the states share of retained child support collec tions generally amount to only 10 of all states expenditures on the tanf program nd argue that for families currently receiving tanf payments the states should continue to retain this declining source of funding to help improve their cse prog rams see crs report rl30488 analysis of federal state financing of the child support enforcement program during the 107th congress many members favor ed child support distribution approach that simply paid former welfare families all the arrearages collected on their behalf including federal income tax refund offsets before re imbursing the state or federal government for any owed arrearages on may 16 2002 the house passed hr 4737 the welfare reauthorization bill which would have provided incentives to states to distribute more child support collections to exwelfa re families and permitted states to give portion of child support collections to tanf families without having to repay the federal government its share of the money in addition hr 4737 would have simplified child support assignment and distribution rule s and made many other changes in the 108th congress hr 4 welfare reauthorization bill almost identical in substance to hr 4737 was introduced on fe bruary 4 2003 hr 4 was passed by the house on february 13 2003 it includes child support assignment and distribution rules identical to those in hr 4737 as passed by the house in the 107th congress
