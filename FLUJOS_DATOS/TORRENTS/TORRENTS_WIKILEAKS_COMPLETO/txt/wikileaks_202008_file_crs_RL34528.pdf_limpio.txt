reached agreement on the sanitary rules that korea will apply to beef imports from the united states it allows for imports of all cuts of us boneless and bonein beef and other beef products from cattle irrespective of age as long as specified risk materials known to transmit mad cow disease are removed and other conditions are met however both sides revised this deal in june to limit sales of us beef only to cattle less than 30 months old south korea published rules to put this agreement into effect on june 26 and quickly began to inspect us beef sitting in cold storage the us department of agriculture similarly has begun to implement new program to verify that the beef sold is processed from cattle under 30 months old us beef exporters are now working to recapture key overseas market in 2003 south korea was the thirdlargest market for us beef exports prior to the ban imposed after the first us cow infected with mad cow disease or bse bovine spongiform encephalopathy was discovered koreas commercial significance is reflected in the position taken by several members of congress who state that congressional consideration of and support for the korea us free trade agreement korus fta depends upon south korea fully opening its market to us beef while the us beef industry and us policymakers welcomed the april deal korean tv coverage of the issue and internetspread rumors that questioned the safety of us beef resulted in escalating protests and calls for the beef agreement to be renegotiated or scrapped us officials countered that measures already in place to prevent the introduction of bse in us cattle herds meet international scientific standards to address rising public pressure the korean government twice pursued talks with the united states to find ways to defuse these concerns without renegotiating the beef agreement on june 21 both governments confirmed voluntary private sector arrangement that allows korean firms to import us beef produced only from cattle less than 30 months old both governments view this as transitional step until korean consumer confidence in the safety of us beef improves since midjuly 2008 new exports of us beef including bonein cuts have resumed and gained market share against other competitors until recently korean importers were only selling us beef to regional markets and small neighborhood butcher shops however the november 25 announcement that three large korean discount department stores will shortly stock us beef on their shelves is expected to draw down imported inventories and open the door for possible significant market expansion for us beef in coming months the antibeef agreement protests in south korea have subsided however they could have lingering effects on ussouth korean relations because of the erosion of the korean presidents political standing and their possible impact on his governments ability to secure ratification of the korus fta this report will be updated to reflect developments

us negotiating position has been to press for full access in one step for all us beef into south koreas market this meant expanding the scope of the 2006 agreement to include exports of bonein beef and coverage of all us beef from cattle regardless of age as long as bserisk materials are removed during pr ocessing us trade officials have maintained that us beef is safe pointing out that it is consumed by millions of americans they have frequently noted that the us measures in place to prevent the introduction of bse in us cattle herds already meet international scientific standards as spelled out by the oie south korea argued for twophased approach to full opening the first step would allow imports of both boneless and bonein beef cuts from us cattle less than 30 months old cattle parts identified by the oie as agents that can transmit bse to cattle and in turn potentially harm humans would have to be removed from imported beef koreas trade minister argued this first step would give the united states about 80 of it s market share before the ban on us beef took effect in late 2003 the second step to take effect later would permit imports of beef from older cattle as long as

widely held view that cattle younger than 30 months are less susceptible to mad cow disease by contrast the oie makes age distinction in assessing the risk level of cattle slaughtered for beef instead its recommendation is that importing countries to prevent the introduction of bse ensure that beef of any age meet certain conditions such as the removal of those cattle tissues suspected of transmitting bse and the implementation of effective safety controls for cattle feed though the united states for some time has argued that it is in full compliance with oie guidelines us negotiators appear to have had little choice but to compromise in way that would allow some sales to resume publicly both countries presented this arrangement as transitional step to improve korean consumer confidence in us beef and did not commit to any timetable for revisiting this matter some members of congress responded cautiously or skeptically to the voluntary commercial agreement noting that it changes the april protocol by allowing korea to reject us beef from cattle over 30 months of age disregards international standards that affirm the safety of all us beef regardless of age and sets an unfortunate or dangerous precedent in negotiating the terms of beef access into other countries 9 south korean government officials portrayed the junenegotiated arrangement as going far to allay public concerns about the safety of us beef however the political fallout of the controversy continued through the summer three high ranking korean officials including the agriculture minister and his deputy resigned because of their involvement in the agreements negotiations the korean national assembly completed an inconclusive parliamentary inquiry on the strategy and process followed by two successi ve governments on negotiating this agreement it also debated controversial livestock sector bill that includes ban on beef imports from any country whenever new case of bseinfected cattle is discovered as adopted the measure reportedly exempts the bilateral beef agreement reached with the united states from being subject to its coverage

marketing service ams the first is that beef and products destined for south korea must be produced under an approved export verification ev program this details the specific product requirements that supplier must meet in order for an export shipment to be eligible to enter korea as of november 18 2008 ams listed 48 suppliers as covered by the ev program for korea the second is the voluntary quality system assessment qsa progra m that verifies that beef from participating plant is from cattle under 30 months of age as of october 28 ams has approved 48 exporting establishments as eligible to ship beef product that can be certified as meeting this requirement 16 g17g158g157g149g152g152g148g561 concluding the 2008 bilateral beef agreement was the last step in the us governments 4½year effort to regain access to south koreas lucrative beef market for the us cattle and beef processing sectors the agreements added requirement that beef be processed from cattle under 30 months of age is not expected to reduce potential sales volume since the age of most us cattle currently being slaughtered is younger since the agreement took effect attention has focused on its implementation by koreas quarantine inspection agency and the pace at which us beef is reaching korean consumers us beef companies have geared up to proce ss beef under the ams programs established to facilitate sales to south korea usdas weekly export numbers together with pending sales commitments indicate that korean meat importers placed orders to meet initial demand and build up inventories the usmef reported that us beef sold out where available and had been very hot in koreas restaurant market to cultivate consumer demand the federation conducted some market promotion activities to emphasize the lower price of us beef and the quality of the beef cuts that the us beef industry previously sold in korea most recent were second set of promotions featuring us beef at several prominent butcher shops korean imports of us beef to date have far exceeded actual sales resulting in importers holding larger inventories this has occurred against the backdrop of growing economic uncertainty brought about by koreas own financial crisis households have tightened spending and cut back on eating out at restaurants where us beef would frequently be consumed more important however was the reluctance of the large department stores supermarkets and re staurant chains ie the primary south korean outlets for marketing beef to purchase us beef largely due to lingering lack of confidence in the product as expressed by some groups of korean consumers 17 16 see usda fsis export requirements for the republic of korea as updated september 25 2008 at

by three large major discount retailers to resume sales of us beef on november 27 these firms stated that the availability of us beef will provide value and convenience as well as help stabilize consumer prices for koreans facing financial difficulties they also noted that there is longer any reason for them not to carry pricecompetitive us beef18 even though the us dollar has strengthened against the korean won in recent months making us beef more expensive than before the price of us beef reportedly is about half the cost of korean hanwoo beef and even lower than australian beef19 the usmef views the decision by these large retailers as critical to jumpstarting larger volume sales across all market sectors and leading other retail outlets and restaurants chains to add us beef before the lunar new year in late january 2009a period of peak consumption though the usmef views this development positively it notes that challenges remain these include consumer reaction to the broader availability of us beef and the extent to which households with reduced purchasing pow er respond to lowerpriced us beef 20 the 2008 bilateral beef agreement was intended to resolve an issue that some members of congress said stood in the way of congressional consideration of legislation to implement the korus fta now that south korea has put the agreement into effect these members are monitoring the pace of actual sales and how koreas quarantine inspection agency implements the revised rules however while koreas lifting of the beef ban was widely regarded as politically necessary condition for the bush administration to send this trade agreement to congress it has become less and less sufficient condition because of other opposition to the korus fta eg over its auto trade provisions and increased opposition to ftas in general even with the resumption of us beef exports the bush administration is not expected to submit the agreement to congress this year as result the decision on if and when to submit this fta to congress will be left to the obama administration g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561
