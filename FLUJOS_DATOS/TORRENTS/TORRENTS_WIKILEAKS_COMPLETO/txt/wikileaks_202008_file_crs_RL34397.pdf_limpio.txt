primer introduction individual retirement accounts iras are taxadvantaged accounts that individuals or married coupl can establish in orde r to accumulate funds for retirement depending on the type of ira contributions may be made on pretax or posttax basis and inve stment earnings are either taxdeferred or taxfree iras were first authorized by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa pl 93406 orig inally limited to workers wit hout pension coverage all workers and spouses were made eligible for iras by the economic recovery act of 1981 pl 9734 the tax refo rm act of 1986 pl 99514 limited the eligibility for taxdeductible contributions to individuals whose employers do not sponsor plans and to those whose employ ers sponsor plans but who have earnings below certain thresholds the taxpayer relief act of 1997 p l 10534 allowed for certain penaltyfree withdrawals and au thorized the roth ira which provides taxfree growth from aftertax contributions the economic growth nd tax relief rec onciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 significantly affected the contribution limits in these plans in three ways 1 it increased the limits 2 it indexed the limits to inflation and 3 it allowed for individuals 50 and older to make additi onal catchup contributions among other provisions the pension protection act of 2006 pl 109280 mporally allowed for taxfree distributions fo r charitable contributions ma permanent the indexing of contribution limits and allo wed taxpayers to direct th irs to deposit tax refunds directly into an ira1 this report describes the two kinds of

stment earnings in an account and these earnings are used as basis for retirement income among the benefits of traditional iras two are 1 pretax contributions provide larger bases for accumulating investment earnings and thus provide larger account bala nces at retirement than if the money had been placed in taxable accounts and 2 taxes are paid when funds are distributed since income tax rates in retirement are often lower than during working life traditional ira holders are likely to pay less in taxes when contributions are withdrawn than when the income was earned eligibility individuals who are less than 70½ years old in year and receive taxable compensation can set up and contribute to iras examples of compensation include wages salaries tips commissions selfemployment income alimony and nontaxable combat pay individuals who receive income only from noncompensation sources ca nnot contribute to iras contributions individuals may contribute either their gross compensation or the contribution limit whichever is lower in 2007 th contribution limit was 4000 in 2008 the contribution limit is 5000 and beginning in 2009 it will be indexed to inflation individuals 50 and older ma make additional 1000 catch up contributions for households that file joint return spous may contribute an amount equal to the couples total compensation reduced by the spouses ira contributions or the contribution limit 4000 each if younger than 50 and 5000 each if 50 years or older whichever is lower contributi ons that exceed the contribution limit and are not withdrawn by the due date for the tax return for that year are considered excess contributions and are subject to 6 excess contribution tax contributions made between january 1 and april 15 may be designated for either the current year or the previous year the following noncompensation sources of income cannot be used for ira contributions earnings from property in terest or dividends pension or annuity

httpwwwirsgovpubirspdfp590pdfinvestment options iras can be set up through many financial institutions such as banks credit unions mutual funds life insurance companies or stock brokerages individuals have an array of investment choices offered by the financial institutions and can transfer their accounts to other financial institutions if they are unhappy with their choices several transactions could result in additional taxes or the loss of ira status these transactions include borrowing from iras using iras as collateral for loans selling property to iras and investing in collectibles like

depending on whether the individual or spouse is covered by pension plan at work and the level of adju sted gross income individuals are covered by retirement plan if 1 the individuals or their employers ve made contributions to defined contribution pension plan or 2 the individuals are eligible for defined benefit pension plan even if they refuse participation for individuals and households

households adjusted gross income individuals w ithout employersponsored pensions and if married whose spouse also does not have pension coverage ma deduct up to the contribution limit from their

none of their ira contributions depending on the i ndividuals or households adjusted gross income individuals may still contribute to iras up to the contribution limit even if the contribution is nondeductible nonde ductible contributions come from posttax income not pretax income one advantage to placing posttax income in traditional iras is that investment earnings on nonde ductible

stringent than those summarized in table 5 for example an iras plan documents could require that desi gnated spouse or designated nonspouse beneficiary distribute all assets in the ira by the end of the fifth year of the year following the ira owners death in such case the beneficiary would not have the option to take distributions over longer period of time unless the ira plan documents specify otherwise it is possible to take distributions faster than required in table 5 for example beneficiary may elect to distribute all assets in single year in such case the entire amount dist ributed is
