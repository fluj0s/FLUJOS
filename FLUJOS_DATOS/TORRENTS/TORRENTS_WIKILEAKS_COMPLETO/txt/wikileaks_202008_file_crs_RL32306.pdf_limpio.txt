294 million for tribal accounts the house and the senate appr opriations committee increased f unds for historical accounting but capped the amount at 580 million in appropriations language for fy2005 congress approved the 58milli on cap which after resci ssions in the law is 572 million or 127 million 29 over fy2004 and 522 million 48 below the request the house appropriations co mmittee in its report on the fy2005 bill explained that the cap was related to ongoing mediation and settlement discussions in the trustfunds litigation and to the possibility of large future appropriations if these efforts failed litigation an iim trust funds classaction lawsuit cobell v norton was filed in 1996 in the federal district court for the district of columbia against the federal government by iim account holders6 many ost activities are related to the cobell case including litigation support activities but the most significant issue for appropriations concerns the method by which the historical accounting will be conducted to estimate iim acc ounts proper balances the dois proposed method was estimated by the depar tment to cost 335 million ove r five years and produce relatively low total owed to iim accounts the plaintiffs method whose procedural cost is uncertain was estimate d to produce figure of 176 billion owed to iim accounts in 2003 the court conducted lengthy trial to decide which historical accounting method to use in estimating the iim accounts proper balances previously in the first phase of the cobell case in 1999 the court had found that doi and the treasury department had breached trust duties regarding the necessary document retention and data gathering needed for an accounting and regarding the business systems and staffing to fix trust management the lawsuits final phase will determine the amount of money owed to the plaintiffs based on the historical accounting method chosen congress has for several years been concerned about the current and potential costs of the cobell lawsuit although it has liminated proposed appropriations language directing settlement of the case the appropriations committees have expressed concern that the iim lawsuit was jeopardizing doi trust reform implementation and have re quired reports from doi on th costs and benefits of historical accounting methods in cluding statistical sampling the courts decision on historical acc ounting was delivered on september 25 2003 the court rejected both the plai ntiffs and dois proposed historical accounting plans and instead ordered doi to account for all tr ust fund and asset transactions since 1887 without using statis tical sampling the interior department estimated that the courts choice for hist orical accounting would cost 612

statute or trust law principle s hould be construed to require the interior department to conduct the historical acc ounting until either congress had delineated the departments specific historical accounting obligations or december 31 2004 whichever was earlier the conferees asserted in the conference committee report that the courtordered hist orical accounting was too expensive beyond the intent of the 1994 act and likely to be appealed and that congress needed time to resolve the historical accounting question or settle the suit opponents in the house and senate argued that the provision was of doubtful constitutionality since it directed courts interpretation of law and effectively suspe nded court order in an ongoing case and further was unjust to the plaintiffs and might undermine the in terior departments incentives to negotiate settlement the fy2004 conference report with this provision passed both the senate and narrowly the house and was enacted on november 10

fy2005 appropriations bill expressed encouragement at the mediation and at commitments by the house and senate authorizing committees to develop legislative solution on december 10 2004 the appeals court overturned much of the september 25 order finding among other things that the congressional provision prevented the district court from requiring doi to follow its directions for historical accounting the appeals court noted that the pr ovision expired on december 31 2004 but did not discuss the district courts possible reissue of the order meanwhile bill was introduced in the 108th

assessed on tribes class ii and iii operations igra currently caps nigc fees at 8 million per year the nigc in recent years has requested additional funding because it has experienced increased demand

the fy2005 budget the administrati on proposed language amending igra to create an adjustable formulabased ceiling for fees instead of the current fixed ceiling the administration argued that formulabased fee ceiling would allow nigc funding to grow as the indian gaming industry grows gaming tribes did not support the increased fee ceiling or the pr oposed amendment of igras fee ceiling arguing that nigcs budget should first be re viewed in the context of extensive tribal and state expenditures on regulation of indi an gaming and that changes in nigcs fees should be developed in

flep but the provision was removed on the house floor on point of order the fy2005 law includes provision cancelling 200 million of flep funding leaving 200 million available for flep funding through fy2006 other provisions were considered but not enacted the house had agreed to the chabot amendment to prohibit funding fo r forest development roads to remove timber from the tongass national forest ak this amendment would have prevented new timber harvesting roads paid by taxpayers but would not have prevented road building by private timber companies or by the government for other purposes it

1975 consists of caverns formed out of natura lly occurring salt domes in louisiana and texas in which more than 650 million barrels of crude oil are stored the purpose of the spr is to provide an emergency source of crude oil wh ich may be tapped in the event of presidential finding that an in terruption in oil supply or an interruption threatening adverse economic effects warrants drawdown from the reserve in midnovember 2001 president bush ordered that the spr be filled to capacity 700 million barrels using royaltyinki nd rik oil this is oil turned over to the federal government as payment for production from federal leases acquiring oil for the spr by rik avoids the necessity for congress to make outlays to finance direct purchase of oil however it also m eans loss of revenues to the treasury in so far as the royalties are paid in wet barrels rather than in cash deliveries of rik oil began in the spring of 2002 and in early 2005 were scheduled to continue through april additional deliveries are highly likely until the spr is filled deliveries that were scheduled for 2002 and the first months of 2003 were delayed due to tightness in world oil markets some policymakers in the 108th congress urged the administration to suspend rik deliveries once again so that rikhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32306crs50 oil could be released to tight markets the administration argued that the 100000 200000 barrels per day of deliv eries to the spr are marginal volumes too small to have any discernible effect on crude and product prices there were three attempts dur ing the second session of the 108th congress to temporarily suspend deliveries of rik oil to the spr on march 11 2004 during debate on the fy2005 budget resolution the nate agreed to another suspension of deliveries of rik oil and sale of this oil instead several members of the house also have voiced support for deferra l of deliveries during house floor debate on the interior appropriations bill representative sanders offered an amendment to suspend rik deliveries and forbid the expenditure of funds in the bill to maintain the spr above 647 million barrels the vel at which the spr was when the senate passed its budget resolution the amendment was rejected the most recent attempt to suspend fill occurred on september 14 2004 during debate on hr 4567 the fy2005 department of home land security appropriati ons bill senator byrd proposed suspension of rik fill in or der to provide 470 million in additional funding for homeland security purposes the amendment fell on point of order the current program costs for the spr are almost exclusively dedicated to maintaining spr facilities and keeping the spr in readiness should it be needed the costs of transporting rik oil to spr s ites are now borne by the contractors so new money was requested for the spr petroleum account beginning with fy2004 the request for spr for fy2005 was 1771 million 1721 million for the

committee on appropriations the enacted appropriation for fy2005 including the nhor is 1746 million comprehensive energy legislation hr 6 reported from conference during the 108th congress would have

funds that specify and direct the purpose of funds fi nally government gran ts and contracts are provided by various government agencies for projects specific to the smithsonian institution and they

legacy program and the habitat conservation program tion of the cooperative endangered species conservation fund this was nearly 500 million less than the administrations request for funding for other programs in the minority views attached to the report representatives obey and dicks stated that they disagree with the illogicallydriven opposition to land ac quisition but did not comment on lwcf funding for other programs hrept 108542 p 180 the total for lwcf in senate legi slation was 5490 million which would have been less of reduction from funding in past years than the housepassed bill this legislation provided almost the same total as the administration requested for federal land acquisiti on although the amount for the nps was more than 22 million less than the request while the amount for the fs more than 15 million than the administration request more specifically the senate legisl ation earmarked 179 million for 11 blm sites 347 million for 36 fws sites 453 million for 19 nps sites and 665 million for 37 fs sites stat grants were almost the same as the house bill the senate bill provided mo re than 237 million to 5 other programs 4 of which are administered by the fish and wildlife service the fy2005 law provides more than the h ouse had allocated but less than the senate for each of the four federal land management ag encies for acquisition the total for state grants is little changed fro m the request and the amounts in the house and senate bills the fy2005 appropriation for othe r purposes totals 2034 million for four fws programs and one fs program which is less than half the administration request but more than doubl the amount that the house bill would have provided the enacted levels nd overall consideration of lwcf funding appeared to be somewhat less contentious this year httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32306crs68 conservation spending category congress created the conservation spending category csc as an amendment to the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 in the fy2001 interior appropriations law the csc which is so being called the conservation trust fund by some combines funding for more than two dozen resource protection programs including the lwcf it also includes some coastal and marine programs funded through commerce appropr iations this action was in response to both the clinton administration request for substan tial funding increases in these programs under its lands legacy initiative and congressional interest in increasing conservation funding through legisl ation known as the conservation and reinvestment act cara whic h passed the house in the 106th congress the fy2001 interior appropriations law authorized that total spending for csc would grow each year by 1600 million from 16 billion in fy2001 of which 12 billion would be through interior appropriations laws to 24 billion in fy2006 all csc funding is subject to the appropriations process also how programs are categorized or scored matters the administration and the appropriations committees disagree on whether all or portions of funding for some programs should be credited to the csc the appropriati ons history through fy2005 is as follows the fy2001 laws exceeded the target of 16 billion by appropriating total of 168 billion 120 billion for interior appropriations programs and 048 billion for commerce appropriations programs tot als for interior and commerce funding were both increases from the preceding year of 566 and 160 million respectively the fy2002 request totaled 154 billi on for this group of programs and congress appropr iated 175 billion thus almost r eaching the target of 176 billion the appropr iation for the interior portion was 132 billion reaching the authorized target amount the fy2003 request totaled 167 billi on for this group of programs decrease from fy2002 funding and below the target of 192 billion congress appropriated total of 151 billion for the interior portion congress provided 103 b illion bout 410 million less than the authorized target of 144 billion the fy2004 request totaled 133 billion according to estimates compiled by interior and commerce appropriations subcommittee staffs this am ount is below the target of 208 billion for the interior portion the request was 100 billion and the target is 156 billion the administration had an alternative estimate that increases the total fy2004 request to 122 billion for interior programs but it is based on some different assumptions about which programs to include the tota l appropriated is not specified in congressional documents the fy2005 request from the departme nt of the interior included 105 billion for the csc an increase of 140 million over thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32306crs69 fy2004 appropriation for the same group of programs according to the department however this total did not include requests from the forest service or department of commerce neither the forest service nor the department of commerce used the csc as structure for organizing or tabula ting their requests in any case these requests in total are likely to be well below the target of 224 billion the total appropr iated is unclear none of the fy2005 bills or accompanying committee reports identified f unding levels for the csc with one excepti on the house appropriations committees report accompanying the fy2005 housepasse d bill mentions the csc only in the minority views where representatives obey and dicks state that the bill would fund the csc at 850 million below the 17 billion target for fy2005 the report does not include other funding levels or broa der discussions of the csc the senate appropriations committees report accompanying the fy2005 appropriations bill did not mention the csc by name in discu ssion of conservation funding srept 108 341 p5 it stated that the committee remai ns concerned about proposals to create direct entitlement funding for selected conservation
