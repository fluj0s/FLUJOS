organiza tions that in addition to their responsibility to comply with campaign finance laws they are subject to tax on certain political expenditures1 the ruling lists criteria that the irs uses when determining whether an expenditure foran issue advocacy communication is taxable and provides examples section 501c of the intern revenue code describes various organizations that qualify for taxexempt status under the code some of these organizations may participate in political campaign activity 2 these include the organizations described in irc 501c4 social welfar organizations 501c5 labor unions and 501c6 trade associations while they may participate in such activity without risking their 501c status these organizations are taxed if they make certain political expenditures specifically under irc 527f 501c organization is subject to tax on any expenditure made for an exempt function an exempt function is the influencing or attempting to influence the selection mination election or appointment of an individual to federal state or local public office to an office in political organization or as presidential or vicepresidential elector3 the term exempt function can be confusing when talking about 501c or ganization because the organization is not exempt from tax when it makes an expenditu re for an exempt function it may be helpful to understand that the term exempt function is primarily used to describe thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21725crs2 4 see plr 9652026 1996 plr 9725036 1997 plr 9808037 1997 plr 199925051 1999activities that section 527 political organiza tions may conduct without being subject to tax in other words 527 organization is exempt from tax when it makes an expenditure for an exempt function while 501c orga nization is subject to tax when it makes an expenditure for an exempt function the determination of whether an expend iture is for an exempt function is dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case revenue ruling 20046 provides guidance in this area by presenting nonexhaustive list of factors that the irs considers in determining whether an expenditure for an issue advocacy communication is for an exempt function according to the ruling f actors that tend to show an expenditure for an issue advocacy communication is for an exempt function include the communication identifies candidate for public office the communication identifies the candi dates position on the subject of the communication the candidates position has been rais ed either by the communication or in other public communications to distinguish him or her from other candidates the communication is timed to coincide with an electoral campaign the communication is targeted at vot ers in particular election and the communication is not part of an ongoing series of substantially similar advocacy communications by th organization on the same issue factors that tend to show the expenditure is not for an exempt function include the absence of one or mo re of the above factors the communication identifies specific legislation or an event outside the organizations control that the organization hopes to influence the communications timing coincides with specific event outside theorganizations control that it hopes to influence the candidate is identified solely as government official who is in aposition to act on the issue in connection with specific event eg will vote on the legislation and the candidate is identified solely in list of the legislations key sponsors the ruling provides six examples that i nvolve 501c4 501c5 and 501c6 organizations making expenditures for issue advocacy communications the examples explain whether each expenditure is for an exempt function and therefore taxable under irc 527f there was little guidance in this area prior to the ruling but the ruling is consistent with the irss position on such things as voter education activities4 if 501c organization makes an expenditu re for an exempt function then it is taxed at the highest corporate tax rate on the lesser of its net investment income or the amount of taxable expenditures so long as the organization is allowed to participate in political activity eg is 501c4 501c 5 or 501c6 organization its taxexempt status is not at risk simply because it made taxable expenditure in order to avoid

is intended to provide 501c organizations with guidance on when they become subject to tax under irc 527f the ruling also helps clarify the ta x treatment of 527 organizations these organizations are political organizations th at are organized and operated primarily to accept contributions and make expenditures for exempt functions6 they are exempt from tax on certain types of income to the extent that the funds are used for exempt functions by providing guidance on the finition of exempt function the ruling may be helpful to them 501c3 organizations taxexempt 501c3 organizations are mainly formed for religious educational and charitable purposes these organizations may lobby on public policy issues but may not participate in political campaign activity although revenue ruling 20046 does not explicitly address 501c3 organizations it may still be helpful for determining what 501c3 organizations can and cannot do with respect to issue advocacy communications this is because the irs has at times taken the position that political activities prohibited under section 501c3 are correspondingly treated as being for an exem pt function under section 5277 thus the ruling may provide guidance on whether the irs will c onsider an issue advocacy communication to be prohibited 501c3 political activity howe ver it is not clear that the determination that an activity is for an exempt function will necessarily mean that it is prohibited 501c3 political activity8
