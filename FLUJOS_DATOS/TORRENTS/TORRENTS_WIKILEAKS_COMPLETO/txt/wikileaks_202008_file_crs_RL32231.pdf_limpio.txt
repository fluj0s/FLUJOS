governments in this report racial profiling is defined as the practice of targeting individuals for police or security interdic tion detention or othe r disparate treatment based primarily on their race or ethnicity in the belief that certain minority groups are more likely to engage in unlawful behavior assertions that law enforcement personnel at all levels unfai rly target certain racial nd ethnic groups particularly but not exclusively for traffic st ops and searches have raised concerns about violations of the constitution major debate on racial profiling centers on whether the practice should be prohibited entirely and whether da ta on traffic stops and searches should be collected to determine if the practice is occurring this report analyzes the debate and focuses on legislative proposals on racial profiling before congress number of bills relating to racial profiling have been introduced in the 108th congress and have been re ferred to their respective committees

held hearings on racial profiling during the 107th congress there has been some recent presidentia l involvement on the issue of racial profiling on june 18 2003 president george w bush issued guidelines to bar federal agents from using race or ethnicity in routine investigations the guidelines however exempt investigations of terrori sm and other national security concerns in 2001 the president instructed the attorney general to review the role of race in the decision of federal law enforcement au thorities to c onduct stops and searches to work with congress on procedures for da ta collection and to cooperate with state and local law enforcement to assess the extent and content of those procedures two federal agencies the bureau of justice statistics and the general accounting office have researched and published their findings on aspects of racial profiling the major recommendations for determining if racial profiling is occurring are to collect data on stops and searches by law enforcement officers and to use technology as an aid in detec ting the practice the collecti on of data is controversial leading to questions about what to collect how to collect it who is to analyze it where the data would be housed and for how long what the collection of statistics would accomplish and whether its collection is an invasion of privacy this report will be

of racial prof iling for this report racial profiling is defined as the practice of targeting individuals for police or security interdiction detention or other disparate treatment based primarily on their race or ethnicity in the belief that certain minority groups are more likely to engage in unlawful behavior1 for years members of africanamerican and hispanic communities have complained that they were victims of profiling the circumstances under which profiling may occur vary for example allegations of racial profiling have been aimed at security personne l of department stores who suspect african american shoppers of stealing traditionally howev er accusations of racial profiling have resulted from encounters at traffic stops and have been directed at local and state police the impetus for police traffic stops and searches may be the perception that members of certain minority groups are more likely to be engaged in the illicit drug trade in searching for illicit drugs us customs agents and border patrol officers have been charged with racial profiling as well2 with the racial and ethnic makeup of the nation changing and after the rrorist attacks of september 11 2001 other groups such as arab americans muslims and asian americans have joined the call for an end to racial profiling anecdotal accounts of racial profiling have been the basis for most complaints against the practice individuals reportedly have been subjected to racial profiling while walking shopping and driving sometimes black individuals are stopped and questioned by police if in the perception of the police these individuals are walking in the wrong neighborhood ie white neighborhood or uppermiddle class neighborhood3 other points of contact with w enforcement personnel that lead to allegations of racial profiling are airports and border points of entry more often however charges of racial profiling occur when person is driving vehicle and the driver or passengers of car based on the judgment of law enforcement personnelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32231crs2 4 racial profiling is sometimes referred to as profiling and ethnic profiling 5 for fuller discussion of the action of

act by establishing visa fairness commission to collect data on racial profiling by american embassies and us border and immigration inspectors because number of bills that were introduced in the 107th congress offered variety of approaches to addressing raci profiling this report provides detailed analysis of them some of these legisla tive proposals were directed specifically at certain federal agencies others at state law enforcement officials this report examines racial profiling nd legislative proposals that affect law enforcement efforts5 policy questions racial profiling is complex and controversial issue in addressing the matter of racial profiling whether practiced at the state and local levels or in federal agencies to combat illicit drug activity or terrorism congress is faced with number of questions some of these questions ar listed here followed by more detailed section on arguments on racial profiling how should profili ng be defined there are many definitions of profiling with federal agencies states local jurisdictions and citizens all offering their own definitions some are more comprehensive than others racial profiling may be defined as all law enforcement activities that are initiated solely on the basis of race while another definition may focus only on the context of vehicle stops the term racial profiling can overemphasize r ace leaving out ethnicity gender or other considerations as factors that influence law enforcement action is racial profiling common or an exceptional practice studies that have attempted to measure the extent of racial profiling have been for the most part methodologically flawed while some studies have shown that minor ities are disproportionately subjected to traffic stops and searches general accounting office gao report concluded that the st udies did not distinguish between thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32231crs3 6 us general accounting office racial profiling limited data available on motorist stops gao report ggd0041 mar 2000seriousness of traffic viola tions nor did the analyses provide information on which traffic violations if any were more likely to result in stop6 gao suggests that analyses examine whether diffe rent groups may have been at different levels of risk for being stopped because their rates andor verity of violating traffic laws differed in other words some racialethnic groups may commit more traffic violations such as speeding tailgating or having faulty equipment than other groups should data on st ops and searches be collected supporters of data collection maintain that it can help deter mine if racial profiling is occurring can assist law enforcement agencies in becoming more effective in identifying problems and can indicate to the community vel of commitment to unbiased policing opponents of data collection believe that it is not cost effective in addition they warn that it can harm relations between police and the community because despite the limitations of data collection there ma be public perception that conclusions drawn from analyses of these data are va lid sometimes law enforcement personnel and departments are unfairly disparaged ba sed on data collection studies some feel the nature and extent of racial profiling ca nnot be determined by using social science methods who should be held accountable when racial profiling is practiced and how some feel that ultimately the head of an agency or department is responsible for establishing policies and pro cedures not staff in this view the top administrator must set the cultural tone of the agency in word and action checks and balances and review sy stem can be established to ensure that laws policies and procedures relating to racial profiling are carried out at all levels in an acceptable fashion they suggest that those who violate established rules of operation should be provided tr aining should be monitored in the future and if they continue to disregard official policy and procedure then they should be discharged from service others believe that to eliminate racial profiling there s hould be more severe consequences for individuals who practice it as well as their supervisors they want law enforcement agents and managers subj ect to civil suit opponents of lawsuits believe this is not good way to solve the problem they predict it will exacerbate tensions between police and minority communities and will cause valuable resources to be used defending law enforcement rather than battling crime should technology be used as tool in eliminating racial profiling it is generally accepted that tec hnology can play an important role in identifying and eliminating racial profiling concerns however have been expressed about the sole reliance on technological vices to record traffic stop and passenger search occurrences some argue that the use of audiovideo technological devices invades the privacy of citizenshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32231crs4 7 see crs report rl31950 racial profiling and traffic stops in the states selected issues and legislative approaches by sula p richardsonwhat data should be collected elements suggested for documentation in data collection include race ethnicity location of the traffic stop reasons for the stop searches conducted if any consen t of vehicle occupants to the search identification and confiscati on of contraband and action taken by law enforcement such as an arrest or issuance of ticke t in addition at issue is uniform data collection on traffic stops some feel it is sufficient to collect data only on certain law enforcement actions eg arrests and issuance of tickets others argue that in order to accurately assess raci profiling data on all tra ffic stops must be recorded who will analyze the data collected the same data can yield very different interpretations depending upon who analyzes it some suggest that the collected data be analyzed not by affect ed law enforcement departments or agencies but by an outside group or persons with reco gnized training in statistics design and data analysis in this view objective analysts would more likely be associated with college or university or an indepe ndent social science research firm how should collected data be used some question the need and appropriateness for the mass collection of racial and ethnic data their data collection concerns are citizen privacy access to the material protection of the identity of individuals and law enforcement agents and maintenance storage and final disposition of the data who will provide funds for the cost of purchasing maintaining and storing technological equipment and data collected video technological devices are expensive they are co stly to purchase require maintenance and need to be stored who will bear the cost of acquiring and maintaining this equipment is federal racial prof iling legislation needed many argue that racial profiling is largely state and local probl em and believe there is good reason for ordering federal law enforcement agencies to record the race and origin of everybody they question search or arrest they point to the current activity on racial profiling at both the state and local leve ls as an adequate response to the problem to the extent that there is problem7 some believe that law enfo rcement personnel are more than capable of correcting racial profiling and want to do so further they claim that not enough is known about the issue for congress to offer broad solutions that affect states and localities others question whether even at the federal level legislation is needed to eliminate racial profiling in the executive branch maintaining that if federal agency is engaging in the practice agency administrators can handle the problem by ordering an investigation and taking corrective action as needed supporters of federal action respond by pointing out that there are many approaches to correcting r acial profiling and that this creates problem when comparative studies of different jurisdictions and agencies are made to determine the nationwide extent of the practice

trying to compare studies was like comparing apples and nuts because of problems with data components others argue that states and localities use different strategies and policies to address racial profiling consequently an individuals protection against this unconstitutional practice varies depending upon the jurisdiction in which the stop or profiling incident happens according to this argument provisions of the constitution s hould uniformly protect citizens against racial profiling in all areas of the united states and federal legislation would ensure that this occurs further federal legi slation requiring uniform data collection standards could offer comprehensive res ponse to racial profiling and would allow more valid comparison of studies of racial profiling in different jurisdictions or agencies to be conducted8 arguments on racial profiling law enforcement has been accused of pr acticing racial profiling in the pursuit of two major goals to prevent illicit drug activity and to stop terrorists in the debate on the appropriateness of profiling some make distinction between the two according to polls conducted since 1999 the vast majority of americans disapprove of racial profiling when traffic stops are involved9 when questioned about racial profiling to identify terrorists however their response was quite different majority of americans polled approved of racial profiling to intercept terrorists because the terrorist attack ers of september 11 2001 were identified as arabs many have asked for increased scrutiny of them majority of americans polled favored requiring arabs including those who ar us citizens to undergo special more intensive security checks before boarding us airplanes nearly 50 of persons responding to one poll reportedly would s upport requiring arabs including those who are us citizens to carry special id10 according to another national poll of june 2002 conducted by op inion dynamics 54 percen t of respondents approved of using racial profiling to screen arab male airline passengers while 34 percent disapproved of the practice more recen t national poll conduc ted between october 21 and november 25 2002 by cornell university indicated that 68 percent of respondents supported racial profiling as tool to fight terrorism11 some argue that an increased scrutiny of arabs is justifie d because the public safety issue should be the major factor in deciding whether to profile any group according to this view when practiced politely and respectfully racial profiling may be vital

were born in this country their appearance can vary from blond hair white skin and blue eyes to dark hair dark skin and brown eyes lthough they are often perceived as muslims the majority of arab americans are reportedly christian of the estimated 6 million muslims in the united states the largest group is african american not arab according to the economist magazine13 concern about terrorism also has prompt ed calls for profiling persons entering this country from specific geographic re gion of the world ie persons whose national origin is the middle east proponents of this practice argue that the lack of technological means to detect bombs nd long delays caused by searching the luggage of passengers make effective screen ing nearly impossible also it is argued that were policy of profiling by nati onal origin in place on september 11 2001 all 19 of the terrorists might have been in tercepted those who oppose this strategy point out that muslims and people of middle eastern descent have migrated to countries around the world terrorists of middle eastern background could come from germany france or any country out side of the middle eastern region in addition the largest population of muslims about 200 m illion lives in i ndonesia they suggest that in searching for terro rists the emphasis should be on suspicious behavior14 some believe that racial profiling has been shown to be ineffective when used to identify persons involved in illicit drug activities in support of their argument they offer an orlando sentinel investigation of vehicle st ops on an interstate highway in florida while nearly 70 of motori sts stopped were black or hispanic only 5 of the drivers on that highway were minor ities of the 1000 stops police made nine resulted in traffic ticket as another example they point to the new york attorney generals report that found stopandfrisk tactics on norities were less likely to lead to arrests than stops of whites15 critics of using racial profiling to combat illicit drugs argue that despite rising rates of arrest and incarceration and record drug seizures drugs are more available than ever they also point to the difficulty in visibly discerning race or ethnicity16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32231crs7 17 for legal analysis of the issue of racial profiling see crs report rl31130 racial profiling legal and constitutional issues by

pp 56many civil rights advocates charge that racial profiling violates individuals constitutional rights specifically the fourth protects against unreasonable searches and seizures fifth protects against di scrimination by federal law enforcement officers that is based on race ethnicity or national origin and the fourteenth amendment provides security nd equal protection of the laws17 spokesmen for various law enforcement groups have commented on the practice of racial profiling recognizing the central and difficult position that law enforcement officers occupy in balancing i ndividual rights and pub lic safety in basic enforcement the international association of chiefs of police iacp states that if officers are perceived as biased in their actions it can foster mistrust and suspicion among some members of the public according to the iacp those persons who mistrust law enforcement officers often believe that police officers violate rather than protect their civil rights iacp states th at although this perception is inaccurate it damages efforts to reduce crime because law enforcement agen cies need community support to solve crimes therefore to build confidence in law enforcement the iacp opposes biased enforcement practices18 the national organization of black law enforcement executives noble another law enforcement group opposes racial profiling whether it is used to fight illicit drugs or terrorism on the grounds that it threatens our demo cratic way of life pointing to historical abuses that have occurred under the umbrella of national security for example the internment of japaneseamericans in world war ii spokesman for noble rejects justifi cation of the practice on those grounds arguing further that people not r ace or ethnicity commit crime he questions linking an entire group of people to crime ba sed on the behavior of few of that race or ethnicity he uses the following ex ample blacks are responsible for 80 of reported crime in town but that doesnt mean that 80 of blacks commit crime more likely 5 of the towns black populati on is responsible for the high crime rate in addition he states that fear is the driving force behind demands for ethnic and racial profiling whether it is fear of crime and violence or fear of another terrorist attack and that bias prejudice and racism only add fuel to the fire of fear19 noble believes that over the past few years law enforcement has lost the respectand confidence of the public and that the he roic response of public safety officers to the terrorist attacks offers second chance to restore that trust and achieve national unity therefore it maintains that we s hould learn from our historical mistakes and be creative in addressi ng national challenges the

the color of his or her skin according to spokesman for fop racism is never legitimate law enforcement tool20 he also states that statistically minorities have greater chance of being crime victims because crimes occur more frequently in areas with large minority population good policing means going after criminals and patrolling areas where crimes are committed this is good police work not racism21 collection of traffic stop data collecting data that might help in evaluating the relationship between race and traffic stops by law enforcement officers has been offered as the primary way of determining whether racial profiling is practiced but analyzing data on the nature character and demographics of law enforcement practices to determine racial profiling is very complex major problem with data collection is how to analyze data once collected since there are national datacoll ection standards or guidelines there is agreement on what racial profiling is or how to measure it for instance if blacks comprise 15 of citys population but 20 of the traffic stops is that evidence of racial profiling what if traffic stops for them were 30 should the number of searches conducted at traffic stops be recorded not only what information is collected but where it is co llected is relevant should residential populations or driving populations be used are the population data used current census data may be 10 years old and may poorly reflect the changing populations in urban areas with increased mobility and immigration data collected in an urban area with dense poor minority populati on with few car owners will likely result in very different findings than data collected on an interstate highway where the driving population is likely to be more diverse the same data can result in divergent in terpretations the challenge according to harvard law school professo r margo schlanger is that legally it is very difficult to use statistics to determine police fficers motivation officers can respond to statistics revealing that hi gh percentage of blacks is indeed stopped and searched by saying that there are just more blacks who do suspicious things statistics alone cannot prove intenti onal discrimination22 when first proposed the international ssociation of chiefs of police and the grand lodge fraternal order of police opposed the collection of data three

data proposals would burden already overworked police forces and would run count er to police training efforts to teach officers not to consider race24 another argument of opponents is that resources might be better used fighting racially bi ased policing and the perceptions thereof rather than collecting data25 in 1999 the executive director of the fraternal order of police said it collecting data shortc uts meaningful dialogue between the police and the community if anything it exacerbates the gulf26 some oppose the federal governments ma ss collection of racial and ethnic data without good reason27 on the grounds that it is an invasion of privacy proponents of this view state that when police stop people because of racial or ethnic characteristics and not what they have done it is both wrong and bad police work to them the objective of wanting to do some thing about racial profiling is too vague to merit intrusion in our shrinking zone of privacy28 they also question the ultimate use of these data by 2000 however the international associ ation of chiefs of police had joined other groups such as noble in support of gislation requiring collection of traffic stop data noble supports data collecti on citing the following reasons to build trust between law enforcement and minority communities to identify and stop inappropriate police conduct to improve police productivity by enabling police to use the most effective stopandsearch prac tices by assessing and studying the types of stops time spent on them and the results of such stops to reenforce to officers that racial profiling is not consistent with effective policing and with equal protection under the law to identify practices that some officers may be using subconsciously and to assist law

collection the association will only support data collection legislation that ensures that an impartial and sc ientifically sound methodology will be used for evaluating collected data31 while some governmental agencies and private groups have collected data that suggest minorities are dispropor tionately the subject of routine traffic stops many law enforcement organizations challenge th findings to demonstrate how law enforcement results can be misinterpreted fop representative steven young cited an experience of the arlington county virg inia police department in response to demands from the black community for incr eased enforcement against drug dealers in arlington county the police instituted ggressive motorvehicle checks and other actions to make dealers uncomfortable in the neighborhood their efforts however resulted in increased arre sts of minorities and ironically left th police department vulnerable to accusations of disproportionately arresting minorities he argued that to use statistical data without an adequa tely sophisticated benchmark for analysis is bad policy32 efforts to rely on comprehensive data rather than anecdotal accounts to determine if racial profiling occurs in fede ral state or local law enforcement have proved troubling primarily because the lack of uniform data components makes the validity of comparing different studies ques tionable

well as federal state nd local data on motorist stops on march 13 2000 gao reported that it found comprehensiv source of information that could be used to determine if race had been primary factor in motorist stops problem associated with traffic data analysis is the small number of locations studied only five quantitative analyses were ava ilable and according to gao they were methodologically flawed gao stated th at these analyses failed to provide conclusive empirical data fro m social science standpoint35 to determine the extent to which racial profiling may have occurred that is while the analyses included data on the relative propor tion of minorities stopped on roadway gao believes that is only part of the information needed to assess the extent of racial profiling that may have occurred the best of the studies that gao analyz ed determined the race of motorists at risk of being stopped and collected informa tion on the number of travelers and traffic violations on specific roads but even th is study did not distinguish between the gravity of different traffic violations th analyses did not provide information on which traffic violations if any were more likely to result in stop gao suggests that analyses fully examine the question of whether different groups may have been at different levels of risk for being stoppe d because they differed in their rates andor the severity of traffic law violations that is were some groups more likely than others to commit certain traffic violations such as speeding tailgating failing to give signal when changing lanes driving w ithout license or without proper vehicle registration and equipment violations such consideration might determine if minority groups are stopped at th same rate that they viol ate traffic laws and if so might suggest that group member s were stopped for particular traffic violations rather than for race or ethnicity36 despite these limitations gao found that in the studies it reviewed africanamerican and other minority motorists were proportionately more likely than whites to be stopped on the roadways studied37httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32231crs13 38 steven holmes clinton orders

federal mandates representing the grand lodge fraternal order of police steve young opposed provisions that would have used st atistical data against law enforcement officers and agencies in court young believe d that the bill rather than repairing the bonds of trust and respect between w enforcement and minority communities would widen them because it presumed that racist tactics are commonly used by police departments according to him the definition of racial profiling was too broad because unless there was an eyewitness or specific description of suspects race or ethnicity law enforcement officer could never use race as factor in an investigation43 house committee on government reform on july 19 2001 the house government reform committee held hearin g that focused on technology as tool to eliminate racial profiling44 witnesses identified adva ntages and disadvantages of using the two major visual technologies analog and digital in traffic stops these surveillance systems are often mounted in the grill on the dash or on the roof of car with recorder placed in the trunk similar to the home vhs video cassette recorder the analog video simply records an image on tape and th tapes are kept for certain period of time and th either discarded or reus ed with digital technology the recorded image is converted into dig ital file and recorded on either tape flash memory cards hard drives cd roms or dvd discs the advantages of video technologies are they provide an objectiv documentation of events that the camera can see and hear the material can be revi ewed by supervisors and researchers and they can influence in positive way the behavior of citizen and law enforcement officer video tapes also can be used as teaching tool for law enforcement officers disadvantage of using video technologies is that if relied upon solely to detect racial profiling the device usually sees less than the officer can cameras may not show what precipitated the stop before filming began the purchase price 3000 5000 per video camera and maintena nce of equipment are expensive maintenance is expensive because of the number of tapes used typically six patrol cars use over 500 tapes each month of stor age facilities that would be needed and of the review of videos that supervisor would have to conduct many systems are improperly installed and po orly maintained resulting in poor audio and image quality most installations allow the operator to rerecord which could result in tampering finally privacy concerns ar raised in using t echnological
