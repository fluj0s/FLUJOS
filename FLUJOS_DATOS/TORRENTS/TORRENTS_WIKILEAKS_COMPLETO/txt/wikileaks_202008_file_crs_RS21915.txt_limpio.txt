sharing among government agencies and the private sector the president should safeguard the privacy of individuals about whom information is shared the burden of proof for retaining particular governmental power should be on the executive to explain 1 that the power actually materially enhances security and 2 that there is adequate supervision of the executives use of the powers to ensure protection of civil liberties if the power is granted there must be adequate guidelines and oversight to properly confine its use at this time of increased and consolidated government authority there

httpwww911commissiongovhearingshearing6witness_rotenbergpdf crs4 the guidelines recommended and the commitment the government makes to defend civil liberties13 key markle foundation task force recommendations guidelines must be set by the president regarding personal information collection analysis and availability which among other considerations will enable managers to embed respect for privacy and civil liberties into the core definition of analysis itself guidelines for database access and use should be prescribed offering framework and procedures to allow such information to be effectively used analyzed and disseminated while also ensuring that information about people in the united states is used in responsible fashion that respects responsible claims to individual privacy the duties of the department of homeland security privacy officer and office of civil rights and civil liberties need to be clarified by httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21915 combining the two offices into one well funded and staffed civil liberties and privacy office with well spelled out referral criteria for the departments inspector general14 the president should issue an executive order which among other considerations creates within the terrorist threat integration center ttic appropriate institutional mechanisms to safeguard privacy and other civil liberties congress should undertake review of the performance of federal agencies in improving analysis and information sharing as prescribed by the commission and in utilizing private sector information while protecting civil liberties guidelines covering how information is collected used and shared among the relevant actors are critical for several different but complementary reasons including robust sharing of information only being pursued consistent with civil liberties interests the president needs to set forth in an executive order guidelines that establish the principles for using the recommended information network to improve information collection analysis and sharing while protecting civil liberties the executive branch should create within the ttic the appropriate institutional mechanisms to safeguard privacy rights 13 op cit the 911 commission report pp 394395 14 markle foundation task force on national security in the information age protecting americas freedom in the information age new york october 2002 pp 31 32 35 crs5 the government should establish guidelines to regulate access to use and sharing of private sector data among agencies which would help the government to ensure that information is used in ways that are consistent with core national values including privacy other civil liberties and the functioning of an accountable democratic political system rules governing access to and use of private sector data should be based primarily on two dominant considerations the value of the information to the government and the sensitivity of the information from the perspective of individual privacy and other civil liberties it is strongly preferred that private sector data be kept in the private sector whenever possible rather than having the government retain it in areas where the government has compelling need to retain private sector information solution might be to create trusted data banks within the government with strict limitations on who has access to the underlying data and for what specific purpose httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21915 another way to help limit the government retention of private sector data to that which is essential to the mission would be to require formal written justifications for the creation and retention of data sets that contain personally identifiable information the recommended guidelines must also address the question of how to assure compliance with the required policies and procedures and foster accountability and some agency the department of homeland security is recommended must have overall supervisory responsibility to oversee the application of the guidelines oversight of government use of private sector information should ensure the accuracy of the data that is brought into the information network because accuracy is vital not only to protect the privacy and civil liberties of individuals who can be harmed by the use of inaccurate data but also to assure that information has real value to the counterterrorism effort15 key gilmore commission recommendation the president should establish an independent bipartisan civil liberties oversight board to provide advice on any change to statutory or regulatory authority or implementing procedures for combating terrorism that has or may have civil liberties implications even from unintended consequences16 15 markle foundation task
