conflicting and inconsistent regulation of pension and welfare benefit plans by various state laws3 such laws were believed to be inadequate in protecting the interests of plan participants nd beneficiaries4 prior to erisas enactment there was comprehensive regulation of the individuals who managed plan assets and controlled the operation of employee benefit plans plan fiduciaries were regulated by combination of federal and state laws and by common law trust principles5 in many instances plan fiduciaries were able to limit their liability by contract or were beyond the jurisdicti on of particular court6 under erisa fiduciaries must act solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of plan7 the act defines fiduciary as someone who 1 exercises any discretionary authority or cont rol with respect to the management of plan or exercises any authority or control with respect to the management or dispositi on of plan assets 2 renders investment advice for fee or other compensation dir ect or indirect with respect to any moneys or other property of such pla n or has any authority or responsibility to do so or 3 has any discretionary authority or responsibility

section 406a1c of erisa pr ohibits fiduciary from engaging in transaction when he knows or should know that such transaction constitutes direct or indirect furnishing of goods services or facilities

recommendations provided under the programany transaction could fall within one of th prohibited transaction categories individuals are reluctant to provide investment advice13 recognizing that participants and be neficiaries may not have sufficient understanding of investment pr inciples and strategies to make informed investment decisions the department of labor dol issued an interpretive bulletin in 1996 that identified categories of information and materials that would not constitute investment advice for purposes of eris as fiduciary definition14 the interpretive bulletin discusses the provision of investmentrelated educa tional information to participants and beneficiaries rather than the rendering of investment advice the interpretive bulletin contemplates the availability of information and materials that info rm participant about the benefits of increasing plan contribu tions that discuss ge neral financial and investments concepts such as diversifica tion that provide pa rticipant with asset allocation models and that allow participant to estimate future retirement income needs and assess the impact of different asset allocations on retirement income15 in 2001 dol issued an advisory opinion th at commented directly on the provision of investment advice to par ticipants and beneficiaries16 in response to an application from sunamerica retirement markets inc sunamerica provider of financial services for an exemption from erisas prohibited transaction restrictions dol considered whether sunamerica would violat erisa if investment advice was provided through program involving computer m odel that applied methodology developed maintained and overseen by financial expert who was independent of sunamerica17 dol concluded that sunameri ca would act as fiduciary only to the extent that it was responsible for the prude nt selection and periodic m onitoring of its investment advisory services individual investme nt recommendations pr ovided or implemented under the program however would not be the result of sunamericas exercise of authority control or responsibility such that erisas prohibited tr ansaction restrictions would be
