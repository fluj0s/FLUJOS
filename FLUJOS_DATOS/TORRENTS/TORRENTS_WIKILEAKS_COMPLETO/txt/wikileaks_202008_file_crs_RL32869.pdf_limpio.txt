contentious aspect of the tenantbased assistance account is the renewal of existin g vouchers congress has authorized the creation of more than 2 million vouchers over the histor of the program and the funding for virtually all of them expires ev ery year if family is using voucher to lease an apartment but funding is not suffi cient to renew it then the family will lose its assistance and likely lose its curre nt housing prior to fy2004 hud funded phas based on the number of vouchers they were using and the cost of those vouchers if costs went up or phas were able to use more of their vouchers they received additional funds to cover those co sts in fy2005 at congresss direction hud funded phas based on the number of vouc hers they were using and the cost of those vouchers in mayjuly 2004 plus infl ation reduced by 4 to fit within the amount appropriated this new formula wa s designed to contain the growing cost of the program many phas and low income housing advocates opposed the new formula arguing that it left many agencies with inadequate funding to maintain their programs while it appears that few agencies were required to terminate assistance to families as result of budget shortages many agencies suspended the reissuance of vouchers when families left the pr ogram and undertook other administrative measures to cut costs the presidents fy2006 budget request included 141 b illion to renew expiring voucher subsidies an increase of 5 fro m fy2005 it proposed distributing renewal funding to phas on prorata basis base d on what they received last year plus an inflation adjustment and prorated to fit within the amount appr opriated in addition to renewal funding the administration requested 45 million for central reserve fund to cover the cost of unforeseen exigenci experienced by p has such as natural disasters or significant changes in the economic condition of locality congress provided hud with central reserve account in fy2003 and fy2004 but not in fy2005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32869crs9 hr 3058 as it passed the house ppropriations committee on june 21 2005 provided more than 300 million less for tenantbased assi stance than the president requested but funded re newals at the presidents re quested level during floor proceedings on june 30 2005 an amendment adding 100 million for tenantbased renewals was approved the increase was ffset by decrease in funding for the working capital fund the bill proposed to distribute renewal funding using the same formula proposed by the president it would have permitted the secretary to set aside 45 million of renewal funding to adjust budgets that were adversely affected by the fy2005 funding formul due to high number of portability vouchers the senate version of hr 3058 would ve funded renewals at the presidents requested level unlike the house bill and the presidents request the senate bill would not have funded agencies based on the funding they received in fy2005 plus inflation rather agencies would have r eceived renewal funding based on their voucher costs and leasing over the past 12 mont hs plus inflation and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated low income housing and pha groups advocated for this use of more recent data the nate bill would have provided the secretary with the authority to us up to 45 milli on to adjust pha budgets if they were adversely affected by the mayjuly formula either because those months were anomalous for the agency or because the agency faced high number of portability vouchers the final version of hr 3058 funds renewa ls at the same level proposed by the senate bill and the pres idents request 100 million ss than the housepassed level it adopted the renewal funding fo rmula proposed by the president and included in the house bill for calendar year 2006 agencies will receive the amount of funds they were eligible to receive in 2005 plus inflation adjusted for tenant protection vouchers hope vi

projectbased section 8 for example families who ar displaced from public housing due to demolition or disposition families in the witness protection program and families in the child welfare system the president requested an increase in funding for tenant protection vouchers of almost 120 for fy2006 the proposed in crease was attributed partly to the needs of the hope vi program and partly to new rule that hud stated would be published in 2005 that would permit the secr etary of hud to require the conversion of public housing to vouchers practice called mandatory conversion the report accompanying the housepassed version of hr 3058 expressed doubt that the mandatory conversion rule would be imp lemented before the end of fy2006 and therefore proposed to fund tenantprotecti on vouchers at roughly the same level as last year an increase of about 3 the senate version ex pressed the same doubt about the mandatory conversion rule and noted that for many of the units that would be subject to the rule hope vi remains viable option the senate recommended 192 million for tenant protecti on vouchers more than the house but less than the presidents request the final version of hr

provided in hrept 109153 and srept 109109 as shown in table 18 fha has negative appropriati ons which means that the income to the program from insurance premiums exceeds the program expenses this suggests that because of the surplus generated by fha hud needed 1724 million less in appropriations in fy 2005 the negative appropriation has implications for two legislative initiativ that have been proposed by the administration one initiative would pe rmit 100 fha financing for firsttime buyers with strong credit records u nder the other initiative hud would amend its underwriting guidelines in or der to permit borrowers with blemished credit records to obtain fhainsured loans the fha insurance premiums for these borrowers would be increased to cover the higher ri sks and costs involved in these initiatives the presidents budget assumed that these initiatives would create 268 million in additional negative appropria tions in fy2006 the budget also assumed that the mmi and gisri programs would gene rate 1956 million in offsetting receipts based on its assumptions of income costs and fees to the insurance funds the administration estimated net fha appropriations of 1489 million for fy2006 the appropriations committee however did not accept the administrations assumptions the committees reestimate shown in table 18 as the fy2006 request assumes zero savings from th proposed initiatives and it assumes 347 million less in offsetting receipts both house and senate versions of hr 3058 assume lower administrative expenses in the mmi account and lower ffsetting receipts in the

have allowed although notably less than in the presidents original budget and less than was available in fy2005 as shown in table 18 the committees assumptions result in an estimated appr opriation of
