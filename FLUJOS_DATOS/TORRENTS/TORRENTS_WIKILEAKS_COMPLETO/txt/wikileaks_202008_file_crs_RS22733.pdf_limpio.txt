summary pl 11081 the honest leadership and open government act of 2007 s 1 includes provisions that affect senate rules concerning restrictions on conference reports in two ways first it amends senate rule xxviii concerning out of scope material in conference reports the modification to rule xxviii does not change existing restrictions on the content of conference re ports but it does significantly alter how the senate may dispose of points of order raised under the rule second the law establishes new senate rule xliv c oncerning congressionally dir ected spending provisions paragraph 8 of that rule creates new restriction on conferen ce reports it precludes them from including any specific items of disc retionary or mandatory spending that were not in either the house or sena version of the legislation nt to conference if point of order is raised against conference report under either the modified rule xxv iii or under the new rule xliv paragraph 8 the ru allow the senate to strike out the offending portion of the conference recomme ndation but agree to the rest of the compromise furthermore the senate also can waive either of these rules with three fifths vote of senators duly chosen and sworn 60 senators if there are vacancies senate rules have long placed restrictions on what can be included in conference report the senate changed its rules c oncerning conference reports on september 14 2007 when the president signed s 1 the hone st leadership and open government act of 2007 pl 11081 two of the changes that went into effect upon enactment of the law affected the authority of conferees to include in their report matter that was not passed by the house or senate before the c onference committee was ppointed co lloquially such provisions are sometimes sa id to have been airdropped into the conference report first the enactment of s 1 affected the consequences of violating the existing senate rule xxviii that precludes conference agreements from including policy provisions that were not sufficiently related to either the house or the senate version of the legislation sent to conference such provisions are c onsidered to be out of scope under long standing senate rules and preced ents second s 1 created point of order in paragraphhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22733crs2 1 senate rule xxviii paragraph 2 see also house rule xxii clause 9 2 floyd m

associated with senate rule xxv iii are more complicated than summarized here for more information see crs general distribution memorandum senate decisions concerning the authority of conferees rule xxviii by elizabeth rybicki available from the author8 of rule xliv that can be raised agai nst new directed spending provisionsor provisions in conference report that provide specific items of appropriations or direct spending that were not committed to the conference committee in either the house or senate versions of the legislation this report first gives brief overview of what has been and what will continue to be considered out of scope material under senate rules and precedents it then discusses in detail the defin ition of new directed spending provision finally the report describes the disposition and waiving of points of orde r raised against conference reports containing out of sc ope material and new directed spending provisions the box at the end of the report outlines the procedural steps for disposing of these points of order when they are raised against conference reports the interpretation of senate rules of course ultimately rests with the senate and the implementation of the new rules will depend on senate practice the discussion here should not be considered substitute for cons ultation with the par liamentarian on specific procedural problem s and opportunities senate rule xxviii ou t of scope material senate and house rules place restrictions on the kinds of agreements conferees can propose to their two houses implicit in the rules of both chambers is the requirement that conferees resolve the differences committed to them by reaching ag reements within what is known as the scope of the differences between the house and senate versions of the bill the conferees may accept the house position the senate position or position that is compromise between them any position that is not within this range of options exceeds the scope of the differences between the two houses it constitute s matter not committed to them by either house1 and makes their conference repor t subject to point of order on both the house and senate floor in practice these restrictions are not as st ringent as they may seem on their face the house often waives its rules that restrict th authority of conferees and the senate has developed precedents that grant its conferees considerable latitude in reaching agreements with the house especially when they are in conference with bill from one house and single amendment from the other house that pr oposes to replace the entire text of the bill2 rulings and practices in the nate have left the chamber with body of precedents that allow the inclusion of new matter as long as it is reasonably related to the matter sent to conference3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22733crs3 4 the rest of senate rule xliv which establishes disclosure requirements for congressionally directed spending items limited tax benefits and limited tariff benefits is not addressed in this report 5 for more information on the applicability of pa ragraph 8 of rule xliv see letter from the majority leader inserted into the congressional record daily edition vol 153 september 24 2007 pp s11993s11994 6 for more information on discretionary and direct spending see crs report rs20371 overview of the authorization appropriations process by bill heniff jrthe amendment to senate rule xxviii did not alter the defin ition of what constitutes new matter as described below the significant change to rule xxv iii was change to the method for dis posing of the point of order senate rule xliv paragraph 8 new directed spending provisions paragraph 8 of the new senate rule xliv established ne w restriction on the content of conference reports4 under the rule senator can rais point of order against provisions of conference report if they constitute n ew directed spending provisions the rule defines new directed spending provisions as any item that consists of specific prov ision containing sp ecific level of funding for any specific account specific program sp ecific project or specific activity when specific funding was provided for such sp ecific account specific program specific project or specific activity in the measure originally committed to the conferees by either house it is worth emphasizing that paragraph 8 of rule xliv applies only to the conference report and not to the joint explanatory statement also known as the statement of managers that accompanies it joint explanatory statements are signed by the conferees but like reports of standing committees are not voted on by the house or senate and cannot be changed through any formal amendment process it is the conference report that contains the formal legislative language that will become law if both chambers agree to the report and the measure is then signed by the president in contrast to rule xxviii which applies to the full text of every conference report paragraph 8 of senate rule xliv applies only to provisions of conference reports that would provide for actual spending in other words it applies only to discretionary and mandatory spending provisions and not to authorizations of appropriations5 discretionary spending is pr ovided in appropriations acts and generally funds routine operations of the federal gove rnment mandatory spending also referred to as direct spending is provided in substantive law and generally funds titlement programs such as social security and medicare6 hypothetical example can illustrate the difference between the rule xxviii scope point of order and the rule xliv paragraph 8 new directed spending point of order the house might pass an appropr iations bill providing funding for several specific projects the senate might pass this bill with an amendment in the nature of substitute and the two houses then could ag ree to conference the conferees might agree to include in the conference report fundi ng for several similar projects that were not listed in the hous bill or in the senate substitute under rule xxviii the provisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22733crs4 7 on august 2 2007 the presiding officer affirme d in response to parliamentary inquiry that points of order concerning new directed spending will be considered pursuant to the new rule xliv rather than the amended rule xxviii congressional record daily edition vol153 august 2 2007 p s10718 8 the form of the motion depends on what the hous and senate sent to conference very often continuedincluding funding for additional projects woul d likely be considered to be reasonably related to the matter sent to conference nd therefore not subject to point of order under rule xliv paragraph 8 however provisions of this kind would likely be interpreted to be new directed spending provisions and therefore subject to point of order7 disposing of the point of order the enactment of s 1 established procedure identical in the amended rule xxviii and the new rule xliv that allows the senate to strike new matter or new directed spending provisions from the conference report but agree to rest of the terms of the co mpromise it is not in order however for either chamber to alter the text of confer ence report and therefore the process converts the text of the conference compromise minus the new matter or new directed spending provisions into an amendment if the senate agrees to this amendment it is then sent to the house for consideration in that chamber the change in the method of disposing of rule xxv iii points of order could significantly affect senate practices under the former rule xxviii when scope point of order was sustained against conferen ce report the report was recommitted to the conference committee assuming the house had not yet acted on the conference report if the house had acted then there was conference committee to which the report could be recommitted and the report would fall leaving before the senate the bill and any amendments that had originally been committed to conference before the enactment of s 1 if point of order was sustaine d against conference report under rule xxv iii the conference report typically would either die or face an uncertain fate back in conference committee this fact likely affected the decisions of conferees to include provisions that could be considered new matter as well as the decisions of senators about whether to raise point of order regarding particular provision and risk the defeat of the conference compromise as whole under the process established by the enac tment of s 1 senator can make point of order against one or more provisions of c onference report if the point of order is not waived see below the presiding officer rules whether or not the provision is in violation of the rule if point of order is raised against more than one provision the presiding officer can make separate deci sions regarding each provision when the presiding officer sustains point of order against conference report on the grounds that it violates either the prohi bition of new matter or new directed spending provisions the matter will be stricken from the conference recommendation after all points of order raised under this procedure are disposed of the senate will proceed to consider motion to send to the house in place of the original conference agreement proposal consisting of the text of the conference agreement minus the new matter or new directed spendi ng provision that was stricken8 amendments to thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22733crs5 8 continued house bill and senate amendment are sent to conference the motion in that case would be for the senate to recede from its amendment and concur in the house bill with further senate amendment consisting of the conference committ ee compromise without the new matter or new directed spending pr ovision if senate b ill and house amendment were sent to conference the motion would be that the senate recede from its disagreement to the house amendment and concur in the house amendment with further amendment 9 paragraph 4b2 of rule xxviii paragraph 8b2 of rule xliv 10 for more information on the byrd rule see crs report rl30862 the budget reconciliation process the senates byrd rule by robert keithmotion are not in order the motion to agree to the bicameral compromise with the new matter or new directed spending provisi on stricken is debatable under the same debate limitation as the conference report9 under the regular rule s of the senate debate on conference reports is not limited it is limited only if the senate agrees to limit debate by unanimous consent if cloture has been successfully invoked on the conference report or if the senate is consider ing the report under an expedited procedures established by law such as the procedures for considering budget resolutions nd budget reconciliation measures under the budget act in short the terms for consideration of the motion to send to the house the proposal without the offe nding provisions are the same as those that would have applied to th conference report itself if the senate agrees to the motion the conference recommendation as altered by the deletion of the new matter or new direct ed spending provision would be returned to the house in the form of an amendment betw een the houses the house would then have an opportunity to act on the amendment the prohibition against amendments to conference report does not apply to amendments between the houses accordingly the house could under its procedures agree to the modified compromise version as it was received from the senate or offer further amendments thereto the house could also request further conference with the senate or choose to take ac tion at all on the new compromise language the procedure for disposing of poi nts of order under either rule xxv iii or paragraph 8 rule xliv is similar to that currently followed for disposing of points of order against conference reports under th byrd rule section 313d of the congressional budget act the byrd rule applies only to reconciliation measures however10 waiving the rule the new rules also create mechanism for waiving the restrictions on the content of conference re ports the points of order under rule xxviii and paragraph 8 of rule xliv can be waived with the support of threefifths of all senators duly chosen and sworn 60 senators if there are vacancies senators can move to waive points of order against one or several provisions or they can make one motion to waive all possible points of order unde r either rule under the new procedures motion to waive all points of order is not amendable but motion to waive points of order against specific provisions is as result it will be possible for senator to ensure vote on waiving all points of order under each rule and if ccessful separate motions to waive points of order against individual provisions would be necessary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22733crs6 time for debate on the motion to waive is limited to one hour nd is divided equally between the majority leader and the minority leader or their designees if the motion to waive garners the necessary support the nate is effectively agreeing to keep the matter that is potentially in violation of the rule in the conference report motions to waive scope rule xxviii points of order would be made and considered separately from motions to waive new directed spending rule xliv paragraph 8 points of order the rules further require thr eefifths vote to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair and limit debate on an app eal to one hour equally divide d between the party leaders or their designees the purpose of these requi rements is to ensure that either method by which the senate could choose to apply these rules through motion to waive or through an appeal of the ruling of the chair requires threefifths vote of the senate usually 60 senators simple majority 51 senators if there are vacancies and all senators are voting cannot achieve the same outcome the effect of overturning ruling of the chair on appeal is quite different from the effect of agreeing to motion to waive rule the decision on an appeal stands as the judgment of the senate and becomes precedent for the senate to follow in future procedure decision to waive the rule in contrast does not change the interpretation of the rule in future practice table 1 procedural steps for disposing of rule xxviii or rule xliv paragraph 8 point of order including motion to waive 1 senator makes point of order pursuant to rule xxviii or rule xliv paragraph 8 2 senator may make motion to waive the point of order motion to waive is debatable for one hour divided and controlled by party leaders or their designees motion is in order even if point of order has not been made 3a if threefifths of senators duly chosen and sworn vote in favor of the motion to waive then consideration of the conference report continues 3b if threefifths of senators duly chosen and sworn fail to vote in favor of the motion to waive then the presiding officer ru on the point of order the decision of the presiding officer can be appealed appeal is debatable for one hour divided and controlled by party leaders or their designees and requires three fifths vote of senators duly chosen and sworn to overturn 4 if point of order is sustained then provi sions against which senator raised the point of order are stricken from the conference agreement 5 after all points of order under either rule are disposed of the senate considers an amendment that consists of the text of the conference agreement minu s the stricken provisions more formally the motion before the senate is typically either 1 to recede from the amendment to the house bill and to conc ur in the bill with further senate amendment or 2 to recede from the disagreement to the house amendment and concur in the house amendment with fu rther senate amendment the exact form of the motion depends on what the house and senate sent to conference the motion is considered under the same debate limitations if any that existed for the conference report 6 if the senate agrees to the amendment it is sent to the house for further consideration
