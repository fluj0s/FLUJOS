objectives treasury officials have testified before congressional committees about federal debt management the government accountability office has written reports concerning federal debt management as requested by congressional committees federal debt management narrowly defined concerns treasurys decisions about sales of treasury bills notes and bonds which affect the term structure of the privately held interest bearing federal debt the term structure of interest rates relates the average yield to maturity of particular type of debt instrument such as us treasury securities to its time such as years to maturity financial economists have different theories concerning the causes of the term structure of interest rates and the changes in the term structure over the business cycle the four primary theories are the expectations theory the risk averse theory the segmented market theory and the preferred habitat theory the treasury must float debt maturities securities which are salable if the federal government is to continue to operate subject to this manda tory objective the treasury has discretion in pursuing three secondary objectives economic stabilization minimization of interest costs and neutrality make debt sales as predictable as possible the pursuit of one of these secondary objectives may adversely affect another objective furthermore these different objectives depend on different theories of the term structure of interest rates beginning in fy1975 the treasury decided to pursue policy of neutral debt management while attempting to increase the average length to maturity of the marketable treasury debt according to this policy of neutral debt management the treasury spread its borrowing needs widely across the maturity spectrum and sold debt issues on regular and predictable schedule the clinton administration shortened the debt maturity in order to reduce interest costs this policy was controversial and was reversed as budget surpluses occurred the bush administration also shortened the debt maturity in order to reduce interest costs which has also been controversial this report will not be updated

broad sense federal debt management encompasses policies that affect the maturity composition of the privately held interestbearing federal debt and determine the characteristics of federal debt instruments 2 the us treasury decides the maturities of new marketable debt this marketable debt consists of bills which mature in one year or less notes which mature in 2 to 10 years and bonds which mature in more than 10 years3 the treasury also sells savings bonds but these are not marketable furthermore the treasury conducts advance refundings that is it offers holders of particular outstanding debt issue the option of exchanging that debt issue for new debt issue with longer maturity the federal reserve system fed also can affect the maturity composition of federal debt through open market operations the fed purchases treasury securities in order to expand the money supply and conversely sells treasury securities in order to contract the money supply obviously the maturities of the securities that the fed decides to buy or sell affects the maturity composition of the federal debt held by the rest of the public4 through open market operations the fed has the capacity to partially offset treasury debt management decisions but the fed 1 as examples in september 1999 gao published debt management in period of budget surplus in response to request from the chairman of the senate budget committee and the chairman of the house ways and means committee and in february 2001 gao published debt management actions and future challenges at the request of the chairman of the house ways and means committee the chairman of the social security subcommittee of the house ways and means committee and the chairman of the senate budget committee 2 privately held interestbearing federal debt accounts for part of federal debt much of the federal debt is held in federal trust fundsin other words the federal government has issued ious to itself for an overview of the federal debt see crs report rl31590 the federal government debt its size and economic significance by brian w cashell 3 treasury bills are sold on discount basis that is an investor earns the difference between the purchase price and the redemption value treasury notes and bonds pay semiannual coupons interest the initial sales price of treasury note or bond may be above or below the redemption value he nce in addition to interest payments an investor may have an acquisition discount or premium 4 the treasury excludes fed holdings of treasury securities in its calculation of the average length to maturity of the privately held marketable treasury debt hence the fed purchase or sale of particular maturity such as bills on financial markets would change the composition of the non fed privately held marketable treasury debt and thus change the average length to maturity t

management policies thus the treasury usually plays the dominant role in dete rmining the maturity structure of federal debt held by the investing public finally the broad concept of debt management includes treasurys ability to add or change the characteristics of its debt issues examples of these characteristics include the length of maturity call features conversion features variable rate features and indexation for changes in the price level the treasury has issued securities with new maturities discontinued some maturities and included or deleted call features from different security issues 5 the treasury sells savings bonds with fixed rates and priceindexed rates but thes bonds are not marketable that is they cannot be resold on financial markets6 in january 1997 the treasury began issuing marketable securities indexed to changes in the price level unless specified otherwise in this report debt management is narrowly defined as treasury decisions about debt sales that affect the maturity composition of privately held interest bearing federal debt this report focuses on marketable treasury debt unless specified otherwise monetary policy is assumed to be held constant the treasurys changes in the maturity composition of the federal debt are important because of their possible effects on the term structure of interest rates and the interest costs on the national debt change in the term structure of interest rates on marketable treasury securities all else held constant will cause parallel change in the term structure of private marketable debt because treasury securities and private securities of the same maturity are highly substitutable

structure of interest rates relates the average yield of particular type of debt instrument such as us treasury securities to its time such as years to maturity the average yield to maturity of security is calculated based on annual interest payments and the difference between the current market value of the security and its maturity value or face value since it takes into account the gain or loss that will occur at maturity the average yield to maturity differs from the coupon yield and the current yield the coupon yield or nominal yield is the yield stated on the face of the security the coupon yield is not affected by any difference between the cost of security and its maturity value or face value the coupon yield is useful in indicating the dollar amount of interest paid each year the current yield of security is simply the dollar amount of interest divided by the current market price of the security 7 the distinction between the concepts of coupon yield current yield and average yield to maturity can be illustrated by simple example assume an individual purchases for 950 bond with 10year maturity and redemption value or face value of 1000 the bond pays interest of 60 year the coupon yield or nominal yield per year would equal 601000 or 6 the current yield per year would equal 60950 or 632 8 the average yield to maturity would be 670 5 call feature gives the treasury the option of redeeming particular security issue before its date of maturity 6 current information about savings bonds is available at httpwwwtreasurydirectgov visited september 12 2008 7

from the present date to the date of final maturity which is calculated based on all future interest payments and any capital gain or loss at final maturity in this example the average yield to maturity of 670 was calculated by using 950 for p present value and solving for i in the general formula for calculating the present value of an interestincome security which is explained in the second example in the appendix the term structure is the relationship of average yields to maturity and time to maturity of debt instruments each maturity class of securities such as three years to maturity five years to maturity etc has an average yield to maturity and the term structure shows how they relate to one another for example treasury note with three years to maturity could have an average yield to maturity of 40 treasury note with five years to maturity could have an average yield to maturity of 50 and treasury note with 10 years to maturity could have an average yield to maturity of 60 the term structure of interest rates is often depicted on chart by measuring the average yield to maturity on the vertical or axis and time of maturity on the horizontal or x axis this graph of the term structure is sometimes referred to as the yield curve the term structure is drawn for debt instruments outstanding at given point in time9

financial economists have different theories concerning the causes of the term structure of interest rates and the changes in the term structure over the business cycle10 the four primary theories are the expectations theory the risk aversion theory the segmented market theory and the preferred habitat theory currently the prevailing theory among economists is the preferred habitat theory which is combination of the first three theories according to the preferred habitat theory the primary determinant of the term structure of interest rates is expectations about interest rates the validity and policy value of any theory can be evaluated by determining how well theory explains relevant data and predicts outcomes the implications of each theory of the term structure of the interest rate can be compared with three realworld phenomena first the yield curve is usually upward sloping indicating that the yield rises as the length of maturity increase for example during the period 19502003 in 88 of the months the yield curve was upward sloping 11 second usually shortterm intermediateterm and longterm yields rise or decline together12 third over business cycles usually shortterm and longterm interest rates move in procyclical fashionrising during expansions and declining during recessions furthermore shortterm rates fluctuate more than longterm rates over business cycles13 9 on daily basis the treasury calculates rates for the yield curve for treasury securities these data are available at httpwwwtreasurygovofficesdomesticfinancedebtmanagementinterestrate visited september 12 2008 10 these theories assume that monetary policy is constant however if the fed instituted tighter easier monetary policy then the term structure curve would shift up down 11 lloyd b thomas money

financial economists believe that the primary determinant of the term structure of interest rates is interest rate expectations there are two basic expectations theories for the term structure the pure expectations theory and the errorlearning theory g18g158g155g142g561g7g161g153g142g140g157g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g22g145g142g152g155g162g561g343g346g561 model based on the pure expectations theory has the following four assumptions 1 all securities are riskless with respect to the payment of both interest and principal moreover the theory abstracts from tax considerations call features differing coupons and other such imperfections 2 investors hold with complete confidence set of uniform expectations concerning all future shortterm rates of interest and their forecasts are accurate 3 there are transactions costs and consequently switches among securities of different maturities are unimpeded 4 the behavior of all market participants is motivated by objective other than profit maximization thus ensuring full use of every opportunity for profitable arbitrage among different maturities 15 these assumptions imply that all maturities are perfect substitutes for each other each investor seeks to maximize the yield on given security over given holding period the dollar yield on security for any given holding period equals the coupon interest received plus the capital gain or minus the capital loss the average yield to maturity equals the coupon interest received plus the capital gain or minus the capital loss divided by the purchase price of the security because securities of different maturities are perfect substitutes for given holding period an investor may purchase security with maturity equal to the length of the holding period series of shorterterm securities with combined maturity equal to the holding period or security with longer maturity than the holding period which can be sold at the end of the holding period furthermore an investor may purchase any combination of different maturities in equilibrium due to arbitrage any combination of maturities should have the same average yield to maturity for any holding period for exam ple an investor would be indifferent between purchasing series of 90day treasury bills and reinvesting the principal and interest and purchasing 30year treasury bond and reinvesting the interest as simplified case assume the 30year bond is sold at par 16 hence the average yield to maturity on the 30year bond would 14 professor irving fisher developed the relationship between shortterm and

series of 90day treasury bills over the 30year period17 under the pure expectations theory different expectations by investors of shortterm interest rates would result in term structure curves with different shapes in equilibrium for given sequence of expected treasury bill rates there would be unique term structure of interest rates since the longterm yield is an average of current and expe cted shortterm yields the longterm yield can never fluctuate as widely as the shortterm yield18 in figure 1 four hypothetical term structure curves are depicted that correspond to different

because of its underlying assumptions some critics argued that investors are simply not capable of predicting interest rates for periods far into the future19 early empirical studies tested the correspondence between expected shortterm rates and the later actually observed shortterm rates these tests were mostly negative in their results which means that the theory is not supported by the evidence20 but professor david meiselman correctly argued that expectations need not be realized in order for them to determine the rate structur in the manner asserted by the theory21 in other words investors purchase securities based on their expectations of yields to maturity rather than actual yields to maturity

revisions of future interest rate expectations for example if actual shortterm rates turn out to be higher than expected shortterm rates then the market will systematically revise upwards expectations concerning shortterm rates in the future 22 since longterm rates are averages of present and future shortterm rates the entire term structure would rise23 professor meiselman maintained that his empirical tests supported his errorlearning theory but critics disputed the accuracy of his data and his econometric procedures empirical tests by other economists using more recent data failed to support meiselmans theory24 g5g152g151g156g146g156g157g142g151g140g162g561g160g146g157g145g561g6g138g157g138g561 the pure expectations theory indicates that the average yield spread over period of years should be zero which is inconsistent with the data showing average yields rising as the term to maturity increases 25 the pure expectations theory assumes that various maturities are close substitutes for one another consequently this theory correctly predicts that the yield of various maturities will typically move in the same direction furthermore according to the pure expectations theory shortterm rates should always fluctuate more than longterm rates but treasury bond rates sometimes have changed more than treasury bill rates finally the pure expectations theory correctly predicts that interest rates on different maturities move in procyclical fashion over the business cycle 26 19 malkiel p 23 20 ibid p 2829 21 malkiel p 35 22 ibid p 30 23 ibid p 31 24 ibid p 3435 25

are riskless these critics maintain that securities contain risk and that most investors are risk averse the prevailing view of financial economists is that with time risk increases but at decreasing rate28 hence investors must receive risk premium for purchasing securities with longer maturities but the amount of this risk premium increases more slowly than does the length of the time to maturity thus under the risk averse theory the yield consists of the interest rate under the pure expectation theory plus risk premium g22g162g153g142g156g561g152g143g561g20g146g156g148g561 there are four major types of risk but these types of risk tend to be interrelated all of these types of risk tend to increase with the length of the forecasting period these types of risk are default risk interest rate risk inflation risk and political risk g6g142g143g138g158g149g157g561g20g146g156g148g561 default risk is the probability that all promised payments of interest and repayments of principal will not be fully paid or paid at all us treasury securities are often said to be free of default risk but this may not be the perception of every investor so this risk could play some role29

decline for given unexpected rise in the interest rate the decline in the market value of the security increases as the length of time to maturity rises conversely an unexpected decline in interest rates causes rise in the market value of fixed income securities and this rise increases with the length of time to maturity thus buyer of fixed income securities assumes the risk that his interest rate forecast may be too low and the magnitude of this risk increases as the time to maturity increases 30 g11g151g143g149g138g157g146g152g151g561g20g146g156g148g561 change in the expectation of future inflation nds to drive up interest rates and thus lower the market value of fixed income securities investors seek real rate of return on their principal they deduct the expected change in the costofliving from the nominal rate of return to determine the real rate of return an increase in the expectation of future inflation causes investors to demand higher nominal interest rate

existing ones may adversely affect the market value of securities including treasury securities for example higher marginal tax rates on interest income may encourage investors to shift funds into taxfree municipals or growth stocks which are expected to earn more lightly taxed capital gains although actual default by the us treasury is almost unthinkable there may have been fear that the federal government would monetize more of the debt and thus cause unexpected inflation which would in turn lower the real value of the national debt and interest payments 31 some financial experts argue that approval of current proposals to provide extensive federal credit assistance to financial institutions may result in the monetizing of more federal debt and thus cause unexpected inflation professors alessandro missale and olivier je an blanchard found that during the period 1960 through 1989 three oecd nations had debttogdp ratios which rose more than 100 these three nations were ireland italy and belgium as their debttogdp ratios rose further and further above some threshold debt of 40 to 50 of gdp these countries reduced the average maturity of their publicly held debt the authors provide tentative explanation that as the debt togdp ratio rose investors became more fearful that their governments had greater incentive to inflate away the real value of their national debts investors were increasingly reluctant to purchase government securities of longer maturities hence in order to sell debt these governments had to sell shorter maturities and consequently the average maturity of outstanding debt declined 32 political risk is more pronounced for private debt instruments for example more stringent pollution controls required by the environmental protection agency could adversely affect the value of particular corporations bonds if the corporations output causes significant pollution then more stringent pollution controls would raise the production costs of the corporation lower profits and thus increase the probability that the corporation would default on its bonds g5g152g151g156g146g156g157g142g151g140g162g561g160g146g157g145g561g6g138g157g138g561 most financial economists believe that most investors are risk averse usually the term structure of interest rates is upwards sloping which is cons istent with the risk averse theory but if risk aversion were the sole explanatory factor for th term structure and risk is always monotonically related to time then the term structure curve would always be upwards sloping which it is not hence most financial economists believe that risk aversion explains only part of the shape of the term structure curve the risk averse theory is consistent with yields of various maturities 31 for current

expectations theory argue that it is incorrect because of its assumptions that all debt instruments are perfect substitutes and that there are transactions costs these critics maintain that the loan market is segmented in to compartments accord ing to maturities the leading proponent of this segmented market theory is professor j m culbertson who in 1957 totally rejected the expectations theory he contended that the supply and demand in markets for specific maturities determine their respectiv interest rates according to culbertson there are variety of impediments to mobility of funds in debt markets legal restrictions on some types of borrowing and on debt holdings of institutional investors desire of investors for portfolio diversification customary investment standards applied to financial institutions lags in establishment or revision of financial institutions specialization of investors on technical grounds impediments to geographical movement of funds in cases requiring judgment or administrative activity etc 35 he stated that lenders as much as borrowers generally insist upon maturity that is related to the purpose of borrowing36 business prefers to borrow longterm in order to construct plant37 life insurance companies invest funds from the sales of annuities in longterm securities in order to minimize risk pension funds also prefer to inve st in longterm securities in order to match debt maturities with projected payouts hence life insurance companies and pension funds have limited needs for liquidity but commercial banks must maintain more liquid position because of possible sudden large withdrawals by depositors government regulations concerning asset holding reflect these differences in liquidity requirements 38 furthermore according to the pure expectations theory shortterm rates should always fluctuate more than longterm rates but treasury bond rates sometimes have changed more than treasury bill rates for example during the period of january 1 1994 through may 15 1994 the 30day treasury bill rate often changed on daily or weekly basis by less than the 30year bond rate39

the segmented market theory have different implications for the feasibility of using debt management as policy instrument if the expectations theory is valid then change in the composition of treasury

theory because debt instruments of all different maturities are perfect substitutes in contrast the segmented market theory assumes that debt instruments of different maturities are not perfect substitutes hence the segmented market theory suggests that changes in treasury debt sales can affect the supply of debt in different markets and consequently the term structure of interest rates40 professor culbertson writes that if used actively in coordinated manner monetary and debt management policies can play an essential role in dealing with both inflationary and deflationary problems by enforcing an appropriate behavior on interest rates through their impact upon conditions in debt markets and through their influence upon the liquidity position of the economy 41 professor culbertson did not present specific testable model but instead he presented concepts based on extensive anecdotal evidence furthermore data limitations made any possible econometric testing difficult consequently there has not been quality econometric testing which has either supported or rejected the segmented market theory42

and is consistent with the prevalence of upward sloping yield curves43 the segmented market theory is inconsistent with data that show yields of various maturities typically move in the same direction because financial markets for different maturities are distinct rise in the interest rate for one maturity should not affect the interest rate on other maturities finally the segmented market theory offers plausible explanation using institutional factors for the cyclical pattern of the term structure of interest rate for example during recession loan demand declines and banks put their excess funds into treasury bills which raises treasury bill prices and lowers their yield 44 g18g155g142g143g142g155g155g142g141g561g10g138g139g146g157g138g157g561g22g145g142g152g155g162g561 professors franco modigliani and richard sutch ms argued that the expectations theory the risk averse theory and the segmented market theory have merits and shortcomings consequently ms advocated the blending of these three theories into preferred habitat theory 45 they described their preferred habitat theory as basically an adaptation of the ex pectational theory of the structure of interest rates under certainty to world in which 1 future rates are in fact uncertain 2 transactors both final wealth holders and final borrowers have definite preferences as to the length of time they want to keep their funds invested or for which they require financing that is they have preferred maturity habitat and 3 types of transactors generally exhibit risk aversion and 40 culbertson pp 487488 41 ibid p 517 42

their portfolios to their habitat so as to be sure of the return or cost in addition to final transactors the model also recognizes the existence of arbitragers or intermediaries prepared simultaneously to borrow and lend in different maturities when the differences in expected returns provide sufficient inducement to compensate for the risk involved in the operation 46 according to ms investors have some preferred portfolio of maturities but they can be induced to alter their portfolios if their returns from changing are sufficiently high modigliani and sutch conducted extensive empirical analyses using their model they examined the relationship between the yield on aaa rated co rporate bonds and the rate on commercial paper they concluded that the expectation model can account remarkably well for the relation between short and long term rates in the united states furthermore the prevailing expectations of longterm rates involve blending of extrapolation of very recent changes and regression toward longterm normal level there is evidence that the maturity structure of the federal debt or changes in this structure exert significant lasting or transient influence on the relation between the two rates 47 modigliani and sutchs model and empirical results were harshly criticized by some economists professor neil wallace argued that the ms analysis has serious data problems and econometric shortcomings48 professor reuben kessel believes that ms should have employed more sophisticated econometric techniques he also argues that the ms model is more of market segmentation model than an expectations model49 g5g152g151g156g146g156g157g142g151g140g162g561g160g146g157g145g561g6g138g157g138g561 the preferred habitat theory is consistent with data

among financial economists which makes the formulation of debt management policy controversial g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g17g139g147g142g140g157g146g159g142g156g561 prior to the administration of president bill clinton the consensus of financial economists was that federal debt management had one necessary objective and three alternative secondary objectives g4g152g155g155g152g160g561g8g158g151g141g156g561g507g16g142g140g142g156g156g138g155g162g561g17g139g147g142g140g157g146g159g142g508g561 the treasury must float debt maturities which are salable if the federal government is to continue to operate currently the us treasury is experiencing difficulty in selling any maturity but change in debt marketing practices conceivably might create problems for the salability of debt at least in the short run furthermore large increase in the volume of debt to finance might complicate the issuance of new debt subject to this necessary objective the treasury has discretion in pursuing three secondary objectives g3g149g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g159g142g561g21g142g140g152g151g141g138g155g162g561g17g139g147g142g140g157g146g159g142g156g561 the pursuit of one of these secondary objectives may adversely affect another secondary objective furthermore these different objectives depend on different theories of the term structure of interest rates g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g21g157g138g139g146g149g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561 supporters of the economic stabilization objective maintain that the term structure of interest rates is explained primarily by the segmented market theory they argue that debt management should be used to lessen macroeconomic fluctuations for instance during recession the treasury should lower the average maturity of the national debt by issuing fewer longterm securities and more shortterm securities this reduced supply of longterm securities would raise their price and consequently the longterm rate of interest would fall on the other hand the increased supply of shortterm securities would lower their price and increase the shortterm rate of interest since the longterm rate of interest has more pronounced effect on investment than does the short term rate of interest total investment would increase which would cause multiple expansion of gross domestic product conversely according to this view during boom the treasury should raise the average maturity of the debt by issuing more longterm securities and fewer shortterm securities this policy would raise the longterm rate of interest lower investment and reduce the rate of inflation some critics of countercyclical debt management argue that it would reduce the stability of financial markets by causing uncertainty and direct competition with the private sector for long term funds during boom periods furthermore opponents charge that the countercyclical policy would raise interest costs on the national debt because the treasury would sell more longterm securities when interest rates are high and fewer longterm securities when interest rates are low

treasury debt management cannot alter the term structure of interest rates and consequently cannot be used as countercyclical tool

debt which would require that the treasury have some ability to forecast interest rates under this policy the treasury should issue more longterm securities and fewer shortterm securities when interest rates are perceived to be low often during recessions in order to lock in low interest costs conversely when interest rates are perceived to be high often during booms the treasury should sell more shortterm securities and fewer longterm securities and thus reduce the level of future obligations to pay high interest rates on securities critics argue that it is difficult for the treasury to forecast interest rates furthermore to the degree that the financial markets are segmented this policy of minimizing interest costs usually would be procyclical since interest rates are typi cally low during recessions but high during booms g16g142g158g157g155g138g149g146g157g162g561 proponents of neutrality policy for debt management argue that the treasury should borrow funds across the entire maturity structure with re gularly scheduled sales they assert that the treasury should attempt to make debt sales as predictable as possible in order to minimize uncertainty in financial markets and consequently reduce interest costs hence the treasury should not alter the composition of debt sales because of changes in the business cycle or changes in interest rate forecasts brief presentation of the history of debt management from 1945 through 1992 will provide better understanding of the pursuit of debt management objectives and background to examine debt management policies implemented by the clinton administration and the bush administration previous sections of this report have largely discussed treasury debt management without considering policies of the federal reserve system but this brief historical overview of debt management demonstrates their interrelationship

interest rates which it had begun in march 194251 this policy initially imposed ceilings on different interest rates ranging from 38 of one percent on 90day treasury bills to 2 ½ on 25 year treasury bonds52 the federal reserve purchased without limitation all treasury securities at those prices which ensured that their average yields to maturity did not rise above the pegs under this pegging policy the fed abandoned control over the money supply the structure of the interest pegs was also the term structure of privately held marketable treasury debt as long as 51 dudley g luckett money

to peg rates they preferred to hold longer term securities because of their higher interest yields53 hence from 1945 through march 1951 the average length to maturity of the privately held marketable treasury debt was high as shown in figure 2 these computations of the average length to maturity exclude treasury securities in government accounts and in federal reserve banks54 figur 2 v erag length

was discussed publicly the fed wanted to discontinue pegging interest rates in order to be free to conduct an antiinflationary monetary policy the treasury wanted pegging of rates to continue in order to lessen interest costs on the national debt and to maintain stable financial markets55 on march 4 1951 the treasury and the fed jointly announced the accord an agreement ending the pegging of interest rates the fed gradually pursued an active monetary policy while assisting in maintaining orderly markets for treasury issues 56 as shown in figure 2 after the accord the average maturity of privately held marketable treasury debt declined after the accord the fed was concerned about the stability and strength of the government securities market consequently subcommittee of the federal open market committee was assigned the duty of studying this market th is subcommittee found that the government securities market lacked depth breadth and resiliency57 hence this subcommittee recommended that the fed conduct openmarket operations by buying and selling only treasury bills in 1953 the fed adopted this bills only policy which it continued through 196158 as shown in figure 2 the average maturity of the privately held marketable treasury debt fluctuated during this period of bills only in the late 1950s the fed became concerned about the large persistent balanceofpayments deficits because of the recession in 1960 the fed also was concerned about the slow rate of growth of the us economy in 1961 the fed decided that the appropriate policy was to raise shortterm interest rates and simultaneously reduce longterm rates the fed believed that rise in the shortterm interest rate would attract shortterm capital to the united states and thus reduce the us balanceofpayments deficit the fed also believed that reduction in longterm interest rates would raise investment and consequently increase economic growth from 1961 through 1965 the federal reserve with the assistance of the treasury implemented this policy which was called operation twist the fed simultaneously bought longterm treasury securities and sold treasury bills the treasury altered the composition of its debt sales by raising the proportion of debt sold which consisted of bills 59 hence the average length to maturity of the privately held marketable treasury debt rose from 1961 through 1965 as shown in figure 2 modigliani and sutch found that during operation twist that the spread between rates on long term government bonds and the bills rate declined from 150 base points down to 35 base points60 but they maintained that the spread typically tends to close in period of recovery and rising shortterm rates61 they concluded that operation twist only slightly reduced the spread between longterm and shortterm rates62 but other economists have argued that it is difficult to assess the effects of operation twist because of its limited scale63 55 chandler and goldfeld pp 560561 56 ibid p 564 57

its net purchases of longer maturities moreover the treasury offset these operations to some extent by issuing longerterm securities 64 nevertheless the prevailing view of financial economists was that operation twist was disappointment hence support for using debt ma nagement as countercyclical tool diminished beginning in 1965 high longterm interest rates prevented the treasury from issuing bonds because congress had forbidden the treasury from is suing bonds with rate of return more than 42565 consequently the average yield to maturity of the privately held marketable treasury debt began declining sharply as shown in figure 2 the treasury was concerned about this rapid decrease in average maturity in 1967 the treasury requested and received congressional permission to raise the maximum maturity on notes from five years to seven years66 there was congressional ceiling on the rate of return on treasury notes in march 1971 congress enacted limited exception to the 425 ceiling on treasury bonds67 in 1973 the treasury obtained congressional permission for an increase in the maximum maturity on notes from seven years to ten years68 despite these changes the average length to maturity of treasury debt continued to decline as shown in figure 2 from 1966 through 1974 the treasury issued debt on sort of ad hoc basis69 the treasury did not announce in advance its plans for sales thus potential buyers were faced with uncertainty about which treasury securities would be issued beginning in fy1975 the treasury was faced with the difficulty of financing persistently high budgetary deficits the treasury was concerned about the stability of financial markets the treasury decided to pursue policy of neutral debt management while attempting to lengthen the average length to maturity of the privately held marketable treasury debt according to this policy of neutral debt management the treasury spread the treasurys borrowing needs widely across the maturity spectrum the treasury had regular and predictable schedule of debt issues 70 the treasury did not vary the composition of its debt issues based on interest rate forecasts this policy minimized investor uncertainty in 1975 the treasury started program of regularization of debt issuance with the scheduled cycle of sales of 2year 4year and 5year notes71 the congress expanded the quantity of treasury bonds that could be sold without being subject to the 425 interest rate ceiling on november 10 1988 the interest rate ceiling of treasury bonds was repealed 72 from december 1975 until february 1992 the average

administration the treasury pursued three main debt management goals sound cash managementensuring that treasury cash balances are sufficient at all times lowest cost financing for the taxpayers and the promotion of efficient capital markets73 to achieve these goals the treasury was guided by five interrelated principles 1 maintaining the riskfree status of treasury securities 2 maintaining consistency and predictability in issuing debt 3 ensuring market liquidity 4 financing across the yield curve and 5 employing unitary financing ie aggregating all of the us governments financing needs and borrowing as one nation74 in its 1993 budget the clinton administration announced change in federal debt management75 the treasury would issue less longterm debt and more shortterm debt the clinton administration maintained that shortening the debt maturity would reduce interest costs because shortterm securities usually have lower interest rate than longterm securities76 in early 1993 the treasury reduced the quarterly auction of 30year bonds from 10 billion to 925 billion77 on may 5 1993 the treasury announced reduction in the sale of 30year bonds from quarterly sales of 925 billion or 37 billion annually to semiannual sales of 11 billion or 22 billion annually78 the treasury also announced the discontinuation of the issuance of 7year notes which had been amounting to about 40 billion per year79 the treasury replaced these 7year notes with additional sales of bills and 2year and 3year notes80 it is not clear whether the administration considered possible effects on the term structure of interest rates ms deborah danker the assistant secretary of domestic finance stated that the treasury was not attempting to manipulate the yield curve or drive down longterm rates 81 mr frank newman undersecretary said that by borrowing less at longer maturities the treasury was not trying to reduce longterm market rates82 but if that happened he reportedly said it would not break my heart83 there is some anecdotal evidence that at least in the shortrun the 73 testimony of gary gensler assistant secretary of financial markets us department of the treasury house

treasury bonds to decline84 in the 1993 budget the office of management and budget forecasted savings of 16 billion over fiscal years 1994 through 1998 because of this new policy of issuing shorter debt85 actual savings were below estimates but specific amount has not been estimated these changes in the composition of treasury debt issues were criticized by many financial analysts they argued that omb forecasted interest rate levels that could be too low and consequently savings in interest costs could be overstated after the treasury announced the changes in the composition of its debt sales two major american corporations walt disney and cocacola sold bond issues with maturities of 100 years 86 furthermore at least half dozen corporations issued 50year bonds and many other corporations increased the average length of their longterm debt87 unlike omb and cbo these corporations apparently judged that long term rates were low and decided to lockin existin g longterm rates these corporations likely had different forecast of interest rates than omb and cbo in may 1996 the treasury began selling debt with longer average maturity88 this change in the composition of debt issuance has contributed to the stabilization of the average length of the marketable interestbearing debt on january 29 1997 the us treasury began issuing inflationprotection priceindexed securities which were 10year notes89 the treasury issued 5year inflationprotection notes in 1997 and 30year inflationprotection bonds in 1998 by the end of 1998 the treasury established regular schedule of offerings of 5year 10year and 30year inflationprotection securities the decline in the size of the deficit for fiscal years 1995 1996 and 1997 caused reduction in the rate of growth of the national debt and conseq uently decrease in the rate of growth of the volume of debt issuance this decrease combined with the may 1996 decision to sell debt with longer average maturity and the issuance of inflationprotection securities stabilized the average length of marketable interestbearing public debt the debt management changes of the clinton administration implemented in february 1993 would have eventually shortened the average length of maturity of the treasury from five years and eleven months in february 1993 to approximately four and onehalf years 90 the budget savings forecast by omb from february 1993 through may 1 1996 were substantially overstated because interest rates over most of this period exceeded those forecast by 84 lauricella and thomas t vogel jr many treasury prices

not relevant because of policy changes in debt management since shortterm rates are usually lower than longterm rates lower average length of maturity that occurred between february 1993 and january 1995 may have reduced interest costs in the long run92 but as the average length of maturity of the debt declines the treasury must refinance the debt more frequently and consequently yearly interest costs will be more volatile and uncertain beginning with fy1998 the federal government bega n running budget surpluses that is the flow of revenue into the us treasury exceeded th outflow of expenditures the treasury lowered the amount of outstanding publicly held debt by reducing new debt issuance as existing federal debt issues matured in addition on march 9 2000 the treasury conducted its first buyback operation of outstanding treasury securities before maturity 93 for fiscal years 19982001 budget surpluses caused decline in the level of publiclyheld debt because fewer shortterm securities were issued the average length rose from five year and five months at the end of fy1997 to six years and one month at the end of fy200194

security should be determined through basic supply and demand factors related to the market98 the treasury asserts that it is regular and predictable market participant and not market timer99 at the start of the bush administration in january 2001 the average length of market interest bearing public debt held by private investors was five years and nine months100 during the two terms of the bush administration this average length of debt declined and was four years and six months at the end of may 2008 101 since shortterm interest rates were below longterm rates the shorting of the debt by the bush administration resulted in an immediate savings in interest costs but as the shorter is the average length of maturity of the debt the more frequently the debt must be refinanced and consequently yearly interest costs will be more volatile and uncertain during much of the bush administration interest rates were relatively low in comparison to interest rates over the past 35 years hence the treasury may have failed to lock in low interest rates by limiting the sale on longer term securities 102 the complexities of federal debt management are indicated in the following statement by james clouse then acting deputy assistant secretary for federal finance in 2006 the pragmatic approach to debt management focuses largely on minimizing the cost of debt financing over time while also giving some weight to other factors such as variability in interest payment the diversification of the investor base operational risk and flexibility to some extent the pragmatic approach is amenable to standard analysis of decisionmaking under uncertainty for example given the presence of term premium in longerterm treasury yields strict cost minimization criterion would probably favorat the marginshorterterm financing on the other hand yields on longerterm securities are less variable over time than shortterm yields and longerterm securities can be employed to lessen rollover risks an optimal debt portfolio might then involve some appropriate balancing of these considerations while useful exercise there is fundamental difference between this standard sort of analysis and treasury debt management in practice the textbook exercise assumes that treasury is pricetaker in financial markets but in reality the strategies and tactics employed by treasury debt managers can affect the market prices of treasury securities it is this interplay of market expectations and debt management policy that makes treasury debt management more subtle and nuanced than simple optimal cash management exercise 103 98 ibid p 7 99 ibid p 8 100 us department of the treasury treasury bulletin june 2001 p 27 101 us department of the treasury treasury bulletin september 2008 p 25 102 see

rate risk and to demonstrate that interest rate risk increases as the time to matu rity increases the present capital value of an income producing asset is calculated by process called capitalization which involves discounting the expected flow of money receipts dollar received in the future is worth less than dollar today because the dollar today can be immediately invested and earn interest compounded over time an investor generally would not buy security unless the yield on the purchase price is as high as that available on other comparable securities these concepts are demonstrated by the following examples of three different maturities 1year 10year and perpetuity first assume potential investor is offered 1year security which promises to pay 1060 in one year the general formula for simple discount is shown by the following equation p a1i where p is the present value is the dollar amount receivable at the end of the interest period and i is the rate of interest for that period stated in hundredths in this example if the prevailing market yield is 6 percent per year that is i 006 then the investor would be willing to pay 1000 as shown in the following calculation p 10601006 1060106 1000 if the prevailing market yield had been 8 percent then the investor would have paid only 98148 which was calculated as follows p a1i 10601008 98148 if an investor purchases the 1year security when the going market yield is 6 percent and the going market yield rises immediately to 8 percent then the market value of the 1year security would decline from 1000 to 98148 this decline of 1852 is 1852 percent of the initial purchase price of 1000 if the prevailing market yield had been 4 percent then the investor would have paid 101923 which was calculated as follows p a1i 10601004 101923 if an investor purchases the 1year security when the going market yield is 6 percent and then the going market yield immediately declines to 4 percent then the market value of the 1year security would rise from 1000 to 101923 this rise is 1923 or 1923 percent of the initial purchase price second assume potential investor is offered 10year security that promises to pay 60 at the end of each year for ten years plus 1000 at the end of the tenth year in addition assume that the market rate of interest is 6 percent 104 this appendix is based closely on the following source

interestincome security is the following p 11i 21i2 31i3 n1in f1in where p is the present value of the security the as are the dollar amounts of interest received at the ends of each interest period f is the amount of principal repayment i is the rate of interest at which the amounts are discounted and n is the number of interest periods hence the present value of this 10year security would equal 1000 which was calculated as follows p 601006 6010062 6010063 60100610 1000100610 1000 if an investor purchases the 10year security when the interest rate is 6 percent and then the interest rate immediately rises to 8 percent then the market value of the security would fall from 1000 to 86580 which was calculated by using 008 for i in the formula this decline of 13420 is 1342 percent of the initial purchase price of 1000 if an investor purchases the 10year security when the interest rate is 6 percent and then the interest rate immediately declines to 4 percent then the market value of the security would rise from 1000 to 116222 which was calculated by using 004 for i in the formula this increase of 16222 is 16222 percent of the initial purchase price third assume that potential investor is offered security that pays 60 per year in perpetuity the formula for calculating the present va lue of perpetuity is the following p ai where p is the present value of the security is the dollar amount of interest received at the ends of each interest period and i is the rate of discount thus in this example the present value of the security would be 1000 which was calculated as follows p ai 60006 1000 if an investor purchases this perpetuity when the interest rate is 6 percent and then the interest rate rises to 8 percent then the market value of the security would fall from 1000 to 750 60008 this decline of 250 is 25 percent of the initial purchase price of 1000 conversely if an investor purchases this perpetuity when the interest rate is 6 percent and then the interest rate declines to 4 percent then th market value of the security would rise from 1000 to 1500 60004 this rise of 500 in the value of the security would equal 50 percent of the initial purchase price table a1 summarizes these three examples these examples demonstrate that for given change in the interest rate the present value of an outstanding security would vary more as the term to maturity increases all other things being equal
