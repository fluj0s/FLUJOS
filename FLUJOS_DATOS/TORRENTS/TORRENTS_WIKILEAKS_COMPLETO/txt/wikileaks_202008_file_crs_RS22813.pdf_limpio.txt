meanwhile denied that it was greatly expanding the use of cds carriers and argued that contract mail delivery was not new according to the usps contractors collect and deliver mail mostly in rural areas the usps noted that contractors are less expensive to employ than career delivery carriers and that using them makes business sense11 the usps also declared that it is not replacing career carriers with contractors rather the usps reported that it considers assigning only new delivery routes to contractors12 on march 28 2007 representative albi sires introduced hres 282 which expressed the sense of the house of represen tatives that the united states postal service should discontinue the practice of contractin g out mail delivery services hres 282 was referred to the house committee on oversight and government reform hcogr nearly two months later the first of two bills that would limit the uspss authority to contract for mail delivery ppeared s 1457 introduced by senator tom harkin on may 23 2007 would forbid the usps from entering into any contract with any motor carrier or other person for the delivery of mail on any route with 1 or more families per mile the bill would permit all existing cds contracts to remain in effect and to be renewed s 1457 was referred to the senate committee on home land security and governmental affairs second bill h r 4236 was introduced by representative stephen f lynch on november 15 2007 the bill would curtail the uspss contracting authority by requiring it to bargain with pos tal unions before entering into any contract providing for mail processing mail handling or surface transportation of mail if such contract would for any 12mont h period involve the equivalent of 50 or more workyears of work that would otherwise be performed by career postal employees13 hr 4236 was referred to the hcogrs subcommittee on federal workforce postal service and the district of columbia which held hearing to examine the issue on july 19 200714 the controversy over the uspss contracting of mail delivery raises two basic questions 1 by what authority may the usps contract for mail delivery and 2 to what extent is the usps using cds

39 usc 1001b and 39 usc 1201 et seq using contractors the unions argue circumvents the collective bargaining process and opens the door for the usps to replace all career delivery carriers with contractors the usps has responded that its contracts with the postal unions recognize uspss authority to use contractors17 the extent of the uspss use of cds carriers to deliver mail between 1998 and 2007 the number of carrier routes18 served by cds carriers rose from 5424 to 6531 or 204 table 1 however throughout this period the usps career city and rural carriers delivered mail on the vast
