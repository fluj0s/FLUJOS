and opposition party leaders to discuss opposition demands for constitutional reforms prior to presidential and parliamentary elections expected to take place before the end of the year the governments refusal earlier to consider these demands resulted in the deaths of over dozen people in the past several months background kenya nation of 28 million people became independent in december 1963 after prolonged uprising against britain since independence the east african country has enjoyed relative stability in region long marred by civil wars famine coups and countercoups kenya became oneparty state in 1969 and returned to multiparty rule in the early 1990s largely due to domestic and international pressures political conditions in early 1990 opposition religious and civic society leaders launched campaign against the one party rule of president daniel arap moi kenya had been facto one party state since 1969 in 1983 president moi ostensibly legalized that reality by amending the constitution however by 1990 domestic and international pressures against authoritarian governments were mounting across africa in response to these forces president moi initially arrested leading opposition figures and cracked down on the movement in mid1990 branding proponents of multiparty system as tribalists and troublemakers in july 1990 the peaceful multiparty campaign turned into violent httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97739crs2 confrontation between security forces and prodemocracy advocates when police killed 23 and arrested over 1000 protestors in december 1991 president moi reluctantly agreed to move to multiparty politics the move came after two years of an antigovernment campaign by opposition groups and persistent pressure by donor countries including the united states opposition groups were apparently caught unprepared by the swift move to multiparty system major concern was snap election without opposition groups being ready for the multiparty challenge with president moi holding out on the date for elections opposition leaders began squabbling among themselves in august 1991 former vice president oginga odinga announced the formation of forum for the restoration of democracy ford four months prior to the presidential declaration of switch to multiparty system security forces arrested some ford leaders but released them days later by mid1992 ford began to fragment along ethnic lines in the face of infighting between the two leading opposition leaders kenneth matiba and odinga by september 1992 ford which was founded by disgruntled former politicians and new generation democrats officially splintered into two factions ford kenya odinga and fordasili matiba intense rivalry within the opposition camp led to rivalry among the major ethnic groups diminishing the prospects for opposition victory fordkenya led by odinga was considered luo dominated party although it had multiethnic representation at the top level of leadership fordasili became known as kikuyu party while the democratic party led by former vice president mwai kibaki kikuyu emerged as new political force the 1992 elections with opposition groups fighting each other the ruling party moved to consolidate its powerbase and entered the election campaign strong in late december 1992 kenyans voted in record numbers in the country s first multiparty election in almost 26 years president moi in power since 1978 defeated opposition candidates by small margin his party the kenya african national union kanu also won majority in the 200seat parliament despite scores of defeats of senior kanu officials by little known opposition candidates the three major opposition parties fordkenya fordasili and the democratic party dp each received substantial votes but fell short of expectations observers attributed the oppositions defeat in the presidential elections to internal bickering in the parties and failure to field single opposition candidate to challenge the incumbent president the three opposition parties that competed in the elections won total of 88 parliamentary seats while the ruling party won 100 seats according to the kenyan constitution the president has the authority to appoint 12 members of parliament further increased kanus majority in parliament but kanus victory in the parliamentary elections was not easy over dozen prominent kanu politicians including several cabinet members were defeated by opposition candidates some prominent opposition members were also defeated including gitobu imanyara of fordkenya and john keen of the democratic party some opposition leaders rejected the elections result accusing the moi government of election rigging international election observers while agreeinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97739crs3 1

election results reflected the wishes of the people of kenya developments since the 1992 elections since the 1992 multiparty elections kenyas political landscape has been unstable progress has been made on number of fronts despite occasional harassment of opposition politicians and proopposition journalists by hardline kanu members opposition parties have been actively engaged in the political process inside parliament and outside but remain divided along ethnic lines numerous efforts to bring about reconciliation among opposition groups have not been successful in april 1995 new opposition party safina was launched with the objective of bringing other opposition groups under one umbrella organization safina has attracted prominent kenyan politicians including some white kenyans who had been strong supporters of the ruling party for many years safinas registration application for official recognition is still pending and its leaders have been subjected to occasional harassment and intimidation by government officials1 meanwhile the extensive attention given to safina by the west whose supportbase outside the capital has yet to be tested could cost the new opposition party valuable support among average kenyans some kenyans are convinced that the sudden rise of safina is because of the membership of whites in the party and outside support meanwhile divisions within the opposition camp continue to intensify2 in addition to the formation of several other small political parties number of factions have emerged within the major opposition groups in recent years fordkenya currently led by michael wamalwa has lost number of prominent political figures including paul muite last year raila odinga the of the founding father of ford left fordkenya and joined the small national development party of kenya ndpk fordasili is also split into two factions one led by matiba and another led by the secretary general of the party martin shikuku the democratic party has also suffered from factional fighting the secretary general of the party john keen and the deputy chairman of the party agnes ndetei defected to the ruling party and the latter is now serving as assistant education minister in the moi government the internal bickering within political parties is not limited to opposition parties the ruling party kanu has also been in turmoil in recent months at the center of this controversy is the issue of succession the upcoming presidential election expected before the end of the year is president mois last according to the constitution and kanu leaders are trying to position themselves for postmoi era in january 1997 kanus internal feud came to an end for the time being when president moi reshuffled his cabinet and brought back his

cabinet posts in the recent reshuffle sources of crisis kenyas ongoing political crisis has many roots erosion of checks and balances and mois autocratic style of leadership b mistrust and ethnic politics c human rights violations and d intolerance and insecurity erosion of checks and balances concentration of executive powers at the expense of the legislative branch and the judiciary is seen as one of the major causes of the current crisis in august 1978 after president jomo kenyatta died vice president daniel arap moi assumed the presidency against background of intense political infighting and uncertainty within kanu but in relatively smooth transition president moi member of the minority kalenjin clan did not seem to pose serious threat to the political establishment rather he was seen as caretaker president but what evolved over the years since he became president was stunning surprise not only did president moi remain in power but he created much stronger presidency than kenyatta series of constitutional amendments were implemented beginning 1982 that strengthened president mois office and weakened both the judiciary and the kenyan parliame nt in 1982 the moi government led the parliament to amend the constitution to make kenya jure oneparty state series of electoral laws and presidential decrees ensured presidential supremacy and reduced the once relatively active parliament to an advisory body colonial laws stifled political freedom and gave security forces enormous power to crackdown on dissidents analysts assert that it is the concentration of enormous powers in the hands of the presiden t that is at the core of the current political turmoil in kenya number of promises and pledges to repeal these oppressive laws and implement reforms have not materialized opposition groups are demanding the repeal of these laws and discussion of constitutional reforms before the upcoming elections at minimum opposition groups are demanding the creation of an independent electoral commission constitutional guarantees for the formation of coalition government simple majority requirement to be elected president constitutional guarantees for independent candidates to run for office without being affiliated to political party repeal of colonial laws and access to governmentcontrolled media4 the governments refusal to consider these opposition demands resulted in the deaths of over dozen people in clashes between protestors and security forces in the summerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97739crs5 5 the christian science monitor moi ducks and weaves in bid to rule kenya july 22 1997 p6 6 reuters kenyareforms july 24 1997of 19975 the violence shook the political establishment of kenya and eventually led to government concessions in midjuly president moi met with religious and opposition leaders to discuss opposition demands and agreed to consider constitutional reforms before the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections president mois unexpected move has been well received by some opposition groups and church leaders although others remain skeptical however this move may threaten the unity of the fragile coalition of church groups and opposition parties at recent meeting of the national convention executive council ncec group that has organized recent protests some opposition leaders lambasted individuals who met with president moi and rejected the presidents proposal for reform some members of the ncec would like negotiations to take place through the ncec and not with opposition leaders selected by the president the ruling party for its part argues that the government will not negotiate with nonelected groups like the national convention assembly nca in recent interview the secretary general of kanu stated that the issue of constitutional and legislative reforms cannot be handled haphazardly and kanu will not therefore abdicate its responsibility or delegate it to nonelective bodies like the nca6 ethnic politics kenyas political system is marred by ethnic divisions kenyan political leaders often deny that they are motivated in any way by ethnic concerns although political parties are largely structured along ethnic lines kenya is not unique ethnicity and politics in many african countries are intertwined albeit beneath the surface during the long rule of the late kenyatta the kikuyu the presidents ethnic group benefitted at the expense of other groups almost two decades of rule under moi brought enormous political and economic clout to the kalenjin the presidents ethnic group although some kalenjins deny that they have benefitted from mois presidency the dominance of the kalenjin has led to the marginalization of the old political class the kikuyu although they remain dominant in the bureaucracy the ruling party seems to be inclusive of all groups on the surface although real political power rests with small circle of trusted advisors these advisors appear representative of all groups in kenya the democratic credentials of opposition parties are also tarnished in large part by strong ethnic divisions some observers assert that ethnic politics has emerged as one of the major obstacles to the democratization process in kenya recent attempts by the ruling party to lure the kikuyu are seen by other groups as an attempt to marginalize them and secure continued kalenjin dominance in 1992 the two major ethnic groups the kikuyu and luo voted in large numbers for opposition candidates and help defeat kikuyu and luo candidates in the ruling party not single luo or kikuyu was elected to parliament from the ruling party in the 1992 elections public disenchantment with both the opposition and the ruling party has in recent years led to the growth of strong civil society this movement could become an important third force with better chances of success in bringing change where opposition groups and the ruling party apparently failedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97739crs6 human rights violations another source of tension is the abuse of power by security forces and violations of basic human rights indeed human rights conditions have improved over the past years in kenya but serious problems remain opposition party officials and journalists continue to be harassed and intimidated by government officials even though the government claims to have political prisoners meanwhile numerous sedition laws many from the colonial era continue to encroach upon the fundamental liberties of kenyans these laws which include the chiefs authority act the police act the society act the public order act and the preservation of public security act are used systematically to suppress opposition groups most of these laws do not require constitutional amendment for repeal but the preservation of public security act requires constitutional amendment since it is referred to in the constitution intolerance and insecurity another contributing factor to the current political crisis is intolerance by both sides the culture of intolerance has dominated kenyas political scene especially since the late 1980s the ruling party according to kenya watchers is quick to use violence to suppress dissent some ruling party officials have not yet fully accepted the concept of multiparty politics opposition politicians also do not understand or are not accustomed to an opposition role electoral defeat is seen as the end of their political career some in the ruling party are concerned that if the opposition gets to power minority groups will find themselves dominat ed by the majority and thus the return of the old political order it is this sense of insecurity that has been the core of contention in recent years for democracy to succeed in kenya political leaders on both sides must find middle ground and build the level of trust across party and ethnic lines in the view of kenya watchers the upcoming elections if judged free and fair could pave the way for more stable and democratic kenya uskenya relations kenya has been valuable us ally since independence providing the united states access to its military facilities and political support in the united nations washington once considered kenya model developing country with shared democratic values in continent where civil wars raged and military and authoritarian governments reigned with the end of the cold war us interests began to shift from containing soviet expansion in africa to human rights and democracy in the late 1980s and early 1990s human rights issues emerged as one of the leading us foreign policy concerns in kenya the promotion of democracy also surfaced as an important element of us policy towards kenya in the early 1990s relations between kenya and the united states became strained due to deteriorating human rights conditions and the governments refusal to introduce multiparty system relations began to improve slightly after the december 1992 multi party elections in which the ruling party won the united states and kenya in mid1997 renegotiated the facilities access agreement which was first signed in 1980 the agreement allows the united states to use kenyas ports and airport facilities for military purposes despite some concerns washington continues to see kenya as stabilizing force in region still marred by civil war and political instability washington for example monitors events in somalia from its embassy in nairobi and moved the operation of its sudan embassy to nairobi in january 1996 because of safety concerns kenya is also an important us trading partner the 8th largest in subsaharan africa us investment in kenya is estimated at 300 million
