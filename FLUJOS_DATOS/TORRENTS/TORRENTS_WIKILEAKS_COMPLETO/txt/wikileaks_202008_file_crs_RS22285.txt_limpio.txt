efforts to assess damages and needs to repair and reconstruct damaged systems full facility restorations in some locations may take many months and costs of needed repairs are largely unknown order code rs22285 updated december 15 2006 hurricanedamaged drinking water and wastewater facilities impacts needs and response claudia copeland specialist in resources and environmental policy resources science and industry division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22285 throughout the gulf coast region high winds and water from hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 damaged wide range of public service facilities including drinking water supply and treatment and sewage treatment plants restoring those facilities is part of the overall cleanup and restoration process this report describes impacts of the storms on drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities and efforts to assess damages and needs to repair and reconstruct damaged systems full facility restorations in some locations may take many months and costs of needed repairs are largely unknown to meet those longterm recovery needs affected communities are likely to rely heavily on federal assistance in emergency appropriations acts as well as traditional water infrastructure programs principally those administered by the environmental protection agency epa and the us department of agriculture in september 2005 the senate passed bill intended to streamline delivery of funds through existing epa programs to repair stormdamaged sewage treatment and drinking water plants s 1709 also legislation was introduced to provide hurricane assistance to louisiana including 5 billion for water infrastructure projects s 1765s 1766 hr 3958 further action occurred on any of these proposals during the 109th congress water infrastructure facilities affected by the 2005 hurricanes damages at many water infrastructure facilities from hurricanes katrina and rita included loss of electric power to pump process and treat raw water supply and wastewater initially following the storms some plants were able to operate temporarily on backup generators so long as fuel was available in addition flooding and structural damage disabled services in number of locations including new orleans overall large number of systems were affected by the two disasters for example within few days after hurricane katrina the environmental protection agency epa estimated that more than 1220 drinking water systems many of them very small in terms of customers crs2 served and more than 200 wastewater treatment facilities in louisiana mississippi and alabama had been affected as electric power was restored many of the affected systems were able to restore needed services especially facilities in alabama which was not in the center of the first storms path two weeks after hurricane katrina epa reported that about 30 of the affected drinking water and 40 of the affected wastewater facilities were again operating however many of the inoperable drinking water and wastewater plants serve large numbers of customers in biloxi for example officials were unable to repressurize the drinking water system because of broken and inaccessible water mains and valves onethird of the sewage treatment facilities in harrison county mississippi serving biloxi gulfport long beach and pass christian were destroyed or very severely damaged similarly drinking water and sewage service for more than million customers in new orleans discussed below was severely disrupted epa reported that by october 10 2005 following hurricane rita which hit texas and parts of louisiana on september 24 more than 85 of drinking water and 95 of wastewater treatment facilities in the region were operational1 by december epa httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22285 reports indicated that all wastewater treatment plants in mississippi alabama and texas were considered to be operational in louisiana small number of wastewater treatment plants were not yet operational including three large facilities serving about 150000 customers nearly all drinking water treatment plants throughout the region also had restored at least partial service although about 5 remained under boil water advisories for bacterial contamination after the storms epa staff assisted state and local officials in assessing all drinking water and wastewater plants in the region including more than 900 facilities located in areas that were unaffected by the hurricanes for damaged facilities steps involved in restoring service included drying out and cleaning engines pumps and lift stations testing and repairing waterlogged electrical systems testing for toxic chemicals and harmful bacteria that may have infiltrated pipes and plants restoring pressure drinking water distribution systems activating disinfection units restoring bacteria needed to treat wastes sewage treatment plants and cleaning repairing and flushing distribution and sewer lines impacts of hurricane katrina on new orleanss water and sewer system were particularly severe in the central portion of the city in addition to electric power extensive damage occurred from flooding of treatment plants drinking water distribution lines collector and interceptor sewers and the water systems powerplant even after restoration of electricity cleanup and recovery at flooded water and sewage treatment plants is taking considerable time the first task was to remove excess stormwater which required extensive repair of the citys stormwater system including levees and drainage pumps once floodwaters were addressed drinking water restoration became the next priority the largest of the citys two drinking water plants located where the worst flooding took place was completely underwater for nearly two weeks it was repaired sufficiently to provide flow ie for fire fighting but may not be capable of providing 1 for information see epas website at httpwwwepagovkatrinaactivitieshtml including weekly activity reports provided through midnovember 2005 periodic updated information is now available at httpwwwepagovkatrinaindexhtml crs3 potable water for some time officials say the issue with regard to drinking water in this area is large numbers of waterline breaks resulting from house connections that were damaged when trees fell fire hydrants that were damaged by debris or debris cleanup efforts and lines that were crushed or fractured by the weight of floodwaters an ongoing problem across the gulf coast region is that as hurricane debris is cleared fire hydrants and water meters are often torn out of the ground causing leaks that must be repaired sometimes more than once forcing water lines to be shut down and flushed in order to allow the system to operate for flooded areas sewage treatment often is the last thing back on line because plants are at the lowest point of the city to take advantage of gravity and thus were under the deepest water new orleanss two wastewater treatment plants were damaged the larger facility which serves 12 million customers was flooded until the end of september 2005 and standing water significantly damaged pumps and electrical equipment this plant partially restored service in october and was able to provide secondary treatment of wastes by midnovember but numerous continuing operational problems persist even one year later including power disruptions leaks and equipment difficulties the smaller facility located on the west bank of the mississippi river httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22285 experienced extensive wind damage but was judged to be fully functional three weeks after hurricane katrina the citys public works officials reportedly believe that much of the sewer system had probably been damaged and cracks leaks and breaks will need to be fixed by tearing up roads although road repairs already may be required as part of the overall cleanup effort potentially lengthy repair process2 ironically one problem facing new orleans and other communities is lack of customers although the majority of water and sewer facilities have been able to resume operations some are not in use because displaced citizens have been unable to return some of the systems considered to be operational are serving only small percentage of their prestorm customers with little or population present for utilities to serve there is insufficient demand for drinking water or waste flowing into wastewater treatment plants for normal operations and utilities are unable to collect revenues needed to pay existing bills repair or maintain their facilities or make payments on bonds leading to concern about possible defaults in some cases especially by small utility systems damage and needs assessments under authority of the national response plan3 epa and the us army corps of engineers staff have conducted assessments of water infrastructure systems assisting state 2 much of the new orleans water infrastructure was built more than 75 years ago even before the hurricane the sewerage and water board which is responsible for providing drinking water sewage treatment and drainage services to more than one million customers had 1 billion capital improvement program to address longterm maintenance and repair needs including compliance with 1998 courtordered sewer system consent decree 3 the national response plan nrp is the framework to coordinate emergency response activities of the federal government with those of state local and tribal governments and the private sector it is organized by 15 emergency support functions such as public works and engineering each with designated coordinator primary agencies and support agencies the text of the nrp is available at httpwwwdhsgovxpreprespcommitteeseditorial_0566shtm crs4 and local government personnel to evaluate damages efforts continue throughout the region to determine facilities needs for repair or rebuilding epa cautions that evaluations are ongoing and the status of some facilities is still unclear especially small systems even more than one year after the 2005 hurricanes in particular facilities determined to be operational may not be providing the required level of treatment for example some wastewater treatment plants in alabama and mississippi are operating at limited capacity or are providing only primary treatment of sewage not full secondary or better as required by law and to meet water quality standards similarly new orleanss wastewater treatment plants while considered operational and in compliance with permit limits as of january continue to face structural and other problems many require repair or reconstruction facility restorations full or partial are likely to take many months and costs of needed repairs are unknown or where available are considered preliminary in september 2005 the american water works association awwa issued very preliminary estimate that 225 billion will be needed to repair or replace drinking water infrastructure at public water systems that were damaged by hurricane katrina the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22285 estimates were presented with significant caveats however because of the limited information available on the extent of actual damage4 the epa inspector general issued two reports on the status of restoring public water supplies in louisiana and mississippi noting that officials estimate that about 615 million will be needed in those two states for public water system replacements and repairs due to hurricane katrina5 epa and states have taken time to develop estimates of needs for reconstructing sewage treatment facilities throughout the region as of february louisiana and mississippi officials estimated that costs to repair those states damaged wastewater infrastructure exceed 13 billion with about 12 billion needed just in new orleans6 as with estimates for drinking water facilities however all such estimates are considered preliminary and very rough in april results of study conducted by the water environment federation and black veatch corp were released this study sought to provide general assessment of infrastructure damage to wastewater treatment plants and collection systems in alabama mississippi and louisiana estimated to be 12 billion as well as an estimate of the effect on the financial stability of utilities that lost significant portion of their rate base another 163 million7 it noted that damages might have been worse and costs estimates higher but for the fact that many concrete structures withstood high winds flooding and storm surges better than anticipated 4 american water works association restoring public water supply systems in the aftermath of

costs and debt management for wastewater utilities affected by hurricane katrina april 2006 23 p crs5 meeting needs for repair and reconstruction as previously noted assessments of needed water infrastructure repairs and associated cost estimates are incomplete for now but could be substantial for systems that were directly affected how those communities will pay for repairs is challenge for public officials at all levels of government the 109th congress considered how to assist their activities and enacted appropriations but other specific measures while repairing stormdamaged facilities is the most recent funding needed by water infrastructure systems in the gulf coast it is not the sole need there throughout the united states wastewater and drinking water utilities face significant investment needs to meet the treatment and performance requirements of the clean water act cwa and the safe drinking water act sdwa according to the most recent estimates by epa and states the nations public water and wastewater treatment systems need more than 460 billion over the next 20 years to construct and upgrade facilities in order to comply with those laws and to provide safe and healthy water8 the federal government is unlikely to provide 100 of that amount and policymakers already have been debating how to meet those existing needs which of course do not reflect additional costs to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22285 reconstruct hurricanedamaged structures over the years congress has authorized number of programs to assist local communities in addressing water supply drinking water and wastewater treatment problems these programs generally are intended to aid communities in constructing facilities to comply with federal drinking water regulations and clean water rules in order to prevent the discharge of harmful levels of sewage wastes into surface waters they have different types of financing mechanisms some provide grants others authorize loans various administering agencies and other differences such as eligible community size9 these programs comprise the traditional sources of federal assistance that communities use to meet their water infrastructure needs congress also has authorized number of programs that can provide emergency assistance to repair and restore drinking water wastewater and related water infrastructure systems and facilities these include programs administered by the federal emergency management agency fema epa the corps of engineers and the us department of agriculture10 responding to the 2005 hurricane disasters the 109th congress provided more than 62 billion in emergency assistance in pl 10961 and pl 10962 most of this funding went to the disaster relief fund administered by fema approximately 78 billion was targeted for infrastructure repair but was not limited to 8 us environmental protection agency clean watersheds needs survey 2000 report to congress august 2003 epa 83203001 drinking water infrastructure needs

programs see crs report rs22248 federal disaster and emergency assistance for water infrastructure facilities and supplies by claudia copeland mary tiemann and nicole t carter crs6 drinking water and wastewater facilities11 eligible work is either classified as emergency work eg debris removal or permanent work intended to restore damaged facility to its predisaster design the affected communities are likely to rely primarily on femas federal disaster grant assistance to repair and rebuild stormdamaged structures where emergency funds are insufficient for example if fema denies request to pay for reconstruction beyond that needed to return to predisaster status communities may turn to funding under the traditional water infrastructure aid programs especially those administered nationally by the department of agriculture loan and grant programs for water and waste disposal projects in communities of less than 10000 persons and by epa under epas programs authorized in the cwa and the sdwa federal grants of appropriated funds are used to capitalize state revolving fund srf programs states in turn make loans from the srfs to local communities for needed wastewater and drinking water projects12 other legislation was proposed in response to the 2005 hurricanes for example the louisiana katrina reconstruction act s 1765s 1766 hr 3958 sought 1035 billion in appropriations for epa to provide infrastructure assistance in louisiana plus 4 billion httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22285 directly to the state of louisiana for repair reconstruction and improvement of storm affected wastewater and drinking water infrastructure systems other legislation included changes to epaadministered funding programs but not additional appropriations on september 27 2005 the senate passed s 1709 the gulf coast emergency water infrastructure assistance act it would have modified the revolving loan provisions of the clean water act to provide favorable treatment such as forgiveness of loan principal and extended repayment for sewage treatment repair or rebuilding projects in alabama mississippi and louisiana the safe drinking water act already includes similar provisions that are not restricted to emergency conditions s 1709 would have permitted those states to provide assistance for two years for wastewater and drinking water projects not included on states intended use plan since many of the systems affected by hurricane katrina are believed to not be included in the plans which generally are required before project can be funded under either the cwa or sdwa there was further congressional action on any of these proposals during the 109th congress in the immediate aftermath of hurricane katrina and subsequently after hurricane rita attention focused on assistance for individual victims and management of the overall response effort in subsequent months attention turned to longterm recovery of affected residents housing and essential public services as those efforts proceed congress may consider other policy options and issues including with regard to water infrastructure systems 11 us congress senate budget committee informed budgeteer 5 sept 12 2005 12
