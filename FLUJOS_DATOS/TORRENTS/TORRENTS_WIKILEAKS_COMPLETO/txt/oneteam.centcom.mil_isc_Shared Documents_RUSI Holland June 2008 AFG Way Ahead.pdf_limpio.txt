forcesaddressing many previous failings of theafghan counterinsurgency the task issimple hearts and minds must be wonand rule of law and governance thewrit of the afghan state extended overthe area but there are many problemsthe very presence of the forces afghanand british necessary to keep order andthe taliban out intimidates the localpopulation infrastructure is dire posinglogistical challenges and foreign troopsoperate within complex indigenousculture that is difficult to penetrate yetof which they must be extremelysensitive imposing solutions and policiesthat sound good in national capitals willlead to failure if they do not fit easilywith local reality for the majority here in the united kingdom the ongoing struggle inafghanistan is simple one oferadicating the taliban by military forcethe reality is much more complex andwhat has now been accepted is thatlongterm success will only be achievedif the battle for political influence is wonyet for all our good intentions this is notsomething that any foreign power caneasily achieve least of all those from thewest fortunately however there hasrecently been something of seachangein approach new doctrine and policy not least the introduction of the tacticalconflict assessment framework tcaf is helping british and nato forces tocounteract some of their inherentdisadvantages and to combat theinsurgency not just with bullets but byimplementing the right kind ofstabilisation and redevelopment that willwin the longterm consensus of the population before taking more detailed look at some of these new approaches howeverit is worth making brief assessment ofthe situation in helmand from the pointof view of those living in that troubledcorner of the world back when thetaliban held musa qaleh as one itsstrongholds in the north of the provincethe town outwardly at any rate lookedmuch as it had done for years rathershabby downatheel settlement ofconcrete and mud buildings perched onthe banks of wide wadi for the civilianpopulation there could be doubtingwho ran the place yet to the casualobserver there were comparatively fewsigns that this was place under militarycontrol of any kind all this changed in december last year when the afghan national armyana along with their british andamerican nato partners won aspectacular victory and ousted thetaliban from the town immediately itwas swarming with troops admittedly it was afghan troops that first entered musa qaleh in the wake ofthe fleeing taliban and it remains thecase that the ana still have strongpresence there it is also true howeverthat most of the ana soldiers are notfrom helmand but from other corners ofafghanistan country that has alwaysbeen geographical concept rather thana culturally and politically unified nationand despite the part played by the anathe british and nato effort there is aconsiderable one and most townresidents believe it is the latter who holdthe power strings when the author visited the town in

mohammed the owner of the willows was not entirely happy aboutthis enforced felling despite thecompensation that would be given tohim there was also notable caution inhis attitude towards the new power inmusa qaleh when asked what life hadbeen like here in musa qaleh before theafghan and nato forces had taken thetown he replied matteroffactly wehad security and corruption he is not alone in

many problems as itsolves and unlike the taliban the afghan government is perceived to be weakand although president karzai is apashtun most of the government arefrom northern tribes of which helmandpashtuns are suspicious to say theleast elsewhere in helmand the publicface of the government is either the anaand nato forces or the afghan nationalpolice anp who are seen asthroughout the region life expectancy is under forty it is perhaps surprise then that the greatest desire of most afghans inhelmand is to live in peace and securityand for many the taliban do offer thatit may be an extremely harsh shariabased rule of law and heavily dependenton intimidation and violence but asignificant number of helmandis stillbelieve that is the best they can hopefor as one british major said

militarytraining or even many weapons toseriously interrupt the efficiency of anoccupying power finally and less important are the difficulties of operating amongst peopleof deeply complex and alien culturelarge parts of helmand are extremelyprimitive in the outlying rural areas notmuch has changed since alexander thegreat passed through in 329 bc andmost people live in conditions that offerno concession whatsoever to the modernworld people who live in at bestmedieval conditions tend to also have acorresponding mentality other parts ofthe province are more civilised visitorto lashkar gah the provincial capital forexample would find similarities with anybackwater town across the muslim thirdworld lively market some metalledroads vehicles and evidence ofrudimentary electricity supply most helmandis are pashtuns and for the majority pashtun and triballoyalties come before even religionindeed many taliban fighters take uparms because of kin and tribalconnections the pashtunwali code issomething each pashtun grows up with and it is complex and largelyincomprehensible to an outsider whoimmerses themselves in the pashtunculture for years let alone soldier on asixmonth tour in other words the conditions culture and needs of helmand arecompletely different throughout theprovince the tendency of nato hasbeen to make assumptions about what itis that helmandis want as viewedthrough westernised democratic lensand to apply these assumptions to alland sundry when the reality shows thatno such template can or should beimposed compounding the problem hasbeen the sixmonth tour of duty aperiod that is too short for any soldier tobegin to understand the place in whichthey are supposedly bringing bettergovernance and stability animprovement might be twoyear tourfor each brigade with its componentsrotating in staggered fashion after asixmonth period but at present thebritish army is so overstretched it doesnot have the capacity to make such achange the point is however that helmandis face choice the taliban or the natobacked national government thetaliban are culturally and tribally close tothe majority and they provide securityorder and jobs most are prepared towork in heroin plants if not economicdevelopment they also bring with themharsh sharia law on the other hand thenational government backed by theriches of nato has the potential toprovide redevelopment and longtermprosperity the downside is that manyhelmandis are sceptical as to how longnato will stay and there are seriousinstitutionally corrupt and ineffective helmand afghans hope nato will bringabout great changes and improvedgovernance but there is some scepticismabout how long they will stay heresalim mohammed asked whether lifehad been better under the talibanreplied not better and then said againbut there was security was heoptimistic for the future as long as thebritish stay while the taliban have been seriously weakened due to the heavy fighting overthe previous two years the insurgency isfar from over indeed despite money andbacking from across the border inpakistan and elsewhere the talibanssurvival up until now owes more tosupport from the uneducated andisolated local populace who are deeplysuspicious of any outsiders historysupports this whether it be italianpartisans in the second world war orcommunist rebels in malaya in the1950s resistance or an insurgency cannot continue without the tacitsupport of proportion of thepopulation the challenge then facing nato and specifically the british who have takenthe stabilisation of helmand as theirparticular task is to win over the supportof the people gain the consensus of thepopulace and at the same timestrengthen governance this is agargantuan task not least because of theongoing insurgency which means alarge part of the military effort has to bedirected towards combat rather thandevelopment it also means the show offorce has to be emphatic and everpresent which is in turn intimidating forthe civilian population helmandis mayknow they will not be summarilyexecuted but noone in their right mind pashtuns included would want to be while the taliban have been seriouslyweakened due to theheavy fighting over theprevious two years theinsurgency is far fromoverthere are few metalled roads and none in musaqaleh for example noreven bridge across thewadirusi 1533 textqxp 19062008 1236 page 48nato and afghanistan 49doubts as to the effectiveness of the national government who are alsoperceived to be tarnished by corruption this put very simply is why the british effort in helmand faces such anuphill struggle but the only way thefuture of the province can be secured is ifgovernance is improved and the rightredevelopment and progress establishedthe local population will only put upwith foreign troops on their doorstep ifthose soldiers are delivering betterfuture what has been needed is first an acceptance that western ideology andassumptions have not been necessarilyright for helmand and second thedevelopment of tool that would helpnato to apply the right kind ofreconstruction and development indifferent parts of the province and whichat the same time would overcome thelimitation of nato troopsunderstanding of the culturalcomplexities in afghanistan the goodnews is that it seems that great stridesare now being taken in both cases brigadier andrew mackay only recently returned from commanding 52brigade has done much to championthese changes in approach formerpoliceman in hong kong he had laterserved lengthy tours in bosnia kosovoand iraq experiences that left himfeeling frustrated and angry in equalmeasure in each case he says themultinational coalition was trying toimpose western ideas onto cultures itunderstood very little he spent most ofhis nine months in postwar baghdad trying to help rebuild the iraqi policeforce banging his head against wallthere were clear lines of authority orresponsibility he says clear sense ofhow things might get done cleartcaf had been received coolly in the states but mackay had been taken with itimmediately and had realised that with abit of refining it might well work inhelmand since their meeting in 2006the two men had been in regular contactand mackay then invited derleth to themission rehearsal exercise beforedeployment by then it had been honedinto four carefully worded questionswhich every soldier on the ground couldask any afghan they met have there beenchanges in the villageneighbourhoodpopulation in the last year what are themost important problems facing thevillage whom do you believe can solveyour problems and what should be donefirst to help the village their answerswould demonstrate both what localsneeded as opposed to wanted andshow precisely what the makeup of thelocal population was at that given time and that was the eureka moment says wardlaw i thought tcaf was goingto be just tool that would allow us toestablish what the main problems thatcaused instability were i didnt realiseuntil jim started talking about it at therehearsal exercise that if you then keptasking those questions over time youwould also get measurement of effect as derleth points out it is simple system and its answers ensure that wecan provide what local helmandis needrather than what we think they want tohelp the coalitionbacked governmentgain consensus before we do anythingsays derleth we need to ask ourselveswill this new school for exampledecrease support for the enemy will itincrease support for the governmentand will it increase the governmentsability to gain support if the answer isno to any of those then dont do itthis also applies to questions of womensrights of course we in the west believein sexual equality but that is notnecessarily the way in helmand winningconsensus means winning the support ofthe adult male population and if theydo not want enfranchisement of womenthen imposing it will work against effortsat stabilisation tcaf results in lashkar gah the provincial capital and elsewhere such asin and around sangin and gereshk havebeen surprising and have demonstratedplan it was case of making it up as you go along there were also endlessdifferent agendas depending on who theindividual was it was just chaoticfrankly he was also painfully aware that much of what they had been trying to dohad had very little impact on theinsurgency it was all outputbased hesays it was all about the number ofprojects done or how many vehicles hadwe delivered to the police and to thearmy how many uniforms how manyweapons how many police stations hadbeen created it was all quantitative notqualitative and so he began to wrackhis brains for tool that could showwhether what they were doing washaving positive effect and helpingthem achieve their goals lieutenant colonel richard wardlaw commander of the brigades engineershad also had frustrating time in iraqand like mackay had been thinking hardabout means of implementing effectivereconstruction one of the principaltasks of army engineers in iraq andafghanistan he was particularlyconscious of the limitations of the sixmonth tour in coming to terms withboth the language and complexities ofthe local culture when he first met brigadier mackay last summer there was an immediatemeeting of minds the brigadier told himabout an american academic called drjim derleth senior strategic plannerand conflict specialist working for usaidwhom he had met the previous summerduring trip to washington derleth haddevised new impactmeasuring toolthe strength of which was that it madethe most of the forces greatest asset itstroops and their ability to get amongstand talk with the local population derleths tool which he labelled the tactical conflict assessment framework the taliban are culturally and triballyclose to the majorityand they providesecurity order and jobswhat has been needed is first an acceptancethat western ideologyand assumptions havenot been necessarilyright for helmandrusi 1533 textqxp 19062008 1236 page 49rusi june 2008than troops with little previous experience of such task indeed the taking of musa qaleh back in december also provided anopportunity to implement yet newapproaches to combat the taliban thetown was northern strongpoint for thecounterinsurgency and its capture waskey to undermining the power andinfluence of the taliban in the northernhalf of the province it was agreed thatcollateral damage had be kept to aminimum there were subsequently nocivilian casualties in the town anddamage to buildings was minimal whilepreparation for the immediate postbattle stabilisation of the town took upmore time than the actual militaryplanning consequently several projectswere up and running within days of thecapture of the town and by the end ofjanuary school had been refurbishedand was teaching 400 children bymarch this figure was 900 the fact that task force helmand is working in an open spirit of cooperationwith mullah salam former talibanleader recently appointed as districtgovernor of musa qaleh by presidentkarzai demonstrates the recognitionthat local problems are best solved bylocal measures and that future stabilitybegins now free from the shackles of thepast there is still understandablenervousness about salam and yet so farhe appears to have proved an inspiredchoice charismatic and persuasive he isprepared to listen to nato advice and isworking hard travelling around thedistrict talking to tribal elders and urgingthem to turn away from the taliban andtowards the kabul government his isprecisely the kind of strong leadership towhich afghans instinctively respondnoone in task force helmand is under any illusion that massive task stilllies ahead critically there is still the longoverdue overhaul and retraining of theanp for example yet large parts of themost populated regions along thehelmand river are now relatively stableand secure and those areas are onlyincreasing in size musa qaleh despitethe military presence is bustling oncemore hawkers and traders are busy inthe town bazaar and even travellingthrough the town back in january therewas little sense of menace bombs arerare there is real sense of hope albeittempered with caution amongst theincreasingly returning population many of the new approaches established in recent months are beingcontinued by 16th air assault brigadewho have recently taken over from 52brigade not least the use of tcaf but itis not yet accepted british militarydoctrine in contrast the us militaryalways quick to learn has put aside anyearlier doubts and having seen howeffective if can be has adopted tcafwholeheartedly lieutenantcolonelrichard wardlaw has even presentedtcaf to 3 commando brigade who arenext to take over in helmandfurthermore the us military have putaside any earlier doubts and are using itin afghanistan but as lieutenantcolonel wardlaw points out tcaf has tobe part of wider change of emphasisthere needs to be greater shift froman enemycentric j2 focus he says tomore of human environment focus inother words we should use ourintelligence not only to directly combatthe taliban but to also help us win theconsensus of the population clearly the significance of the recent changes in doctrine and policy inhelmand has wider ramifications asmany of these can be applied to anypostconflict mission there is nosuggestion that tcaf should be used iniraq for example yet it is essential thatthese new approaches are nowdeveloped and refined further only bydoing so do we have any chance oflongterm success in helmand and otherpostconflict situations around theworld h17039not only that the tool works but also that their earlier assumptions had oftenbeen quite wrong moreover results inthe two places were very differentshowing just how wide local differencescan be moreover tcaf has also been accepted by the provincialreconstruction team prt made upfrom combination of foreign officeand department for internationaldevelopment dfid civilian officials inanother seachange of thinking the prthas over the last year not only boughtinto the concept of increasing afghangovernance rather than imposingwestern ideology but has also grownenormously from just four employees tonearly thirty now this figure is still notnearly enough but progress is beingmade more importantly the civilian andmilitary components of task forcehelmand work closely together atlashkar gah in almost seamless cooperation when i was in bosnia saysbrigadier mackay military and civilianheadquarters were three miles apartnow one of my officers has beencomplaining that us being in buildings ahundred metres apart is too far hampering progress was foreign office and dfid concerns over the safety oftheir employees which meant prtofficers were unable to stay overnightanywhere other than lashkar gah withtravel in helmand so difficult and with ashortage of helicopters this wasseriously limiting their effectivenesshowever there has been relaxation ofthese rules in recent months and thereare now prt officials permanently inmusa qaleh for example this meansthat civilians with greater understandingof the culture and local conditions aredirecting the stabilisation process rather large parts of the most populated regions along the helmandriver are nowrelatively stable andsecure preparation for theimmediate postbattlestabilisation
