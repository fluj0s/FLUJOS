in vermont agency of natural resources v united states ex rel stevens the supreme court considered whether states are persons under the false claims act fca the court also addressed the much broader question of whether qui tam relators meet article iii standing requirements analyzing the text of the act as well as the long history of qui tam actions the court ruled that while relators do have article iii standing the false claims act does not subject states to liability the false claims act fca or act imposes liability on any person who knowingly makes false claim for payment to the united states1 to encourage enforcement the act provides that private person known as relator may bring civil action for substantive violations of its strictures for the person and for the united states government with the action being brought in the name of the government2 such suits are called qui tam actions and the relator receives share of any amount recovered in the action3 in vermont agency of natural resources v united states ex rel stevens the respondent originally filed qui tam suit asserting that the agency had submitted false claims to the environmental protection agency thereby inducing the epa to provide it with unearned grant money4 the court of appeals for the second circuit rejected vermonts argument that state is not person subject to liability under the fca and that any such action would also violate the eleventh amendment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20641crs2 5 justice scalia wrote the opinion and was joined by chief justice rehnquist and justices oconnor kennedy thomas and breyer id at 1860 6 id at 186162 7 id at 1862 quoting warth v seldin 422 us 490 499 1975 8 id at 1862 9 id at 186263because of split among the circuits the supreme court granted certiorari in stevens initially limited to the issues decided by the second circuit however shortly before oral argumen t the court issued an order indicating that it would also consider whether qui tam suits violate the standing requirements of article iii in its opinion the court first addressed the jurisdictional question of whether stevens had article iii standing to bring suit5 the court identified three requirements which must be met to establish standing first claimant must demonstrate an injury in fact meaning that there must be concrete harm to his or her interests that is actual or imminent second the claimant must establish causation in the form of connection between the alleged injury in fact and the alleged conduct of the defendant third the claimant must make showing of redressabil ity by demonstrating that there is substantial likelihood that the relief sought will remedy the alleged injury according to the court these three requirements constitute the irreducible constitutional minimum of standingan essential and unchanging part of article iiis case or controversy requirement6 applyin g this standard to the case at hand the court noted that the complaint undoubtedly asserted an injury in fact to the united states however according to the court the question remained as to whether stevens could pursue such claim on behalf of the government since article iii judicial power exists only to redress or otherwise to protect against injury to the complaining party addressing this issue the court first opined that the relator could be viewed simply as statutorily designated agent of the united states further characterizing the relators bounty as fee received from the governments recovery for the successful pursuit of an action the court rejected this characterization however determining that the fca gives the relator an interest in the action itself and not merely the right to retain fee out of the recovery7 the court explained that while the relators interest in the recovery created concrete private interest in the outcome of the suit the interest was identical in nature to that of an individual who had simply placed wager on the outcome8 as this interest was unrelated to any injury in fact the court deemed it insufficient to confer standing on relator elaborating on this point the court stressed that an interest sufficient to confer standing must consist of obtaining compensation for or preventing the violation of legally protected right since the pecuniary interest qui tam relator seeks to vindicate does not mature until the successful resolution of litigation the court held that relator cannot be said to have suffered an injury to legally protected right9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20641crs3 10 id at 1863 11 id at 1863 12

58 64 1989 wilson v omaha tribe 442 us 653 667 1979 15 id at 1867after declaring that the aforementioned rationales did not support article iii standing the court nonetheless determined that qui tam relators suit could be justified by the doctrine that the assignee of claim has standing to assert the injury in fact suffered by the assignor specifically the court explaine d that the fca could be interpreted as effecting partial assignment of the governments damages claim while it had never before recognized such representational standing by assignees the court stressed that it had routinely entertained such suits as well as suits by subrogees or equitable assignees given this the court determined that the united states injury in fact suffices to confer standing on qui tam relators10 buttressing this conclusion according to the court was the long tradition of qui tam actions in england and the american colonies the court found this long tradition particularly significant to constitutional inquiry into standing since article iiis restriction of the judicial power to cases and controversies is properly understood to mean cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to and resolved by the judicial process11 this historical basis coupled with the theoretical justification for relator standing based on the doctrine of assignment led the court to declare that there is room for doubt that qui tam relator under the fca has article iii standing12 having disposed of this threshold issue the court turned to the merits of the case specifically the state of vermont argued that it was not person subject to qui tam liability under the fca furthermore vermont asserted that even if it could be characterized as person under the act the eleventh amendment would nonetheless preclude such suit analyzing the first argument the court noted that the text of 31 usc 3729a imposing liability on any person who knowingly presents or causes to be presented to an officer or employee of the united states governmenta false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval had to be interpreted in light of the longstanding presumption that person does not include the sovereign13 specifically the court noted that this presumption is especially persuasive in instances where it is claimed that congress has subjected the states to liability to which they had not been subject before14 furthermore the court stressed that while such presumption is not immutable it nonetheless may be disregarded only upon clear showing of contrary statutory intent applying this maxim to the case at hand the court first looked to the historical context of the fca noting that the fca was originally enacted in 1863 to alleviate fraud by contractors during the civil war the court determined that the original liability provision of the act bore indication that states were subject to its penalties15 moreover the court found that the original provision did not even make clear that privatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20641crs4 16 id at 186768 emphasis in original 17 id at 1868 18 id at 1868 19 id at 186869 20 id at 1869 21 id at 1870 citing 31 usc 3801a6 which defines person as any individual partnership corporation association or private organization 22 id at 1870 23 id at 1870 quoting will 491 us at 65 24 id at 1870corporations fell within its ambit as its express terms referred only to classes of real persons and provided for criminal penalties including imprisonment while the court acknowledged that this structure did not undermine the assumption that corporations were indeed covered by the act it did nothing to overcome the presumption that states are not covered16 the court next considered the subsequent amendments to the fca determining that none of the changes made to the act indicated broadening of the term person to include states17 the court went on to explain that the current version of the fca further supported the conclusion that states are not subject to qui tam liability18 specifically the court noted that 31 usc 3733 of the act which allows the attorney general to issue civil investigative demands to any person possessing information relevant to false claims law investigation expressly defines person to include states for the purposes of that section the court determined that the inclusion of this provision in 3733 coupled with the absence of such in 3729 suggested again that states are not persons for purposes of qui tam liability19 the court also found it significant that the current version of the fca imposes damages that are punitive in practical effect which would be inconsistent with state qui tam liability in light of the presumption against imposition of punitive damages on governmental entities20 finally the court noted that the program fraud civil remedies act of 1986 pfcra related scheme establishing administrative remedies for false claims contains unlike the fca definition of persons subject to liability and that definition does not include states21 given this the court held that states could not be considered persons under 3729 as it would be most peculiar to subject them to treble damages and civil penalties under the fca while exempting them from the relatively smaller damages provided under the pfcra22 in light of these factors the court declared that various features of the fca both as originally enacted and as amended established the states are not persons for purposes of qui tam liability concluding its disposition of the issue the court noted that its holding was buttressed by two other considerations first the court reiterated the ordinary rule of statutory construction that congress must make its intention to alter the federalstate balance unmistak ably clear in the language of the statute23 second the court also pointed to the doctrine that statutes should be construed so as to avoid difficult constitutional questions24 finally the court stressed that while its holding did nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20641crs5 25 id at 1870 quoting ashwander v tva 297 us 288 348 1936 brandeis j concurring 26 id at 1871 27 id at 1871 stevens j dissenting 28 id at 1872 29 id at 1872 30 id at 1872 citing united states v mine workers 330 us 258 275 1947 the majority rejected this argument stating that none of the cases relied upon by the dissent addressed statutory provision authorizing private suit against state further the majority stressed that both comity and respect for our federal system demand that something more than the mere use of the word person demonstrate the federal intent to authorize unconsented private suit against them id at 1314 n9 31 id at 1873 32 id at 1874 quoting s rep 99345 pp89 it is again important to note that the majority refuted this aspect of the dissents argument finding that the legislative history and case law supported only determination that the fca was intended to cover all types of fraud not for the continuedexpress any view on the issue of whether qui tam action by relator against state would violate the eleventh amendment there is serious doubt on that score25 justice ginsburg penned concurring opinion that was joined by justice breyer who also joined the opinion of the court justice ginsburg explained that while she joined the courts holding she interpreted the opinion as leaving open the question of whether states should be considered persons when sued by the united states itself under the fca26 the dissent written by justice stevens and joined by justice souter maintained that the statutory text of the fca did indeed support finding that states are persons under the fca27 specifically the dissent argued that the 1986 amendments declaring that person who violated 3729 thereby triggering the civil investigative demand provision includes any state or political subdivision of state clearly established that congress intended for states to be liable for fca violations28 the dissent went on to argue that such conclusion was supported by the legislative history of the 1986 amendments and was fully consistent with the courts construction of federal statutes in cases decided before those amendments were enacted29 elaborating on this point the dissent stated that cases decided before 1986 uniformly support the proposition that the broad language used in the false claims act subjects states to liability in particular the dissent argued that while general statutory references to persons are not normally construed to apply to the enacting sovereignwhen congress uses that word in federal statutes enforceable by the federal government or by federal agency it applies to states and state agencies as well as to private individuals and corporations30 the dissent further argued that the false claims act is all embracing in scope national in its purpose and as capable of being violated by state as by individual action31 coupled with this broad purpose according to the dissent was the legislative history of the 1986 amendments which included senate report declaring that the term person includes partnerships associations and corporationsas well as states and political subdivisions thereof32 relying upon this characterization of the applicable law andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20641crs6 32 continued additional proposition that the fca was intended to cover all types of fraudsters including states id at 15 n10 emphasis in original 33 id at 1872 34 196 f3d 514 53031 5th cir 1999 35 id at 531 36 stevens 120 sct at 1870principles the dissent asserted that the majoritys decision was an outgrowth of series of recent cases that cloak the states with an increasingly protective mantle of sovereign immunity from liability for violating federal laws33 while the decision in stevens clarifies the proper application of the false claims act in relation to states and state entities the court expressed views on other critical constitutional issues currently being considered in the lower courts in riley v st lukes episcopal hospital for instance fifth circuit panel held that qui tam suits violate the separation of powers and unconstitutionally intrude on the executive branchs duty under article ii to take care that the laws are faithfully executed34 having reached this conclusion the court did not reach the argument that such actions also violate the appointments clause35 the courts opinion was vacated pending rehearing banc the determination of these issues could ultimately bring the constitutionality of the false claims act before the court again furthermore it is conceivable that congress will respond to stevens by amending the fca to bring states within its ambit given justice scalias statement that there would be serious doubt as to the eleventh amendment validity of false claims suit against state such congressional action would undoubtedly lead to further review by the supreme court36
