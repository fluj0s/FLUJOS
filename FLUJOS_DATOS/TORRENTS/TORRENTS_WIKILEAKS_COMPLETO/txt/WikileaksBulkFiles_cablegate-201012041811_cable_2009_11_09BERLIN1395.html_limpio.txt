anger in germany ref berlin 01131 b berlin 01093 c berlin 00390 d berlin 00272 berlin 00214 berlin 00001395 0012 of 002 classified by econmin robert pollard for reasons 14 bd 1 c summary just hours after chancellor merkels historic november 3 address to joint session of congress general motors gm canceled its sale of opel to canadian auto parts manufacturer magna the decision which followed repeated assurances from gm that it was done deal came as complete shock in germany and dominated media coverage throughout the day merkel herself was reportedly highly upset over gms flip flop ulrich wilhelm the chancellors spokesman on opel said the german government regretted the decision and reminded gm that it must now repay berlins 15 billion bridge loan to opel by the end of the month while fdp economics minister rainer bruederle described gms action as totally unacceptable the cabinet was expected to discuss the gm move on november 4 opels labor unions which had strongly backed the magna sale because of its promise to save jobs and keep plants open announced that workers would withdraw all concessions made under the terms of the magna deal and sta rt general strike at opel plants on november 5 while anger is widespread there are already some voices outside the government advocating acceptance of gms announcement as the only viable alternative to total collapse of opel end summary germanys political establishment reacts with anger 2 c opinion across the political spectrum has been uniformly negative fdp economics minister rainer bruederle blasted gms behavior as totally unacceptable juergen ruettgers minister president of nordrhein westfallen cdu asserted that gms decision showed the ugly face of turbo capitalism the leadership of the fdp whose opposition to government intervention in the opel deal is well known joined in the condemnation of gm highlevel source indicated that chancellor merkel is furious over the gm move and refuses to talk to gms leadership it is likely to be only matter of time before critics will call merkel herself into account for her strong support of the now collapsed magna deal the cabinet has been called into session and is likely to confirm the withdrawal of all financial support and demand that gm repay the governments 15 billion euro bridge loan by the end of the month 3 c jochen homann the economic ministry state secretary heading the german interagency working group on opel told emin on november 4 that there was possibility of further german financial assistance to opel in the foreseeable future the failure of the magna deal and gms reputation as an unreliable partner would likewise complicate negotiations with other governments seeking to preserve opel jobs and factories although one directly blamed the usg the germans are still having trouble understanding how gm could act independently of washington dr schubert one of homanns lieutenants complained to the embassy that if the us government had gm under better control this would not have happened it is now up to gm he said to submit new restructuring and financing plan as their previous one is out of date schubert was adamant that this time there will be special treatment for opel and gms plan would have to go through normal channels matched by threats from organized labor 4 sbu klaus franz the head of opels works council announced on november 4 that opels 25000 employees in germany will begin an indefinite strike on november 5 to protest the gm decision franz called on all 55000 opel workers across europe to join in accusing gm of blackmailing governments and workers in europe to sign on to its unacceptable restructuring plan he also revoked prior labor commitments to contribute 388 million dollars in foregone benefits to the magna sale berlin 00001395 0022 of 002 5 c oliver burkhardt head of the metal workers in nrw likewise condemned the decision as bold and unfriendly not only to opel employees but to the german government however burkhardt conceded that he is waiting to see long term gm plan for opel that relies on more than costcutting and downsizing in contrast to klaus franz burkhardt contended that nongerman labor unions were elated over the failure of the magna deal which was tilted against workers in other countries and doubted they would heed franzs strike call he also predicted that the strikes in germany will be shortterm and largely symbolic rather than actual closures adding we are not going to close the door on solution with gm similarly fred irwin citigroups country manager in germany and the chair of the opel trust that oversaw the magna negotiations predicted that unions will eventually reconcile with gm once they realize there is other choice while despair permeates opel executives 6 c opel managers such as berlin representative uwe berlinghoff who almost uniformly favored the magna contract were also taken completely by surprise by the gm announcement berlinghoff now expects gm to resurrect its premagna restructuring plans including closure of plants at bochum and antwerp belgium and the sale or closure of the eisenach plant berlinghoff also expected the german government to cancel the expected 45 billion dollar loan guarantee package as gm has demonstrated its lack of credibility with german politicians research and development and ipr could be key 7 c german auto industry insiders have privately identified compelling reasons why gm cancelled the magna deal among these are the importance of the gmopel research and development facility in ruesselsheim and its patents to gms development of small efficient cars in europe the us and elsewhere gm was also reportedly skeptical that it could adequately protect crucial ipr from russian exploitation because of the sberbankgaz partnership with magna moreover magna had oversold its ability to penetrate the russian market gms announcement stressed its plans to build on its already significant business in russia while retaining opel and to work closely with gaz without magna partnership but auto leader welcomes the move 8 c dr norbert reithofer the ceo of bmw told the ambassador on november 4 that gms move would be welcomed by the german auto industry reithofer was adamant that there was way bmw and the other german auto manufacturers would have purchased auto parts from magna once it became direct competitor as an auto manufacturer in reithofers view magna made the opel purchase proposal in moment of panic at the height of the economic crisis but now that recovery is in the offing probably is not unhappy to see it dissolve comment 9 c despite the considerable german ire aimed at gm much of it is aimed at gms handling of opel in particular the timing of the november 3 announcement rather than its business rationale for retaining its german subsidiary thoughtful german opinion leaders including former economics minister zu guttenberg conservatives in the german business community were equally critical of berlins strong arm lobbying on behalf of magna an opel trust board member and fdp politician dirk pfeil has already issued statement urging berlin to provide 3 billion euro in state aid to keep gm afloat like it or not the german governments will need to seek an accommodation with gm to keep opel alive murphy
