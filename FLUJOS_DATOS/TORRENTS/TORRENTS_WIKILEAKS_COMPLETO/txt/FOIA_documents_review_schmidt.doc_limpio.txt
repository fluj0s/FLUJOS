review of schmidt this paper is timely as it clearly shows that the results claimed in dml06 and mm07 are almost certainly spurious it is important that such papers get written and the obvious statistical errors highlighted here the problem relates to the original belief that there were many more spatial degrees of freedom this is common mistake and it will be good to have another paper to refer to when reviewing any more papers like dml06 and mm07 there is really excuse for these sorts of mistakes to be made that lead to erroneous claims about problems with the surface temperature record my recommendation is that the paper be accepted subject to minor revisions i have grouped my comments into minor changes that are needed and second set of thoughts that the author might like to consider to help clarify his arguments it is certain that this paper will get read by particular type of climatologist so it ought to be as clear as possible im happy if all the thoughts are ignored minor comments 1 the appropriate ipcc chapter isnt forster et 2007 it should be chapters 345 so trenberth et lemke et and bindoff et 2 p5 line 22 change to an ive used the ijc line numbering which is off from the lines in the paper 3 p6 line 5 add before minimum 4 basic reference to amip style runs would be useful 5 p7 line 3 how small is small 6 it might be worth saying which uah version christy et 2003 is 7 is the version of edgar used edgar2 8 p8 line 12 add to before each method also in brackets say and differences only depend upon missing values 9 p8 line 27 dml07 to dml06 10 p8 line 39 add ensemble before fall 11 p10 line 7 dml07 to dml06 again 12 p11 line 34 in wondering what the other variables were i realized that the paper doesnt refer to tables 1 2 and 3 the authors table 1 should be introduced at this point and also in the next section where mm07s table 2 is reproduced the authors table 1 the authors table 2 should be introduced on p12 about line 3640 and table 3 should be introduced on p13 line 1012 13 p14 lines 1517 there seem to be couple of points in northern india as well 14 figures 1 and 2 although obvious from the error ranges it would be useful to include the number of grid boxes foe each bin of the co2 threshold the count could be on the yaxis on the right it might have to be log scale but it would get over the point that figure 3 also shows 15 figure 1 caption line 29 change is to are thoughts 1 in the first paragraph of the introduction id put the two interpretations the other way around in the second sentence 2 id also emphasize that the 19792001 period is just 23 years 3 waste heating may be important at the grid box scale some hadrm3 work by mark mccarthy raised temperatures in london even more than just urban tiling by adding extra heat probably not published yet 4 one could argue that the range of trends in the main paragraph isnt the same areas the observational data is for the whole globe while the model is for one grid box from number of ensembles difficult to know what else to do 5 is the forcing strictly uncorrelated between the ensemble members p6 line 48 6 the last sentence of p7 is probably true i guess table 1 implies this 7 the sentence on p8 lines 2024 could refer to santer et paper where adding the trend estimate uncertainties is discussed 8 eclectic is great word here 9 the last few sentences before section 4 indicate that it is all down to the calculation of spatial degrees of freedom this problem is harder for many climatologists to comprehend 10 im not convinced that the last sentence is useful final one to make phil jones
