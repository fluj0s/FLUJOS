specialist in european affairs foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32136future of the balkans and us policy concerns summary the united states its allies and local leaders have achieved substantial successes in the balkans since the mid1990s the wars in the region have ended and all of the countries are undertaking political and economic reforms at home and orienting their foreign policies toward euroatlantic institutions however difficult challenges remain including dealing w ith the impact of kosovos independence fighting organized crime corruption and enfo rcing the rule of law bringing war criminals to justice and refor ming the economies of the region the goal of the united states and the international community is to stabilize the balkans in way that is selfsustaining and does not require direct intervention by natoled forces and international civilian officials relatedly the united states has reduced the costs of its commitments to the re gion in part due to competing us and international priorities such as the war on terrorism and efforts to stabilize iraq and afghanistan which have placed strains on us resources sfor and kfor the natoled peacekeeping forces in bosnia and kosovo have been reduced over the past decade in december 2004 sfors mission was concluded and european union troops took over peacekeeping duties in bosnia us combat troops remain in bosnia about 16000 troops re main in kosovo as part of kfor including 1600 us soldiers since the september 11 2001 attacks on th united states the war on terrorism has been the united states main foreign policy priority including in the balkans before september 11 qaeda supporte rs operated from bosnia and albania however the administration has said that these countries and others in the region have actively supported the war on rrorism shutting down terrorist front organizations and seizing their assets lthough their efforts are hampered by the weakness of local government institutions us antiterrorism efforts in the balkans are aided by us military and intelligence asse ts in the region as well as reservoir of good will among local muslims of all ethnic groups congress has played an important role in shaping us balkans policy some members supported clinton admin istration efforts to intervene to stop the fighting in the region while others were

policy the united states and the international community have achieved substantial successes in the balkans since the 1990s th wars in the former yugoslavia ended and all of the countries are undertaking po litical and economic re forms and orienting their foreign policies toward euroatlantic institutions administration officials have stated that ensuring the stability of the balkans is an important part of us vital interest in securing europe whole free and at peace for more than decade the united states has provided significant aid and troop deployments to the balkans in support of this goal both aid amounts and the us troop commitments have declined as the regi on has stabilized and more pressing us foreign policy priorities have emerged at the same time the european union has increased its role with the ultimate goal of extending eu membership to the countries of the region however analys ts believe the united states still may have an important role to play in the balkans observers note that the united states has political credibility in the region particular ly among bosniaks and albanians which the europeans may lack in addition the region may have high er strategic profile given the establishment of us military bases in romania and bulgaria which could be useful for us operations in the middl east continued us attention may also be needed to uproot possible rrorist networks in the region current challenges in the region impact of kosovos independence on february 17 2008 serbias kosovo province declared its independence the united states and at least 20 of the 27 eu ropean union countries including key states such as britain france germany and italy have recognized kosovo as an independent state in all at least 41 countries have recogn ized kosovo so far serbia which considers kosovo as part of its territory sharply condemned the move and declared it to be null and void belg rade downgraded diplom atic relations with the united states and other c ountries that have recognized kosovo serbia has been joined in its opposition by russia and at least five eu count ries spain greece cyprus romania and slovakia which have ethnic minority concerns of their own andor are traditional allies of serbia httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32136crs2 1 ahtisaaris report to secretary genera l ban kimoon on the plan can be found at httpwwwunorgdocsscunsc

supervised by the international community for an undefined period1 kosovo would not be permitted to merge with another country or part of another country the document contains provisions imed at safeguarding the rights of ethnic serbs and other norities in kosovo si x serbianmajority municipalities would be given expanded powers over their own affairs local police in these areas would reflect the ethnic composition of the locality the judiciary and central government would have to reflect the ethnic composition of kosovo and all laws having special impact on an ethni c minority could only be adopted by majority of that ethnic groups representativ in parliament international missions led by the european union would superv ise kosovos compliance with the ahtisaari plan kosovos independence could lead to inst ability in the region in february and march 2008 serbian mobs attacked eu and kosovo government property and personnel in northern kosovo many experts believe serbia is iming at facto separation of the serbiando minated northern part of the province from the rest of kosovo if there is largescale violen ce between serbs and albanians in kosovo large numbers of serbs could leave the provi nce particularly those living in isolated enclaves in the southern part of kosovo some believe that serbs in bosnia and albanians in southern serbia and mace donia could see kosovo independence as precedent for possible secession efforts of their own2 establishing democracy and the rule of law the domestic political situation in the ba lkan countries has improved in recent years all the countries in the region ve held largely free and fair elections although some problems with elections still need to be addre ssed civil society groups and independent media express wi variety of views but sometimes face pressure from government au thorities the countries in the region have undertaken efforts to redraw their constitutions along more democratic lines but some constitutional provisions in rbia and other countries are still less than ideal serious problems remain the legitimacy of democratic institutions is challenged by the weakness of government structures the countries of the region lack effective depoliticized public administration progre ss toward the rule of law is slow the police and j udicial systems in many c ountries are weak and often politicized government corrup tion is serious problem in all of the countries of the region organized crime is powerful force in the region and is often allied with key politicians police and intelligence agency fficials albania macedonia and other countries of the region have had problems in developing stable democratic political culture this has resulted in excessively sharp tension between political parties thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32136crs3 3 for more information see crs report rs22324 bosnia overview of current issues by julie kimhas at times hindered effective governance relatedly ethnic tension remains serious problem in many countries of the region particularly in bosnia kosovo and macedonia although the international community has provided large amounts of aid and advice to strengthen local institutions and th rule of law it may itself be responsible for some of the problems the united states and its european allies helped craft the decentralized political system of bosnia which was product of postwar political compromise in recent years they have viewed the arrangement as an unworkable one that hinders the countrys euroatlan tic integration and have pushed for the strengthening of central government in stitutions but have faced resistance and obstruction mainly from the bosnian serbs3 in both bosnia and kosovo international officials frequently imposed policies from above perhaps fostering culture of dependency and po litical irresponsibility among local elites given these problems the regions transition to democracy and the rule of law is likely to be lengthy and difficult economic reform and impr oving living standards the economies of the region face the burden of communist legacy as well as well as resistance to economic transparency by many local leaders some of the regions economic problems are closely related to its political problems weak and corrupt state structures have been an obstacle to rationalizing tax and customs systems to provide adequate revenue fo r social programs and other government functions the absence of the rule of law has hampered foreign investment in some countries due to concern over th sanctity of contracts in bosnia the lack of strong central government and the division of the country into two semiautonomous entities has hindered the development of single market privatization in kosovo has been slowed by uncertainty over owne rship of assets whic h was reflection of uncertainty over the provinces status substantial progress has b een made in economic reforms in many countries fiscal and monetary austerity with the assistance of international financial institutions has permitte d many countries to avoid hy perinflation and stabilize their currencies the countries of the region ve embarked on the privatization of their industries however the pr ocess remains incomplete nd there have been concerns within these countries and among foreign investors about corruption and lack of transparency in some deals high une mployment and poverty are serious problems in all of the countries of the region in recent years the countries of th region have experienced substantial economic growth and increases in real wages they have also have attracted increasing foreign investment although tota ls remain low when compared to those of central european countries that jo ined the eu in 2004 croatia has been particularly successful in economic reform and in attracting foreign investment and expects to join the eu in 2011 indeed in per capital income structural reforms

croatia has already surpasse d several current eu member states particularly romania and bulgaria although positive signs have emerged in recent years the economic challenges faced by the countries of the region mean that many years could be required before the poorer countries even appr oach average eu living standards as in the case of political reform which is closely linked to successful economic reform longterm international commitment of aid advice nd the prospect of eu membership may be required to build and maintain local consensus for often painful measures us policy concerns creating selfsustaining stability in the balkans the main goal of the united states and the international community in the balkans is to stabilize the region in way that does not require direct intervention by natoled forces and international civilian officials and puts it on path toward integration into euroatlan tic institutions the united states and eu countries support larger role for the eu in the region with smaller role by the united states at least as far as troop levels and aid are concer ned these goals have been given greater urgency by competing us and international priorities that have emerged since september 11 2001 such as the war on terrorism and efforts to stabilize iraq and afghanistan which ve placed strains on us resources since taking office in 2001 the bush administration has maintained the position that the us peacekeeping forces we nt into the balkans with the europeans and would leave together with them nevertheless as the situation in the region has stabilized the united states and its allie s have withdrawn troops from the region currently about 1600 us troops are depl oyed in kos ovo experts estimate that three times as many troops are affected by the deployment including those who are about to rotate into an assignment and retraining for troops who have rotated out moreover constant deploy ments throughout the world may have negative impact throughout the us military including in the army reserve and national guard units that now play key role in the us deployment in kosovo in december 2004 the mission of sfor the natoled peacekeeping force in bosnia came to an end peacekeeping duties were handed over to european union force eufor now composed of about 2500 troops the eu force is tasked with helping to maintain secure environmen t in bosnia and suppor t bosnias progress toward integration with the eu us combat troops remain in bosnia4 currently there are about 16000 natoled troops in kfor in kosovo including the us contingent filling possible security gap an important concern facing both balkan deployments is who if anyone will fulfill the tasks that they are currently performinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32136crs5 5 for detailed account of the riots and the response of unmik and kfor to them see international crisis group collapse in kosovo april 22 2004 at the icg

regular patrolling in bosnia an eu police mission monitors inspects and provides advice to promote multiethnic professi onal police forces that act according to european standards the office of the high representative ohr the leading international civilian body in bosnia has attempted to increase central government control over the police reducing the role of the semiautonomous entities within bosnia the united states and the eu be lieve such move would make the police more efficient and effective and increase bosnias unity however progress toward this goal has been slow due to strong resistance from the republika srpska the largely serb entity rs leaders see the police as key bulwark of their power and do not want give up control over it police reforms passed by th bosnian parliament in april 2008 were considerably weaker than those originally urged by the international community march 2004 riots in kosovo exposed serious weaknesses in policing and security in kosovo with notable exceptions the local kosovo police service did not perform very well sometime s melting away in the face of the rioters and in few cases joining them civpol the po lice contingent in kosovo was hampered by lack of cohesion and leadership there were many reports of kfor troops outnumbered by the rioters and unwilling to fire on them refusing to intervene to stop the destruction and looting of propert some kfor units reportedly failed even to protect serb civilians and police from violence5 kfor officers have said the alliance has taken steps to deal with these problems including by supplying its forces with nonlethal riot control equipment establishing clearer lines of authority and consistent rules of engagement kfor and civpol performed better during the violence in mitrovica in northern kosovo on march 17 2008 po lice stormed courthouse occupied by serbian protestors the police and kfor stood their ground as rioters attacked them with rocks molotov cocktails automatic weapons and grenades one policeman was killed and more than 60 u n police and about 30 kfor troops were hurt as were 70 rioters further viol ence may occur in kosovo as result of provocations by the serbian government ndor serbian extremists or by ethnic albanians uncertainty over the jurisdictions of the police and eulex the eu led ruleoflaw mission in kosovo that is currently deploying may exacerbate possible security problems eufor and kfor have also played important roles in overseeing the military forces of bosnia and kosovo eufor in spects military arsenals in bosnia nato and the office of the high representative have worked together to reform the two bosnian entity armies and reduce them in size these reforms include the unification of bosnias armies under single comma nd structure including minister of defense and chief of staff however although bosnia now nominally has unified armed forces military units are not integrated at lower levelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32136crs6 kfors presence deters possible serbian aggressi on or military provocations against kosovo although an invasion of ko sovo by serbian troops appears unlikely nevertheless kfor has already been deployed to deal with violence in such flashpoints as the divided town of mitrovica in northern kosovo and may face similar or greater challenges in the future kfor will also oversee the establishment of kosovos new army the kosovo security fo rce as foreseen by the ahtisaari plan given these concerns the presence of kfor will be needed for some time although the mission may eventually be turned ove r to the eu and all us combat troops withdrawn as in bosnia if kosovo stabilizes and serbia is viewed as not posing military threat to an independent kosovo restructuring the international role in the region another issue linked to eufor and kfors future is how to reorganize the international civilian presence in the region us and european officials say that th ad hoc arrangements cobbled together at the end of the conf licts in bosnia and kosovo under which local authorities are supervised and sometimes overruled by international bureaucracies the office of the high representative in bosnia the mission in kosovo should be phased out they believe that the two main forces for euroatlantic integration the european union and nato should have clear leading role in the region but through advice and aid not direct rule european union at the june 2003 thessaloniki eu summit with the countries of the western balkans eu lead ers recognized the countries of the region as prospective eu members the eu has granted eu membersh ip candidate status to croatia and macedonia croatia has made good pr ogress in its membership negotiations and hopes to join the eu in 2011 the eu has recognized macedonia as membership candidate but has not st arted formal talks with skopje due to concerns about the pace of reforms there the eu has concluded stabilization and association agreements saa with the other countries in the region the saa provides trade concessions aid and advice aimed at accelerating reforms and integrating the recipients more closely with the eu with the goal of eventual eu membership albania signed an saa in 2006 but the eu has refrained from starting membership negotiations with tirana due to uneven implementation of reforms montenegro signed an saa in 2007 the eu signed an saa with serbia on april 29 2008 the move appeared to be aimed at strengthening the hand of proeurope forces in serbias may 2008 parliamentary elections however at the insistence of the netherlands and belgium the agreement will not be implemented til all eu c ountries agree that serbia is cooperating with the intern ational criminal tribunal fo r the former yugoslavia icty another obstacle to closer ties with the eu may be serbias anger at the recognition of kosovos independence especi ally if an ultran ationalist government takes power in belgrade after the bosnian parliame nt approved police reform legislation in april 2008 the eu announced that it would sign an saa with bosnia on june 16 2008 the move was softening of the eus prior approach as the police reform was watered down version of previous proposals and ot her eu conditions appear to have been dropped or postponed like the eus decision to grant an saa to serbia the signinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32136crs7 of an saa with bosnia may have been intended to stabilize the region in the wake of kosovos independence before kosovo became independent it pa rticipated in an saa tracking mechanism that provides it with advice and support with the aim of bringing kosovo closer to the eu now that kosovo is independent it ma be considered for stabilization and association agreement however lack of consensus within the eu on kosovos recognition as well as kosovos institutiona l weakness may slow this process nato natos future role in the region w ill take place in part through the partnership for peace pfp program which promotes the reform of the armed forces of these countries and their interope rability with nato in addition the membership action plan map process prep ares selected pfp members for possible future nato membership by providing them with detailed guidance on improving their qualifications map participants albania and croatia were invited to join nato at the alliances summit in buch arest in april 2008 mbership invitation to macedonia also map c ountry was withheld due to an ongoing dispute with greece over the countrys na nato countries pledged to admit macedonia to the alliance once th name issue is resolved serbia and bosnia and herzegovina were long excluded from pfp due to their failure to cooperate with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty however in what many experts viewed as an unexpected reversal of policy they were permitted to join pfp by nato in december 2006 this may have been done for the same reas ons that motivated the eu to sign saas with these countries in 2008 to bring them closer to euroatlantic institutions as kosovos status was close to resolution an d in order to encourage further reform in the case of serbia both moves may have also been timed to assist prowestern parties in upcoming elections monten egro is also pfp participant at the april 2008 nato summit bosnia and montenegro were offered an intensified dialogue step toward membership action plan status the alliance said it would consider serbia for an i ntensified dialogue if it requests one however serbias interest in nato membership appears to have waned in the wake of the recognition of kosovos independence as an independent state kosovo will set up its own armed forces under kfor tutelage kosovo may join pfp in the future but this decision could be s ubject to disagreement within nato over recognition of kosovos independence international supervisory b odies in bosnia and kosovo the office of the high representative ohr in bosn ia may be eliminated by the end of 2008 if the country makes sufficient progress on package of reforms and conditions that has been outlined by the international community after ohrs departure an eu special representative will remain but will not have powers to impose legislation and dismiss officials as ohr had ohr has used these bonn powers powers more sparingly in recent years nevertheless it remains to be seen if aid conditionality and the distant prospect of eu membership will be sufficient to move the reform process forward in bosnia httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32136crs8 after kosovo declared independence in february 2008 the european union began to deploy an international civilian office ico which would oversee kosovos implementation of the ahtisaari plan the role and powers of the ico appear to be modeled on those of ohr in bosnia the head of the office the international civilian representative icr was chosen by an international steering group of key countries the icr also serv as eu representative in kosovo an american serves as his deputy the icr is the final authority on the implementation of the settlement and would have the power to void any decisions or laws he deems to be in violation of the settlement as well as the power to remove kosovo government officials who act in way that is inconsistent with the settlement the icrs mandate will last until the international steer ing group determines that kosovo has implemented the settlement the first review of settlement implementation will take place after two years the icr is expected to be operational on june 15 2008 mission under the eus european s ecurity and defense policy esdp dubbed eulex will monitor and advise the kosovo government on all issues related to the rule of law specifically the police courts customs officials and prisons it would also have the ability to assume limited executive powers to ensure that these institutions work properly eulex is currently only partly deployed it is unclear how these euled missions will relate to the mission in kosovo unmik the ahtisaari plan fore sees the withdrawal of unmik 120 days after the eu deployment begins however as the ahtisaari plan was not adopted by the security council unmik appears to have legal basis for withdrawing this situation could lead to conflict over the jurisdictions of the eu and missions however as practical matte r unmik may eventually be shouldered aside as cooperation between the eu missi ons and the kosovo government increases in such case the secretary general may decide to reconfigure the mission reducing it in size another concer n is that serbia and many kosovo serbs reject the euled missions but still suppor t unmik the serbs may cooperate with unmik in serbdominated northern kosovo but reject perhaps violently efforts of the euled missions to extend their authority there war crimes prosecutions responsibilities for prosecuting most war crimes in the region is shifting from the icty to local courts us and international officials have worked with local leaders and the icty to create war crimes chamber to try lowerlevel war crimes suspect s within bosnia the united states and other countries also assisted serbias efforts to set up its own war crimes court however the two most notorious icty indictees former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and former bosnian serb army chief ra tko mladic have not been turned over to the tribunal in additi on to karadzic and ml adic two other icty indictees are at large both serbs u n security council resolution 1503 calls for the icty to complete its trials by 2008 and all appeals by 2010 this could create situation where serbia and bosnia c ould run out the cloc k on cooperation with the icty if the completion strategy id out in unsc res 1503 remains in place us role the united states could gradually play smaller role in the region over time acting largely through nato and providing bilateral aid in selected areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32136crs9 6 cards financial statistics at the european union website httpeceuropaeuenlargementhowdoesit

united states has in the region will likely still be needed to exercise leadership in resolving some of the most difficult issues such as the arrest of war criminals and ensuring the regions stability in the wake of kosovos independence us and international aid in the balkans since the end of the wars in the region us aid has gradually declined in part due to natural shift from humanitarian aid to technical assistance and partly due to focus on assistance to other regions of the world us bilateral assistance appropriated in the account for political and economic reform in eastern europe which now almost exclusively focuse s on balkan countries fell from 621 million in fy2002 to just under 296 million in fy2008 for fy2009 the administration requested 2756 million for political nd economic aid to the region the overall goal of us aid to the ba lkans is to prepare the countries for integration into euroatlantic institutions us programs are aimed at promoting good governance fighting corruption streng thening civil society and an independent media enhancing market re forms reducing threats of weapons of mass destruction preventing trafficking in persons and band and promoting the rule of law and human rights throughout the region us bilateral aid plays lesser role in assisting macroeconomic reforms restructuring local industries and the banki ng sector and rebuilding infrastructure although the united states pr ovides important advice in th areas through technical assistance programs most funding for thes functions are performed by international financial institutions such as the intern ational monetary fund world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and devel opment us officials see the eu as playing the leading role in providing assi stance to reform thes countries along eu lines eventually leading to eu membershi p as these countries move closer to eu standards the more advanced countries will graduate from us assistance for example

reform and nato integration efforts eu aid to the balkans eu countries have s ubstantial interest in the stability of the balkans the regions problems already have substantial impact on eu countries in such areas as trafficking in drugs and persons the effect could be considerably worse if the region deteriorates into chaos and conflict some us and european experts criticized what they view as

pointed to generous eu preaccession aid given to central european countries and to neighboring bulgaria and romania as mode l saying more extensive aid would help the balkan countries restru cture

aimed at dealing with these problems cards has been folded into the instrument for preaccession assistance ipa which helps all countries seeking eu membership the eu has allocated 1147 billion euros over 1781 billion for the ipa for 20072013 the prospects for balkan countries to join the eu are clouded by public skepticism in wealthy eu member states bout the benefits of further enlargement while croatia may join the eu as early as 2011 it may take much longer for other countries to gain membership given their current poverty and need for further progress on reforms8 the war on terrorism and the balkans since the september 11 attacks on the ited states the war on terrorism has been the united states main foreign polic priority and has had an impact on us policy in the balkans in the 1990s wars and political instability provided an opportunity for qaeda and other terro rist groups to infiltrate the balkans however us and european peacekeepin g troops aid and the prospect of euro atlantic integration helped to bring more stability to the region moreover the september 11 2001 attacks on the united states underscored for the countries of the region the dangers of global terrorism and re sulted in increased us attention and aid to fight the terrorist threat in part as result many experts currently do not view the balkans as key region harboring or funding terrorists in contrast to the middle east south asia southeast asia and western europe however experts note that the region may play role in terrorist plans as transit point for terrorists as well as for rest and recuperation moreover they agree that the regions continuing problems tinue to leave it vulnerable to terrorist groups in october 2005 bosnian police captu red an islamic terrorist cell that was plotting to blow up the british embassy in sa rajevo this and seve ral other incidents have caused some experts to be concerned that the balkans may play greater role in terrorist plans than in the

combat terrorist infrastructure in the region us officials say that us efforts to bring stability to the region also help to fight terrorism they note that political instability weak political and law enforcement institutions and poverty provide breeding ground for terrorist groups us objectives are also outlined in the 911 commission report and the presidents national strategy for combating terrorism which calls for the united states to work with other countries to deny terrori sts sponsorship support and sanctuary as well as working to diminish the underlying c onditions that terrorists seek to exploit the united states has variety of instruments to fight terrorism in the balkans one is the presence of us troops in kosovo and intelligence personnel in bosnia the united states also provides bilateral counterterrorism assist ance to the countries of the region the overall us aid program to the region aimed at bringing stability through strengthening the rule of law nd promoting economic reform also serves to combat the sometimes lawless climate in which terrorists can thrive us aid helps to develop export c ontrol regimes in the region including over weapons of mass destruction and dualus technology the united states has encouraged regional cooperation on terror ism and international crime through the southeast european cooperation initiative seci in the longer term efforts to stabilize the region and thereby perhaps reduce its attrac tiveness to terrorists are also dependent upon integrating it into eu roatlantic institutions10 the role of congress in us balkans policy congress has played an important role in shaping us balkans policy members of congress spoke out strongly against atrocities by serbian forces in croatia and bosnia in the early 1990s some members pushed for lifting the arms embargo against the bosniaks so that they could better defend themselves congressional pressure may ve encouraged the clinton administration to play bigger role in stopping the fighting in bo snia ultimately culminating in the dayton peace accords in 1995 congress also played an important role in supporting the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia and pressing for the arrest and transfer of indictees despite the activism of some members on these issues many in congress remained cautious about us military involve ment in the balkans the deployment of us peacekeepers in bosnia in 1995 and the air war in kosovo in 1999 provoked heated debate in congress in part due to policy disagreements in part due to partisan conflict between the clinton administration and republicanled congress however despite so metimes harsh criticism both mil itary missions received full congressional f unding nevert heless concerns about the

key catalyst for form er serbian leader slobodan milosevics transfer to the tribunal in 2001 as well as the transfer of many others since then however the fear of suspected war criminals that they would be turned over to the tribunal to comply with the aid criteria may have led to the murd er of prime minister djindjic in march 200311 four major indicted war criminals remain at large including
