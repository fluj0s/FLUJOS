reasons 14 b and d 1 s summary argentine president cristina fernandez kirchners cfk promotion of former justice minister anibal fernandez af to cabinet chief puts in place someone with six years of experience working for the first couple first as former president nestor kirchners interior minister and then as cfks justice minister by dint of his offices physical proximity to the presidents as well as his portfolios constitutional responsibilities af is in position to wield significant power and influence and is already playing key role in shaping casa rosada politics policy and message 2 s af has been the most accessible member of cfks cabinet for the embassy but unlike his two immediate predecessors he has also not been shy about vociferously attacking the usg or any other target in order to defend the kirchners like many argentine politicians he is dogged by corruption rumors including ties to narcotrafficking according to unsubstantiated press and intelligence reports ref additionally he is suspected of directing intelligence teams to clandestinely monitor the emails of the administrations political opponents according to separate intelligence reports refs b and c and he has been linked to reported cfk administration efforts to secure additional votes illegally in buenos aires and cordoba provinces ahead of the june midterms despite the varied and persistent accusations of corruption lodged against him however there is hard evidence end summary cfk rewards fernandez loyalty with cabinet chief post 3 c former minister of justice human rights and security anibal fernandez af became cfks third chief of cabinet since she assumed office in december 2007 longtime peronist and close ally of former president nestor kirchner nk af has worked over six years for the presidential couple since the first day of nks term he has been one of the administrations most outspoken public defenders first while serving as nks interior minister and later as cfks justice minister many viewed afs promotion to cabinet chief as reward for securing in his hometown of quilmes one of the few significant kirchner victories in the june 28 midterm elections ref origins of the cabinet chief post 4 c as cabinet chief af has considerable power and influence the authors of the 1994 constitutional reforms intended the position to be check on presidential power as watereddown prime minister although in practice the cabinet chief has become presidential chief of staff spokesman and allpurpose firefighter the cabinet chief is technically responsible for the collection of national taxes submitting the executives budget request to congress cosigning executive decrees appointing administration employees not designated by the president and overseeing the cabinets ministers additionally the presidents cabinet chief is expected to report at least monthly to congress alternating between the lower house and the senate note the last two cabinet chiefs alberto fernandez and sergio massa appeared before congress less than once year anibal fernandez will make his first such appearance this week under the ks cabinet chief influence grew 5 c under the kirchner administration the cabinet chief position has grown in influence beyond its constitutionallyproscribed powers since 2002 the argentine congress has annually authorized economic superpowers for the executive branch originally enacted to address the 2001 financial crisis these controversial superpowers enable the cabinet chief to redistribute federal funds coming from export taxes and tax collections above and beyond budget estimates at the presidents discretion 6 c the cabinet chiefs influence ultimately depends on his relationship with the first couple afs immediate predecessor the mediafriendly sergio massa reportedly had differences with nk over style and substance their tense relationship soured even further with nks poor showing in massas hometown in the june 28 midterm elections ref alberto fernandez not related to af who served as cfks and nks first cabinet chief was one of the few capable of moderating the temperamental first couple but even he was unable to walk the kirchners back from their takenoprisoners approach to an extended conflict with the farm sector and he resigned in july 2008 out of frustration ref f amid cabinet that does not speak much to the media anibal fernandez has long been one of the most visible spokesmen for the kirchners and his influence over policy and political decisions will likely grow in his new post embassy interaction with fernandez 7 c af has been for us the most accessible and forwardleaning member of cfks cabinet welcoming usg law enforcement training and cooperation ref g again and again he has gone out of his way to rearrange his travel schedule to meet with visiting us officials and greet embassy officials at diplomatic events although he has frequently told us that he is the most proamerican member of cfks cabinet we think this reflects his deepseated pragmatism rather than any abiding affinity for the united states our positive working relationship with fernandez for example did not stop him from criticizing the united states to protect the kirchners as he did during the 200708 suitcase scandal ref h nonetheless he was one of the first argentine officials to assure embassy officials that the suitcase scandal was water under the bridge 8 c more political hack than diplomat af is fiefdombuilder who loathes giving up control over strategic resources when he moved from the interior ministry to justice for example he took the internal security agencies with him many believe that even now as cabinet chief af retains operational control over the law enforcement forces 9 c although af confided to the embassys former legat that he was not in position to micromanage the ministry of justice at first he said he immediately centralized control once he got the lay of the land as chief of the internal security forces including the border patrolparamilitary police gendarmeria nacional coast guard federal police and special airport police af quickly imposed strict vertical hierarchy where he discouraged information sharing and commanded security chiefs to report directly to him he has boasted to embassy officials that while his predecessor at justice alberto iribarne only signed few ministerial decrees he signed hundreds judicial contacts have told us that as justice minister he even tried to pressure provincial judges to advise him of any judicial assistance requests from federal judges but subsequently backtracked on that position after judges complained that the directive interfered with judicial independence his micromanagement over even routine matters in his portfolio resulted in bureaucratic backlogs for us naming participants to us training programs the visits of transportation security administration teams to conduct airportair carrier assessments and clearance for us federal air marshals all required his personal approval once when the dcm visited fernandezs chief of staff at justice fernandez got wind of the meeting while it was in progress got into car and stormed into the office taking over the meeting while the chief of staff clammed up 10 c pragmatic and politically savvy interlocutor af prefers not to include his staff in meetings with embassy officials although he is always wellprepared his speech and demeanor can sometimes be crass on more than one occasion he has taken obvious notice of an attractive translator during meeting with visiting us officials additionally he has referred to the existence of local demand for young genitals when explaining the challenges his ministry faces in fighting human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation af denies drug problem advocates decriminalization 11 c although he has not interfered with usg cn activity here insofar as we can ascertain af has frequently denied that drug trafficking is major problem in argentina despite evidence indicating that colombian and mexican drug cartels operate in argentina and that argentina leads latin america in cocaine consumption af insists that argentina is merely transit point and continues to deny the existence of drug labs in argentina in an october 2008 workshop on argentine narcotics policy af described press reports claiming that drug cartels had established production facilities in argentina ref i as mere fiction he is also longtime advocate for the decriminalization of drug use saying he dreams of the day when drug addicts are sent to rehab instead of prison af argues that the government should stop focusing on smalltime carriers in order to focus on dismantling large drug trafficking networks ref j 12 snf according to late december 2006 intelligence reporting ref k af advised then vicepresident scioli that he should not make counternarcotics his number one campaign issue when he ran for governor of buenos aires province reasoning that the narcotraffickers are wellorganized with the capacity to frame politicians af suggested that scioli pay only lip service to counternarcotics efforts he argued that scioli should not assume the risks since drugrelated crimes would never be resolved ties to drug trafficking 13 snf unsubstantiated press and intelligence reports refs and m suggest that af may be financially profiting from narcotrafficking these reports state that afs ties to narcotrafficking date back to 1994 when af was mayor of quilmes and allegedly directed cocaine trafficking network the embassys dea section has heard similar allegations from contacts at the argentine counternarcotics secretariat sedronar which has been at loggerheads with af sedronar contacts told poloff that af personally called off an ongoing drug investigation in salta province near the bolivian border when he got wind of the investigation 14 snf we have information to corroborate these allegations and we are unaware of any formal legal complaint against him on narcotrafficking charges however there are two formal legal complaints pending against former subordinates including federal police officials for protecting or willfully ignoring various illegal brothels in the monserrat neighborhood within fiveblock radius of federal police headquarters in buenos aires city where the sale of drugs is suspected spying on the opposition 15 snf intelligence reporting suggests that af has not hesitated to resort to questionable means to keep tabs on political opponents in midmay 2007 af as interior minister allegedly directed private intelligence team composed of retired military and intelligence officers to clandestinely monitor the emails of provincial and federal government officials business executives and journalists suspected of working against nks administration ref b in september 2007 he reportedly used private unofficial investigative team to read the emails and collect derogatory information on thengubernatorial candidates for buenos aires province francisco narvaez and juan carlos blumberg and buenos aires province minister of security leon arslanian ref c according to intelligence reporting in november 2007 af used two computer technicians to hack into highlevel email accounts including chief justice lorenzettis email ref g san isidro judge sandra arroyosalgado wife of alberto nisman the special prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of the argentine jewish mutual association amia is investigating afs relationship with the two technicians according to press reports note these technicians in the past have been associated with argentinas state secretariat for intelligence side and sought asylum in uruguay 16 snf af reportedly may have played tangential role in illegally bolstering voter registration ahead of the june 28 midterms according to june 2009 intelligence report he supported efforts led by interior minister florencio randazzo and secretary of intelligence hector icazuriaga to illegally procure national registry identification numbers dnis to register ostensible supporters and secure additional votes in buenos aires and cordoba provinces ref l transparency 17 c although af once bragged to the embassys former legat that he has transparent and honest style he did little as justice minister to fortify his agencys anticorruption efforts or enhance governmental transparency admittedly the mojs anticorruption office aco was weak unit to begin with but it made headway during afs tenure contacts who work for the cabinet chiefs government accountability and transparency unit have expressed concern that the goa will become even less transparent under his watch they note that since af took over as chief of the internal security forces criminal statistics are longer public information indeed despite public alarm over rising insecurity af refuses to acknowledge rise in robberies and kidnappings and instead has argued that insecurity is only sensation fed by the media corruption 18 c like many argentine politicians af has been dogged by rumors of corruption in recent years some embassy contacts have alleged that af has corrupt relationship with the japanese computer company nec when af was mayor of quilmes 19911995 he was charged with several counts of corruption becoming fugitive for 48 hours although he was later acquitted he has continued to face accusations of corruption from the opposition and the allegations remain fresh in the minds of some argentines when cfk named him minister of justice one judicial contact told us that many in the judicial system considered the appointment ironic and called af the fugitive from quilmes bio data 19 sbu af began his political career in 1983 working first as an advisor to the budget committee of the buenos aires provincial senate from 1985 to 1987 he served as the administrative secretary for the peronist party pj in the buenos aires provincial senate he also simultaneously held positions in the municipal councils of quilmes and florencio varela in 1991 af was elected mayor of quilmes in 1995 he won provincial senate seat where he presided over the commission on public health and control over addictions he was named provincial government secretary in 1997 labor secretary in 1999 and the provinces first labor minister in 2001 af served in former president eduardo duhaldes cabinet as secretary general of the presidency in january 2002 and then as production minister in october of the same year he switched allegiance to nk in 2004 when the peronist party split into two factions one that supported nk and another that supported duhalde since then duhalde supporters have called him traitor and the first kirchner convert in 2007 cfk tapped him to serve as her justice minister and on july 7 she named him cabinet chief 20 sbu af was born in quilmes buenos aires province on january 9 1957 public accountant af received his law degree while serving as interior minister although the kirchners stifled afs ambitions to run for governor of ba province in 2007 when they tapped then vice president daniel scioli for the job afs power and influence within the kirchner cabinet has steadily grown he accompanied cfk to the united states in july when she went to the oas to discuss the political crisis in honduras he also accompanied her in may 2007 when she addressed the american jewish committee as senator and first lady during that visit he met with the us attorney general fbi officials and state department officers on tiprelated issues af lives in the trendy waterfront puerto madero neighborhood in buenos aires city with his wife and one fan of technology he carries multiple cell phones and his office has six television sets permanently tuned in to every local news channel he speaks limited english comment handle with care 21 s for usg officials anibal fernandez has long been the most readily accessible goa cabinet member that has continued since he became cabinet chief assuming more importance than ever fernandez has far better access to the ruling first couple than any other member of the cabinet perhaps only reclusive casa rosada staffer carlos zannini has more influence with the kirchners given afs importance accessibility and the absence of hard evidence to substantiate the allegations described above we continue to meet and work with him at the same time there are enough rumors about fernandez even in this rumorplagued conspiratorial society to approach interactions with him with some caution kelly
