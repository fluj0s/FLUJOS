air force one at stansted airport on 31 march 2009 the worlds most powerful leader was being protected by bisteel this started with the permanent bisteel wall system outside the main terminal building at the airport installed to protect against vehicle bomb attack followed by temporary bisteel perimeter protection measures around the us ambassadors residence in regents park where the president was staying and at the summit venue the excel conference centre in london docklands in addition visits to number 10 downing street took place behind protective measures currently installed in whitehall which incorporate the bisteel bollard system as well as bisteel walls and balustrades disguised under traditional portland stone bisteel general manager jurek tolloczko takes us on tour of the g20 summit providing an insight into the hard work involved in the design testing manufacture and delivery of perimeter protection solution for one of bisteels largest single security projects to date we had known for some time through our home office and sussex police contacts that bisteel barriers would be used at the g20 summit although we didnt know early on what would be required or where the deployment would take place we were asked to design and test several new perimeter protection products to pas 682 007 specifications these included the new quick link lite rapidly deployable bisteel barrier system and the innovative arrestor wire rope system developed in collaboration with bristorm for the protection of large perimeters our engineering and cad teams had to move fast to work up the co rrect designs followed by swift manufacture of the prototypes then testing all within threemonth window our hearts were in our mouths several times as we watched the test trucks head at speed towards the prototypes at the tr l test track but the new products passed with flying colours when we received the order from sussex police for major expansion to their existing national barrier asset 1 million contract the race was on to manufacture everything in time for use at the g20 summit pas 682007 specification for vehicle security barriers this publicly available specification pas has been prepared to address the needs of organisations who wish to have assurance that vehicle security barriers will provide the level of impact resistance that they seek bisteel update march 2009 page 2 of 2 fast forward to the weekend before the summit when implementation of the g20 security measures began the original heavy duty nba bisteel barriers gates and portals were installed around the excel centre for the summit itself meanwhile in regents park our new rapidly deployable quick link lite units and over 2Â½ km of the new arrestor wire rope accompanied by 75 bisteel bargeshaped barriers were arranged around the us ambassadors residence bisteel pedestrian portals were positioned to allow the free flow of pedestrians where required through the perimeter of barriers whilst bisteel barges and swing gates protected the main entrance deploying the entire nba simultaneously across 2 locations required concentrated logistics effort steve morle from our delivery services team myself and some colleagues from our partner company emtrade spent the weekend helping main contractor hardstaff traffic barrier services with the installation remaining on hand to assist with any technical or practical issues the schedule was tight and installing the new arrestor for the first time at such high profile event was challenging plus we had to avoid any damage to the us ambassadors lawn on the morning of wednesday 1 april everything was in place and wherever the president his wife and the us security service went bisteel was in evidence according to tony duffell national barrier asset manager sussex police this has been one of the most high profile and challenging security projects we have worked on and i am pleased to confirm successful outcome our colleagues at corus bisteel pulled out all the stops to design test and manufacture the new units we needed for this event within very tight timeframe the companys staff have proven to be highly knowledgeable and helpful constantly striving to develop and refine their products whilst providing the highest levels of service and support this event was an excellent showcase for our full range of bisteel perimeter protection products and clearly demonstrated the benefits of the new arrestor wire rope system as turnkey security solution for temporary venues and events lets hope the long term results of the g20 summit are considered such success the nba what is it the national barrier asset nba is stock of barriers including biste antiattack vehicle barriers used to protect people and property against attack from vehicle borne improvised explosive devices vbied s owned by sussex police the nba is available for use by all uk police forces typically on short term basis for deployment at security sensitive sites or major events such as political conferences state visits and sports meetings the bisteel stock consists of range of barriers in different sha pes barges straights and curves including the new quick link lite and the arrestor systems heavyduty gates and pedestrian portals which can be arranged around site to control vehicle access and protect against vehicle bomb attack the nba was developed through close collaboration with the government security service to address an increase in terrorist activities involving suicide attacks using cars or trucks loaded with high explosives concrete blocks and bollards were previously used but they were considered ugly inflexible and could shatter into dangerous fragments on impact or when subjected to explosive blast the nba is highly effective has been expertly engineered and we are unaware of any similar systems available across the globe thats why us security service personnel were so interested in bisteel when they saw it being installed in london last week
