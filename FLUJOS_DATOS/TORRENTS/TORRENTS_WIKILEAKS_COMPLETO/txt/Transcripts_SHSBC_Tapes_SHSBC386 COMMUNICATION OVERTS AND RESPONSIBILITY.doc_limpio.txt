communication overts and responsibility lecture given on 16 june 1964 how are you today audience fine thank you etc good this is the what audience the 16th the 16th of june in these stirring times june 16 ad 14 saint hill special briefing course well looks like weve got lots of people here well be getting rid of them very shortly going out in all directions i probably ought to start giving you some lectures of as you go forth into the world men are not evil theyre just nutty all is not good that glitters you know that sort of thing but in these high and stirring times it is very easy to forget the fellow who is out there slugging in at level iii trying to get result in an hgc or private practice on somebody who is mainly concerned with the fact that every now and then he has goose bumps you know and this type of approach were liable to forget because it is still with us and frankly there is nothing you can do for that fellow in terms of gpms or anything like this you just got to get down and do groundlevel job of auditing and its funny thing but people dont realize how far that groundlevel type auditing carries somebody its quite remarkable iveran into somebodys pc who was round the grounds here some little time ago and this was the height and level of his worries it seemed like they only had auditing on the weekends and it really wasnt quite enough auditing to take care of all the problems he was having with his wife and if hehe thought maybe if they could just have auditing little faster or little bit more then he would have chance maybe to catch up with his problems with his wife this was his zone and horizon this was as far as life extended and during session toward the end of session he could suddenly begin to get an insight into the fact that there was something could happen to him that was better than had been happening in life you see and hed just about grasped this insight and then he would go home and have some more trouble with his wife dont you see and this was the sort of treadmill he was on its hard thing for person who has been in processing and has been processed for quite while to look directly and straight into the teeth of this factor that individuals are so wrapped up and involved with their immediate environment that they have time to think of themselves or ease gain or anything like that its just an effort to control their immediate environment and theyre in some fabulous contest with the immediate environment and if you could remember this as an auditor and if you can process at this level when you are handling such people you will have remarkableremarkable success only thing im trying to tell you here is that the individualthat the individual that you process that isnt going to othes just going to sigh of relief see i mean thats about the highest level of gain which he could attain tothis fellow is in contest with his environment it doesnt sound like much dont you see it doesnt sound like any more than their problems and cases sound like dont you see but nevertheless it is the key the direct and immediate key to the ease now whats his environment well this is your job as an auditor to find out thats your first job what is this blokes environment now we will just take off from this point the individual is in contest with his environment well just take off from that point now thats very true observation particularly if we qualify that observation just little bit further and we say that contest is not necessarily battle of fisticuffs there are various ways to react to the environment you can react to the environment by going into catatonic schizophrenia complete immobility and yet do you know that that is method of handling the environment if you get down to rock bottom on this thing anything your pc is doing at these lower levels is an effort to handle the environment it is an effort to do that once umptyskillion years ago i got swatted and sat there very very immobile being right i went on being right for quite little while see by permitting myself to be immobilized it made the other fellow wrong it didntwasnt really doing anything to him taking action absolutely forward thrust of any kind whatsoever outward motion outward flow of any kind not even thought of an outward flow and yet that was the method of handling the environment so the way we qualify this is the method is not necessarily smart and right down to the lowest rung of the ladderto the lowest rung of the ladder this individual is still in contest with his environment is still reacting toward his environment and is still seeking to handle his environment those things are quite true thats true of any case see thetan never gives up now these methods are not clever they are very often downright stupid and the frailty of these methods is so great theyreyou see theyre just solutions of one kind or anotherand the frailty is so great that you can very easily unsettle the solution you see it isnt good method to begin with and just by circulating little mental energy around it the slightest peek underneath the edge of the rug pulls the rug out see its not hard to unsettle one of these things because theyre not smart see it isnt clever method to begin with all right so i got swatted see give you an idea all right i got swatted you know goodgood blast see so i sit there immobilized you see being right see and this made the other fellow wrong but hed left see now if anybodynow if anybodyif anybody had come along and had said to at that particular time well just how does this straighten this situation up i possibly would have said well uhmmmmheh it doesnt and that would have been the end of that see do you see very easy to unsettle these things now oddly enough the more irrationalthe more irrational the solution or the handling of the situation the more easily it is unsettled you can unstabilize it as solution in direct ratio to its uselessness as solution now how in the name of common sense alienists and the witch doctor and the other blokes up and down the track have never run into this as rule i dont knowi dont know it makes ask some very searching questions did they want anybody to get better it makes ask mean questions like this dont you see because this rule here is perfectly visible its very visible rule you start fooling around with this very long and you will find out that the more irrational the solution the easier it is to unsettle the harder it is to maintain well now lets give you an example out of life lets say that this fellow has solution of keeping the hind wheels of his car off the road as method of safe driving thats good irrational solution seegood and irrational see he wants to drive safely so hes going to keep the hind wheels of his car off the road well man look at what hes got to do to put this solution into action see hes either got to run along behind itif its mini morris or somethingand hold it off the road you see or hes got to get wrecking truck to follow him with the hind wheels pulled up dont you see or hes got to hire helicopter see or hes got to put on some kids roller skates on platform with building jack on top of them you know this thing isthis thing is crazy see well look at the number of frailties in any solution that he gets there see you get an irrational solution it is very difficult to maintain so the helicopter pilot has cold you see and cant come that day dont you see any one of these pointsbecause weve added more points to the solution so therefore we have added more points of frailty to the solution and it is harder and harder to maintain so the rule is the more irrational solution is the harder it is to maintain and this would not bethis would not be legitimate as comment unless it were borne out in actual practice and application and it is borne out in actual practice and application the way madman works at staying mad is absolutely fabulous he sweats over it man hes in there twentyfour hours day keeping himself good and mad see its marvelous he works at it hell once in while catch himself out being slightly sane about something and youll just see him grab for it and put it all back in the madness range see clank you can observe this in action now thatslets take psychosisusing dirty word the slightslighter manifestation of it neurosis theyre very hard to maintain its irrational and the only requisite to unsettle it is of course communication if youre trying to pull pole out from underneath skylight to close the skylight you had better have an adequate means of grasping the pole to give it pull in other words there has got to be contact here of some kind or another probably one of the reasons why they were incapable of observing thistheyre mad themselves of courseone of the reasons why the observation was never made may have been that they got all involved in trying to make the first contacttrying to get communication through or in in order to begin an unsettling process and you would very easily have so much trouble with this one point youd just have so much trouble with this one point of trying to communicate on this subject or about this thing that you might then entirely forget the fact that if you could unsettling the neurosis or psychosis or loopiness or worries of the individual was dead simple see you could have so much trouble trying to talk to joe that youd totally lose grasp of the simplicity of what was wrong with joe see so youd skipyoud skip that and youd put all of yourall of your time and energy here on this basis of trying to contact joe see now you could become so frantic you see given the fact that well he thinks theres alligators in the corners of the room dont you see and you know that if you could just ask him what this waswhat this solved or something like this itd all fall down like house of cards and the alligators would fall out of the corners of the room and that would be the end of that see given that see the reason you dont observe this is because you seldom get to such person with communication in order to disabuse him of this idea see and pull the props out from underneath this idea so you could get so frantic over here trying to communicate to joe you could get so driven through your own skull that you become frantic on the subject of communication and psychotherapy would then park on this basis of communication and the franticness of trying to communicate would bring about more and more brutal means of communication until you get modern psychiatry see they take an operation developed by adolf hitler less and his very expert medicos of the third reichthe prefrontal lobotomy which was developed to make slavesmake farm slaves take undesirable nationalities who were not the super race you knowhe did eight hundred thousand of them interesting round figure had himself lot of farm slave labor now how this ever got to be psychotherapy i myself am absolutely gasping about and i pursued this one day and i asked very searching questions on how it did and it turns out that there was blacksmiths assistant in bavaria this always happens in bavaria if you know there are ghosts or werewolves they always put it somewhere over there and old american weekly if you want to go back half century and look at its files everything always happened in that corner of the world well this one happened there too and it seems like this blacksmiths assistant was standing by the forge when the forge blew up now the fellow was kind of an idiot and the forge blew up and crowbar about an inch in diameter and very long was driven through his skull from one temple to the other temple and completely severed his prefrontal lobes now you can go on and wait for the rest of the story just like i did theonly rest of the story is he didnt die he didnt suddenly become sane this is not part of the clinical record see he didnt become sane he didnt regain speech he didnt become president nothing happened here that was astonishing and marvelous and thats the end of the clinical history and you can actually delve deep and endlessly trying to find the rest of this and how this brought about reasoning whereby if you give somebody prefrontal lobotomy he turns sane and you know thats your assumption as to why theyre giving prefrontal lobotomy thats not the psychiatric assumption thats an interesting view isnt it legislature will assume this in passing laws and everybody assumes this we usually say well immediately oh so so you say to yourself writing scripts see like mad oh i understand he was ahe was an idiot and the crowbar went through his skull and immediately he was totally sane and an acceptable member of the society and thats why the youre writing script boy thats part of thethats part of the clinical record at all it isnt even inferred in the clinical record so as far as theyve gotten is just this rationale that if you cut somebodys prefrontal lobes up he doesnt die right then you think im joking but its true thats where the rationale goes im just giving youim not berating psychiatry heh who has to the point here is just this that that is an anxiety of communication the like of which nobody ever thought of see these boys have been totally educated into believing to reach the brain they dont know what theyre talking to thats how far back theyve gotten see so they got to reach this fellow so that means his brain or his thinkingness you see and their irrationality is simply and totally evolved around the one point of we werent able to contact him so we get into this total frenzy of contact we finally reached him huh we finally made result on this blanketyblankblankblank see its against the law to shoot him see but we finally recorded from to his brain b and we produced result he hasnt said anything for days huhhuhhuh you see its as insane solution as insanity but now this is just not for the pleasure of berating psychiatry this is solely and totally to this point i want to bring about to you and givegive you this clarity of understanding of this one point that regardless of the frailty of the neurosis or psychosis the quicksand on which it is built will very fast go awayregardless of that the effort to communicate to the person can assume such baffling forms and shapes can give you so many barriers so many insurmountable barriers that you never do get around to studying whats wrong with the pc you never do get around to there see youre so involved with the outworks of the castle that you never even find out what the shape of the donjon keep is you dont get within arrowshot of the walls actually youre out there with the chevaux defrise and you never get near it your communication effort is where you wind up so just remember that to do anything for an individual requires as its first and primary action communication to that individual and communication from that individual dont then because that is true immediately assume that communication to the individual solves all this is merely step it is the necessary step and you will find where scientology breaks down in the lower levels that it breaks down in the vicinity of effort to communicate to the being thats where it breaks down and thats why youll get some weird and fantastic notions of what you should do for or with somebody thats the zone and area where those appear an inability to communicate to the individual an inability to get the individual to communicate results in frenzy of effort then we get the auditors code being broken we get the pc being overwhelmed we get various actions that are not really capable of bringing about any result at all now we get these things in almost standard practice you see youin other words the whole subject could break down right at that point because thats where every psychotherapy breaks down so theres reason why study such as scientologyeven though it is not psychotherapythere is reason why it shouldnt break down there too and in the individual practitioner theres where it breaks down and thats what youre not able to quite get across to the has the hqs the early hca thats whats hard to get across thats why you have to keep telling them acknowledge acknowledge acknowledge he said something acknowledge thats why you sweat it out keeping those parts of the comm cycle in thats why you work on it because when that disappears then your ability to do anything about the case vanishes see so that one that one is the point of concentration now we know the formulas of communication we know how communication can be built up we know about gradient scales and we know other things in this particular line you should know those things for what they are theyre something youre working with in order to do something with or about the individual and you must continuously and repeatedly follow that particular channel and work along that particular channel see and you mustnt spoil that channel because the moment the channel is spoiledsuch as well you dont give another auditing command youve gotten one accepted and answered maybe you even acknowledged it but then you didnt give the next auditing command see see yet these are really goofy errors see but yet they happen yet they happen because the individual himself in an effort to do something for other people has long since thrown in the sponge few times on the subject of communication well you cant talk to him anyway well theres reasoning with him well theres round round round round round see so that actually doing something for an individual at the lower levels is dependent upon what degree of communication can be entered upon with the individual and if you want to know what makes level thats what makes level see its just the gradient scale of what communication can be entered upon with the individual and the individual who cant have much communication entered in upon of course would be in lower level of activity hed be down there in grade 0 he hadnt been talked to yet see thats in actual fact what makes grades what makes pcs whats the difference of cases and that sort of thing now once you get this first series of shafts through very nicely and youre reaching the individual now the individual is responding to you ah well these other things are house of cards first thing youve got to take up is the goofiest solutions he has for his environment thats about the first thing youve got to find and then we get to what youre trying to do for the individual what youre trying to do for the individual is alleviate his contest with his environment now that he is in contest with his environment of course barriers communication from his environment and youll find he will eventually solve the fact that he is being communicated to by his environment by moving you out of the environment as his auditor that is to say you are longer part of his normal environment and he solves this very very well he says well there are human beings and there are auditors and i wont let human being talk to but i will let an auditor talk to see he starts solving it at rather early stage in his processing this is why any group that has ever been able to help anybody or do anything for them at all eventually assumes an ethereal spiritual height of some kind or another and takes on special status in the society see because the individual is in contest with his environment and if the group communicating to him were part of the environment hed feel like he was being driven around the bend so he just solves the whole problem by moving the group up into very esoteric level see very simple so that you take onto some of your pcs you take on almost holy proportions theyll credit you with all kinds of various facilities and abilities and all of this sort of thing what theyre doing is solving this one point they cant bear to communicate with the environment and youre communicating with them so therefore you cant possibly be part of the environment and then they prove it to themselves by saying these other things you see its interesting that the melbourne inquiry tracks along this way rather consistently and so forth and the people who are attacking the organization the hardest are actually hanging around the neck of the organization rather supernatural atmosphere i told mary sue here some months ago the one thing thats going to come out of the melbourne activity we will be unnatural beings we will be supernatural beings of some kind and yes its gone further and further of course as they run up overts against usknowing very well they shouldnt be running up overts of this particular character seewhy theyre having to remove us further and further out of the real environment you see so the other day very serious discussion took place in the hah court down there on the subject of you see it isnt even trial its just bunch of guys shooting their face off andat vast expense theythey took it up as they werenow youd say well would clear becould you see through clear you know youd say well people could understand discussion along that line but the discussion had gone much further than that much further than that its why did i appear sometimes tall and sometimes short and sometimes broad and sometimes thin and why did clears in general appear this way it was longer question that they appeared this way you see that was not the case in point it was wondering why they did marvelous therefore if you can reach or talk to people when other people cant you immediately will assume some status with the person which is quite different than from any other status he has any knowledge of he will put you into some status or another which is quite pedestaled and quite out of this world you might say because it proves itself hes in contest with his environment hes having trouble with his environment all over the place and hes not having trouble with you so therefore you cant be part of the environment i mean thats all there is to that see he solves the problem very nicely this is the common solution to that well it isnt even worth doing anything about thats the way the thing rides you see i would never pander to it or aid and abet it particularly but at the same time if your communication line depends upon his ideas of you i would not sit around now and use the fact that i could talk to him to clarify his opinion of see i would use the time and ability to talk to him to pull the props out from underneath few of these flimsy structures that are called neuroses or oddball ideas or something see thats the time i would use i wouldnt get into an endless discussion with him about whether i were sometimes large or sometimes small or had come to him in the middle of the night and given him an auditing command i wouldntwouldnt bother i just would not discuss it id say well all right thats fine i wouldnt even jump in and say do you think other people come to you in the middle of the night id understand what he was trying to communicate to hes trying to communicate to that he was in communication with was not in communication with other people so therefore i wasnt other people that was all he was trying to communicate to see i wouldnt use this as symptom at all or wouldnt even rack it up as part of his symptoms see id get very much more interested in those things he was in contest with and thats what youve got to handle thats what youve got to handle what is he in contest with thats real to him now get your communication line in and then handle that now just getting your communication line in is more of trick than any field of mental healing psychotherapy spiritualism or religion has ever been able to uniformly accomplish you see that they cant uniformly accomplish that some priest walking around in circles talking about these heretics and so forth is simply saying there are some joes around that i cant get next to i cant communicate to them see his failures of communication are what weigh him down now weve pretty well solved this business of the communication to the individual given half chance at all we can communicate to the individual see there are various well weve developed many methods which we longer talk about anymore theres communication by mimicry by knowing the communication formula in full you can of course introduce the various factors of the communication formula into your communication with the individual so your communication with the individual is not dependent on merely saying something to the individual see you ever want to put kid in good humor and so forthhe accidentally wiggles his nose wiggle your nose and he bobs his head and you bob your head and the next thing you know why hes in high old time man hes in marvelous state you havent said word its mimicry just nothing but mimicry all the way through well you can even talk to raving madman along this particular subject line so youre using various parts of the communication formula as they exist in the creation of human ability and in other places in the early works taking those parts apart and understanding what those parts consist of and then realizing that you can use any of those parts or any variation of those parts to bring about communication with the individual and then by using anygradient scalesby using any communication which youve established with the individual to increase your ability to communicate with the individual seemore and more communication better and better seeyou can then get around to doing something for the individual now what fools you is that by your communicating with the individual he gets better theres some part of the environment that hes in communication with and this will of course make him better and so this other thing has this other liability that by doing communication with the individual and by building communication getting the individual into better communication only with you you see you could of course increase his ability to handle his environment and you can bring about better state of mind in the individual and the reason thats fooler is youre still back there in the first step and its almost as much mistake to stop there dont you see or to use that as it would be to go into frantic state trying to communicate with the individual in other words saybe frantic about trying to communicate with the individual so i finally communicated with him i hit him with club see see i finally i communicated with him i hit him see well its just asjust almost as much mistake as just saying well ive done something for him because i now communicated with him dont you see youre now using communication as the endall its just channel and what the fooler there is he really is better see hes really bit better off dont you see and he is so much better off when he is with you or around you that you eventually wont believe hes still daffy around other people and therefore you become very hard to convince along this particular line and you lay in big problem for yourself here you can longer see that this fellow is showing any nuttiness and you say well weve cured his oddball battinesses and so forth yes he doesnt exhibit any of them around you just around other people as before see you can get into an odd ridge here well just recognize where you sit with relationship to the case and it solves the thing see now here you are communicating to this individual see youve got past the frantic point and you built it up and that sort of thing and youre not going to make the mistake of saying ive cured him because i can now talk to him youve got yourself merely set up to do something for the case thats as far as youve gone you havent gone any further than that and dont kid yourself that you have or you will have some singular losses in processing you will have some very singular losses in processing sooner or later you will get into some kind of state of beautiful comfort with regard to some bird and he goes home and slaughters the whole family see you say but what happened youhe seemed so calm yeah around you in the first place because you could communicate it to him you werent part of the environment therefore you were some special type of being you were in an esoteric relationship to him you probably didnt use this on command basis or an overwhelm and he wasnt any saner elsewhere than he ever had been but in your vicinity he manifested sanity see sort of christ manifestation occurs you know you appear all is calm see well dont forget after you disappear all goes to pieces too see that can also happen so that will happen to you and you will say what in the name of common sense occurred you end the fellows intensive and he was just fine at the end of the intensive and week later you see he shoots cop or something something wild occurred here well just recognize your relationship to the individual is special and communication with the individual is not an endall of processing that is simply the beginning that is all there is nothing more to that so all right given communication with the individual now what now what we say oh well that wasthats been such big psychotherapy problem how do you communicate to the individual and that sort of thing you mean you do something with it i meanyou mean you go somefrom here yeah theres where you start see now you start to do something for the individual see now this requires this next piece of understanding which ive already given you that the individual is in contest with his environment and he is using very very nutty solutions indeed with regard to his environment and he is using thesehe is using these nutty solutions for just one particular and continuous reason because hes in contest with his environment and therefore his environment looks very very dangerous to him and thats the whole lot well how do you enter on upon all this how do you start this how does this occur how do you undermine all of these nutty solutions and let them fall down how do you go about it well of course you cant go about it at all if you dont have communication channel you must have communication channel now go to work youve got to find out now the dangerous things that are in his environment the menaceful things that are in his environment and the solutions hes using to combat and contest these various things and in actual fact you shouldnt really use to too great degree problems and solutions this is something thats very okay for the very very beginning of the case but you go too long along this direction youre going to get in trouble because these are gpmsproblemssolutions solutions are gpms thats part of the reactive bank and thats restimulable all of that is restimulable and as sober fact that isnt the basis of his activities with his environment at all its not problems and his solutions to them its what he does to solve them that keeps him obsessed and pinned in against them you must immediately and directly assume of course that if an individual has problem hes going to do something about it how do you know that you havent gotten present time problem of pc now thats the oldest one you know of thats the oldest one you know of how do you know that you havent done anything for the pc present time problem youre processing present time problem how do you know right away that you havent handled present time problem theres one therejust like that hes going to do something about it the pc who leans back suddenly in the session and says all right well i understand that now i really havent got problem with the dentist im going to soandso and soandso and see dr jones all right i have that all settled now and we can go on with oh bull you havent settled the present time problem you havent handled the present time problem and thats something auditors have known for years and years and years and years and years thats an old old old one see if you havent handled the ptp at the beginning of session the pc is going to do something about it and thats the biggest index that you have that is the biggest index that you have hes going to do something about it so there it is now the whole contest then that you are up against is to find out what is the individual continuously and perpetually doing as in his environment and it falls under the heading of ow it doesnt fall under the heading of problems and solutions at all itd fall under the heading of ow because the more he does about this thing hes obsessed about the more hes going to get stuck in it and the more hes going to get obsessed with it what brings aboutwhat brings about undue concentration upon subject what brings about his absolute conviction that he has this tremendous contest with this environment what brings about this absolute conviction its because hes doing something about it all the time how do you unpin somebody from worrying about the united nations guy goes around all the time hes worrying about the united nations you finally find out that the reason he wears green hat is because the united nations flag is blue or something see something wild here and this is the genus of all this well how come hes so pinned in to the united nations well he must be doing something odd as it may seem he must be doing something to the united nations or about the united nations every few time intervals and it must be something real or actual it might dwindle down to the level of critical thought dont you see but hes been active in this particular direction and you dont have to go into other lifetimesits this one the real problems exist in this lifetime you dont have to go very far adrift to unpin these things actually theyre so simple to unpin that its wonder to that anybody had any trouble unpinning them theyre quite laughable but the secret of it is ow you see he himself is mucking up his communication with the environment because his communication is series of overts so therefore he better not communicate with his environment because its an overt against the environment so therefore he better have some kind of wild solution so that he wont have to communicate with his environment and it isnt that it all comes down to communication it just happens to be riding on the communication channel which is what broke down his communication with his environment see he can longer recognize what part of his environment hes in communication with he cant tell he doesnt know whats there he put up screen long time ago against tigers and hes never been brave enough to take the screen down since and hes now forgotten whats behind it but hes fighting something in that direction he knows he has to keep fighting in that direction hes not sure why he has to keep fighting in that direction but he just knows he has to and his method of fighting in that direction may take innumerable forms such as never looking in that direction never looking in that direction oh lets find fellow whose head is swiveled over to the side and he has chronic arthritis of the neck and he cant look to the left how come his neck is swiveled over this way see that seems to be an odd way to carry body and particularly and peculiarly odd you see because hes even used calcium deposits to cement in the vertebrae so that he cant turn it over how come hes doing this now if youre in communication with the individual you have the possibility of finding out you can bunt and punch around you eventually will find out on various channels and so forth that hes liable to commit some other solution some other action hes liable to do some other overt if he looked to the left i would eventually recognize that somebody who was never paying any attention to the left side of anything had something there that he was doing something to or about you may even find out its his wife hes stuck in the marriage ceremony or something see thats right you may find some weird things may find hes got ghost relative in the room or may find all kinds of odd things about this fellow but hes doing something now the reason he does lowlevel overts on various dynamics is because hes afraid hell do highlevel overts on the various dynamics and his reactive bank is so manufactured that the one thing thetan gets in trouble doing is committing overts and the wholewell id say better than fifty percentof the reactive bank is tailormade to force him to commit overts see so here is being whose sanity depends actually on not committing overts who has reactive bank which forces him to commit overts and i think this is probably the basic mechanism of enslavement of the thetan pinning him down trapping him and so on is probably thei would say not positively but probablythe grander plan of the trap see youre just continuously athese people just people mustevery piece of their reactivity is driving them to commit overts and they mustntthey just mustnt and the broader angle is is even if he didnt have bank hed get into trouble committing overts because it violates the communication formula and communication formula is above the reactive bank so this gives us two mechanisms which are above the reactive bank one is the communication formula and the other is ow now that puts somebody who is early on in processing in the drivers seat because hes got two things that are superior to all the aberration the pc packs in one fell swoop hes got all of it ow is one of the frail spots of auditors i must say that with some regret but it is true its frailty in lot of auditors well youd naturally get the perpetuators of any given trap spreading around lot of propaganda about the invasion of privacy and about the this and about how it wasnt nice and how people were entitled to hold their withholds and you get all kinds of wild propaganda going on on this particular line see if people are crazy along this line in general then you can be sure theres lot of crazy propaganda on the same subject so you get men that ought to know better leaping about talking about lie detectors and all of this kind of thing you get whole government rising up and seizing an organizations emeters see its nuttiness see if you dont think theyre nutty why look at the facts of the case you see well they turn them right over to the war department and they investigate them up at walter reed and theyre very grateful for the thing but theyre not even sane enough to pat us on the back you see and give us couple of quick bucks for the patent rights you see but if theyve seized them you see this makes it somehow all right this is craziness see its craziness at work where would you expect to find the most craziness at the door to sanity youd find out that the greatest amount of barricade would be along that chain that channel see and if youif you look over any group of auditors great many of them unfortunately will fringe by not very positively but theyll sort of fringe by this invasion of privacy and so forth they wont really sit there and clean that needle you know they just wont sweat at it you know well their reticence along this line comes from their fear quite naturally of breaking their communication channel with the pc and theyre afraid theyll break this communication channel so therefore they dont press home the therapy in other words they preserve the communication channel but arrive at nowhere because of its preservation so anxious to preserve it that they never do anything with it so they well very oftenim not running down all auditorsive just noticed in training auditors that this is point we have to get them over and there are many right here that weve gotten over this point but its point that people hit and that they have to be gotten over thats where it breaks down they say all right this individual is worry worry worry worry figure figure figure think think think think think obsess obsess obsess is he i dont know hes just ruhruhthuhthuhthuh on this one subject you know green horses or something i dont know instructors something else unreal see and the individual just goes on on on on on on on over the rest of this thing see and the auditor says all right have you done anything well obviously the guy must have done something or he wouldnt be pinned in see thats the part of the equation you may notsome people have not totally looked at that in order to be pinned in on something he must have done something to it see because there isnt any way anything could get in communication with thetan in the first place you want to solve problem man theres nice problem for you how does anybody ever get in communication with thetan of course its impossible the origination must have been original with the thetan why hes invisible you couldnt even find him he doesnt even really natively have any location in spacenothing so he must have originated and that must be the basis of the do and thats how he gets pinned into anything and he can get it all disguised so that its impossible for him to understand how hes pinned in which iswhich is quite remarkable and he tries to unpin himself with obsessive do hes got to do do do do do do to unpin himself and boy anybody will fall for this i catch myself by the scruff of the neck every once in while well if i just wrote up couple of letters it would straighten it all out then of course i know ill go ahead write couple letters straighten this out this points worrying one way or the other ill write the couple letters then i find out i have to write another letter see you know i have to write another letter to straighten that out and then i think well maybe itll be good idea if i just wrote four or five more you see and straighten that out and that particular then i suddenly realize what i am doing this is why im worrying about it its because im writing letters about it see simple see realize that and all of sudden cease to worry about it bang its gone see so anybody even when he knows the mechanism can be caught in the same mechanism because its the basic mechanism of entrapment there is more subtle mechanism of entrapment than that thats the lot so this is what you must realize about this thetan that it isntwe sit down with the thetan and were processing him and we say oh well what have youwhat have you done to an instructor and well nothing really audience god iii listened impertinently when he said good morning see all right good now what have you done to an instructor you see nothing really nothing really but i thought they were awfully wrong when they chopped all up and they did this and they did that and they did the rurur motivator motivator motivator motivator and the auditor says fine and asks the next question not having gotten his question answered now right there in the mechanism of the session you see hes pinned him in tighter he bought motivator he pinned him in tighter do you see that it isnt whether or not its social or not social it isnt anything else its just good sense technically see and they dont want to break their communication channel or their feeling of rapport being simpatico with the pc you see by being challenging where as matter of fact theyd be far better friend of the pc itd be much more honest thing all right thats all very well but now what the hell have you done to an instructor thats got you this worried oh well you put it that way i well well backing out of the parking lot and hit his car the other night didnt tell him about it he hasnt found out the fenders dented yet see right away bang the guys unpinned see because he goes throughhe goes through the action ofhe does something not necessarily intentional he does something and then he does something to justify having done this thing and then he does something to justify what he has done by this time hes getting pretty pinned in and he keeps on trying to do this thing and then he eventually will be physically batting away from this thing as though hes trying to push himself off wall see and the next thing he does he does the only thing left to himhe blows he has to leave physically or he has to do something else physically well if he cant leave physically he has dwindling gradient of the things he can leave physically by not leaving physically you know you can leave physically all right but how do you leave without leaving physically well one of the waysyou could become groggy see you could become less alert you could show people that it was wrong of them to have you there see you could show that you were pinned from leaving you see by developing bad spine so that you couldnt walk see all kinds of wild solutions now these are the solutions that im talking about the individual cant leave the universe physically so he tends to pile up all these solutions you get married and you cant part company easily and stay in the marriage but then leave the marriage but not physically see cant leave the marriage physically because thatd be too irresponsible see so you leave the marriage now if you want to see something complicated its the number of ways thetan can leave without shoving off physically and practically psychotherapy is just study of that you can go down into making people sorry that they didnt let you leave dont you see you can make them guilty of having put you in situation where you couldnt leave by in your turn appearing so nastythats wild pitch isnt it well they all have wild curve on them like this you seeby appearing so nasty to everybody when you were so happy before see its not necessarily an unimaginative set of factors see but the basis on which theyre based is very very simple theres veryvery little to this basis basis is the individual commits an overt intentionally or unintentionally he commits some other overts and he goes whole gamut of commission of actions he never really stops committing actions but now he commits them with negative reason he commits them in order to get out of there if he cant leave at all now he has whole bunch of solutions that go downhill from that point i mean you just get the wildest things and its really study of assertive thereness right on down to notthereness and sort of gradient scale of these two factors involved and all of thisall of this being on communication channels and being like communication channel requires communication of some kind or another to resolve but weve got this factor of the regretted action or the regretted reach or something like this we got this factor and weve got the factor of the communication formula both of them superior to the reactive bank now the reactive bank boobytraps this to some degree communication is mirrored in the reactive bank there isnt any word overt in the reactive bank that i know of at this time but the whole thing is just study of overts from beginning to end the word withhold is definitely in there and its in there so often that we must really cease to use it too restimulable too restimulated the pc would get if you continued to use it substitute for it and youll find out it actually works better what he didnt say see what have you done what havent you said what have you done what havent you thought what have you d see what action have you taken and what action havent you done dont you see just play both sides of the coin understand the principle rather than get the parrot rating see and the word withhold although we have it around and although we wouldnt be able to root it out of our technology actually couldntcan remain in the technology but not in an auditing command because it restimulates the pc and you get false ta youre moving banks around and youre getting false ta on the thing its just bank discharge is all youre getting youre actually not doing anything and its really not bank discharge its tone arm action being occasioned by gpm coming in and it eventually will freeze up i know that makes it sound grim but youre perfectly safe as long as you just dont use that word withhold it wont happen you can say what havent you said youll find out that youll have ball with that thats gorgeous you could even sort out the thing said thought acted not acted what action havent you taken you could sort the thing out see and get the fellow right where he lived and by building up from that point free him on innumerable points and knock out whole bunch of these weird nonsenses but of course you realize that you cant do that easily unless youre in good communication with the individual now one of the principal factors that you bat your head against then in case is the inability of case to admit any action or take any responsibility for action if case can take responsibility of any kind for any action ever committed that case is committed forever to the deep there isnt anything you could ever do for that case hes just buried in the fivemile philippine deep and that is the end of that but you understand ive said take responsibility for any action he has ever done im not now talking about an overt act see dont interpret it from that line and youve got it pretty well won but thats the lost soul the lost soul who is being shredded between the worlds with soundless wail is the person who can take responsibility for any action he has ever done and that is statement of exactly where case ceases to be within range of assistance this makes those things you cant talk to pretty irresponsible doesnt it well they are i can imagine conversation if you could achieve one with spider the tremendous importance of the spider the fantastic putuponness of the spider and the utter irresponsibility of every action the spider takes and undertakes would be something that would drop your jaw the inability to communicate goes along with the irresponsibility for actions see thats an index those two things go straight together as the ability to communicate drops out responsibility for actions as factor falls as responsibility for actions as factor falls ability to communicate falls now dont come around and write despatch sometime and ask how to cure stutterer thats deteriorated zone of communications it doesnt mean that theres anything fabulously in error about this individual it does mean that there is some zone or area of an irresponsibility because those two factors rise and fall alongside of each other they dont go on scale like the scale of justice they go up in pair of elevators responsibility for ones own actions rise ability to communicate rises responsibility for ones own actions fall communication falls there they are they ride side by side and joe spider out here in the garden an examination of his responsibility for why hes in the garden and for what hes doing and if you could get hearttoheart talk with him which of course you cant because of this other factori wont say that you cant maybe some of you someday willthis birds not talking doesnt even make noise but yet his concept of responsibility would be utterly fantastic everything is all done actually the reason he spins webshe can actually see himself spinning webs and has very detached viewpoint if he can see himself at all and its mechanism that was laid into him by god and he does this because of compulsion that was handed him you see at this time and the flies that get into the web are driven in there by some guardian spirit of spiders you see that had battle in valhalla with the wahfwahf and thats why they are destroyed and the reason they are consumed is to keep the garden clean for jubbub whos that well i dont know you find out that spider is not doing confounded blasted thing he doesnt spin he doesnt eat he doesnt do anything hes model of nothing and he cant talk see he cant deliver any lectures on the subject of spiders you see this you see this as factor now think of thisthink of this when you see madman x leaping about in padded cell covered with his own filth and that sort of thing and gibbering and yapping and somebody says to you well if you really knew anything about the mind i dont know why they put this up see well thats the same mechanism at work in another line see if you really knew anything about the mind why you could do something for that madman in there take look at it of course they want you if possible to commit an overt against that madman then theyve got you see but there you are looking athere youre looking at the factor how mad is this man this is the first question you would ask how mad is this man well this man happens to be as mad as you can get into communication with himas you cant get into communication with him its an inverse ratio of course in that particular instance he canthe cant make any sense he doesnt pay any attention to you and so forth well hes pretty mad first thing youd have to do would be to build up communication factor across the fact of responsibility at all thats quite trick but you could build it up with mimicry you could build it up in various ways you could build it up by timed hello every day you come by and say hello thats all just one hed eventually be over at the bars saying hello might be six months you see but hed eventually get at this and providing of course that somebody else didnt do something gruesome to him in the meantime why he wouldhe would eventually be able to recognize that you were different from the rest of the environment you see hed work it out here somehow or another and hed eventually start responding to you and that sort of thing and then youd have to find something that he did something that he had done something he really knew hed done something he could take responsibility for and just expand that perimeter and you would return his sanity there is more complication in the basic theory than that there arent exceptions to this basic theory where the exceptions come in is how in the name of god you eventually bring this fellow about to talk to you the gradient you have to run in order to get this individual into communication with you how you put it to himhow you put it to him that you want to find out what he has taken responsibility for in his environment these are the factors that require genius see theres bit of genius mixed up in this man youve got to think on your feet this individual starts to go that way you got to round him up and head him off and bring him back again you see you say all right now what part of your life did you like best oh your early teens all right all right now what did you most enjoy doing in your early teens see you got it right there see he can answer thatquestion if you can find that question to ask answer that question up she starts going see and then some nuttinesses start chipping off because his ability to observe what his environment is and so forth will again pick up hes less in contest with that environment you see youve made an inroad on it even though he considers you plaster angel that has descended just to assist him regardless of that he has nevertheless made crack in the environment so responsibility for own actions doesnt then merely mean overt actions it just means actions of any kind what can he do that hed take responsibility for the worse off an individual is the less responsibility he can take for anything but the genius required is where do we hit this case to pick up its zone of responsibility and those cases that are having rough time of course we hit them around here at very high level with such as something like this well now what have you done that you know confounded cottonpicking well you shouldnt ought of been doing that you can take responsibility for see thats more or less in that line what have you done around here that you really know youve done bud ah well awawawawawa and then all of sudden the guy will hit something and it breaks you see he starts to straighten out in this direction but recognize that is fairly high level of action it pays you the compliment of considering youre sanecan take responsibility but that your wheels were slipping for while see thats thebut thats high level of action have you done anything today that you know you yourself did lets get this level of action now oh thats another level of action isnt it all right now theres an undercut where have you been today that you know you have been thats done by reason of placement lets work up gradient scale to where the guy decided to be someplace and was there see lets work it up on the basis of responsibility for placement of self not even contest with the environment you see there are various ramifications here that you can work on theres various gradients but this is not really the principle of this lecture its just this youve got these two factors communicationand even though thats in the bank the formulas of communication are superior to the reactive bankand youve got the idea of responsibility for own action and responsibility may or may not be part of the reactive bank and it just wouldnt matter if it was or wasnt the truth of the matter is it exists as superior to the bank responsibility for own actions which is the very woof and warp of being thetan can you decide to do something and do it can you be somewhere can you be out of somewhere at will these are the abilities of thetan and if you cant do those things then youre slipping so where do you start somebody in to get those things done and thats very important question so youve got two factors here which are superior to the reactive bank which are superior to this universe and which are native to thetan now ive always said that the overt actmotivator sequence was not necessarily true it isnt necessarily true it isnt true but it fades out in terms of consideration higher than any other consideration it goes higher and is still truth after other things have become lies before it becomes lie do you understand its pretty high these two factors ride right together and it gives you all levels of processing from iv on down and it gives you all levels of eases now how many ways you can go about doing this how many processes you can adapt into this how many systems as they exist in scientology right this minute to achieve communication with the individual how many systems exist after you get through to pull the rocks out from underneath some daffy consideration daffy considerationthats obviously married up to the fact that its the individuals doing something that is daffy see those things will fall apart very easily to the degree that the individual can accept doing something and if youve got those two factors however many ways there are of getting at those things you have all these lower levels of processing you have all these lower levels of case and there in actual fact is real excuseno real excuse at all for you to be in the dark about why youre not making progress with case because whatever other factors are present see what other factors are present these factors are more present see it may be true that this fellow is so harassed in his marriage that he cant put his mind on anything of the whats he stuck in like that for is your first question not how terrible his environment is well look at how hes stuck into his environment all right where is he stuck into his environment lets get pc just talking one way or the other were asking him in effect hey bud where are you stuck in see what tank trap have you run into that youre still treading your wheels in see youre skidding your treads in see where are you is what were asking now this individual is at his job or hes at home or hes here or hes there but hes being there all the time while hes elsewhere see hes really stuck in you see hes rommel stuck in at tobruk hes so frightened on this front that he never has chance to fight the war see hes stuck in someplace and just with general itsa and that sort of thing you very soon very shortly find out where this individuals stuck in now the burning question is is what responsibility can he take in that zone or areafor his own actions in that zone or area now you frankly dont care at lower level of case whether this individual is answering overts or unsaids or withholds or anything else you just dont care about any of those factors all youre interested in really is responsibility for own actions or responsibility for lack of actions what is he certain he hasnt said that would be very gentle entrance point but of course you couldnt play that out question after question because its an out of arc process youd have to quickly shift on over to the other side of the picture you just get his responsibility for action in that zone or area and all of sudden that house of cards will fall down sometimes it takes quite little while to steer it around steer it around get it more real you know and get better view of the situation all of sudden one will fall out of the hamper and youll find out this individual is not now as obsessively worried about something as he was before now theres one thing that gets in your road as you go over this ground and i will admit to this that theres one thing that gets in your road an individual can have piece of the gpm keyed in to such degree that its driving him half around the bend see at the lower levels youd just better leave it alone at this particular time but i have done something by reading off short list of words that possibly were authoring the condition and seeing if one read and then telling him that was an integral part of the reactive bank that was influencing him and it discharged at that particular moment and he ceased to become obsessively worried thats another root on the same basis see but is not one that you would commonly care to practice and probably is little more dangerous than it is safe if you follow the other one around youll find out itll apply very generally to all cases thats how you crack one of these cases thats how you go about this sort of thing and thats what in essence auditing is about one of the ways you can badger somebody into finally getting off of certain merrygoround is very interesting one too ofid say theres lots of methodology about this very interesting one too you say to him all right what have you done that you really know you have done in that particular zone or area that hes worried about seewhat have you done that you really know youve done in that particular zone and so forth and he tells you wow i know ive done this you see and he comes up and you know the glibness with which he comes up with this thing he really has taken responsibility for it this isthe responsibility factor is lying there like sleeping dog the fellow might tell you glibly but theres responsibility the rebuttal on such thing is to get him to explain to you for some time how he has not really done that cant play it too long because its cut comm line type of approach dont you see but you can actually get him to explain this oh iii busted up the old mans car and ran it off cliff haha all right very good well how didnt you really do that oh well hell let you in on it now and boy theres the most tortuous logic you ever heard of in your life as how he never really did that he took the ear he didnt have permission he was at the wheel of the car he ran it down over the concrete abutment and into the arroyo but somehow or another responsibility see its some kind of solution to this situation you see the responsibility factoryoull just see it you can sit there with your jaw dropped sometimes he didnt really do it he wasnt really in the ear the car just sort of whistled him over and made him sit down in the seat and and then its the old mans fault because the old man never had restrainingfromthecurb thing put on the car that made the wheels turn away from the curb dont you see and its actually the fault of newton for pointing out gravity that made the car go down the arroyo and its pretty wild pretty wild but you get him to explain all this and all of sudden it begins to dawn on him gently that he had something to do with this action and you play around the perimeter of this thing and all of sudden it breaks and the case does tremendous send the reason why you cant run straight ow and get this tremendous send because theyre not really overts the individual has responsibility with them you see you get him to explain how he never did them and we enter lower level of responsibility factor we all used to have it what part of that action could you have been responsible for or could you be responsible for dont you see as direct approach process theres another indirect approach process how didnt you really do it little higher level what reasons did you have for doing that get him to asis all of these things and then dont let him get into state where hes running up more because you are the auditor and hes trying to look good to you certain amount of genius is involved here on the part of the auditor but knowing these factors and playing them one against the other and back and forth and so forth you could bust almost anybody out of these immediate environmental situations which have him doing such weird and wonderful things and so forth and you had to have auditing actually below level iv because youre using two principles which are senior to the mindto all other considerationsfor those lower levels and youll make it and i wish you some success when youre using it thank you audience thank you
