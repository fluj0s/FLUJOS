stabilization of afghanistan is the alliances key task other issues of note under discussi on were new capabilities natos role in the balkans and possible future enlargement of the alliance iraq the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and subs equent efforts to stabilize that country have caused great controversy in the alliance in february 2003 shortly before the war france germany and belgium attempted to block us efforts to provide allied defensive assistance to turkey because they contended that such assistance would be tantamount to acknowledgment that war was necessary and imminent the conflict and ensuing failure to locate wmd sharpened debate among the allies over the degree to which international institutions such as the should be relied upon for political measures such as inspections

for the most part pub lic opinion opposes involvement of national forces in iraq polish officials have expr essed wish to have nato take over polands sector by early 2005 in order to allow wa rsaw to withdraw some of its forces approximately 60 of the polish people oppose their countrys involvement there spanish forces serving under polish command were withdrawn in may 2004 after new government took power in britain prime minister tony blairs public support has plunged over his handling of iraq issues2 several factors account for these reactions some governments believe that the bush administration went to war precipitously w ithout waiting for the results of weapons inspections they predicted that the move would diminish rather than enhance international security the handling of prisone rs by us forces at the abu ghraib prison in iraq in apparent violation of international conve ntions has led to sharp criticism in the european press and condemnati on by some european governments the administrations defense of some interrogation methods at gu antanamo and in iraq has also elicited criticism some officials also state that they do not wish their government to take

that the alliance faces danger of failure there in june 2004 he said that nato has never met force goal in afghanistan he has asserted that ther are 1100 infantry companies 2000 helicopters and 300 transport aircraft in european allied militaries yet fo r afghanistan the allies have not provided the several infant ry companies helicopters and transport aircraft necessary to fulfil isafs mission

the united st ates britain and france have combat forces able to deploy long distances and sustain themselves for extended periods of time at prague the bush administration urged the allies to adopt two initiatives meant to increase deployability7 the administration described the initiatives as test to revitalize the alliance one initiative th nato response force nrf is on schedule the allies wish to develop force of 21000 tr oops maintained in highreadiness status for highintensity conflict and able to reach its destination within 730 days of nato decision to use it the nrf is an inserti on force designed to manage conflict until larger allied force can arrive the for ce now has 6500 troops prima rily european and is to be fully operational in 2006 the other key initiative at the 2002 summit was the prague capabilities commitment pcc the pcc succeeded an earlier capabilities initiative deemed to have had too many unrealistic goals the pcc is slimmed down version with 8 capability goals targeting the allies principal deficiencies the capabilities include strategic lift air and sea aerial refueling precisionguided munitions secure communications ground surveillance systems and special forces at istanbul nato announced that chemicalbiological radiol ogical and nuclear defense battalion has become fully operational fulfilling one of the capability goals however there remain serious shortfalls in aerial refuelers and in strategic lift where pcc goals are unlikely to be met on schedule some g overnments such as the germ an government have pleaded that competing budget necessities such as pension programs are forestalling plans to modernize their militaries the german parliament has also reduced and capped defense expenditures for the next several years8 in the view of some observers these sh ortfalls underscore the absence of political will in some allied governme nts to meet force goals that were recently pledged repercussions of these shortfalls include difficulty in meeting commitments already made such as sending forces to afghanistan the allies have identified afghanistan as their first priority even if more european allies wished to send forces to iraq the ability to deploy combat forces to assist in stabiliz ing that country would be lacking hoop scheffer has proposed that nato discuss po ssible reform in financing missions nato has few jointly held combat assets one such asset is the awacs an aerial early warning and reconnaissance platform hoop sche ffer has proposed that rather than pursue the current practice of each country paying fo r its own forces deployed to theater nato purchase more joint assets that might be assigned by the alliance as whole for an operation were this practice to be followed then all allies contributing to the development of equipment and possibl units would share in the cost9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21864crs5 10 see crs report rs21774 bosnia and the european union military force eufor

bosniahercegovina wish to join partnership for peace but the allies decided that too many hurdles remain before this step can be taken for example in both countries succeeding govern ments have not delivered suspected war criminals to the tribunal in the hague at the summit the allies did not endorse the administrations broader middle east and north africa initiative in winter 2004 th administration had wished to adopt series of measures to promot democracy and human rights in range of countries from the western sahara to afghanistan however some allies and number of muslim states have been reluctant to appr ove program in which outside governments appeared to be instructing middle eastern governments on steps to reform some allies believe that the united states and europe will

defense reform for these states which are in the partnership for peace program conclusion the war in iraq and its aftermath have badly strained the alliance some allies have cast doubt on the administrations leadership public opinion in most allied states is sharply critical of the bush administration for example shortly after september 11 2001 the publics in germany and france respectively had confidence in the united states to deal responsibly with world ffairs at levels of 73 and 53 by ma 2004 those figures had dropped to 22 and 1313 repercussions of tensions over iraq continue to trouble the alliance while most allied governments believe that terrorism and proliferation are serious threats they prefer largely political measures to c ounter those threats they concede that military action may occasionally be necessary however at the same time they note that it will be difficult to persuade their populations to join with the united states in military operations in the near future in part some do not wish their forces to be associated with us forces particularly in the muslim world in the wake of the scandal at the abu ghraib prison some believe that nato operation in iraq would taint the alliance and could result in loss of credibility should the operation fail some also add that much has been lost in iraq in terms of the wests claim that its value system provides moral example to the world in this view the united states until r ecently had provided the core of those values and gave the world worthy example of the wests value system they believe that these values must now be reestablished and that only judicious leadership from washington in iraq and elsewhere can achieve this goal14
