readme file for gridding mark new 2000 tim mitchell 30304 the main program for gridding is quick_interp_tdm2pro this program is based on one of mark news called quick_interppro this program takes as inputs the outputs from anomdtbf90 option 3 see codelinuxcruts and the readme file there the location of these files is identifed as pts_prefix there may be an additional input required of synthetic data to augment sparse grids for secondary variables see the published literature for the reasoning here the synthetic files are in binary format and are identified to the program through synth_prefix both identifiers are only prefixes not full names because the program itself supplies the yearspecific file endingsi use anomfac and synthfac as appropriate use year1 and year2 to specify the range of years to process use out_prefix to specify the location of the output files use dist to specify the correlation decay distance for the climate variable being interpolated necessary information to determine where to add dummy or synthetic data use gs to specify the grid size 05 for halfdegree use dumpbin to dump mark new style to unreadable idl binary files use dumpglo to dump tim mitchell style to glo files suite of processing software for glo files under codelinuxgoglo dont bother with dumpmon use binfac and actfac as appropriate if creating primary variables dont bother with synthetics if creating secondary variables create or find primary variables grid at 25deg resolution and store as idl binary files then use frs_gts_tdmpro rd0_gts_tdmpro vap_gts_anompro to create synthetic grids for the correct variables then use quick_interp_tdm2pro on the secondary variable with synth_prefix supplied to create the new grids bear in mind that there is working synthetic method for cloud because mark new lost the coefficients file and never found it again despite searching on tape archives at uea and never recreated it this hasnt mattered too much because the synthetic cloud grids had not been discarded for 190195 and after 1995 sunshine data is used instead of cloud data anyway to convert the output glo files into the grim formatted files supplied to users 1 convert these landocean files to landonly files using globulkf90 option 1 globulkf90 is under codelinuxgoglo 2 convert the landonly files to grim using rawtogrimf90 codelinuxgrim
