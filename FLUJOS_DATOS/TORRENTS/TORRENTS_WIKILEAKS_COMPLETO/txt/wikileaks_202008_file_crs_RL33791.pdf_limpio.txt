legislative activity summary indexation of the minimum wage linking the minimum wage to an outside economic variable in variety of forms s been subject of discussion at least since the early years of the 20th century when early proponents of wage floor began to consider the matter as public policy within the united states they established series of state wage boards these boards were given the authority to fix reasonable rate below which most workers were not permitted to be paid the powers of the boards varied from one state to the next and where they were reasonably effective there was the constant fear that the courts would intervene and overturn whatever authority the boards may have had the boards wrestled with variety of methods for setting the minimum wage some made surveys of the costofliving for lowwage employees and tried to render measure of equality between such costs however defined and income derived from work but surveys proved difficult and gradually re liance developed upon governmental agencies it was not necessa rily neat fit nd questions remained in 1938 largely moving beyond the state boards congress passed the fair labor standards act the flsa the act established the federal minimum at 25 cents an hour for those relatively few workers ac tually covered si nce 1938 congress has revisited the act in sporadic fashion the result through the years has been series of gradual expansions of the act and some variation in wage rates but generally since the 1960s downward spiral in the r eal value of the minimum wage has set in during the reagan era new increases were made and only two the 1989 and 1996 amendments have been ma in subsequent years at present at least fi ve states missouri m ontana oregon vermont and washington index their state

issue of indexation by gerald mayerpossible indexation of the federal minimum wage evolution of legislative activity part i introduction indexation of the minimum wage was considered some years prior to enactment of the fair labor standards act flsa in 1938 it continues to be an issue of discussion and in some cases at the state vel has been introduced as part of the general minimum wage structure this re port provides an evolutionary history of minimum wage indexation and of the federal legislative interest in the concept in 1937 congress decided that certain lowwage workers should be protected by federal minimum wage law and set in motion initiatives that would evolve into the fair labor standards act of 1938 as amended through the years the flsa has become the primary federal statute dealing with wage rates for lowwage workers as the law now stands the genera l minimum wage is 585 per hour to increase in steps to 725 per hour by july 2009 the federal minimum is fixed by statute and altered whenever there is suffi cient support to do so in congress the result has been fluctuation in the real or inflationadjusted value of the minimum wage it reached its highest level in 1968 and has since inter mittently been allowed to decline in value to reach the 1968 level in real terms the current minimum would need to be slightly in excess of 950 per hour1 in order to eliminate fluctuations in its real value some have suggested that the federal minimum should be pegged to an out side economic variable for example to component of the costofliving index or to some other rela tively neutral series2 matter of philosophy the concept of minimum wage initially was to provide workers with minimum income but how minimal what might be included within minimal standard to whom should not less than the minimum be paid and by whomhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33791crs2 3 john ryan living wage its ethi cal and economic aspects new york the macmillan company 1906 p 324 4

the minimum wage to support themselves and their families but what about women especially those with an employed spouse and young persons yout h workers are certain types of work by definition minimum wage work deserving payment at the minimum wage or below early in the past century some proposed living family saving wage that is to allow for safe and healthful living fo r procreation and for setting aside little for ones old age still there were problems with definitions how safe and how healthful how much procreation one child two or perhaps five or six setting aside little for ones old age may be appropriate but how much living wage and basic sustenance john ryan an early proponent of minimum wage argued in 1906 study that laborers right to living wage is the specific form of his generic right to sufficient of the earths products to affo rd him decent livelihood this right father ryan suggested is as valid as hi s right to life the difference is merely in degree of importance3 later ryan asked rhetorically well what is decent livelihood4 with other scholars of the period ryan was willing to suggest at least modest framework by way of answer if th concept remained vague and perhaps arguable it involved something more than the necessaries which will enable worker to function effectively as an in strument of producti on and further that amount of goods which will enable human being to live as human being rather than as an animal even well fed animal it supposes that he shall have food clothing and shelter sufficient to maintain him and his family in health and that they shall have the means of some recreation it means the requisites of religious and moral life it means also some opportunities for intellectual development some readin g matter and at least an elementary education for the children in general therefore it comprises an elementary degree of physical mental moral relig ious social and recreational welfare but then ryan added when the concept is presented in terms of money men naturally differ considerab ly one from the other and yet whenever the thing has been systematically undertaken men have been able to come to an agreement5 other scholars seemed equally sure differences of opinion may develop over the concrete question of how much in any given case this wage must be observed economist henry r seager in 1918 but the principle

in 1890 the consumers league of the c ity of new york was established and quickly blossomed into the national consumers league7 its general purpose was social uplift through the next several years league representatives began systematic exploration of the plight of lowwage workers attempting to connect an inadequate wage with malnutrition and vice gradually attention came to focus upon the minimum wage in 1911 massachusetts became the first state to move for adoption of minimum rate the campaign then spread to oregon wisconsin minnesota california and other states the experiment was new to the united st ates though it had been tried elsewhere after considerable discussion wage board approach was taken speaking generally because there were differences among the st ates and in some states other processes were utilized the board would examine an industry and if it found that significant body of workers was being paid less than what was considered minimal new standard might be adopted in one case massachusetts the penalty was moral suasion publicity concerning the failure to pay minimum wage the purpose of the boards was to increas the general standard and then to maintain the value of the minimum wage at constant level or at least at level in keeping with the costofliving as one advocate stated none of the american boards ever arrived at the intelligent arrangements achieved by some of the british trade boards of pegging the rate at given period by providing for its automatic increase and decrease with variation in the costofliving index number8 nonetheless the costofliving connecti on was very real presence throughout during the early years of the minimum wage movement there was always the threat that statute would be declared unconstitutional in the spring

calculation and the wage board approach for covered workers relatively few in number mostly industrial workers the basic rate was 25 cen ts an hour to rise in steps to 40 cents an hour seven years

concerns during 1937 and 1938 when the future fl sa was under consideration by the congress tensions arose that kept the bill from being enacted in its initial form speaking generally compromise was developed that allowed the several parties to claim victory in the negotiations the north ern states would have preferred higher wage 40 cents an hour the south agreed to settle for 25 cents an hour leading up to 40 cents some years later representative mary norton dnj then chair of the committee on labor argued that bill of this kind is very necessary if we are going to help the underpaid worker

the factors in your mind th at would determine minimumwage rate norton replied first of all the high cost of living the dialogue continued mr mcconnell what kind of cost of living would you consider the cost of living for the entire country or the cost of living in certain section mrs norton it is the cost of living for those people who are unorganized and have other method of having their wages raised mcconnell continued to press for specifics you are definite then in your opinion that the minimum wage is to be based on the cost of living and you will stand by that mrs norton opined yes sir i belie ve that should defin itely be considered mcconnell continued mr mcconnell what i am getting at is i would like to get costof living index and fluctuate the minimum wa ges to that costofliving index rather than relying on some political drive every so often to change it mrs norton how could you do that it would mean you would have to come to congress every couple of months to decide mr mcconnell not come to congress at all i would set up formula in the nature of ratio that would fluctuate minimumwage rates according to the cost of living if we assume that is the way we are going to fix our minimumwage rates then we would have automatic fluctuati ons according to the change in the cost of living at different periods mrs norton agreed i would be willin g to go along with that mcconnell concurred i am assuming we would set it correctly in th beginning and then there would be an automatic fluctuation according to the cost of living if we are working on the assumption that the minimum wage rate is to be determined by the costof living index or by the cost of living mcconnell stated any wa you want to say it that is the way it would be handled then he added i have not

was based on wages on general average wages as determined by the bureau of labor statistics say something like 60 percent15 taft had calculated the impact of 75 cent minimum you might have to vary it in different types of i ndustries he said what would you think of minimum wage based on that theory sixty percent of the average wages in the field i would think you would have to have broa d fields tobin queried take for example shoes and establish th minimum taft continued manufacturing and perhaps service industr ies and perhaps mining that might be separate but roughly speaking i th ink you probably would not need mining what would you think of such plan it seems to that is what we want to do we want to say that anybody in an industry ought to be able to make certain percentage of the average even though he is inefficient or the i ndustry is inefficient or anything else and 60 perc ent roughly speaking seems to be the present thing in the manufacturing field what would you think of such an escalator clause taft may have caught tobin offguard secretary tobin i would like to illustrate by taking for example the breakdown of any given classification of skill take shoes there is great wide range of minimum wages for shoe cutters over the country you get breakdown of mens work shoes high grade finished shoes et cetera senator taft we have this legislative problem we have 75cent figure here is 40cent figure when it once gets into the law it is pretty much frozen you have these variations in your industries that is all right however as basic figure in the law instead of having to change the amount every other year to fit into ch anging conditions could we not find formula based on the average wages paid to all american workers or something of that kind secretary tobin i would want to c onsider that i couldnt give you an answer immediately senator taft i wish you would because i think it is possible legislative out here secretary tobin under such an arra

factory wage is 138 an hour 60 pe rcent of that would come out to 824 cents an hour senator taft that is factory service would be somewhat lower secretary tobin service employ ees would be substantially lower senator taft urged the secretary to think it over and to give us your views on it later tobin agreed that he would do so taft concluded that the average wage cost was more appropriate than the cost of living16 reports and amendments 1949 there has been advised represen tative brooks hays dar in 1949 considerable interest in the socalle d flexibility feature of the minimumwage legislation he noted the dispute as to whether the appropriate minima was 75 cents or 65 cents or some other amount but he dded in any event it seems to that it should be governed by the cost of living hays continued if we had had such provision ie cost of living formulation when the 1938 act was adopted we would now have minimum of around 54 cents on one formula or 65 cents on another formula nd we would be spared this unfortunate controversy as to whether or not it is to go to 75 cents he then turned to study by gustav peck of the legislative reference service now crs the question of flexibl statutory minimum wage peck hays stated has assembled all of the argume nts pro and for tying the minimum wage to the cost of living index he suggested that pecks study would be of pa rticular interest to members who favor the principle of fl exibility in minimumwage legislation17 the peck report characteristic of all wages in progressive society is their flexibility peck commenced wages go up and down at different times in response to changes in the labor market s ituation to changes in productivity and job content to relative bargaining power to cy clical influences and to changes in the cost of living peck continued rise or fall in the cost of living chan ges the substance of statutory minimum wage more than such rise or fall affects other wages because contract or competitive wages generally reflect change s in the cost of living while legal minimum wage can not be changed at all except by action of the legislature or in the case of wageboard determinations only after timeconsuming procedures18 congress had resisted attempts to raise the minimum wage and even during the 79th and 80th congresses postwar congresses efforts to raise the 40cent

question pp 1516 25 peck notes the question p 18 that frequently changing minimum wage is very difficult to administer that it takes tim to get across to all employers what their obligations are could make compliance and enforcement more difficultdied of inaction19 labor spokesmen had sought flexibility but always upward first they called for general revision of the minimum to make the act more realistic second they proposed inser tion of an escalator in any new law20 arguments in support of revision of the minimum wage he stated include increases in the cost of living increases in actual minimum wages in industry increases in profits and ab ility to pay and general increases in productivity generally the costofliving was regarded as the most important determinant of proper statutory minimum further some ar gued if prices should decline then there should be some provision in any new act to reduce the minimum wage with reductions in prices and the cost of liv ing or reductions in average wages21 under the 1938 statute limited wage board had been created22 some argued however that board might not be able to move any more quickly than congress to increase the minimum wage for board there would likely be delay of recognition of changed situation delay of factfindi ng and hearings and delay of issuing revised orders thus throughout the late 1930s and during the war years the problem of statutory minimum wages remained one of catching up with the realities of increasing prices and the cost of living peck continued the wage board technique at least as employed in the states is not complete answer to the flexibility probl em because these laws were written with the express intent of raising minimum wages above the levels then being paid even though it might be possible under the terms of some of the laws to make findings which would requi re downward adjustments of the minimum wage such adjustments have ever been made23 inflexible costs he stated could produce contraction of industry and employment and end in the midst of real depression24 he seemed to suggest that if wage rates could move either up or down real flexibility then indexation might be worth trying so long as the timing was right and changes in the rate were not precipitous25 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33791crs9 26 congressional record april 14 1949 p 4627 27 congressional record july 27

receive sufficient funds for his labor to provide h im with rudimentary standards of decency we will have reached our objective29 representative adolph sabath dil challenged the great stress that lucas has placed on the slidingscale provision of his proposed substitute which would mean nothing but uncertainty and confusion30 at this point lucas introduced his substitute which among other things provided for minimum wage of 65 cents an hour with indexation to follow31 there seemed dispute among constituen cies all employee groups so far as i know favor the fixed rather than th flexible minimum stated representative kenneth keating rny so far as i re member not single employer has voiced preference for the sliding minimum32 representative jacob javits rny was similarly disposed when we are fixing minimum wage and concrete floor it must be fixed figure and it should not vary with the costofliving index33 representative charles bennett dfl was in some measure prescient he stated

the flexib minimum wage provision was defeated35 the ellender amendment 1949 senator allen ellender dla proposed his own addition to lucaslesinski debate36 elected to the senate in 1936 he recalled the turbulence that had marked the depression era and the war years and observed the fact is that 10 year s of experience under the flsa are virtually worthless as measuring stick of the probable effects of increasing the present wage minimum37 ellender stated that we proceed with the utmost caution and circumspection lest our actions produce decline in employment prices and production and plunge the nation into recession or major depression38 on august 31 1949 with some caution ellender proposed indexation of the federal minimum wage using variation on the consumer price index he urged an increase of the minimum wage then still 40 cents an hour to 65 cents an hour but with ban of flexibility built into its future calculation he added that in event shall the minimum hourly wage prescr ibed by the administrator be less than 55 cents an hour nor in excess of 75 cents an hour39 ellenders introductory speech seemed at odds with the thrust of his proposal he explained the ripple effect the impact of the minimum wage on other wage differentials and reviewed the southern case against the minimum wage he had reached the 65 cent level he stated because had the original 40 cent figure been indexed that 40cent minimum would be about equivalent to 66cent minimum today40 ellender stated that proposed changes have been considered by at least three congresses and as yet change

oppose without compromise any increase in the maximum basic wage that is not tied to costofliving index using the existing minimumwage base would under flexible formula substantially increase the

some measure of circumspection the 1955 flsa amendments in the 84th congress members were confronted with range of exemptions exceptions and potential for signifi cant flsa expansion but according to representative graham barden dnc then chairman the committee unanimously decided to consider two items at this time the rate of the hourly wage and the date that an increase should become effective46 senator paul douglas dil reported the measure s 2168 in proposing 100 an hour minimum wage the eisenhow er administration had asked for 90 cents two factors were of influence he stated the increase in the cost of living and the increase in productivity taking these increases into account he stated the minimum wage should be raised to just over 100 an hour douglas explained in times past the fair labor standards act has suffered and perhaps it suffers at this moment from the fact that revisions are made sporadically the last increase was postponed from 1944 to 1949 therefore instead of gradual increase jump was then made from 40 cents to 75 cents douglas sought rate not too severe for many industries and many firms to absorb and urged new method of easier transiti on to higher schedules in the future rather than index the wage rate per he proposed writing into dols reporting requirements mandate that the secretary make recommendations as to any changes which may have occurred in the

hearing marked the 40th anniversary of the flsa citing other economists he suggested that there was still virt ually reliable quan titative work on the minimum wage one of the difficulties he stated with respect to most of the studies is that they are based upon macroeconomic data and that heroic assumptions are necessary in order to distill out the effects of economic developments that are occurring simultane ously in the interim he stated about all we can do is to make some tentative observations based upon reading of our past experience and to put in reminder that for 40 years the fair labor standards act has been of considerable benefit to many of the lowest paid in our society without having had any apparently harmful effects on the economy galenson was not partisan of the general concept of wa ge indexing it has led to many difficulties in countries that have practiced it for long periods but he observed it is fact that great many american workers now enjoy indexing by collective agreement and if any group in society needs this kind of protection it is the low paid many if not most of them are not unionized and do not have collective bargaining machinery to prevent the erosion of their real incomes96 sar levitan george washington univers ity followed levitan stated that he supported the concept wh ich will help prevent th erosion of minimumwage protection in the face of future inflation and other wage increases however he stated i believe the index should be set at 50 percent of the average manufacturing wage more than 50 percent should not be attemp ted

the rate of inflation and other factors in the economy and then deciding whether and how much the nimum wage should be increased the concept of this bill is to substitute an indexing formula that will

upon the post world war ii years and primarily upon the 1950s through the 1970s during the 1950s and 1960s the report explained legislated minimum wage increases caused marked improvements in purchasing power that was not the case during the 1970s many minimum wage earners began working in the 1970s and experienced only the decline in the minimums purchasing power more critically lowincome workers in general and minimum wage workers in particular save very little and cannot provide for the future erosion of the purchasing power of their earnings finally those earlier minimum wa ge increases were not designed as buffer for the unexpectedly high infla tion of the 1970s and 1980s since congress did not foresee the oil crisis and ot her economic phenomena that boosted the underlying inflation rate into doubledigit figures119httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33791crs28 120 mwsc vol 1 p 73 121 mwsc vol 1 p 79 122 mwsc vol 1 p 79 123 mwsc vol 1 pp 8384 concerning the chnical

possible methods for its implementation120 it seemed to conclude that there may be really ideal baseformula for indexation the eff ect of the various methods explored upon employment was assessed to be small although it varies slightly with the method used it was found that corporate profits would increase slightly under each of the plans studied lending support to the theory that firms find it easier to adjust to gradual and expected advances in labor costs than to the more abrupt legislated increases that have at times exacerbated inflation121 but had indexation attached to hourly earnings growth been attempte d the report noted the longrun impact on consumer price inflation corporate prof its and real gross national product would have been small though beneficial122 in summary the commission concluded first the present system has not maintained the purchasing power of the minimum wage second indexation is not necessarily inflationary if it is based on costofliving or other increases that have already taken place as measured for example by average hourly earnings the consumer price index wit hout the mortgage interest payments or the im plicit deflator third indexation would have small beneficial effect on the economy in the long run in the short run the commission concluded indexation could have either small beneficial or small harmful effect pending on underlying economic conditions123 nonetheless the commission recomme nded that the minimum wage be indexed on the basis of average hourly ear nings in the private economy and adjusted each year on the basis of the previous years overall rate of change in this index further it concluded th at regular and predictable increases in the minimum wage would be noninflationary and would be eas ier for business to adjust to than the irregular increases of the present system124 voices of dissent the minority report following congressional practice the repor t was divided into majority finding with in some cases

cited findings produced by objective economists these findings he stated have shaken the very foundations of the flsa robinson stated that the majority has refused to base its conclusions on the inescapable economic facts uncovered in our studies but has instead provided bold and unsupportable assertions in support of the minimum wage126 robinsons comments dealing with variety of minimum wagerelated issues focused as well upon the issue of indexation one of the most farreaching and least supportable recommendations of the co mmission robinson charged calls for automatic annual increases in the minimum wage indexing is by its nature inflationary it starts with the premise that inflation is fixed and permanent part of the economy and implies refusal to deal with the underlying causes of inflation he continued now is ab solutely the worst conceivable time to be building inflationary forces deeper into the heart of our economy yet thats essentially what the majority recommendation for indexing the minimum wage would unavoidably do127 robinson reasoned that there is i ndex that adequately distinguishes inflationcaused price increases from those caused by supply shocks he stated that there were other major problems with indexing ie that it never applies equally to everyone thus the result is that anything short of universal index will always end up redistributing income in some unintended way he continued this will mean those with the lowest job skills will face even worse employment prospects than at present small business will be hurt harder and laborintensive industries like the retail and service tr ades will be forced to pass on their increased costs to consumers robinson contended everyone eventually winds up worse off due to stepped up inflation including those who thought they were being protected by an index128 finally robinson suggested that feder attempts to set wages in defiance of marketplace realities inev itably create inefficiency in the labor market and in particular deny employment to specific segments of the labor market suffering aboveaverage rates of une mployment historically129 other voices of dissent

goodling rpa was more outspoken minimum wage review board is backdoor indexing mechanism that is all it is he charged176 later goodling reiterated at various times during the debate that the issue was backdoor indexing why do i say that goodling protested very simply because now if they want to recommend they must recommend each year to the congress that means each year there is good possibility that the same thing comes up over and over again177 hawkins advised his colleague mr good ling this review board is purely advisory if they recommend an increase that increase would be submitted to

the minimum wage the president said was of an excessive amount would stifle the creation of new job opportunities and would damage the employment prospects of our young pe ople and least advantaged

only about 344 males in 2005 about 598 of workers at nd below the minimum wage were employed on parttime basis of these about 71 who work only parttime were women it may be difficult to analyze just why workers choos to engage in lowwage andor parttime work clearly their perspectives are divers motivational factors may deserve further study 226 jim snyder regular columnist for hotel management r eview innkeeping august 1966 p 10 at time when that industry was brought under the flsa reported weve continuedpart vii for the future some observations minimum wage workers for the most part accept lowwage work because other work is available whether they are very young lack training suffer infirmities or have othe r responsibilities for example care for family members or academic scheduling work at the minimum wage would likely not have been their first choice if higherpaying jobs were available absent alternative and more remunerative employment opport unities some do use entrylevel work as an interim measure some also remain at such work through the better part of lifetime presumably not by choice225 for persons who have entered the work force at minimum wage level wages may be of some importance some employers already pay rate above the minimum others pay only the wage that is required by law that is the minimum wage under the fair labor standards act few minimum wage workers it would appear are union members and work under collectively nego tiated agreement in the case of non union employees their wage may be deter mined by congressional action congress over the years has acted sporadically in this area it is possible that the resultant gaps in mandating an increase have occurred by design conviction that the minimum wage per is bad public policy and that its inflationary erosion would over time render its use as wage floor less important it may also have been the result of indiffe rence or the urgency of competing national priorities for proponents of higher minimum wage for the working poor such gaps may have produced rene wed interest in indexation with indexation regardless of the mech anism used there would be regular predictable wage rate increases for minimum wage workers for the workers themselves at least that minimal amount would be automatically added to their paycheck for employers such rate incr ease generally in response to inflationary pressures could reasonably be an ticipated and prepared for were indexation to be adopted however some things may be lost and some parties may be adversely affected by not indexing the minimum wage and by allowing its continuing decline in real terms certain employers are freed from having to pay higher wages226 further with indexation lowwage workers couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33791crs51 226 continued lost all right philosophized one ahma american hotel and motel association spokesman but when you consider that the industry has saved million dollars or so every day its been exempt i guess you could say that the effort was worthwhile 227 as has been suggested through the years indexation could remove one element of contention the level of the minimum wage nd replace it with another issue the rate at which indexation should be peggedexpect progressively higher wages nd may feel less need of trade unions although indexation might alleviate the need for oversight of the rate of worker remuneration it might also eliminate disc ussion of overtime pa child labor and related subjects227 finally for members of cong ress periodic review of the minimum wage may have certain resonance with voters permitting some to claim credit for an increased wage while others may want to show how firmly they opposed such an increase would indexation whatever its merits resolve the matter of minimum wage increases with formula established whether based on social security percentage of average hourly earnings or the cpi might new campaign arise to take its place for example if indexation were based on percentage of average hourly earnings 40 or 50 or 53 w ould proponents of living family saving wage now protest that the rate continues to provide poverty vel income and that some adjustment may be necessary to 60 or 70 more practical side may emerge to the indexation question first there is perfect methodology for indexation though that issue might be addressed through hearings second if an increase in the minimum wage could be made automatic during good times might decrease also be made automatic dur ing periods of high unemployment or other economic upheavals if the minimum wage goes up when times are good some might argue then mig ht it not come down when conditions are more problematic third how might indexation whether an increase or decrease be factored into other areas of policy such as trade policy or immigration fourth is there nexus between productivity and wa ge increase if there is merit system in place how might that be affected by an automatic increase in wage rates fifth inflation may be yet another matter so view indexation as method through which lower wage workers can cope with pressures of the cost of living but others view indexation in its own right as an gine of inflation that once in place would be basically unstoppable through the years at least since the 1940s indexation has been frequently discussed but perhaps not actually explored in its varied aspects several of the states now have indexation in place veral more will soon have such system installed such experimenta tion by the states may hold promise or threat for policy makers
