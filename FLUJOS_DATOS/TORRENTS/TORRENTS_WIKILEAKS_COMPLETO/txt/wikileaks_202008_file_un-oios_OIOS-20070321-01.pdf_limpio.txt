through unog in the years 2004 and 2005 draft of the report was shared with heads of departments and offices and the comments made whic h were received in january and february 2007 are reflected as appropriate oios assessed that the internal controls establishe d and systems and procedures relating to the hiring and managing of consultants individual contractors and institutional contractors were generally satisfactory oios is pleased to not that in some cases action was immediately taken to strengthen internal controls s soon as the exceptions andor weaknesses were pointed out by oios unogwide compliance with stai19997 the decentralization of responsibilities for employ ing and managing consultants and individual contractors as stipulated by the admini strative instruction stai19997 section 4 responsibilities of offices involved was not fu lly implemented unog administration had taken the decision to maintain greater involvem ent of hrms instead of delegating more of the routine work on consultancies to the respect ive executive offices hrms stated that the rationale for this decision was that some of th unog offices lacked the capacity to fully undertake responsibilities stipulated in stai1999 7 hrms agreed in general to further delegation to some of the genevabased departments there was unogwide roster of consultants and co ntractors for the selection of consultants as prescribed by stai19997 section 2 in oios opinion consultant roster at the level of unog andor requesting offices shou ld be developed to assist in the selection of consultants as well as to have central databa where information on consultants is filed including their expertise evaluation of work done and their frequency of work with the united nations hrms was of the opinion that the establishment of central roster may not be realistic due to the different specialized expertis required by genevabased departments and offices they commented that genevabased departmen ts could establish official rosters with preagreed parameters and hrms could facilitate th eir exchange between departments oios found that the departments and offices reviewe d did not perform formal evaluations of consultants in accordance with the criteria and req uirements of the administrative instruction hrms stated that it agreed with the thrust of the r ecommendation however its implementation will heavily depend on the cooperati on from departments and offices oios findings of the administration of consultants at unog offices the contractual work unit cwu experienced some lay in processing consultancy contracts without an adequate level of resources hrms involvement in the voluminous routine work including screening of cvs verificat ion of credentials and current employment records contributed to the delay in the process it was stated that the delegation of routine work to the executive office conference services division was feasible to evaluate consultants work cwu checked their wo rk on sample basis usually 10 per cent of the translated text oios identified that there is potential risk that translating errorsomissions are not identified through syste matic quality control process particularly as in some cases this work was undertaken by contracto rs with limited experience of the the languages servicecsd stated it would revise entire ly or substantial part of contractors work provided that adequate resources are allocated oios appreciates language servicescsd comments but is of the opinion that more positive action could be taken to channel its resources to the higher risk areas and ensure that there is more focusquality review on the work of inexperienced contracted translat ors the executive office at the united nations economic commission for europe unece had established good system of internal control over the administration of consultants oios however recommended that the executive office amen d its procedures to ensure competitive and transparent selection of consultants the united nations research institute for social velopment unrisd maintained satisfactory system of internal control but needed to improve the selection process to ensure transparency unrisd stated that since early 2006 they had been submitting to hrms unog names of other candidates and details of just ification for selection unrisd should also consider regularising the existing contractual arrangements for its research assistants in view of the continuous nature of their work and sh ould stop the practice of granting them annual leave unrisd maintains that the current practice of short term employment is the only economically viable option due to its financia l constraints unrisd stated that granting annual leave to the 68

its biennial report a595 of 2004 the main findings b oios and the boa related to non compliance with stai19997 in particular that t here was common roster of candidates the selection process was not properly documented nd the terms of reference did not provide measurable performance indicators 6 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed during the exit conference held on 16 october 2006 with the chief hrms draft of the report was shared with heads of departments and off ices the comments made which were received in january and february 2007 are reflected as appropriate 2 ii audit objectives 7 the main objectives of the audit were to evaluate t he adequacy effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls over the administra tion of

avai lable data iii audit scope and methodology 8 the audit covered activities with total expenditu re of us124 million for the services of consultants individual and institution contractors hired through unog in the years 2004 and 2005 oios reviewed and assessed the adequacy of the internal controls and systems and procedures established by human resourc management service hrms united nations economic commission for europe unec united nations research institute for social development unrisd and selec ted substantive offices of unog including the staff development and learning sectio n sdls contractual work unitcsd cwu security and safety sectionda sss and inf ormation and communication technology serviceda icts 9 the audit activities included review on sample basis of available files and records as well as an assessment of hrms internal controls systems and procedures and their compliance to the appropriate rules oios interview ed various staff analyzed applicable data and reviewed available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations compliance with administrative instructions implementation of stai19997 10 unog did not fully implement the provisions of sta i19997 consultants and individual contractors in relation to the division of responsibilities between hrms executive offices and substantive offices for proce ssing the consultancy contracts 11 oios review of procedures and practices at the dif ferent offices showed that hrms contrary to the requirements of stai19997 still conducted the bulk of the work that could have been delegated to the requesting office this included preparing and processing contracts reviewing the curriculum vitae of applic ants doing background checks and verifying credentials for example for cwu and sss hrms practically took over the preparation and processing of contracts for consul tancies of unece and unrisd while the requesting offices initiated and prepared the c ontracts their preparatory work was thoroughly checked by hrms thereby duplicating eff orts 12 in oios view the current procedures established i n hrms are not necessary and go 3 beyond the requirements of providing policy guidanc and compliance monitoring as prescribed by stai19997 13 oios noted that hrms while taking on these extra r esponsibilities did not have adequate resources to process consultancies in an ffective and timely manner one person was assigned on parttime basis 25 per cent of h er time to deal with all consultancies processed through unog except ocha where dedica ted staff member was managing all personnel issues including consultancies instead of 25 per cent of the staff members work time the workload of dealing with consultancies to ok almost 100 per cent of the staff members time despite hrms dedicating staff full time there was still considerable backlog in the processing and the filing of the sultancy records 14 there was an unclear division of responsibilities b etween substantive offices and hrms this led to lack of ownership and unclear res ponsibility for personnel records in the case of cwu for example hrms expected the substan tive office to maintain the records and cwu had assumed that hrms was responsible as result the records maintained by hrms and cwu were incomplete 15 the then acting chief hrms explained that after th stai19997 was issued unog administration had decided to maintain greater involvement of hrms than envisaged to ensure proper internal controls over the process were in place and operating effectively the chief hrms stated that hrms carried out these functions for the requesting offices as they might not have the capability to perform them while oios appreciates this hrms is responsible for providing policy guidance and has role in monitoring compliance of the process by adopting such an approach it would have provided appropriate guidance to requesting offices and help ensure that adequate in ternal controls were in place the overall effect could have been more efficient and timely pr ocessing of consultancy contracts recommendation head2right the unog human resources management service should consider delegating further to large genevabased united nat ions departments the processing and approval of consulting contracts and establishing oversight procedures to ensure that proper procedur are adopted and operating effectively unog administration should s eek formal guidance from the office of human resources managem ent on this delegation of authority and on the interpretation f the stai19997 consultants and individual contractors part iv n their responsibilities rec 01 16 hrms agrees in general to the idea of further deleg ation of authority including the approval of contracts to other large genevabased departments like ece ohchr and ocha but not to small offices like unrisd which ve capacity to assume such authority when and if they have the expertise and the capacity to absorb it 17 oios will maintain the recommendation pending confi rmation that action is taken to further delegate authority to other large genevaba sed departments b roster of candidates 18 contrary to the requirements of stai19997 41 there was unogwide 4 roster of consultants established by hrms this in oios opinion should have been established by unog with relevant input from the re questing offices according to hrms the office of human resources management ohrm sho uld have established the roster shortly after the stai19997 was issued in 1999 it was hrms understanding that roster had not yet been created hrms was also of the opin ion that to some extent imis served as roster as some but not all information on consult ants existed in the system 19 oios appreciates that imis may hold some of the req uired information but this is not sufficient and should not be seen as substitute f or proper consultants roster for example there was record of uptodate data on the skill s and expertise of candidates their prior and current engagements the type of work performed fe and evaluation of past work this had not been requested by hrms from offices in order to develop and consolidate such information centrally as required by the administr ative instruction in oios view unog should take the initiative to develop consultants roster this would be of assistance to requesting offices in the selection process and it could serve as tool to monitor whether requesting offices are complying with the necessary instructions 20 at the exit conference the chief hrms concurred w ith the recommendation and stated that hrms would initiate the establishment f unogwide roster of consultants on further consideration however hrms is of the opinion that the establishment of ch roster may not be realistic due to the widely different an d highly specialized expertise required by genevabased departments and offices unog hrms com mented that the only viable option would be for all genevabased departments to establ ish official rosters with an indication of preagreed parameters hrms can act as repository of these databases and facilitate their exchange between departments oios recognized the practicality of hrms comment s and has revised the recommendation recommendation head2right the unog human resources management service should provide guidelines to genevabased executive offices and ad ministrative offices for them to develop consultants roster hrms sho uld act as repository of these databases and facilitate the ex change of information between departments rec 02 21 oios will keep the recommendation open pending rece ipt of copy of guidelines related to consultants rosters c evaluation of consultants work 22 the evaluation process of consultants and individua l contractors should be improved to ensure that their performance and quality of wor k is systematically documented and that the objectives outlined in the terms of reference h ave been achieved 23 currently hrms and financial resources management service frms require requesting office to submit its evaluation of the c onsultants work on form p106a by ticking off an appropriate box for the performance excelle nt good adequate somewhat less than adequate poor on the form this should accompany the request for the payment of the final installment of the consultants fee oios noted tha t detailed evaluation was only required when an extreme rating either excellent or poor w as given to consultant 5 24 while in practice an overall ratingassessment of t he consultants work had been given in oios view it did not have the attribute s of meaningful evaluation nor did it comply with stai19997 as it did not confirm or not whether there had been compliance with requirements of the terms of reference the qu ality of the work performed and the timeliness of the output of the consultant recommendation head2right the unog human resources management service to ens ure compliance with stai19997 should adopt meanin gful performance evaluation system of the consultants work to incl ude among others confirmation of the consultants compliance with th terms of reference and complete evaluation of the quality of work an d its timeliness rec 03 25 hrms stated that it agreed in general with the thru st of the recommendation however its implementation would heavily depend on the cooperation from departments and offices 26 oios takes note of hrms comments and hopes that i t will encourage executive offices and administrative offices to properly and systematically evaluate and rate consultants work oios will maintain the recommendation pending confirmation that the performance evaluation system for consultants work has been enh anced b practices and procedures in individual unog offices contractual work unit conference services division 27 cwu uses the services of individual contractors for translating documents when staff translators of the languages service confere nce services division are not available the amount disbursed on consultants in 2004 and 200 5 was us1680000 oios found that cwu established and maintained an adequate though r ather outdated system to manage the administration of consultants 28 cwu experienced delays in the processing of its sultancy contracts in at least 8 out of the 33 cases reviewed by oios the delay was between 3 to 4 weeks past the deadline established by the document control section for the timely processing of translation this has resulted in undue delays in submission of contr acted documents 29 the cause of the problem was that the former acting chief hrms was actively involved in the routine work on cwu consultancies including screening of cvs verification of credentials and current employment in oios op inion such work should have been delegated to others as it was not the best use of the chiefs time the then acting chief hrms concurred with oios observation and agreed th at the delegation of routine work to the executive office conference services division was feasible recommendation head2right the unog human resources management service should delegate to the executive office of conference services divisio n the routine work 6 on consultancy contracts and provide guidance to th responsible individuals to ensure proper internal controls are established rec 04 30 oios will maintain the recommendation pending confi rmation that the routine work on consultancy contracts has been delegated to cwu 31 the need for contracting translation services is termined by the chiefs of language sections and approved by the director language ser vices the requests are prepared by cwu and processed by hrms cwu uses selfdevelope d paperbased system for filing and monitoring the contractors oios assessed the s ystem as reliable oios did not identify any exceptions when cwu records were compared to im is records names or amount of fees 32 oios found exceptions but the verification proc ess was arduous and the transparency of record keeping could be improved i n some cases the documentation was not complete especially for older files there were veral cvs missing from the files reviewed 33 consultancy records were maintained thematically an d by subject file of cvs file of payments file of translations made instead of bei ng organized by contractorsname of consultant oios suggested that the filing system b enhanced and records be filed per consultant to enable more efficient monitoring of c ontracts an improved filing system would be beneficial in light of the further delegation of routine work on consultancies to the eocsd recommendation 01 recommendation head2right the contractual work unitconference services divis ion should ensure that sound filing system is established to provid assurance to management that all relevant documents are appropri ately filed and can easily be retrieved rec 05 34 cwu concurred with oioss observations and stated t hat they have developed filing system by names of contractors in june 2006 oios is pleased to note the action taken and will verify the adequacy of the new system 35 as part of the quality review process the language s servicecsd checked on sample basis usually 10 per cent the translated t ext done by staff translators the same policy is applied for contracted translators while this m ay be an appropriate policy for staff members it means that 90 per cent of the work done by contractors was not reviewed or checked the text was published and distributed wit hout any further quality control procedures oios noted that in the absence of an ad equate unogwide performance evaluation requirement there was assurance that the contractors were properly evaluated and that their work was adequately reviewed 36 cwu found their practice reasonable since the contr actors were experienced translators and were capable of selfrevising as d oes the experienced staff translators oios appreciates this but on review of the contrac tors personal history data oios noted that while some of them were very experienced ando r former staff translators some others lacked experience on subjects in the lat ter category therefore there is risk that with limited review of fairly inexperienced trans lators errors could be made in externally translated documents endorsed by the departments and offices of the secretariat this 7 could have negative impact on the image of the secretariat recommendation head2right the contractual work unitconference services divis ion should review their current quality control procedures of contrac tual work to ensure that sound quality control system is adopted particul arly for work done by inexperienced translators with limited experienc rec 06 37 the languages servicecsd would be ready to revise entirely or substantial part of contractors work provided that adequate resources are allocated for revision of contractual work considered so far as special assignment der quality control 38 oios appreciates language servicescsd comments b ut is of the opinion that more positive action could be taken to channel its resou rces to the higher risk areas and ensure that there is more focusquality review on the work of i nexperienced contracted translators oios will maintain the recommendation pending the ction taken by languages servicecsd to provide assurance to management that enhanced qu ality control procedures are in place b united nations economic commission for europe

were prepared by the administrative assistant and processed by hrms 51 the consultancies reviewed had comprehensive terms of reference with two exceptions which were explained as misfiling all outputs reviewed reasonably related to the scope of work 52 while unrisd in general maintained an adequate sy stem of internal controls it did not adhere to some requirements of administrative i nstruction stai19997 oios noted that the selection process was not transparent it was normally done by programme managers without clear evidence on file that other candidate s had been considered even though some requests for consultancies contained the names of t he other supposedly considered candidates oios was informed that programme manag ers verified the experience andor credentials of the candidates but evidence of this verification was not available 53 the documentation though in general complete was organized by projects and not by the name of the consultant even though the consult ant could be hired for different projects therefore it was not possible to perform test to ensure that unrisds records agreed to those recorded in imis recommendation head2right the united nations research institute for social velopment should establish in consultation with unog human resource s management service procedures to ensure competitiveness and t ransparency in selecting consultants

current practice of short term employment of research assistants is the only econo mically viable option due to the current unrisd financial situation 58 unrisd also authorized annual leave contrary
