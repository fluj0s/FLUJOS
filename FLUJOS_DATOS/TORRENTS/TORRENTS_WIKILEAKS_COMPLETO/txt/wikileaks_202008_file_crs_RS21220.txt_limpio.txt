represents major new economic development initiative and as with the empowerment zoneenterprise communities ezec program pl 10366 enacted in 1993 the rc initiative combines tax credits and other provisions designed to revive some of the nations more impoverished areas in important respects however the two programs employ different means to achieve similar goals this report will be updated as events warrant background during most of the nations history two key factors led to limited interaction between federal and municipal governments first citizen expectationsand hence the policy responsibilitiesof these entities have varied greatly the federal government concerned itself with such national policies as defense and international affairs while cities focused on providing local services second there was direct legal connection between them legally citiesas with other units of local governmentare creatures of the states thus until the mid20th century cities interacted almost exclusively with their states or other local governments not with the federal government beginning in the 1950s however the relationship between the federal government and cities changed dramatically particularly since the mid1960s the federal government has undertaken various initiatives designed to help revive distressed areas eg the economic opportunity act of 1964 centerpiece of the war on poverty community action program model cities etc in enacting these programs congress explicitly recognized that the national government had role to play in what are ostensibly local economic development concerns 1 listing of the 40 rcs 28 urban and 12 rural appears on page 6 of this report congressional research service the library of congress crs2 both the federal governments evolving role and its approach in helping distressed urban communitiesas well as rural areasare exemplified by the empowerment zoneenterprise communities ezec program2 enacted by the 103rd congress the ezec program differs from previous efforts in several key respects including competition to determine designated areas the autonomy given to ezs and ecs in decision making the promotion of socalled marketbased economic development and the programs comprehensiveness conceptually the ezec program had its genesis with enterprise zone programs initiated in the united kingdom in the 1980s and subsequently championed in this country by jack kemp among others while both member of the house of representatives and the secretary of housing and urban development during the bush administration the concept originally emphasized various tax incentives and efforts to make it easier for private businesses to operate by eliminating such impediments as restrictive zoning laws and certain other governmental regulations the administration proposed new markets initiative in june 1999 containing many of the elements that were incorporated in the consolidated appropriations act pl httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21220 106554 the renewal communities part of the new law on the other hand has roots that run even deeper representative j c watts introduced the forerunner of the rc initiative in the 104th congress with save our children the american community renewal act of 1996 hr 3467 that legislation was much broader in scope including several controversial provisions dealing with school vouchers lowincome educational opportunity scholarships and family development accounts brief legislative history at joint appearance in chicago in december 1999 president clinton and
