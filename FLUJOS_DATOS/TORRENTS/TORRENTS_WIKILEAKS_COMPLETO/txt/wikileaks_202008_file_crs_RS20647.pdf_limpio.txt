question the report is not expected to be updated both the president and the congress currently can create national monuments type of conservation unit created from federal lands since 1933 and until recently monuments were managed by the national park service in the department of the interior president clinton has created number of new national monuments and has charged agencies other than the national park service with the management of several of them1 the president exercised the authority given the president under the antiquit ies act of 19062 but the creation of the new monuments proved controversial both with respect to particular areas designated and with respect to the process by which the monuments were created3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20647crs2 3 continued act have been submitted in the congress opponents of these proposals argue that the antiquities act should not be changed because it provides valuable avenue to take prompt protective actions to safeguard valuable national treasures and monuments typically provide economic benefits to surrounding communities 4 act of october 21 1976 pub l 94579 90 stat 2743 codified in part at 43 usc 1701 et seq 5 uncodified section 704a reads in part effective on and after the date of approval of this act the implied authority of the president to make withdrawals and reservations resulting from acquiescence of the congress us v midwest oil co 236 us 459 and the following statutes and parts of statutes are repealed 6 see comments of john leshy at press briefing by george frampton acting chair of the council on environmental quality and john leshy solicitor of the department of the interior june 9 2000under article iv of the constitution congress has the power to make needful rules and regulations regarding the territory and property of the united states over the years congress delegated considerable land management authority to the president including the authority in the antiquities act for the president in his discretion to declare by public proclamation national monuments strong presidents expanded on the authorities delegated by congress and many withdrawals and reservations were made that critics charged exceeded the delegated powers eventually congress reasserted control over withdrawals and reservations of public lands by limiting actions that could be taken by the president or the secretary of the interior this posture is especially evident in the land management statutes enacted in 1976 most notably in the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma4 which required certain approvals of congress for large withdrawal s repealed many previous statutory authorities of the president and even repealed any authority of the president to make withdrawals implied by the acquiescence of congress in the actions of previous presidents5 however flpma conspicuously left the antiquities act in place with discussion of why that choice was made the flpma provisions regarding secretarial withdrawal authority may shed additional light on the issue of revocation and will be discussed further below although few monuments have ever been abolished by congress as opposed to being folded into another conservation designation and monument has ever been terminated by president6 the question has arisen as to whether president lawfully could modify previously designated monument at first glance it would appear that this question should be answered in the affirmative since presidents certainly have modified or revoked executive orders and at times executive orders and proclamations have been usedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20647crs3 7 the antiquities act authorizes the president to proclaim monuments it does not appear that the form of the presidents action proclamation rather than an executive order is significant one congressional study distinguished the two instruments by stating that an executive order relates to actions within the executive branch and proclamation typically affects citizens and since the president has power and authority over individual citizens and their rights except where he is granted such power and authority by provision in the constitution or by statute the president proclamations are at best hortatory so far as the general public is concerned unless they are based on statutory or constitutional authority executive orders and proclamations study of use of presidential powers committee on government operations 85th congress 1st sess at vii december 1957 however both types of instruments have been used to create forest reserves see establishment and modification of national forest boundaries chronologic record 18911973 compiled by the forest service department of agriculture 1973 for example the act of march 3 1891 ch 561 26 stat 1103 authorized the president to proclaim forest reserves which reserves were created variously by proclamations and executive orders fact that was reflected in the 1897 act act of june 4 1897 ch 2 30 stat 11 36 that authorized the revocation or vacating of executive orders or proclamations creating forest reserves under the 1891 act 8 see jenkins v collard 145 us 546 560561 1891 and cases involving executive orders eg independent meat packers assn v butz 526 f 2d 228 234 8th cir 1975 cert denied 424 us 966 1976 gnotta v united states 415 f 2d 1271 1275 8th cir 1969 9 39 op atty gen 185 1938 opinion 10 id at 187 citing 10 op atty gen 359 364 1862 an opinion cited with approval in 17 op atty gen 168 1881 and 36 op atty gen 75 79 1929 which stated duty properly continuedinterchangeably to carry out land actions7 but some see the proclaiming of national monument as special category of action that may not simply be undone when president issues proclamation on matters either within the presidents inherent powers or to execute delegated authority the proclamation has the force of law8 an attorney generals opinion concluded that president could validly modify monument because the antiquities act directs that monument in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected9 numerous presidents have modified previously created monuments however the opinion also concluded that president could not eliminate or terminate monument established by previous presidential action the opinion noted that there was separate statutory authority for the president to revoke or terminate monument and therefore any authority that existed for this purpose must be implied by the other powers given the president in the antiquities act the opinion then reasoned that because the president had inherent authority over lands the president was acting only with authority delegated to him by congress monument reservation was therefore equivalent to an act of congress itself and the president was without power to revoke or rescind monument reservation in this regard the opinion cited previous opinion that concluded that president could not revoke reservation of land made pursuant to delegation of congressional authority because doing so would be repealing or altering an act of congress10 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20647crs4 10 continued performed by the executive under statutory authority has the validity and sanctity which belong to the statute itself and unless it be within the terms of the power conferred by that statute the executive can more destroy his own authorized work without some other legislative sanction than any other person can to assert such principle is to claim for the executive the power to repeal or alter an act of congress at will 11 id at 188 the 1910 act is the act of june 25 1910 ch 421 36 stat 847 the pickett act which is one of the statutes whose authorit the president expanded with the acquiescence of congress and the act of june 4 1897 ch 2 30 stat 11 36 which expressly authorized the revocation or vacating of executive orders or proclamations creating forest reserves under the act of march 3 1891 ch 561 26 stat 1103 codified at 16 usc 471 until its repeal by flpma in 1976 in the national forest management act pub l 94588 90 stat 2949 2957 congress provided that forest reserves could only be returned to the public domain by an act of congress 16 usc 1609a 12 this is especially true with respect to authorities which presidents applied expansively in pattern of actions to which congress acquiesced united states v midwest oil co 236 us 459 1915 however there has been pattern or even an instance of presidential revocation of monument designations in addition arguably the era of expansive presidential powers was reversed by flpma 13 hr rep 941163 at 9 1976opinion distinguished the authority of president to make general temporary land withdrawals or to create forest reserves because both of those statutes provided express authority for the president to modify or eliminat reservations made pursuant to those acts11 all of these opinions are old and may reflect more limited view of presidential authority over land that might have changed over the years12 section 204j of flpma the act that repealed most of the withdrawal authorities of the president and secretary of the interior and imposed new congressional controls over large withdrawals that might be made by the secretary after 1976 also specified that the secretary could not make modify or revoke any withdrawal created by act of congress or modify or revoke any withdrawal creating national monuments under the act of june 8 1906 34 stat 225 16 usc 431433 this provision came from the house bill hr 13777 as introduced and as reported the relevant committee report states the bill would also specifically reserve to congress the authority to modify and revoke withdrawals for national monuments created under the antiquities act these provisions will insure that the integrity of the great national resource management systems will remain under the control of the congress13 the conference report does not mention the provision the flpma language addresses only actions of the secretary while the antiquities act is worded in terms of actions the president may take presidential proclamations creating national monuments typically read that they hereby withdraw or reserve lands ie are current withdrawal by the president arguably any subsequent actions taken by secretary to carry out the withdrawals are more in the nature of record changes tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20647crs5 14 tva v hill 437 us 153 189 1977 quoting morton v mancari 417 us 535 549 1974reflect withdrawals already legally made by the president if president were to attempt to revoke monument declaration presumably the revoking proclamation would similarly terminate the previous withdrawals and subsequent actions taken by secretary to reflect that revocation again could be characterized as merely recordkeeping changes made to reflect the action already taken if the president lacks authority to revoke monuments and monument withdrawals then this distinction between withdrawals of president versus withdrawals of secretary does not matter however it appears from the breadth of the committee report language that congress may have believed that controlling revocations by the secretary in this regard would operate to control the revocation of national monument withdrawals ie to control the actions of the president if this was the understanding of congress it may be possible to argue that the general controls in flpma over large withdrawals made by the secretary were also intended to control withdrawals made by the president under the 1906 act arguably the last part of the committee report language seems to indicate that congress may have believed its withdrawal language was in fact adequate to control presidential withdrawals whether this is fair reading of flpma and whether controlling withdrawals or revocations made by the secretary effectively controls the president under the antiquities act are issues that are not clear arguably the flpma language was not effective in this regard because courts are reluctant to find statutes repealed by implication14 and this would seem especially true of statute that so carefully and extensively repealed or modified so many other acts but did not amend or repeal the antiquities act in addition uncodified section 701a of flpma expressly states that the act should not be construed to repeal any existing law by implication and presidents have created largeacreage monuments since enactment of flpma summary we have found cases deciding the issue of the authority of president to revoke national monument while in flpma congress expressly limited the authority of the secretary of the interior to revoke monument withdrawals and reservat ions that language arguably does not affect the presidents authority under the 1906 act which flpma neither amended nor repealed president has ever revoked previously established monument that president can modify previous presidentiallycreated monument seems clear however there is language in the 1906 act that expressly authorizes revocation there is instance of past practice in that regard and there is an attorney generals opinion concluding that the president lacks that authority
