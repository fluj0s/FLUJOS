foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31039military housing privatization initiative background and issues summary this report describes the military housing privatization initiative mhpi pilot program authorized by congress in 1996 to encourage privatelyfunded development of housing for use by members of the us military services including the army navy marine corps and air force the quality of housing available to members of the military services is considered one of the most important components along with pay and quality of workplace in defining the militarys quality of life directly influencing the ability of the military services to retain personnel on active duty as part of the department of defense dod effort to address its housing problems by selfimposed deadline of 2010 the mhpi uses private sector alterna tives to military housing construction leveraging appropriated funds by providing federal supports to commercial real estate developers congress temporarily granted dod 12 of these riskreducing authorities including the ability to convey or lease public property to private enterprise to guarantee minimum occupancy rates or to offer direct loans to real estate developers while the office of the secretary of defense retains general oversight and approval authority the individual military services are responsible for the execution of projects on military installations the mhpi was originally authorized for five years but few contracts were awarded despite its slow start congress has expressed confidence in the program and recently reauthorized it through december 31 2004 the pace at which privatization contracts are being awarded has accelerated while the mhpi has been applied only to family housing dod intends to expand it to include barracks and military dormitories issues for congress in its oversight of the program include the following one issue is how to assess the program and its effectiveness this is difficult task because both the problem of deteriorat ing housing and the solution of mhpi are complex family housing master plans expected to lay out in detail how each service will resolve its housing deficiencies over the next decade will be submitted to congress soon and are expected to establish the benchmarks necessary for program assessment dod operates 300000 military family housing units but the ten mhpi projects currently under contract include only 6900 of them or less than 23 of the total the mhpi alone cannot be silver bullet remedy to substandard housing nevertheless it can be assessed for its ability to provide costeffective quality housing quickly and its use could be expanded second issue is what are the alternative means of providing quarters for military personnel and their families domestic military housing is created through three methods access to the civilian housing market traditional military construction using appropriated funds and mhpi development more than 66 of service members stationed within the united states use commercial housing mhpi housing currently under contract or in solicitation accounts for less than 20 of the remainder with military construction supplying the rest dod intends to resolve its housing shortfalls through combination of those three alternativeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31039contents background 1 military housing as

congress to ensure that military construction meets priority programs such as family housing for more information on military construction see crs report rl30510 appropriations for fy2001 military construction by mary t tyszkiewicz one of series of annual appropriationsrelated reports produced by the crsmilitary housing privatization initiative background and issues background during the past four decades housing for military personnel and their families has been relatively low priority component of military construction after rapid expansion of what was then considered modern and uptodate accommodations throughout the1950s and the early 1960s the effort devoted to the construction and the upkeep of military housing did not keep up with the effects of natural deterioration and changing societal definitions of adequate housing the decrease in quality of housing has accelerated since the end of the cold war as result of the uncertaint ies of base closures both at home and overseas and shrinking defense budgets which have encouraged the channeling of construction funds into projects more directly related to operational readiness as result the department of defense dod estimates that 180000 of the 300000 military family units that it owns and operates longer meet its standards for adequate housing approximately onethird of military families live in governmentowned housing the remainder live in privately owned or rented accommodations of these dod has determined that more than half do not meet its current housing standards with regard to living space amenities etc1 the department has calculated that by using its traditional methods of contracting and constr uction 30 years and 16 billion would be needed to resolve its family housing shortfall historically dod has used combination of two methods to house active duty personnel and their families the principal method has been reliance on the commercial housing supply near military installations and congress has provided member s with cash allowance to defray part of the cost the secondary method intended for those locations where local housing is extraord inarily expensive or unavailable has been to lodge memb ers and their families in quarters built with appropriated funds on military reservations in 1996 third method was provided to dod by congress this report examines the military housing privatization initiative mhpi collection of twelve temporary alternative authorizations as they are termed in the relevant legislation intended for the speedy creation of quality military housing

2000 ch 4 available through the cbo web site at httpwwwcbogov of appropriated funds with private investment dod believes that significant increase in the military housing allowance continuation of traditional construction and expanded use of the mhpi will eliminate housing inadequacies by 2010 the mhpi is not the first instance where the congress has sought to leverage public appropriations in the creation of military housing as explained below still it stands out for the authority and flexibility in execution granted to the department of defense to engage in longterm contractual relationships with the private sector mhpi was created as fiveyear pilot project initial progress in creating new and refurbished housing was slow and last year congress extended the projects life through december 31 2004 there are currently ten separate projects under contract across the united states encompassing some 6900 housing units another 11 projects adding more than 19300 additional housing units are in solicitation with private developers with 25 additional projects in planning there is ceiling set on the number of units expected to be built or reconditioned under the mhpi military housing as quality of life issue housing is core component of the military quality of life matrix in recent testimony before the house appropriations committees subcommittee on military construction march 8 2001 each of the senior enlisted members of the military services the sergeant major of the army the master chief petty officer of the navy the sergeant major of the marine corps and the chief master sergeant of the air force discussed the issues that their soldiers sailors airmen and marines believe are most important to their military careers and to their decisions to remain on active duty or leave the service common to all services were concerns with compensation including basic pay and the basic allowance for housing or bah quality of housing and quality of environment in the workplace bah and quality of housing are closely intertwined dod can house appro ximately onethird of its military families in government owned units on military reserva tions those living offbase either by choice or because of insufficient local government housing supply pay commercial rates for utilities such as water and sewer services and rents or mort gages on their residen ces current bah rates cover 812 of the average rental cost of dod standard accommo dation leaving the remaining 188 to be drawn from the members basic pay supporters of increased bah funding argue that an increase sufficient to cover 100 of offbase housing costs would not only eliminate perceptions of inequity but would ease the demand for onbase quarters by permitting more service members to afford civilian housing2 throughout their testimony mentioned above these senior enlisted members stressed that with large portion of the volunteer military force supporting families approximately 70 of military personnel are married the quality of life afforded those left at home has direct and dramatic effect on the numbers and quality of those who decide to remain for full 20plus year active duty career this in turnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31039crs3 3wherry housing is named for senator kenneth spicer wherry of nebraska world war i navy veteran who sponsored the original bill 4capehart housing was sponsored by senator homer capehart of indiana world war i army veterancan affect the experience level of training and ability the services bring to bear on the missions they are assigned therefore it is argued the quality of military housing has direct bearing on the retention of proficient capable volunteer career military force the mhpi is not the first attempt by congress to create modern family dwellings quickly nor is it the first time that congress has encouraged dod to partner with private industry at least three separate approaches were tried during the cold war with varying degrees of success three key military housing construction private sector initiatives wherry housing3 in 1949 congress passed pl 81221 which was intended to bring private homebuilders into the rental housing market for military personnel without requiring the use of military construction funding as it was first implemented the military services were allowed to solicit plans for housing from private builders from those submitted service chose the builder whose plan was deemed most suitable for the particular military facility the builder arranged private financing and constructed homes on government controlled land for rental to military personnel later in order to make the process more competitive the program was changed so that servic would contract with private architectengineers for standard set of housing plans at designated military facility armed with these the services applied to the federal housing administration fha for an appraisal and eligibilit statement that established maximum insurable mortgage effectively setting the highend valuation for an individual housing unit the service then solicited bids for the project which would be located on governmentowne d or controlled land from private housing developers the lowest bidder was awarded certificate of need which was used to apply to the fha for mortgage insurance because private enterprise was in essence being issued license to respond to demonstrated market need using privately financed albeit fhainsured housing the developer retained title to the resulting real property and rented housing to individual service members the wherry program supplied the greater portion of new military family housing constructed through the early 1950s but congressional concerns with windfall profits accruing to private developers led to its effective termination in 1955 capehart housing4 like wherry housing capehart housing was built on governmentcontrolled land exempting it from local building regulations unlike wherry housing where title to the resulting property remained with the private developer and individual service members made rental payments to the ownerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31039crs4 capehart housing was built using private financing but title was turned over to the federal government upon the completion of construction in wherry housing individual members retained their housing allowances and paid rent to the private project manager who was responsible for paying the projects mortgage capehart housing was governmentowned and members living there forfeited their entire housing allowances dod then made single mortgage payment for capehart project to the private mortgager by the early 1960s dod had constructed approximately 115000 capehart housing units the last authorization for capehart housing was made for fiscal year 1962 the construction of newer larger capehart units tended to draw tenants away from nearby wherry housing in 1957 the services began purchasing the approximately 84000 privately held wherry units thus both wherry and capehart housing eventually came under common administration and today are usually mentioned together as capehartwherry section 801 and 802 housing these sections of title viii of the military construction authorization act of 1984 pl 98115 attempted to encourage the provision of privately constructed housing to military personnel by authorizing the service secretaries to enter into contracts for the lease of facilities on or near military installation s section 801 essentially buildtolease guarantee to local property developer or to enter into agreements to occupy rental housing near military installations section 802 rent guarantee to encourage the erection of rental property the impact these arrangements had on service budgets quickly discouraged their use see the importance of budget scoring below the military housing privatization initiative described both wherry and capehart construction programs and the use of section 801802 arrangements ended within few years of their initiation although each attempted different approach to providing housing and leveraging appropriated funds none offered more than very limited options for increasing the quantity and quality of the housing offered to the families of active duty military personnel in 1996 congress and dod tried something very different the military housing privatization initiative mhpi was devised to give the department of defense the ability to entice private investment by encouraging it to act like private enterprise as businesses can be creative to take advantage of local real estate market conditions in customizing development projects the mhpi was designed to give similar flexibility to dod this was intended as step away from the perceived onesizefitsall mentality of the earlier programs the mhpi toolbox the mhpi includes twelve separate temporary authorities that revive some of the provisions of the earlier construction programs and add to them while permittinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31039crs5 their selective use where they can be most advantageous these alternative authorizations include 1 conveyance of real property the government may transfer title of federal property to private ownership 2 relaxation of federal specifications for housing construction builders are allowed to construct housing in accordance with local building codes 3 inclusion of ancilla ry support facilities bids for contracts may incorporate additional amenities such as child care centers and dining facilities to enhance the attractiveness of the basic housing 4 payment of rent by allotment landlords may receive payment of rents through automatic electronic fund transfer from the approp riate federal disbursing facility guaranteeing cash flow 5 loan guarantee the government may guarantee up to 80 of the private sector loans arranged by the property developer 6 direct loan the government may make loan directly to contractor 7 differential lease payment dlp the government may agree to pay differential between the bah paid to service members and local market rents 8 investment joint venture the government may take an equity stake in housing construction enterprise 9 interim leases the government may lease private housing units while awaiting the completion of project 10 assignment of service members service personnel may be assigned to housing in particular project that they may otherwise not choose to occupy tenant guarantee 11 build to lease the government may contract for the private construction of housing project then lease its units similar to section 801 programs 12 rental guarantee the government may guarantee minimal occupancy rate or rental income for housing project similar to the section 802 program mhpi background and implementation the military housing privatization initiative was created in section 2801 of the national defense authorization act for 1996 pl 104106 as fiveyear pilot program within 10year plan to resolve the general military housing problem through the use of its alternative authoriz

initiative gaonsaid0071 march 2000military housing quickly and economically by leveraging the federal investment by encouraging private investment originally the mhpi was centralized within the department of defense under the office of the secretary of defense osd because of the complexity inherent in this new approach to military housing construction the unfamiliarity of dod contracting personnel with these kinds of negotiations and new legal financial and budget issues that appeared as the program got underway progress in the negotiation of contracts and in beginning constru ction was notably slower than originally envisioned the first project award known as nas corpus christi kingsville i texas for 404 units was consummated in july of 1996 the second termed everett i washington and encompassing 185 housing units was awarded in march of 1997 this experience contributed to 1997 decision by dod to extend its original housing solution target date of 2006 by four years to 2010 in addition 1998 gao report faulted the cost analysis methodology used by dod indicated that actual savin gs would be considerably less than the services claimed and suggested that more effective use could be made of existing private market housing near military installations5 by the end of august 1998 more than three years into the fiveyear program only three projects the two cited above and another at lackland air force base texas for 420 units had been awarded contracts in october of 1998 the secretary of defense devolved operational responsibility for mhpi to the individual services with oversight and final approval authority vested in the osd office of competitive sourcing and privatization6 between the lackland award and the approach of the end of the initial mhpi authorization in late 2000 only one additional project ft carson for 2663 units was finalized followup gao report released in march of 2000 concluded that because none of the contracted projects had yet been brought into full operation there was little empirical data by which to assess whether the mhpi would achieve its goal of eliminating inadequate military housing more economically and faster than possible through the use of traditional construction practices7 the program was set to expire during february 2001 congressional concern with perceived lack of results became apparent as expiration approached the house appropriations committee subcommittee on military construct ion in its report on the military construction appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 noted the department of defense intends to privatize approximately 40000 housing units by december 2001 while the committee supports the extension of the authority for this program it continues to believe this is pilot

december of 2000 robins georgia and dyess texas air force bases mcb camp pendleton i califo rnia and kingsville ii texas and everett ii washington adding more than 2200 housing units to bring the program to total of ten contract awards and more than 6900 housing units additional congressional interest was indicated in the conference report on the floyd spence national defens authorization act for fiscal year 2001 contract award for the mhpi project at patrick air force base florida had originally been anticipated for august of 2000 the air force had expressed an interest in partnering with single private firm for the study of solicitations in this and future undertakings leading to questions about the apparent competitivene ss of any subsequent awards the acts conference report stated that the conferees note the innovative approaches undertaken by the service secretaries in execution of the alternative authorities for the acquisition and improvement of military housing the conferees remain strongly supportive of these authorities and believe competition in the private marketplace has resulted in number of successful procurements after an early period of difficulty in program implementation while supportive of variety of innovative options to construct and acquire military housing under these authorities the conferees were concerned that methodology considered by the secretary of the air force in the determinati on of the awardee of the housing privatization project at patrick air force base florida appeared to be noncompetitive and to delegate the selection process to the private sector the conferees are aware that the secretary has subsequently directed change in the solicitation process the conferees reiterate that the use of competitive procedures should apply when exercising the alternative authoriti for the acquisition and improvement of military housing regardless of the process that may be used9 the act as subsequently enacted extended the life of the mhpi until december 31 2004 in addition the military construction appropriation act for fiscal year 2001 pl 106246 directed each of the four services to submit to the appropriate committees of the congress not later than july 1 2001 family housing master plan to demonstrate how they intended to meet the dod 2010 housing goal using combination of traditional constr uction operation and maintenance support and privatization initiative proposals10 the initiative remains openended having established ceiling on the number of projects or units but as of this writing it

army proposals range from approximately 1700 units at the presidio of monterey in california to more than 6000 units at ft bragg north carolina though relatively few projects have reached the point of contract award patterns of servicespecific contracting practices have emerged army projects tend to focus on the revitalization of existing housing stocks the air force appears to favor the inclusion of the conveyance of federal land in projects under its administration the navy appears to prefer engaging private developers in joint ventures see table 1 in this report the importance of budget scoring budget scoring or scorekeeping is the percentage of dollar value from 0 to 100 of projects cost that must be allocated to an agencys budget in given fiscal year therefore if project cost of 1 million is scored at 10 then 100000 of the agencys budget authority for that year must be used to cover the assessment score of 100 would mean that all 1 million would have to be covered by the agencys budget authority in the designated year each of the authorities created for the mhpi has an associated budget score see table 1 the scoring used for the mhpi was drafted to comply with the credit reform act of 1990 and the budget enforcement act of 1990 both laws were included within the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 as interpreted by office of management and budget omb circular a11 and specific mhpi guidelines issued by the omb on june 25 199712 budget impact of the use of various authorities ranges from none such as the conveyance of nonrevenue producing land or existing housing units to private developers or payment of rents by disburs ing allotments13 through moderate provision of loan guarantee is scored at between 4 and 7 of the loan amount while direct loan to contractor must be scored at 30 to 7014 to highhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31039crs10 15net present value is financial term defined as the present value of the expected future cash flows minus the cost in this case it amounts to the value today of all the monthly payments to be made on the housing unit in the future minus the value today of the money expected to be received when the unit is soldfigure 2 project financing exampleguaranteeing minimum tenant occupancy rate to mhpi housing requires that the net present value of the annual bah for that number of tenants be assigned15 because of budget scoring the mhpi tool or tools selected for employment in any given housing project have significant influence on its budgetary impact the amount of budgetary authority that must be allocated to project is direct function of those alternative authorizations either singly or in combination that are used figure 2 demonstrates alternative options for the use of authorities to fund hypothetical mhpi project and their budgetary impact in this example hypothetical housing project requires capitalization of 40 million in order to build 400 new family units the private real estate developer selected by dod to construct and manage the housing invests 4 million of his own money private developer equity and is able to arrange an additional 30 million in mortgage financing through private banks in order to complete the necessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31039crs11 funding for the project the department of defense commits itself to cover the remaining 6 million value this example presents four differe nt ways that this can be accomplished using mhpi author ities illustrating four very different effects on the dod budget option 1 in figure 2 is direct loan from the federal government to the developer under budget scoring rules the 6 million loan is scored at 50 and 3 million must be allocated to the project from the annual dod budget option 2 consists of conveying 6 million of marketvalue military family housing and land to the developer for his own use perhaps as collateral for additional private financing for the project although this represents the loss of real property to the federal inventory it has effect on the size of the federal budget deficit and budget scoring rules establish its impact on the dod budget at 0 therefore budget authority need be allocated to the project from the annual dod budget option 3 offers differential lease payments dlp direct cash rent subsidies to the developer to make up the difference between what service members would pay the amount of their bah and local market rents for equivalent housing because this increases the commercial value of the project above that of straight bah paym ents the contractor may be able to secure better terms for his private funding budget scoring requires that the net present value npv of dlp be allocated against the dod budget in this example the calculat ion incurs 5 million budgetary burden option 4 illustrates the government taking 6 million equity entering into partnership in the development project budget scoring rules require that an investment of this type be scored at 100 therefore four different alternative authorities used to cover the same 6 million development gap in construction project can have four different impacts on the dod budget in creating real mhpi

approach is in fact being used to configure solicitations to local real estate market conditions however it is noticeable that the projects principally make use of authorities of low or moderate budget scoring while none applies authorities where the budget scoring is assessed as high the largest single mhpi awarded to date the 2663 army units at ft carson colorado combines five different authorities four of these have 0 budget scoring while the fifth loan guarantee is rated low the four projects that use authorities of moderate to high budget scoring navy developments at everett i and ii corpus christi and kingsville ii cover combined total of 1027 units this suggests that the system of budget scoring combined with project size may influence the combination of incentives offered to private developers in the course of solicitation development for the status and history of all planned and awarded mhpi projects see table 2 at the end of this report issues for congress the creation of military housing has been compared to threelegged stool the first leg is the use of privately owned property in the local civilian housing market servic members not housed in governmentprovided quarters are given an appropriated addition to their basic pay in the form of housing allowance which they use to help pay for rented apartments or purchased homes the second leg is traditional construction where quarters are built by private contractors on military reservations to military specifications and paid for out of appropriated military construction funds the third leg is the construction of housing using combination of public and private capital as this pilot project explores many different ways in which public assets such as existing housing land or funds can be combined with private investment to create and operate publicprivate ventures to fill the housing needs of military members and their families number of questions arise of possible interest to congress in exercising oversight of the program what are the prospects for the mhpi over the short and the long terms the mhpi was expected to generate significant number of housing units quickly and at minimal cost in appropriated funds as became apparent during congressional consideration of the programs reauthorization this has not yet been the case the mhpi represents dramatic revision in the way military housing is created and the depar tment of defense and the individual services have had to create and adopt new ways of doing business this learning process is expected to continue throughout the program the steepness of this learning curve offers partial explanation why the original fiveyear authorization period passed without the completion of significant numbers of new housing and why the rate at which contracts have been awarded has recently accelerated projects begun between 1996 and 1999 included more than 3600 housing units during the subsequent 15 months this number almost doubled nevertheless despite mhpi s accelerated rate of development housing once it has been created must be managed and maintained and the department and services will have to learn additional skills the leasing of land to private enterprisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31039crs14 the loans made and guaranteed and the commitments to joint ventures may extend for up to halfcentury the knowhow needed to effectively manage the complex mixture of public publicprivate and private housing likely to arise from the mhpi may prove to be as challenging to master as the original contracting private developers have been screened for their willingness to provide enduring project supervision and provisions have been written into contracts to encourage adequate funding of continued operation and maintenance assessing both public and private management with respect to the quality of life afforded to the service member cost to the taxpayer longterm governmental liability and sanctions imposed for nonperformance may require years or decades tied to the issue of longterm prospects of success for the mhpi is the subsidiary question of accurately predicting the need for housing three general variables appear enter into this calculation service culture base loading and local housing availability each military service looks at the need for military housing through its own unique cultur lens for example the army places great value on its unit cohesion and one of the ways the service pursues cohesion is to encourage its soldiers to live in large government housing communities on military reservations the navy on the other hand focuses its attention on cohesion at the workplace the ship or aviation squadron and sailors are more likely than soldiers to prefer living in the local civilian community away from the military installation base loading refers to the number of military members assigned to units stationed at particular installation in areas where there are many large units assigned such as ft hood texas or the hampton roads area of virginia this number in both absolute numbers and as percentage of the total population can be quite high it is variable that can change in short order dramatically altering local military housing requirements for example the shifting of single aircraft carrier from one home port to another can force the sudden reloc ation of approximately 2000 families lost to the original port area and burdening the new one the closing of base can exert an even stronger influence on requirements by eliminating the military population altogether local housing availability is variable in two dimensions quantity and affordability some military installations have been built within metropolitan areas or have seen large populations grow up around them others are placed in sparsely populated locations where the offbase housing market is small where commercial housing is plentiful it may be beyond the means of military members to purchase or rent demand for governmentfurnished housing will be relatively high where outside housing either does not exist or is not affordable yet where vacant civilian housing is present in quantity demand for government quarters can be expected to be function of the tradeoff between market cost and military compensation as the combination of basic pay and basic allowanc for housing rises relative to local rent and mortgage costs proportionate decrease in the need for military housing can be expected taken together these factors complicate the challenge of assessing the long term prospects of success for the initiative most analysts believe its efficacy willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31039crs15 most likely become apparent only after the passage of several years of observing how its various projects evolve how can the mhpi be made more effective the different military cultures and the variety of different approac hes possible under the twelve temporary alternative authorities render even the definition of effectiveness problematic nevertheless there are two avenues that could be pursued in gauging the influence of the mhpi on military housing the first of these centers on examining the impact of budget scoring on the type of actions taken in the creati on of individual mhpi projects as indicated in table 1 mhpi agreements yet finalized involve authorities scored at high budget impact most undertakings are concentrated in authorities with little or budget impact nevertheless some of these transactions such as the conveyance to private hands of public land or existing housing units represent loss to the government of assets of real value it may be worthwhile to consider how practices encouraged by budget scoring may be exerting an artificial pressure on the crafting of business agreements omb has already adjusted some of its scoring requirements and will reexamine the entire budget scoring matrix when the 20th mhpi project is awarded 10 have been launched to date the second approach deals with traditional military constructi on practices it is not clear whether lessons learned in the creation of mhpi projects can be applied to standard military housing construction and maintenance nevertheless experience thus far has indicated that private building contractors enjoy relative freedom under the mhpi to employ local building practices materials labor etc that may not be available to them under conventional contract arrangements this raises the issue of whether or not to consider modifying orthodox construction procedures based upon practices embodied in the mhpi if the mhpi does not meet its goals are there alternatives the only definitive goal set by dod is to have all military personnel and their families adequately housed by the target date of 2010 this goal inevitably takes the form of supply and demand equation the military force structure including authorized manpower ceilings for each service army navy air force and marine corps and force composition within each service numbers of submarines vs aviation squadrons infantry vs armored division or f15 vs b2 wings make up the demand side change in any one of these factors will change the balance between supply and demand and will affect the perception of success or failure of the departments effort to meet its housing goal each service is developing its own family housing master plan which takes into account the need for housing at each military installation and which is expected to be amended when ships are shifted between home ports aircraft wings are stood up or disestablished or the missions of ground units and their locations are changed these master plans will combine tradit ional military publicprivate and private commercial efforts in their attempts to hit the moving target of installation specific housing demand careful continuous study of these master plans with theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31039crs16 expected costbenefit comparisons
