administered and enforced the immigration and nationality act ina1 and transferred most immigrationrelated functions to the newly created dhs lingering questions remain however about the di vision of authorities between doj and dhs in some areas pending legislation would amend the ina to explicitly transfer certain authorities to dhs like the establishment of dhs operation iraqi freedom had goal of protecting us national security this operation prompted congressional interest in legislation to expand the citizenship benefits of aliens serving in the military the 108th congress has enacted measure pl 108136 that amends military naturaliz ation and posthumous citizenship statutes and provides immigration benefits for immediate relatives of us citizen servicemembers who die as result of actual combat service the 108th congress is currently debating legislation that would implement recommendations of the na tional commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states also known as the 911 commission the 911 commissions immigration related recommendations focused primarily on targeting terrorist travel through an intelligence and security strategy based on reliable identification systems and effective integrated informationsharin g as congress has considered these recommendations however possible legislativ responses have broadened to include significant and

legislation and selected bills receiving action transfer of immigration authorities for decades the administrative authority to interpret implement enforce and adjudicate immigration law within the united states lay almost exclusively with one officer the attorney general the most general statement of this power was found in 103a1 of the ina the fundamental statute regulating the entry and stay of aliens with some exceptions immigration functions were delegated to ins which was headed by commissioner who re ported to the attorney general on march 1 2003 primary responsibility for securing our borders and managing the immigration process shifted to dhs this transfer was effectuated through general language in the home land security act hsa pl 107296 congress did not amend every affected section of the ina to change all references to the attorney general that were effectively superceded by the general transfer of authority however congress did amend th language of 103a of the ina first in 1102 of the hsa and later in di vision l 105 of the consolidated appropriations resolution of 2003 pl 1087 this section now states the secretary of homeland security shall be charged with the administration and enforcement of the ina and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens except insofar as th is chapter or such laws relate to the powers functions and duties conferred upon the president attorney general the secretary of state provided however that determination and ruling by the attorney general with respect to ll questions of law shall be controlling the revised language reflects the transf er of general authority but may leave certain issues unresolved first exactly what immigration powers and functions are to be retained by the attorney general laws to date make clear that the attorney general is to remain res ponsible for administrative adjudications by immigration judges and the board of immigration appeals and that determinations and rulings by the attorney general on questions of law are to be controlling however the intended extent of these and possible othe r retained powers may not be

iraq i freedom in march 2003 there has been considerable interest in legislation to expand the citizenship benefits of aliens serving in the military the reported deaths in ac tion of noncitizen so

h1b workers known as h1b dependent employers lapsed at the end of fy2003 those opposing any extension of the increas ed h1b visa ceilings or an easing of admissions requirements assert that there is compelling evidence of labor shortage in these professional areas that cannot be met by newl graduating students and the retraining of the existing us work force they argue further that the education

on nonimmigrant professional specialty h1b workers by ruth ellen wasemproponents of maintaining current h1b levels assert that the education of students and the retraining of the curre nt workforce are longterm responses to potential labor shortages and that h1b workers are essential if the united states is to remain globally competitive some proponents argue that employers should be free to hire the best people for the jobs maintaining that market forces should regulate h1b visas not an arbitrary ceiling pending bills would make various changes to current law on h1b visas s 1452hr 2849

replace them with single category covering aliens coming temporarily to the united states to perform skilled or unskilled work10 intracompany tran sfers l visas concerns have been voiced that the l visa category which allows executives and managers of multinational corporations to work temporarily in the united states is being misused this visa category permits multinational firms to transfer toplevel personnel to their locations in the united stat for five to seven years intracompany transfers enter on l1 visas and their spouses and children enter on l2 visas although the number of l visas l1s and l 2s combined issued has tripled in the past 20 years the number of l visas that the department of state issued in fy2002 112624 is down from high of 120538 in fy2001 some are now charging that firms are using the l visa to transfer rank and file professional employees rather than limiting these transfers to toplevel personnel thus circumventing immigration laws aimed at protecting us employees from the potential adverse employment effects associated with an increase in the number of foreign workers proponents of current law maintain that any restrictions on l visas would prompt many multinational firms to leave the united states as well as undermine reciprocal agreements that currently permit us corporations to transfer their employees abroad legislation that

states indefinitely these fta provisions on the temporar entry of business personnel and professional workers are raising concerns among many in the field of immigration because immigration law traditionally is spe lled out by congress not the executive branch some assert that the us trade representative ustr negotiated these immigration provisions wit hout any authority or direction from congress this assertion implies that the ustr did not honor its obligations of the fast track authority found in the trade promotion authority objectives of the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 to regularly and formally consult with congress during the fta negotiations in return for expedited legisl ative procedures which among other things bar amendments to the fta enabling legi slation more generally some point out that these provisions would constrain cu rrent and future congresses when they consider revising immigration law on busine ss personnel treaty i nvestors and traders intracompany transfers and professional workers because the united states would run the risk of violating the ftas the ustr maintains that the temporary entry of professionals falls within trade promotion authority objectives regarding th opening of foreign country markets for us services and investment and th at ensuring crossborder mobility of professionals and other busine ss persons is critical for us companies in developing new markets and business opportunities abroa d the ustr further argues that the temporary business personnel provisions in the ftas are not immigration policy because they only affect temporary entry the ustr points out that it issued notice of intent to negotiate provisions to fac ilitate the temporary entry of business persons in october 2001 and that it briefed congressional staff on the fta provisions on numerous occasions guest worker programs currently the united states has two main programs for temporarily importing lowskilled workers sometimes
