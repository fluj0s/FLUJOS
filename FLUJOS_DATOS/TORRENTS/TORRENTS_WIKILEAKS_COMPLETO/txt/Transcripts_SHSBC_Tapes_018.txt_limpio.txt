mutual rudiments lecture given on 20 june 1961 thank you give her the applause shes doing all the work i dont know how she does it i think shes got you all fooled ive seen her tremendously popular ive seen her step up on congress stage and i didnt think anybody on the whole continent had ever heard of her you know and you know for the local assoc sec everybody applauds you know little bit and everybody applauds and applauds for the others and all of sudden you introduce mary sue and the chandeliers jump you know i dont know how she does it im sure that being very excellent d of p always getting results all that sort of thing i dont think that has much to do with it its the prevailing opinion in most central organizations and scientology areas current moment that getting tremendous results and big wins has nothing to do with administration or income or keeping the show on the road or doing anything about the world and this we are trying to change and one of the things this saint hill course is devoted to is trying to change just that okay now lets see this when i last looked it might have changed since i came down here but it was the 20th of june when i was upstairs and it was 1961 but looking around here i see that it isnt 1961 in couple of cases now i see note here that question has been asked sufficiently of mary sue that she wants this answered by in this briefing lineup she says when doing i havent read this in advance when doing security check dont just keep repeating the same question allowing the person to say i dont know vary questions so as to give the pc hand returning always of course to your original question in the security check oh man this is wideopen invitation to q and like i was talking to you about the other day and every time auditors get turned loose on varying the question tremendous amount of randomity enters into auditing and tremendous auditing failures occur madly in all directions so when i tell you that this is something you have to know very well the difference between varying question and qandaing with the pc now if you can get that down you can really do redhot security check but let tell you that this has been very difficult point to get across now ill give you try to give you couple of examples here off the bat that are like this auditor have you ever stolen any cats pc well i dont know auditor having seen reaction on the meter well do you know anybody that has stolen any cats the pc says yes my aunt once stole some cats the auditor what was her name now that is q and in the first place who does it what does it matter who else stole some cats were not auditing his aunt well we couldnt care about this this is not varied question the next point is that is direct q and now q and is defined this way the reason it exists it is question and answer but there is technical fact that the perfect answer to any question is the question it is colloquially used this is the philadelphia congress of 1953 philadelphia congress fall 1953 took this up completely and its never been mentioned since it is an oddity and perfectly worthwhile one to know that the perfect answer to any question of course is the question therefore when the question is phrased exactly right it answers itself this is the engineers version of this theres fellow by the name of ninetynine percent johnson at mit and every student from time immemorial called the man ninetynine percent i dont know that he ever knew this but he was fond of saying the question which is asked right is already 99 percent answered and this is very true you can take an engineering problem or any other kind of problem or human problem if theres any vast difference and if you can ask the right question the exact question its already practically answered youre trying to lay out let us say the location of serving equipment or something in hotel kitchen and you keep pushing escalators and dumb waiters and so forth around on your drawing paper you see and you get this and so on and you finally wake up and say well what the hell am i doing here you know this is all good thing to do sooner or later after youve been working on some problem it hasnt solved itself in few hours or days why what am i doing just what am i doing and that is an awfully good question and you suddenly wake up to the fact that what you have been doing is arranging machinery but what you are really doing is trying trying to arrange serving equipment in hotel kitchen and you say well what am i doing you see and the answer is what am i trying to arrange or what am i trying to get accomplished and these questions are different questions and you all of sudden say well ah yes im trying to get food im not fooling with an engineering dra this is why theres very few good layout engineers or very few good design engineers countrys mechanical progress goes along as fast as it gets good design engineers by the way and theyre accidentally only as fast as or only as good as they are able to ask questions of themselves or their work or the world at large and smart one will go down after hes worked with this for long time and he cant seem to get all his pantry equipment in straight hes liable to get the actually brilliant idea of going down and finding the man whos going to use it and asking him what do you try to do in kitchen you see in gettingwhat arewhat are you trying to do in kitchen and the fellow gives him this terrific revelatory answer you see which is well were preparing food for the guests huuuu thats new one see aw then all of this stuff ive been fooling with on the drawing board you mean im trying to get food from the kitchen to how many rooms how many dining rooms well theres eight private dining rooms theres the staff dining room theres the main dining room for hotel guests theres public dining room and all the food comes from this one galley this one kitchen here and it all goes the guy says yeah now lets see youre trying to get food there what condition must the food be in when it arrives well the guy says well it must be hot it must be still crisp it must be this it must be that it must be easily identified and it must be very rapid and there must be place down here for the cooks to get orders to put it together and throw it up onto things and then it can be recovered and shunted oh the fellow says what you need is an ibm sorting system the fellow says an ibm sorting system in hotel kitchen what are you talking about and the dining engineer says thats what you need thats what youre going to get too and then so all of sudden mysteriously at the conrad the conrad filcher new hotel in glasgow which never before has it ever happened that anybody in the dining room ever got anything to eat all of sudden this starts occurring and everybody gets very happy all up and down the lines and so forth why cause somebody asked the right question thats all well old ninetynine percent johnsonhe claimed that if you phrased the question that you were asking exactly right that it was instantly answerable see well theoretically the 100 percent not the 99 but the 100 percent answer to how is the weather today is how is the weather today see thats perfect duplication on the causedistanceeffect communication line in scientology see so how is the weather todayhow is the weather today now thats the 100 percent what youre trying to do is come as close to the 100 percent as you can you want this withhold so its what am i trying to do im trying to get the notknows that this character is running on the world off of the case so that hell brighten up and get on the run see what am i doing here thats the first thing youve got to ask yourself now that you know i told you just the other day this is why you are giving security check not to be nosy not to make people feel embarrassed and not because ron said so see but actually to get the characters to release these tremendous overts of notknowingness because its got them parked in total stupidity youre not running failed withhold on the pc you are running overts called keep em stupid got it now when he stole something it disappeared and its owner couldnt find it and tremendous notknow was entered into the owners sphere of livingness right its an overt to hell with whether or not mest passed that is the basic overt so when you make these things known and scrape them out of the pcs reactive bank and get them up into his zone of knowingness you raise of course his intelligence therefore you raise his knowingness therefore his responsibility comes up enormously right processing in general raises his responsibility and throws these notknowingnesses into restimulation and unless they are released or vented then the pc does not make any further progress and the fastest way in the world to stop pcs progress is to do lousy security check now you can audit with your finger just exactly properly correctly held in holding the emeter you can say all the right incantations and rituals you can have incense in your electrodes swinging from right to left in rhythmic way you can do your auditing with the proper latin chant going in the background matter how good this auditing is matter how expertly you have assessed your pc matter how minutely you have followed through the auditing command and cleared each one matter how well youve gotten the rudiments off you are still going to run into this one youre going to get that case along just few yards up the line and youve increased his responsibility to point where his overts now hurt these withholds these notknowingness overts now hurt because youre increasing his knowingness so therefore theyre being revealed to him and theyre notknowingnesses and he cannot vent these things and he cant get rid of it and that notknowingness just stays like cyst in his mind see his case progress stops right there boom this makes another method of stopping case progress one of those methods is to audit with rudiment out the way you can deteriorate case is to audit with an arc break in existence case will deteriorate with the arc break present time problem the case will not change with withhold on the case will not change and by failing to give expertly administered security checks at routine and regular intervals throughout processing you stop the overall progress of the case just as though you had let him run into the bumpers on the end of train track hes going to get unhappy and the better you audit from there on the unhappier hes going to get why because auditing begins to hurt so he all of sudden realizes that it wasnt smart thing to do to jilt these nine girls in high school that he really upset them that years afterwards actually he found out that hed made tramp out of couple of them you know and this was not smart youre auditing away on the failed sneeze and he all of sudden goes uuuuu youre asking this boy to confront his life arent you well the reason he didnt ever get well in the past automatically was because it was too painful to take responsibility for the things he had done it hurt so hed take his theetieweetie dale carnegie dramamine pills and get to feeling little bit better and hed go thumm this by the way is the manicdepressive he feels wonderful until he suddenly realizes he has an overt so he feels lousy then he recovers from this and then he feels wonderful till he realizes this same overt again well it just will keep going in the same stupid dizzy cycle on and on and on and on itll never release so when scientology got hot and its case advances got rapid all of sudden this new factor showed up and it was brandnew factor that cases exceeded could be made to exceed through auditing their ability to tolerate their improved condition and what you had to do was let the steam off and the mechanism to let the steam off that was absolutely necessary in this particular case was what were calling security checks more properly called processing checks and unless those are given well wow youre just going to park case and your rudiments can be out and you wont get gains on the case you can have wrong assessment thatd really be nice way to get gain on case and you can fail to give security checks properly and man then youll get gain on case beyond certain zone why does this fellows leg hurt you audit it it feels better and then the next day it hurts why well you audited it up to point where he could recognize his responsibility for it and then you didnt give him any chance to come off of it isnt this cute isnt that fascinating about the cruelest thing you could do to case would be leave its withholds on it for any reason under the sun not to clean up this cases withholds now we found that auditors dont do well when theyre just turned loose to ask do you have any withholds thank you do you have any withholds thank you do you have any withholds thank you do you have any withholds thank you they dont do well this way so you have security check that particularizes all types of withholds as matter of fact there are some new security checks we were dreaming them up the other day i said there could be security checks jan got real busy dick got real busy and man they really whipped you up some security checks theres some staff member security checks theres an hgc pc security check academy student security check the staff member security check isnt being yet but the others are now thats just particularized types of withholds that would be if any of them were outits like rudiments if any of those were live the case would only do so much advance and then stop advancing unless that withhold is gotten off in other words the case is going to stop in its advance right there screaming brakes boom do you see this why because the auditing increases his ability to take responsibility his ability to take responsibility blows into view the withholds as soon as the withhold comes into view to him if he has chance to impart this withhold oh hes miserable so of course he says id feel better if i were aberrated and hes absolutely right hed feel much better being stupid and aberrated and president you got the idea i mean he halts his own forward progress and theres the primary reason why you had clear slumps thats the reason for your clear slumps not the guy postulating himself into the ground he ran into his own bank he had to confront it all at once and gradually as time went on i said there was settling out period for clear well if any time during that settling out period he all of sudden found himself confronted with the tremendous irresponsibilities of his own background and it became too painful he said i better be aberrated absence of security check then is the most effective way of halting rapid case gain toward clear have you got that this was bug we used to have another mechanism and actually have had for seven years another mechanism which we used rather constantly and we dont find it in our midst right now we used to do this with responsibility process of one version or another confront or responsibility you got it we used to accomplish less ably the same mechanism unless you ran responsibility on an engram we used to say why it wouldnt stay stably gone okay you remember that all right well now that was the same mechanism at work there but not well articulated not well understood and so forth now weve got another mechanism that supplants that and that does it thousand times better so youve got to learn how to use that ably but just as the pc does not clear up well on have you got withhold thank you have you got withhold thank you have you got withhold thank you have you got withhold thank you have you got withhold thank you have you got with you know you can run him for week and half on that process with difficulties whatsoever they did it on the 22nd american didnt you and it didnt arrive anywhere all right why well the pc is trying to avoid all of his withholds and if the auditor cant remember all of the viciousness of man all the time you then dont get any interrogation which results in release of the exact withholds the pc is withholding so this is fast presession 37 went back to the oxcart you know we relegated it to the metropolitan museum i heard from them today by the way or yesterday and i find out they have all the art objects of any kind that they will ever need and know all there is to know about the whole track and im on an awful withhold today from the metropolitan museum on two or three occasions ive been doing work with scientology organizations and other things sitting up at my desk talking to peter doing other things and its terrible temptation to write them and say congratulations you know congratulations upon the abundance and finality of all of your collections how id come to hear from this id asked them an embarrassing question or two and i found out that they dont need anything in their museum nothing theyve got everything i wasnt trying to give them anything i was i thought that there was possibility that there was place they might get something and we find out they have everything they want i think thats pretty good isnt it its like some selfsatisfied pc and youll get this selfsatisfied pc that doesnt want to improve well why doesnt he want to improve because it might be painful and something might show up you would have to audit the curators combined and collected of the metropolitan museum and get off their whole track overts before they would accept the specimens that they ought to have in the metropolitan museum of art of new york city because it shows up grandly that these characters are restimulated by the crown jewels of ophir because they of course stole them once thats why theyre there theyre now in the valence of the brass watchdog they used to have on them but any more collection would lead to more knowingness and more knowingness to these characters because of the peculiarity of their position might be painful so we have whole societies becoming very selfsatisfied about what they know they know all there is to know about everything that is mechanism lets not run into the pain of having taken responsibility for what weve done if we knew that it would be painful so therefore if we know more it might be possible that we would come to know that too and if we came to know that then that would be very painful so wed better keep telling everybody well psychology thats hahahahahehheh that thats thats the kind of science we want hahahahehheh doesnt reveal anything ughugh yeah thats what we want nice nice stupid sort of thing you know and the more stupid the people we can get in it why the happier well all be thats true too the crazier theyll all stay thats true too and the crazier theyll get thats true too so pcs play this game on you just like societies do and youll find the pc sitting there dianetics 1950 that was enough for him that was it hes got it doesnt care to know anything since doesnt care to know anything since thats it why it might be painful if he found out his own overts if he knew little bit more about the mind he might find out about overts and so you had something on the order of third to half of the people who were interested in dianetics 1950 and so forth very content to stick with that level of it and not at all willing to advance up into scientology do you remember that as phenomenon in the states it was interesting wasnt it male voice yes all right thats the mustntknowanymore factor now the mustntgainanymore factor and the mustntknowanymore factor is something that you as an auditor can qanda with the pc with if you yourself arent getting auditing and getting off your withholds then youre liable to get into situation where if this pc found out more itd be very painful so the kind thing to do is not to do anything else but just say the process lets do the minimum lets do the minimum so when we ask have you ever stolen any cats the pc gets fall on the meter and it says i dont know do the minimum the minimum is have you ever stolen any cats and the pc says i dont know and so you do the minimum and you say have you ever stolen any cats believe youre just going to get nowhere from there on that is the slow way to go about it but youve found nice eddy from the mainstream of life and you can sit there under the banks with the willow trees full of pigeons and use it as repetitive question the security check is not repetitive question process its not now because you might qanda your instructors dont get enthusiastic about turning auditors loose with this so we get the have you ever stolen any cats fall what was that now well uh hmm uh i dont know well have you ever stolen any cats see thats the extreme one i dont know have you ever stolen any cats repetitive question all right now heres the next version have you ever stolen any cats this is q and i dont know well what was that fall uh well uh hmm i dont know uh well has your has do you know anybody that has ever stolen any cats the pc says oh yes my aunt stole some cats now well uh what was your aunts name now of course this is the same mechanism as the repetitive question this again blocks any further knowing on this line which we all know will be painful but in security check this is the only way to take the pain off the only way you can reduce the pain of this additional knowingness is give decent security check so the q and isis wellpoorly situated so what do we get here have you ever stolen any cats what is your aunts name where did she live do you remember what she used to wear have you got picture of your aunt there uh do you have picture of the house how long did you live with your aunt do you have any of the illnesses your aunt had that is mechanism of denying further knowledge because you dont get any more knowledge on the subject of has the pc ever stolen any cats and thats all you want to find out so now here is nonqanda knowledgeable advance version of this and heres heres heres the way itd go have you ever stolen any cats pc gets fall says i dont know and you say well what was the fall and the pc says well i dont know because i have never stolen any cats all right now theres dozen things you can do but they all have to do with the direct and immediate question of the cats and the pc having stolen them not his aunts cousins sisters or the moon now the way to illuminate this the first rule dont try to do this by rules but rule that goes back of this is compartment the question thats one of the nice handy good things to do with any security question youre asking somebody have you ever have you ever been in dc before the pc falls off the pin and you say well when was that that you were there before and you dont get reaction and its all very mysterious and gets very confused dc were the initials of davy crockett the pc is in full restim on this so whenever you say dc to the pc you mean washington dc and he means davy crockett and believe youre not getting anywhere all right so you ask the question something of this order have you ever stolen reaction any cats reaction well what gives with you and cats have you ever stolen any cats reaction any cats reaction have you ever stolen reaction phuh promptly the whole thing clarified what gives with this cat cats yuuuhh well what about cats thhuhhh now youre pressing the button that the meter fell on and its awfully smart to stand there with the unlimited switchboard of the pc and your great big wide thumb you need bartender thumbs see from the motherlode district they used to hire bartenders with inchbroad thumbs because drink was pinch and the bartender would reach into the prospectors poke with his thumb and forefinger to take out the pinch of gold for the drink so theyd get this inchwide thumbs you know well you need these great big inchwide thumbs actually to run this here switchboard called the pc its not just the emeter and what youre trying to do is find out what is the meter falling on and you may come to one of two conclusions that its falling on one or more parts of the question or that its falling on the question now its falling on something in the question theres nothing mysterious about this you dont have to clarify the question on this basis of well are you allergic to cats have cats often disturbed your sleep once more youre off the line because youre trying to find out what the pc has withheld about cats and by compartmenting the question have you ever stolen thats null why are you pursuing this question then have you ever stolen cats as long as you get fall on cats so this kind of questioning opens up whats cat and you find cat is feline object that has long teeth and is colored purple and is very often forty feet high and is used to moor ships and you say aw come off it so you clarify the question and you say the whole question again because this was the question you were trying to clear have you ever stolen any cats in this lifetime fall go to the next question all right you say whats cats clarification the emeter says there are certain parts of the question that are alive or all of the question is live so its up to you to find out what part of the question is burning and then take your bartender thumb and step on that button hard hard hard hard and the pc all of sudden says all right all of my life i havent been able to understand cats i just havent been able to do anything about cats thats all i can do is just every time i see cat heh i used to keep this holland and holland 50caliber elephant gun and every time i heard cat meowing outside i would shoot him hooh or you hear something remarkable well i used to have trap in the backyard and whenever cat would get into it i would take him down in the basement where nobody could hear him and i would cut his paws off one after the other and ive begun to realize recently that this probably isnt nice now the emeter says theres buttons to be pressed and you in your interrogation are only trying to find out what button exactly what is the button so for while you press with your bartender thumb and then you take your little finger which has long pointed chinese fingernail that you can actually press very delicately and you press the exact combination and the pc goesboom and its in hurry it happens fast you say have you ever pdhed anyone and you get big fall well for gods sakes say have you ever you get fall have you ever have you ever get fall and get fall all right pdhed someone pdhed someone null well have you ever what what what for pity sakes have you ever what huhi was afraid youd ask that see it means something exactly and immediately and directly to the pc and he finally tells you its just you asking all the time have you ever have you ever have you ever have you ever and i have never and you say all right what have you never if thats the button ive never had nerve enough to ask girl i havent dared tell anybody bang youve sprung the trap you see how that would work it is matter actually of not playing any instrument more complicated than onefinger version of home sweet home and god save the queen on piano and you can even play it out of tune and still get it done but you will never get it if you do this other thing either you just take responsibility for getting the question answered and you say have you ever stolen cats dont know thank you have you ever stolen cats have you ever stolen cats have you ever stolen did you ever hear of this process have you ever stolen cats ive never heard of this process ive read all my bulletins and i dont read it in them anyplace have you ever stolen any cats such process so it certainly is not repetitive question the other way of debarring information is to waaander you see here sits this console keyboard in front of your face and lights are lighting up you know like pinball machine you know the meter is saying somethings hot somethings hot somethings hot somethings hot emergency emergency there is smoke in number ten compartment and you say well well what do you know well this is time to say well theres too much motion in that thing i think ill put that aside and well go on with this calm thing of finding out because i very well suspect that he doesnt like pea soup i think so and i think ive found the person here in his aunt who made pea soup i think ill just find that out now and this poor console is sitting over here and smoke in number ten compartment smoke in number eight compartment smoke in number two compartment smoke in the engine room abandon ship abandon ship you know and you say well its got too much motion in it lets get rid of that thing and lets carry on something here with true professional mien that has dignity and aplomb and lets not get into any of this wild excitement because it can get pretty exciting its like if you dont know how to interrogate on an emeter you can get the emeter to say anything anything anything you can say that its pdhed the pc and so forth just by associated think because it falls on this it falls on that it falls on something else you find out what its falling on you got that now we had somebody the other day who had the word shop mixed up with business got the idea so its good thing to say whats shop you take everything apart almost syllable by syllable if youre having any trouble and give them each one of these things and you say aha thats hot and thats hot and thats hot and these three things added up together make something else now what gives here see and the person says shop shop well shop thats business what kind of business well thats an administrative office shop is oh it is and right away why the interrogation of course narrows down promptly and instantly and your taking something on the order of twentyfive hours to clear question is bad comment on your ability to compartment question and to step on the buttons because the pc is very often quite willing to answer your questions if you ask them so if you dont ask the right question youre not going to get right answer follow that now this is very true in fact nearly all of your security checks depend utterly on your skill in taking apart each question asking the fringe questions necessary to it now what do i mean by fringe question well your fringe questions actually occur after youve taken the question apart you say have you ever stolen cat have you ever stolen cat cat is dumb numb you get reaction on it you get latent reaction pooh ignore it have you ever stolen and the pc says really and so on you say well you ever stolen he said aw come off of it get good get good right at that point have you ever been accused of stealing yes yes yes and i didnt do it i didnt do it i i really didnt do it and nobodyll believe and so forth well were you lying at the time well yes i was smooth swift resolution of withholds depends upon the auditor asking the right question youve got to be right there on the ball the pc actually needs help because the thing is still about twothirds or better in his reactive sphere he is not very conscious of what it is the borderline between the reactive mind and the analytical mind is the broad savanna of i dont know and when something moves out of the reactive mind of total unknown it moves into the foggy mist that is coming up off the bayous and its just mist the pc needs help it isnt this kind of situation you say have you ever stolen cat instantly name rank serial number of all cats stolen appear magically and go by in little railroad car and all he has to do is read them off well that isnt what happens you say have you ever stolen cat the reactive mind says weve had it boys and so forth and goes clamp and the mist goes up and the pc says whooooooooooo because there he is attached into the i dont know of reactivity you see and he says whoooo wait minute wait minute whoowhoooo whatwhats going on here phoo just moment ago i could look clear out there and i could see the palm trees and the city in the distance and theres nothing now but this horrible miasma which is coming up around and so forth smelling of dead fish i wonder what this is hes wondering what it is as well as you are you see but its just moved into view he knows something is there you ask the question again it clarifies the question little bit but thats about all youd ever accomplish on repetitive question you say what fog are you in mutt and of course this machine is going to tell him tell you and tell him because have you ever stolen cat pang cat well what gives with cats what have you done to cats what have you done to cats pow see what have you done to cats ohohohoh fellow says didnt amount to very much never felt bad about it before this just doesnt seem right right now but when we were little boys why we used to lower them into boiling oil an inch at time because their screams annoyed our mothers and i dont think that was so good get the idea and right away why your security check picks up in velocity picks up in velocity picks up in velocity you got it you must also be able to compartment goals question all of these things are subject to compartmentation you got it all right so much for that all right theres one other thing i want to talk to you about i have just discovered something of magnitude this is magnitudinous cum laude ne plus ultra discovery that ranks with cognition on the part of one of our early pcs its big kidding we for long time have known there was difficulty in some coaudit teams for long time knew there was difficulty in coaudit team they make slower progress they sometimes kind of went out of this world and they would go on grinding grinding grinding grinding and per hour of auditing their auditing was less effective than hgc auditing or something like this you see its been big mystery and this has been on the track for years and years and years and years they make slow progress and i found the answer to it and the answer you wouldnt really suspect now the first inroad i had on this why do they go so slow the first clue i had for this was that when d of p checks the rudiments on an auditors pc he often finds them out even that the rudiments are out even when the auditor having just checked them found them in this is rather constant this is rather constant all right take it from there this has led ds of p into the belief that the auditors were careless and couldnt run rudiments and has lessened executive opinion of auditing ability and has lessened instructor opinion of auditing ability and so forth the truth is that the rudiments werent out with the auditor because that auditing crew grinding together even so much as twentyfive hours can develop mutual set of rudiments this is the dizziest thing you ever heard of and yet this phenomenon exists they develop mutual rudiments and their mutual rudiments are out the rudiments they have in common are flat to each other but not to anybody else and they make solid small island in the middle of the sea of notknow where they dont have their rudiments out to each other but their rudiments are out to the rest of the world now lets get good one on this lets get good one on this they are both agreed that the family of one of them are bunch of swine so of course rudiment really goes out on the subject of the family because the pc is in perfect agreement with the auditor and the auditor is in perfect agreement with the pc about the family being bunch of swine but somebody else comes along and checks the rudiment and what does he find he finds theres fall on family because hes not part of the agreement you got that hes not part of the agreement this is quite remarkable its almost as if the auditor is saying now has anything unusual or is there anything unusual going on about the family and the pc says its just the same old grind the stinking swine the skunks are just the same as ever and the auditor knows theyre swine so he says hes out with them too you see and he says well all right well theres nothing new or unusual about that and of course theres been fall on the meter why is there fall on the meter because the meter registers disagreement and you have pair of people who are in perfect agreement and its as simply mechanically as that dont you see now this is the dizziest one that has ever come up and you know ive been tracking this thing and sneaking up on the edges of this thing and sniffing at spoor seen in the far veldt for years why didnt coaudit teams make more progress or more rapidly because actually their arc should build up easier and they know each others cases better every reason in the world why they should get along well well i attributed it to marked degree with the fact that they had spats and upsets with each other and arc breaks with each other and theyd chew each other up but therefore husbandwife teams had liability or guyandgirlfriend teams had liability you see that the two something like this that isnt the answer that isnt the answer because auditors have these things with pcs too anyway the answer is mutual rudiments now theres dozen ways to solve it the most thorough way to solve it is do new do an oldtime formula 13 list of all the people you know in the physical universe at this present time lets make list of them and now lets run them each and individually lets assess the list for fall and then lets run something on that person and then lets assess it again for another fall and run something on that person assess it again for another fall have you got the idea and just clean up all these people irrespective of whether one agrees with this or not now one of the things odd about this i must mention it in passing is the reason i never noticed it is suzie and i never have this trouble this is one one spot where weve evidently had variation of some kind or another from the norm were both sufficiently coldblooded about auditing that is to say auditing is auditing you see and evidently theres recognition that if you feel bad about something or somebody whether it is agreed with or not it will show up and i will go in like small or very large pavementbreaker one of these widowmaking drills they use to bust up concrete you know and ill finally say all right what is it what is it i dont have an arc break with the maid i dont have one and so on and i can understand it perfectly that the maid is probably giving her bad time and that sort of thing but i dont buy it because she i know she probably has an arc break with the maid and i want to clear it up with the maid you see something like this so ill keep on going on with the pneumatic drill and i will finally spade up the fact that agreed upon or not yes and actually knock out the mutualagreement factor practically every time and so forth and shell do the same thing you got an arc break well thats it you know an arc break with is an arc break with and an arc break is an arc break so i was slow to notice this i dont say were better than others but weve coauditing has its adventurous aspects you know the auditor who has just run all of the mean vicious violent things he has ever done to the pc out of the pc has had to sit there tamely listening to the damnedest distortions the wildest interpretations of things he never could have been guilty of you see and the and on the reversewise why it goes reverse end to but for the twentyfour hours after that session the auditor willynilly will be rather cool but the pc in this case is galumphing up and down the halls feeling sprightly and wonderful to get rid of all of that burden of woe and then they get to the next session and now the pc is the auditor and the guy goes in sits down suddenly settles into the irresponsibility of being pc and starts to give hell say well goddamn you some polite opening you get this kind of notion well its real bravery its real bravery the only time you cant make it is when one party is just wont audit wont do any auditing and wont be audited and thats total impasse and those people are nuts anyway so hell you could probably even do it with the cchs but the point im talking about is that coaudit can have its ups and downs and i thought these ups and downs of you know the overts and the withholds and the this and the that and now all is revealed and that is why all during 1957 you treated like hound dog oohhhh kidding and youd been out with that guy five times and didnt even tell you see this kind of thing blaahhh you know that gets rough all right now what do you do what do you do it must be that that was keeping coauditing teams from advancing well it wasnt that was just so dramatic and it was so well known that it looked logical and the thing that slows down coauditing team is the mutual rudiments out they have an agreedupon regard toward the rest of the world and they begin to settle more and more into this agreedupon thats the way things are and so their rudiments arent out to each other the first way of blowing it up as i say formula 13 even oldstyle formula 13 or prehav 13 you take an assessment of everything everybody the person knows in the physical universe and you assess them all for the heaviest terminal at the moment run that terminal on the prehav scale preferably with twoway command what have you done to them what have they done to you that sort of thing you know twoway command at whatever the level they assessed at see not fiveway bracket but just twoway bang you find out itll knock out fairly rapidly prehav scale is very powerful you dont even make twentyminute test on that sort of thing you know thats you just take the needle action out of it and go on to the next person and assess them and you just clean up everybody they knew in the physical universe in this particular fashion that is new formula 13 thats prehav 13 all right theres another simpler way of doing it is just substitute we for you in the model session rudiments beginning and end rudiments and you wont find those rudiments are now calm just substitute we have we got an arc break and youll find out that all of sudden the thing livens up and becomes very wild weve got an arc break but i havent got an arc break dont you see its an incorrect question its very sequitur to what else i was telling you about security checks its an incorrect question you say have you got an arc break he hasnt got an arc break weve got an arc break you see but i havent got an arc break that you dont know about and you would agree perfectly with this arc break that ive had because all day long salesmen have kept coming to the door and you know how busy the place can get around here and i have an awful arc break with salesmen that might be the actual answer but you say do you have an arc break with anybody today the pc knows that the auditor would totally understand that salesmen interrupting every fifteen minutes when theyre trying to get something done would be very annoying and hed say well thats too bad but he knows also thats usual and the present time problems are usual and the arc breaks are usual and the withholds that they have mutually are all usual and their opinions of other people are all usual and their unkind thoughts are all usual and so they dont fall on the meter and that is quite discovery and you can count on the fact this isnt just coauditing team this is any auditing team thats been going longer than twentyfive hours it happens that fast it happens in hgcs all the time somebody has been going for hundred hours and the d of p calls him in checks the rudiments to find all the rudiments out yeah but theyre not out for the auditor and the auditorll stand there practically jibbering youve seen them you know and they say but the rudiments they always say the same thing the same words but i just checked them before i came down here and they werent out and the d of p thinks an unkind thought about the auditor and says ill bet you did you knucklehead or something like that or maybe he didnt think that exact question or that exact answer but its something like well yes yes well have to get some more expert auditing done here hes kind of actually that was totally incorrect judgment it was absolutely true the rudiments were checked and they werent out and he came down to the d of p and the d of p checked them and boy were they out now we made enormous progress in the south african acc 3rd south african by making everybody all the students were checking the rudiments of all the other students pcs and pointing it out with nasty long bony and critical finger in other words on an auditing team we were routinely making other students do d of p checks on other auditors pcs and we were making very nice progress and i thought this would be good idea in case any of those people ever got to be auditors or ds of ps they would know what this was all about and itd already had the advantage of doing police job you see on the thing and there was an accidental lying in that whole thing there was an accidental but it is the mutual the mutual rudiment and that could hold up cases that could keep them from advancing that could get them all upset that could just slow it down to walk you got the idea so i found new method of slowing down auditing just get into total agreement with your pc that his viewpoints against life and get in total agreement with your auditor that this viewpoint against life is ordinary and usual and therefore isnt out but would be considered unusual by somebody else so if somebody else checks the rudiments of course theyre out and if the auditor checks the rudiments theyre in you got that thats sneaky one isnt it well you should think it was sneaky because let tell you it has taken i dont know how many years i dont know how many years this observation has been made by or how often and i looked that over and my eyes popped and i said by golly heres this old problem sitting here in front of again that ive tried to solve time and time again maybe id better look it over little more closely and just the night before i had checked coaudit team where this exact thing had occurred again and i just looked at it and i said oh wow now what is this theres something here and then mary sue i was checking rudiments on mary sue with her auditor and they were out and then she gave some data about this other team and all of sudden i said oh and thats the way it is thats the way it is it just fell out of the hamper just like that you see it dont you its perfectly crystal clear whatll happen youve got an island against the storm of the world and it doesnt react to the rest of the world after while because of course the emeter reacts only on disagreement got it three solutions i repeat three solutions old formula 13 the failedhelp proposition on everybody you know under the sun moon or stars thats the longer one but very thorough and i point out that the first clear made in south africa had fifty hours of formula 13 immediately before she came on course not bad process huh all right the next one next one would be to do prehav 13 which is just prehav formula 13 which is just to make list of everybody they know assess the terminals very rapidly take the one who falls the most on that particular assessment assess it then on the prehav scale form twoway command for that particular level run the needle action just that soon as the needle is still on this person you ask them again how do you feel about this person you get twitch come off of it right now do another terminal assessment take that terminal do another primary prehav scale assessment form another command for that particular level youve now found this next person at run the needle action out until you can say how do you feel about joe and they say oh i feel all right and the needle the needle now doesnt react on joe that might happen you know in five minutes or fifteen minutes or an hour or two hours or its very undetermined period of time so you ask the question often how do you feel about joe now all youre trying to do is clear joe as mutual rudiment youre not trying to run processes here you see youre trying to clean this persons arc breaks out of existence as rudiment and what youre doing is broadening the question do you have an arc break and youre broadening this question to include everybody they could possibly have an arc break with in present time and youre just running youre assuming theyre all these people might have arc breaks and youre clearing all these people off for the immediate lifetime and then the pc doesnt get arc breaks and interrupt the auditing and the case doesnt worsen and it speeds up okay there is that prehav 13 okay the next one is very fast one maybe not as good but certainly more broadly applicable is do we have an arc break with anyone see do we have present time problem got it is it all right if we audit in this room you got it now do we have withhold you got that this is sparked up by the fact that i found out there was another pc who is having difficulty and is worried about security checking because he thinks he is holding some data that has to do with another person that might be discreditable in some fashion well part of the data is correct and part of the data is false but this pc has not bothered to clarify this data but is afraid of being security checked to protect somebody else interesting state of affairs now this could be broadened up into basis where they have to have special auditing team this fellow has to be specially security checked by some special person and now the two of them think theyre going to make some progress let tell you theyre not going to make any progress because we now have withhold do you see that clearly so the road out is not special security check by special person so that all will not be revealed i happen to know by the way that about threequarters of the data which this pc thinks he has is lot of bunk so hes not only holding on to something that way but hes also holding on to something thats highly fallacious well boy how about how about having delusion as withhold pretty grim huh thats what this person is doing so you got this mutual rudiments out and i think we can end right now lot of slow gain on the part of an awful lot of longdrawn coaudit teams and we can also end slow gain in hgcs when the auditing goes up to hundred hours or something like this or fifty hours after about twentyfive hours youve got unit there youve got an agreed unit the auditor agrees that the pc has been treated badly and the pc agrees this and so on and they agree so thoroughly that its never fall on the meter okay all right youre welcome to that one and were already overdue so go and get your mutual rudiments in thank you
