tax on corporate profitsthe corporate income taxthat is separate and generally in addition to the individual income taxes that corporate stockholders pay on their corporatesource capital gains and dividends the corporate income tax applies 35 rate to most corporate taxable income although reduced rates ranging from 15 to 34 apply to corporations earning smaller amounts of income the base of the tax is corporate profits as defined by the tax codegenerally gross revenue minus interest wages the cost of purchased inputs and an allowance for depreciation since 1980 federal corporate tax revenue has generally varied between 1 and just over 2 of gross domestic product gdp congressional budget office cbo data show that corporate tax receipts registered an uptick in fiscal years fy 2005 and 2007 rising to 23 and 27 of gdp respectivelyan increase cbo attributed primarily to strong economic growth however cbo also projects corporate tax revenue to recede in future years to level closer to its longterm average 2 cbo data show similar trend regarding corporate tax receipts as share of total taxes with an uptick in fy2005 and fy2007 from 129 to144 of total federal revenues cbo again projects the percentage of total revenue from corporate tax revenue to recede to its historical share3 not all businesses are subject to the corporate income tax income earned by partnerships is passed through and taxed to the individual partners under the individual income tax without imposition of separate level of tax at the partnership level also businesses that have more than 100 stockholders and that meet certain other requirements s corporations as well as certain other pass through entities are not subject to the corporate income tax but are taxed in the same manner as partnerships

would reduce tax revenue by an estimated 87 billion over 5 years and 10 billion over 10 years4 the bills proposed reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate is the largest of its proposed cuts both in terms of revenue loss and number of businesses affected under current law corporate taxable income is generally subject to set of graduated rates 15 25 34 and 35 with the lower rates applying to lower increments of income the bill proposes to replace the top two rates with single 305 rate since the bulk of taxable income in the corporate sector is earned by firms subject to the highest rates most taxa ble corporate income would benefit from the rate reduction taken alone the rate cut would reduce revenue by an estimated 1517 billion over five yearsover half the estimated revenue loss from all of the proposed corporate tax cuts combined second tax cut in the proposal would make permanent temporary increase in the expensing benefit for equipment investment by relatively small businesses in addition the bill proposes to extend for one year set of other narrowly targeted temporary business tax benefits most of which expired at the end of 2007 note that chairman rangel subsequently introduced extensions of these as part of another bill hr 3996 most recently the extenders were included in hr 6049 which passed the house on may 21 2008 the proposals revenueraising items are more numerous than the tax cuts but smaller in size though some would reduce revenue by sizeable amounts together and considered apart from the tax cuts the revenueraising items would increase business taxes by 1640 billion over five years the single largest item is repeal of the 9 deduction for domestic production whichfor income attributable to domestic productionwould generally offset 315 percentage points of the proposals 45 percentagepoint taxrate reduction second sizeable revenue raiser would apply to multinational firms it would require firms that defer us taxes on foreignsource income to likewise defer deduction of costs attributable to the income third sizeable revenue raiser would repeal the lastin firstout lifo method of ac counting and taxing the resulting recognition of income over an eightyear period

congress has had longstanding interest in tax policy towards small businessan interest that continued in 2007 where action on small business taxation occurred in conjunction with federal minimum wage legislation the president and others took the position that an increase in the federal minimum wagean issue acted on early in 2007should be coupled with consideration of tax cuts for small business the tax cuts were viewed by their proponents as means of offsetting the extra cost burden higher minimum wage may place on small businesses tax provisions were not included in the housepassed bill increasing the minimum wage hr 2 however on february 1 the senate approved an amended version of hr 2 that included package of tax benefits for small business and set of revenueraising measures designed to offset part of the revenue loss expected from the tax benefits the house subsequently approved tax bill hr 976 approved on february 16 containing set of small business tax benefits more

over 5 years and 48 billion over 10 years the cuts were partly offset by revenueraising items amounting to 70 billion over 5 years and 44 billion over 10 years for net revenue gain of 71 million over 5 years and 55 million over 10 yearsa net effect near to revenue neutrality5 taken alone the revenuelosing and revenuegaining measures in the conference agreement fell between the house and senate bills in terms of their size the senate version of the bill provided both for larger tax cuts and revenue offsets than did the house bill the acts final tax cuts were generally though not exclusively targeted at small business prominent provision was an extension of the expensing tax benefit for business investment in machines and equipmenta tax benefit provided by section 179 of the tax code the provision is linked to small business because it applies only to firms undertaking less than certain level of investment the provision is tax benefit in that it permits firms to deduct expense in the first year of service capped amount of investment outlays rather than requiring the outlays to be deducted gradually in the form of depreciation as is required with most tangible assets permanent provisions of the internal revenue code cap the expensing allowance at 25000 per year and begin phaseout of the allowance when firms investment exceeds 200000 6 however temporary rules initially enacted in 2003 and extended on several occasions increased the annual cap and threshold to 100000 and 400000 respectively the increased amounts are indexed for inflation occurring after 2003 the amounts for 2007 were 112000 and 450000 the most recent extension was provided by tipra in 2006 and extended the increased allowance and threshold through 2009 pl 11028 extended the increased expensing allowance through 2011 and also increased the allowance to 125000 and the phaseout threshold to 500000 another temporary tax benefit the act addressed was the work opportunity tax credit wotc in general wotc permits employers to claim tax credit equal to specified percentage paid in firstyear wages to members of certain targeted groups including families receiving temporary assistance for needy families tanf support qualified veterans highrisk youth and others under prior law wotc was scheduled to expire at the end of 2007 pl 11028 extended the credit through august 2011 and made

security fica taxes paid for employees who receive tips the modification was designed to keep the new higher minimum wage from having the effect of reducing the credit under both the act and prior law the credit is equal to the employers fica tax on tips in excess of those meeting the minimum wage requirement absent other changes an increase in the minimum wage reduces the tax credit by increasing the threshold over which the tax credit is earned pl 11028 increased the minimum wage to 725 from prior laws 515 and would have reduced the tax credit absent other changes however the act provided that the credit will continue to be calculated based on prior laws minimum wage the act also provided that both the fica credit and wotc can offset taxpayers alternative minimum tax the act contained two principal revenueraising provisions one increased the scope of the kiddie tax provision that taxes children under the age of 18 at their parents tax rate on unearned income exceeding certain

time and are each scheduled to expire on various dates the benefits tend to be tax incentives provisions designed to encourage certain types of investment or activity thought to be economically or socially desirable as targeted tax incentives the benefits tend to raise similar policy question according to traditional economic theory smoothly functioning markets and undistorted prices generally allocate the economys scare resources in the most efficient way possible absent market malfunctionsfailures that economists believe are more the exception than the ruleeconomic theory indicates that tax benefits or penalties that interfere with the market reduce economic efficiency and reduce overall economic welfare the question with each extender then is whether there is market failure or socially desirable goal that makes the incentives intervention in the market desirable one extender is the research and experimentation re tax credit which was first enacted in 1981 and which has been renewed on numerous occasions the credit provides businesses tax benefit that is linked to the firms increase in research outlays in the current year over statutorily defined base period the credit is based on economic theorys notion that free markets do not operate smoothly in the case of research and developmentthat absent government support firms would not spend as much on research as is

several other extant research subsidies more than compensate for the theoretical shortfall in research10 the re credits most recent extension was provided by the tax relief and health care act of 2006 trhca pl 109432 in december 2006 and it expired at the end of 2007 the 2006 extension included an additional alternative method that firms can use to calculate the credit which may result in additional tax savings for firms in certain circumstances there has been interest in the current congress however in making the tax credit permanent the extenders in general have been continuing issue for congressin part because their temporary nature necessitates periodic action if they are not to expire and in part because of the strong support for many of the benefits 11 as noted above an element of the tax reduction and reform act hr 3970 that was introduced in october 2007 proposes oneyear extension of number of expiring tax provisions including the re tax credit on october 30 chairman charles rangel of the house ways and means in troduced bill hr 3996 the temporary tax relief act devoted only to extending expiring provisions and providing patch that would reduce the individual alternative minimum tax for one year the alternative minimum tax bill that congress enacted in december however did not contain tax provisions other than those pertaining to the alternative minimum tax the extenders have continued to receive congressional attention in 2008 hr 6049 the energy and tax extenders act of 2008 which was passed in the house on may 21 2008 provides one year extension through 2008 for many of the expiring temporary tax provisions while s 2886 the alternative minimum tax and extenders tax relief act of 2008 proposes twoyear extension through 2009 for the

issue they intended to address during the year their focus appeared to be twofold revenueraising scalingback of tax cuts that were enacted in recent years for the petroleum firms and enactment of new set of incentives aimed at energy conservation and promotion of alternative energy sources those goals were addressed in part in an energy bill hr 6 the house passed in january 2007 the bill contained both tax and nontax provisions its tax measures restricted several tax benefits as they apply to oil and gas production and provided that the resulting tax revenues were to be used to fund reserve for energy efficiency and renewable energy in june the senate began consideration of its own amended version of hr 6 which included wideranging nontax policy component while the senate finance committee approved tax package of revenueraising items and provisions to promote conservation and alternative energy sources the tax plan was not added to the policy component of hr 6 because of 10 see crs

on oil and gas from the gulf of mexico and restrictions on leasing transactions involving foreign property12 the house ways and means committee approved bill hr 2776 on june 20 thatunlike hr 6was restricted to energy tax provisions like the finance committee measure it contains mix of revenue raisers and tax benefits the bill was approved by the house on august 4 2007 in broad outline the finance committee legislation and house bills are similar in certain respects with their conservation and alternative fuels measures partly offset by revenueraising items they differ however in the exact makeup of the respective components and in the magnitude of their revenue effects specifically the finance committee bill contains revenue losing items estimated to reduce revenue by total of 32 billion over 10 years and revenue raisers expected to increase revenues by the same amount thus achieving approximate revenue neutrality on net basis the house bill is likewise estimated to achieve revenue neutrality but the expected magnitude of its respective revenue raisers and revenuelosing provisions is smaller totaling 15 billion over 10 years in each case prominent among the tax benefits in both bills is extension and modification of the tax credit for production of energy from renewable sources provided by section 45 of the tax code although the finance committees version would result in larger revenue loss the remaining revenue losing items in the two bills differ considerably large revenueraising item common to both bills is the denial of the tax codes section 199 domestic production deduction to certain oil and gasrelated income 13 the deduction was first enacted with the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 and it applies to the domestic us manufacturing extractive and agriculture industries in general not just to the petroleum industry the deduction is phased in with rate equal to 6 of domestic production income in 20072009 and permanent rate of 9 in 2010 and thereafter the house bill would deny the deduction to all domestic production of oil and gas the finance committee measure would deny the deduction to integrated oil companies in december the senate failed to take action on an energy bill containing the tax provisions advocated by the finance committee and congress instead approved comprehensive energy legislation stripped of most of its tax elements the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 g22g138g161g561g21g145g142g149g157g142g155g156g561 corporate tax shelters are another area where congress may look for tax increasing revenues they concern policymakers because of their corrosive effect on tax equity and popular perceptions about the tax systems fairness in popular usage the term tax shelter denotes the use of tax deductions or credits produced by one activity to reduce taxes on another the first activity shelters the second from tax in economic terms tax shelter can be defined as transaction for

and general in most usages that it could also be defined simply as tax saving activity that is viewed as undesirable by the observer using the term under most definitions tax shelters can be either illegal and constitute tax evasion or legal comprising tax avoidance congress has evinced considerable interest in tax shelters in recent years and has enacted some restrictions into law the american jobs cr eation act of 2004 ajca pl 108357 contained number of provisions designed to restrict tax shelters in part the acts provisions were directed at specific tax sheltersfor example leasing activities and the acquisition of losses for tax purposes built in losses in addition the act included provisionsfor example revised penalties and reporting requirementsdesigned to restrict sheltering activity in general15 in 2006 the senate version of the tax increase prevention and reconc iliation act tipra pl 109222 contained number of tax shelter restrictions but the provisions were not included in the conference committee bill the senates tipra provisions included what the bill termed clarification of the economic substance doctrine that has been followed in number of court decisions applying to tax shelters generally the economic substance doctrine disallows tax deductions credits or similar benefits in the case of transactions not having economic substance the senate version of tipra would have integrated aspects of the doctrine into the tax code itself similar measure was contained in the senate version of the ajca but was not adopted several bills in the 110 th congress have included codification of the economic substance doctrine as revenueraising offset for tax cuts elsewhere in the tax code these include s 2242 approved by the senate finance committee on

searching for additional tax revenue in part the focus on international taxation stems from concern about tax benefits that are perceived to promote foreign outsourcingthe movement of us jobs overseas economic theory is skeptical about whether tax policy towards us multinationals can have longterm impact on domestic employment although shortterm and localized impacts are certainly possible taxes can however alter the extent to which firms engage in overseas operations rather than domestic investment under current law tax benefit known as deferral poses an incentive for us firms to invest overseas in countries with relatively low tax rates deferral provides its benefit by permitting us firms to postpone their us tax on foreign income as long as that income is reinvested abroad in foreign subsidiaries the benefit is generally available for active business operations abroad but the tax codes subpart f provisions restrict deferral in the case of income from passive investment if made proposals to restrict deferral may consist of expansion of the range of income subject to subpart f 14 these definitions are taken from joseph j cordes and harvey galper tax shelter activity

the direction of expanding deferral and cutting taxes for overseas operations for example the american jobs creation act of 2004 cut taxes on overseas operations in several ways while in 2006 tipra restricted subpart f in the case of banking and related businesses receiving active financing income and in the case of the look through treatment overseas operations receive from subsidiary firms16 further several analysts have recently argued that attempts to tax overseas operations are either counterproductive or outmoded in the modern integrated world economy 17 traditional economic analysis however suggests that overseas investment that is taxed at lower or higher rate than domestic income impairs economic efficiency 16 lookthrough rules generally apply the same treatment of particular items of income in the hands of the recipient as in the hands of payor thus for example dividend paid to parent firm out of active business income of subsidiary would remain active business income in the hands of the parent rather than dividend income ie passive investment income 17 mihir desai and james r hines jr old rules and new realities corporate tax policy in global setting national tax

cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 with the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act egtrra pl 10716 and the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act jgtrra pl 10827 respectively focused more on individual income taxes than corporate taxes and included measures such as reductions in statutory tax rates tax cuts for married couples and expansion of the child tax credit jgtrra however contained number of tax cuts aimed at businesses as did legislation enacted in 2002 2004 and 2006 the most prominent business tax cuts can be summarized as follows temporary bonus depreciation provisions designed to spur investment spending capital gains and dividend reductions intended in part to increase capital formation and the flow of savings to the corporate sector extension of set of narrowlyapplicable temporary tax benefits the extenders that were addressed by several acts and provisions enacted in 2004 designed to boost us manufacturing and competitiveness the domestic production deduction and foreign tax credit provisions the policy questions the business tax legislation raisedagain in broadest termswere as follows what would be the impact of the investment incentives on the economys capital stock does the reduced tax burden increase the supply of capital and saving thus increasing longrun growth or is the economys supply of capital relatively fixed meaning the investment incentives simply interfere with the efficient allocation of investment were the enacted business tax cuts effective in stimulating the economy in the short run thus aiding recovery from the 2001 recession or do planning lags and other factors make business tax cuts ineffective as fiscal stimulus meaning the relation between the business tax cuts and economic recovery was serendipitous what was the effect of the business tax cuts on the overall fairness of the tax system did the reductions accrue primarily to relatively highincome stockholders and corporate creditors or were any reductions on tax progressivity outweighed by positive employment effects how did the business tax cuts affect us economic competitiveness have provisions such as the domestic production deduction helped revitalize domestic manufacturing or do the deduction and other competitiveness provisions interfere with the efficient and flexible participation of us businesses in the world economy g7g151g138g140g157g142g141g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 jcwa pl 107147 contained temporary bonus depreciation provisions that permitted firms to deduct an additional 30 of the cost of property in its first year of service rather than requiring that portion to be depreciated over period of years the provision

contravene the world trade organization agreements prohibition on export subsidies the eu objected to the eti benefit and imposed countervailing tariffs authorized by the wto ajca repealed eti but
