domestic social policy division children in poverty profile trends and issues summary child poverty persists as social and economic concern in the united states in 2007 128 million children 176 all children were considered poor under the official us definition in records dating back to 1959 the incidence of poverty among related children in families has ranged from peak of 269 in 1959 to low of 138 in 1969 poverty affects childs life chances by almost any indicator poor children fare worse than their nonpoor counterparts family living arrangements indicated by the presence of just one or both parents greatly affect the chances that child is poor in 2007 430 of children in femaleheaded families were poor compared to 85 of children in marriedcouple families in that year 24 of children were living in femaleheaded families more than double the share who lived in such families when the overall child poverty rate was at its historical low 1969 children who are racial or ethnic minorities are at particular risk of being poor in 2007 little more than onethird of black children 342 and almost three out of ten hispanic children 283 were poor compared to about one in ten white nonhispanic children 97 work is the principal means by which families with children support themselves without family earnings child is almost certain to be poor however earnings often fail to overcome poverty in 2007 about onethird 324 of all poor children lived with at least one adult who was fulltime fullyear worker another onethird were in families with worker who either worked partyear or less likely parttime another third lived in families without an adult who worked during the year higher child poverty rates were observed for those whose parents had less rather than more education children of younger parents with less potential time and experience in the workforce were more likely to be poor than children of older parents additionally dramatic gains have occurred in recent years in work by lone mothers especially among those with preschool children employment rates of single mothers with children under age 3 rose from 351 in march 1993 to 591 in march 2000 but have since remained below their 2000 level standing at 545 in march 2008 nonetheless many of these working single mothers and their children remained poor the social safety net for children consists of 1 earningsbased social insurance programs and 2 needbased transfers of cash and noncash benefits needtested benefits have undergone radical transformation during the past 20 years capped by the 1996 welfare reform law cash welfare caseloads have plummeted since the reforms of the mid1990s so that many families receiving needtested aid only receive noncash benefits eg medicaid and food stamps whose value is not reflected in official poverty statistics further the welfare reforms of the mid1990s were accompanied by expansions of the earned income tax credit eitc which supplements the earnings of lowincome families with children the value of the eitc is also not considered in official poverty statistics the result has been to curtail benefit availability for nonworking families

and economic concern in the united states in 2007128 million children were considered poor under the official us census bureau definition the child poverty rate the percent of all children considered poor stood at 176 well below the most recent high of 22 in 1993 but still well above its historic low of 138 in 1969 in 2007 18 million more children were counted as poor than in 2000 when 156 of children were poor child poverty reflects both family circumstances in which children reside and economic conditions and opportunities in communities where children live family living arrangements indicated by the presence of just one or both parents greatly affect the chances that child is poor children who are racial or ethnic minorities are at particular risk of being poor to avoid poverty most children need an adult breadwinner the economic wellbeing of children usually depends on how well their parents fares in the labor market children most at risk of poverty are in families without an earner however some are poor despite the work even the fulltime work of parent they are among the working poor poverty affects childrens life chances their prospects of realizing their full potential and their ability to successfully transition into adulthood1 by almost any indicator poor children fare worse than their nonpoor counterparts poor children are at greater risk of poor physical health delayed cognitive development poor academic achievement and risky behavior particularly among children growing up in poor neighborhoods poor adolescent girls are more likely to become teenage mothers than their nonpoor counterparts contributing to cycle of poverty from one generation to the next while income poverty is associated with poor child outcomes lack of income may account for only part of the reason why poor children face poor future prospects other factors are arguably as important if not more so than income per in 1 for an overview of research on the consequences of poverty for children see duncan greg j and jeanne brooksgunn ed consequences of growing up poor russell sage foundation 1997 also for an overview of the effects of poverty on health and social status and economic growth see us government accountability office poverty in america economic research shows adverse impacts on health status and other social conditions as well as the economic growth rate gao07344 january 2007 crs2 affecting childrens life chances prolonged or deep income poverty among families with children may signal more chronic problems than merely lack of income income support policies may help alleviate economic distress among such families helping to provide families basic needs however without other social supports or other more fundamental changes in childrens family circumstances childrens prospects may remain limited numerous programs operate in the us to aid children without breadwinner or with one whose earnings are low these programs together constitute the main threads of this nations incomesocial safety net social insurance programs social security and unemployment insuranceui provide payments for children whose parent has paid payroll taxes but is now out of the workforce social security benefits are paid to children whose parents is dead disabled or retired unemployment insurance benefits are paid temporarily to some workers who have lost job most state ui programs do not provide dependents benefits however neither program imposes an income test benefits are an earned entitlement refundable tax credits the federal earned income tax credit or eitc and the child tax credit supplement low earnings of parents cash welfare programs make payments to some needy children and their parents major welfare programs for children are temporary assistance for needy families tanf and for disabled children or children with disabled parents supplemental security income ssi these programs impose an income test and usually an assets test tanf seeks to move parents into the labor market and requires states to condition eligibility beyond two months on parental work noncash welfare programs such as food stamps subsidized housing medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip provide inkind benefits these programs also are meanstested government is challenged to maintain family selfsupport through workbased policies to promote parents work and family economic selfsufficiency while at the same time maintaining safety net that prevents children from falling into abject poverty when parents are unable to work or their efforts are insufficient crs3 child poverty in 2007 in 2007 128 million children2 out of total of 728 million lived in families whose pretax money income that year fell short of the poverty threshold this translates into child poverty rate of 176 as group children are how is child poverty measured more likely to be poor than are either the aged persons aged 65 the census bureau measures poverty by or older or nonaged adults comparing money income of the childs family persons 18 to 64 years old with income thresholds that vary by family size and figure 1 compares 2007 composition for this purpose the bureau counts poverty rates of children the only money income before taxes and any capital aged and nonaged adults it gains for 2007 the poverty threshold for single shows that children were 80 parent with two children was 16705 for two more likely to be poor than the parents with two children it was 21027 aged and that the incidence of the official count of the poverty population poverty among nonaged adults takes into account all cash income other than any was only slightly higher than capital gains before taxes thus it includes social that of the aged insurance cash payments and cash welfare it excludes noncash aid and tax credits the census there are some well bureau also issues alternate poverty counts that known correlates to child assign value to major noncash benefits and tax poverty childs risk of being credits but they are not included in this crs poor varies by family structure report and size and by raceethnicity further since children primarily rely on adult workers for income child poverty also varies by the educational attainment and age which is related to work experience of the familys head and if present spouse this section provides profile of child poverty in 2007 shown are child poverty rates by characteristics of the family child or family head and spouse this perspective answers the question among children who are most at risk for being in poor families this section also provides the composition of child poverty by those characteristics answering the question who are the poor children 2 the census bureau defines related children under age 18 as children who are related to the household head in march of 2007 there were 740 million persons under the age of 18 with 728 million meeting the definition of related child the remaining 12 million persons under the age of 18 who are not considered related children include 1 those who live in families all of whose members are not related to the head of the household 2 children who are not living with relatives eg foster children and 3 persons under the age of 18 who are themselves household heads or are spouses of household heads crs4 figure 1 poverty rates of

family type living arrangements of us children have undergone dramatic shift since the 1960 census in 1960 88 out of 100 children lived with two parents the proportion living with two parents averaged 81 during the 1970s 75 in the 1980s and 70 in the 1990s corresponding increases were registered by children living with mother only the family type most afflicted with money income poverty 8 in the 1960 census 15 during the 1970s 20 in the 1980s and 23 in the 1990s the data for children living with father alone 1 in the 1960 census 3 on average during the 1970s and the 1980s and 4 during the 1990s finally the share of children living with neither parent averaged 3 during the 1970s and 1980s but rose to 4 in the 1990s3 figure 2 presents data about poverty rates of children who lived in families in 2007 the bar chart presents 2007 child poverty rates by type of family as it shows children in marriedcouple families had much lower poverty rate 85 than those in single parent families

430 589 00 200 400 source congressional research service crs with data from the us census bureau because of the relatively high poverty rate among children in femaleheaded families much of the policy discussion about child poverty centers on this group therefore much of this remaining profile provides information on the poverty rate and composition of poverty for children in single parent families as well as for all children among children in femaleheaded families poverty rates vary by whether the single mother had ever been married see figure 3 children with mothers who never married are about twice as likely to be poor 548 poverty rate as children whose mothers divorced poverty rate of 276 moreover the number of all children in families where the single mother never married exceeds the number of children in families where the mother divorced thus children in families with nevermarried mothers account for large share of poor children about half 513 of all poor children in femaleheaded families crs6 figure 3 poverty among related children in femaleheaded families by marital status of the female head 2007 poverty rates percent of all poor children in femaleheaded

crs with data from the us census bureau child poverty by race and ethnicity children in racial and ethnic minorities tend to have higher poverty rates than white children figure 4 shows that in 2007 the poverty rate among african american nonhispanic children was 342 35 times the poverty rate for white nonhispanic children of 97 hispanic children had lower poverty rates than africanamerican children but higher poverty rates than white children despite the variance in poverty rates by race and ethnicity the populations of poor white africanamerican and hispanic children are of similar size the larger population of white children when multiplied by the lower poverty rates of this group yields number of poor white children not too different from the number of poor children in each of the two other racialethnic groups crs7 figure 4 poverty rates among related children by race and ethnicity 2007 poverty rates percent of all poor children white 97 white 312 african 342 african

composition of poor children by race and ethnicity for children in femaleheaded families as in the overall child population minority children have higher rates of poverty than do white children the poverty rates for africanamerican 499 and hispanic 516 children are both about 15 times that of white children in femaleheaded families 324 however africanamerican children comprise the largest group of poor children in female headed families accounting for about four out of ten poor children in female headed families crs8 figure 5 poverty among related children in femaleheaded families by race

children in marriedcouple families hispanic children have poverty rate 193 higher than that of whites 47 or africanamerican children 110 therefore hispanics account for the largest share of poor children in marriedcouple families 459 thus hispanic children in femaleheaded families have slightly higher poverty rate than africanamerican children in femaleheaded families and also have substantially higher poverty rate than africanamerican children in marriedcouple families however their poverty rates among all children are lower than those for africanamericans this is because hispanic children are more likely than african american children to be in marriedcouple families and children in marriedcouple families have lower poverty rates than children in femaleheaded families

the number of these children totaled 42 million and they accounted for 324 of all poor children pie chart in figure 7 most children 774 not shown on the chart live in families where either the head or if present the spouse is fulltime fullyear worker hence these children account for relatively large share of all poor children even though their poverty rate is low the bar chart shows that the

bureau child poverty by educational credential of the family head or spouse from 1960 to 2007 the share of the population at least 25 years old with high school diploma or more has more than doubled from 411 to 857 in the same period the share with 4 or more years of college education more than tripled from 77 to 2874 the returns to education have also increased over time as the average wages of those with college degree have increased relative to the average wages of those without such degree increasingly job applicants must have postsecondary credentials by some measures high school graduates and those who failed to complete high school have seen declining real wages thus child poverty rates depend in part on the educational level of the family head or spouse in 2007 almost half 496 of children whose family head had not completed high school were poor this group made up onethird of all poor children see figure 9 children whose family head or the family heads spouse had

highest in young families with children the poverty rate for preschool children children under the age of six was 208 in 2007 compared with 160 poverty rate for older children this is because in part these children have on average younger parents younger parents who have less job experience in the workforce tend to earn less than older adults with more experience figure 11 shows the child poverty rate by the age of the household head or spouse if present for marriedcouple families the age of the older adult was used to determine the age of the head or spouse it shows that child poverty rates tend to mirror the lifecycle pattern of earnings of adults that is earnings tend to be low in the early years peak in middle age and decline as adults approach and reach retirement age this explains some of the pattern shown on the figure however children in families with nevermarried female head the group with the highest poverty rate also tend to be in families where the head was young children

rates for children in female crs17 headed families also show pronounced secular noncyclical patterns rates during the entire economic expansion of the 1980s were higher than in the mid and late 1970s coincident with the increase in the number of children of nevermarried mothers who have high poverty rates compared to children in other types of female headed families from the mid1990s to 2000 in

data 172 million children were counted as poor see figure 15 the poor child population declined through most of the 1960s and hovered around 10 million during the 1970s with an alltime low of 95

because of both the economy and demographic trends the number of related children under 18 fell from 70 million in 1968 to 62 million in 1978 the number of related children began to rise again in 1988

headed families has resulted in higher overall child poverty rates than would have otherwise been the case had childrens living arrangements been unchanged over the past several decades in order to approximate the effects of historical changes in living arrangements on the overall child poverty rate we estimate overall child poverty rates based on the relative composition of children by family type that existed crs19 in 1960 while maintaining historically observed child poverty rates by family type5 effectively the adjusted poverty rates present crude approximation of what the overall child poverty rate might have been had family composition remained unchanged from its 1960 level figure 16 shows the effects of these adjustments the top line of the figure shows historical child poverty rates whereas the bottom line shows the overall adjusted child poverty rate had child family living arrangements been the same as those observed in 1960 the figure shows for example that in 2007 the child poverty rate was 176 but had family composition in 2007 been the same as in 1960 the overall adjusted child poverty rate would have been 126 instead of the observed 128 million children being counted as poor in 2007 had family composition remained unchanged from 1960 the number of poor children estimated by this method would have been 92 million or 36 million fewer than the number observed 5 for example in 1960 92 of children lived in femaleheaded families but in 2007 241 lived in such families in 2007 the poverty rate for children in femaleheaded families was 430 if in 2007 92 of children had lived in femaleheaded families ie the same share as in 1960 rather than the 241 observed they would have numbered 67 million rather than the 176 million observed assuming that the child poverty rate remained at its 2007 level ie 430 of children in such families being considered poor then an estimated 29 million children in femaleheaded families would have been poor ie 430 x 67 million rather than the 75 million observed ie 430 x 176 million considering then children living in malepresent families their estimated number in 2007 assuming 1960 incidence rates would have been 661 million rather than the 552 million observed applying the child poverty rate of 95 in 2007 for children living in male present families to the number of children who would have been estimated to be living in such families when adjusted to 1960 incidence levels 661 million the number of poor children in such families would be 63 million rather than the observed 53 million although the estimated number of poor children in malepresent families would be about 1 million higher if family composition in 2007 was the same as in 1960 the number in femaleheaded families would be 47 million lower for net effect of 36 million fewer poor children in 2007 than what was actually observed based on these adjustments the total number of poor children in 2007 would have been 92 million rather than the observed 128 million resulting in child poverty rate of 126 rather than the observed 176 crs20 figure 16 child poverty rates historic rates and adjusted rates holding family composition at

with dependent children afdc converted cash assistance from needsbased entitlement to program of temporary help aimed at promoting work and personal responsibility under the tanf block grant most states reward work by permitting recipients to add to their benefits some or all of their earnings at least for time and most states have increased sanctions for failure to perform required work

earlier in figure 17 hours worked among poor lonemothers increased over the same period in which their employment rates were increasing lonemothers are not only more likely to be working in the later

worked was zero at the 50th percentile by 1999 and 2000 half of all poor single mothers the 50th percentile were working nearly 480 hours per year or more and in 2000 20 80th percentile were working

poverty increased somewhat from 1987 to 2007 fulltime fullyear workers are considered to have worked 35 or more hours per week for 50 or more weeks during the year among all children the rate at which at least one of their parents were fulltime fullyear workers increased from 718 in 1987 to 798 in 2000 and stood at 774 in 2007 see table 1 the decline since 2000 was due at least in part to the 2001

federal cash income support policy can be found in the social security act and the internal revenue code twotier safety net was put into place in the 1935 act the first tier consisting of oldage insurance usually thought of as social security title ii and unemployment insurance title iii aimed to protect families from the economic risks associated with the retirement or unemployment of their workers workers earned rights to these social insurance benefits by paying payroll taxes in covered job the second tier made grants to states to help make meanstested payments to specified categories of needy persons not expected to work namely the aged title i8 children with only one ablebodied parent in the home title iv and the blind title x added to the social insurance tier over time were survivors insurance 1939 social security act amendments disability insurance 1956 amendments and medicare 1965 amendments health insurance for the elderly added to the welfare tier over time was aid for needy persons who were permanently and totally disabled 1952 replaced in 1972 by 100 federal cash program for the aged blind and disabled called ssi health insurance for lowincome aged blind and disabled persons and for needy families with children was added in the form of the medicaid program 1965 amendments health insurance for lowincome children ineligible for medicaid was added by enactment of the state childrens health insurance program schip balanced budget act of 1997 also the cash welfare program for needy children was opened up to some unemployed twoparent families 1961 and finally 1996 was replaced by block grant for temporary assistance the social insurance programs are designed to provide benefits when family loses earnings because its breadwinner is permanently or temporarily out of the labor market through death disability unemployment at the outset the welfare programs were restricted to persons not expected to work but over time work requirements have been added to the cash welfare program for families with children and it now emphasizes moving families from welfare to work in 1975 congress enacted program to explicitly support and supplement the income of working poor parents the eitc this provision of the tax code makes payments from the treasury to parents whose credit exceeds any income tax liability in tax year 2005 the eitc was claimed by 228 million tax filers with credits totaling 424 billion9 in addition child care subsidies have been expanded for families receiving cash welfare by the family support act of 1988 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 which created child care programs for the working poor and the 1996 welfare reform law which consolidated child care funding fy2008 appropriations 8 aid to the needy aged was placed in title i as the most popular provision of the social security act 9 see crs report rl31768 the earned income tax credit eitc an overview by christine scott crs25 for child care totaled 5 billion 29 billion for the mandatory child care block grant and 21 billion for the discretionary child care and development block grant10 finally the federal child support enforcement program begun in 1975 has shifted its role from reimbursing federal and state governments for welfare costs to facilitating income transfers to families with children where one parent usually the father is noncustodial the increased role of child support is particularly important in light of the growth of femaleheaded families in fy2006 child support enforcement offices collected 24 billion 09 billion for tanf cash welfare families 95 billion for former tanf cash welfare families 31 billion for families receiving medicaid and tanf and 113 billion for families that never received tanf cash welfare11 social security as noted above the social security act established an oldage insurance system for workers and later social security was enlarged to cover dependents and survivors of retired or disabled workers12 with these additions social security became system of comprehensive insurance for all families with worker who paid social security payroll taxes13 if the family breadwinner died or became disabled social security would provide cash for his dependents and survivors it was widely hoped that coverage by workrelated social insurance eventually would eliminate most need for cash relief to families who lost their breadwinner in september 2008 there were 506 million social security recipients of which 31 million were children14 this means the federal government makes social security payments to about 4 of us children total benefits to children totaled nearly 15 billion in that month rate of 175 billion per year in addition some adult social security beneficiaries are in families with children so that this program reaches an even greater proportion of the child population15 unemployment insurance the social security act also established the federalstate unemployment insurance ui program this program provides temporary unemployment benefits to workers who are unemployed through fault of their own provided they have earned statedetermined sum of wages during an

quarters and are available for work historically there has been concern that ui eligibility rules present barriers to lowwage workers with unstable work histories to what extent might unemployment benefits be available for former welfare recipients who lose job16 studies of former cash recipients in number of states conclude that most recipients who leave welfare for work have sufficient earnings to qualify for ui at some point after leaving welfare17 however having sufficient earnings is only one of the qualifying conditions for receiving ui upon losing job the job loss must be considered as occurring through fault of the potential recipient definition that varies among the states study of welfare leavers in new jersey considered fairly liberal state with respect to ui eligibility rules found that as many as 60 of those with monetary eligibility might have been disqualified for other reasons especially the high rates of voluntarily quitting job it found that about half of the job quitters did so for personal reason such as health problem having to care for child at home or transportation issue advocates of broadening ui rules to qualify more lowwage workers have recommended that states permit job quits for good reason cash public assistance for children before passage of the social security act in 1935 some states offered mothers pensions so that needy mothers could stay home to raise their children this aid was largely restricted to paternal orphans children whose father had died18 in response to the great depression the social security act provided federal funds to enable states to help certain needy groups including children whose second parent was dead incapacitated or continually absent from home aid to dependent children adc19 the original purpose of afdc was to help states enable needy mothers to be fulltime caregivers at home thus it had expectation of mothers work and requirement for it in fact the law penalized work by 16

the program was renamed aid to families with dependent children afdc crs27 requiring states to reduce benefits by the full amount of any earnings including those spent on work expenses however this changed over the years gradually the assumption that afdc mothers belonged at home faded as more and more nonwelfare mothers went to work and as rising numbers of unwed mothers joined afdc altering the character of the caseload since the early 1960s congress has tried to promote work and selfsupport of welfare families by means of work requirements financial incentives20 and various services the first work rule 1961 applied to unemployed fathers group that congress admitted to afdc at state option that year the rule required states to condition afdc for unemployed fathers afdcuf on acceptance of work in 1967 congress established work incentive program win for afdc families and required states to assign appropriate persons to this education and training program the 1967 law required states to give afdc parents who went to work financial reward disregard of some earnings when calculating benefits21 in 1971 congress removed from states the discretion to decide who must work or train instead it specified that states must assign to win all ablebodied custodial parents except those with preschool child under age six in the family support act of 1988 congress lowered the young child age threshold for work exemption it required states to assign to new jobs and basic skills jobs training program for afdc families all ablebodied custodial parents except those with child under age three under age one at state option however the law required states to guarantee child care for children below age six finally in 1996 congress replaced afdc with the tanf block grant tanf law requires states to engage certain percentages of adult recipients in specified work activities the law exempts one from work participation but it permits states to exempt single parent caring for child under age one and to exclude that parent in calculating the states work participation rate in addition the law bars state from penalizing single parent with child under age six for failure to engage in required work if the person cannot obtain needed child care because appropriate care is unavailable or available care is unsuitable states decide individual participation rules in june 2008 30 million children were in families that received cash benefits from tanf programs or separate statefunded tanf programs this is down from historic peak of 96 million children in families receiving cash benefits from afdc 20 in 1962 congress removed the financial work penalty by requiring states to permit working parents to add to their afdc grant any expenses reasonably attributed to the earning of income 21 states were to disregard the first 30 monthly in earnings plus onethird of the remainder by regulation the reasonablework expense deduction including child care cost already in law was added to the new disregard and taken last in 1981 congress capped the general work expense disregard added capped child care disregard and specified that these disregards must be taken first it also put time limit on the onethird disregard these changes reduced the earnings level at which person lost afdc eligibility crs28 in 1994 in fy2006 federal and state spending on cash welfare benefits totaled 99 billion little less than half the amount spent on cash welfare by the federal government and states back in the mid1990s22 money income poverty rates of children by income source although there are numerous government safety net programs that aid families with children the chief component of money income for most families with children is earnings the first bars in figures 19

government income supports as factors affecting the official child poverty rate work is the principal means by which families with children support themselves child poverty rates are correlated with factors associated with wage rates such as parents educational attainment and work experience the amount of work done during the year and family type which affects the likelihood that family will have second earner without family earnings child is almost certain to be poor however earnings alone often fail to overcome poverty in 2006 onethird of all poor children lived with at least one adult who was fulltime fullyear worker the economy has many jobs that pay low wages parents in such jobs may escape poverty only through job advancement that results in higher wages possibly only by upgrading skills and education while working often it takes work of both parents to move their children and families out of poverty this often comes at the cost of arranging child care to permit both parents to work outside of the home additionally work is not always steady with some parents experiencing spells of joblessness for part of the year access to the first tier of the safety net social insurance is restricted to families with current or previous wage earner social insurance benefits are established through work and are characterized as earned rights although these programs are not targeted to the poor per these programs which partially replace earnings because of the death old age disability or involuntary unemployment of worker have significant impact on reducing poverty among families with children over the past 20 years the social insurance tier of the safety net has remained relatively static the protections of its cash benefit programs have generally been maintained however the social insurance tier has not been revised to take into account changes in the economy family structure and work patterns of parents in contrast the second tier of the safety net programs targeted to lowincome families and persons has undergone radical transformation over the past 20 years cash welfare for needy families with children has increasingly been tied to philosophy of mutual obligations adult recipients have been expected to engage in either work or activities to move them into work in the wake of welfare reforms made at the federal and state levels in the mid1990s the cash welfare rolls plummeted so that children in families receiving cash assistance represent small and decreasing share of both the overall and poverty child populations needtested assistance increasingly is paid to families only in the form of noncash benefits medicaid and food stamps whose value is not reflected in the official child poverty statistics these programs cast an uneven net of basic support to families moreover when parents receiving needtested benefits go to work benefits are often significantly reduced as earnings increase at times creating perverse disincentive to work for many families with limited earnings capacity the route toward self sufficiency can be steep climb yielding only small economic gain for additional work effort crs31 along with the transformation of needtested benefits have come expansions of refundable tax credits for families with children particularly the earned income tax credit eitc as work support the eitc helps offset the financial disincentives relating to work that poor families have traditionally faced under welfare programs for some families with very low earnings the eitc may supplement up to 40 cents on every dollar parent earns eitc payments either advance payments tax refunds or reductions in tax liabilities that would otherwise be owed are not included in the official poverty statistics however for single parent with two children who works fulltime all year at the 2006 federal minimum wage those earnings combined with food stamps and the eitc are sufficient to lift that family to just above the poverty threshold thus recent changes to taxes and benefits targeted to lowincome families have sought to increase the rewards to work however the world of work does not guarantee steady income working parents face risks to financially supporting their children stemming from job loss associated with either cyclical or structural changes in the economy or interrupted periods of work because of their own or family members illness moreover there remain small but not insignificant group of families with children where parent has an attachment to the labor force this creates series of policy dilemmas which include how to balance protections against economic risk while maintaining policy that rewards work and helping children in those families without worker without undermining the efforts of working parents crs32
