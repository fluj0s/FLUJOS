will not be updated introduction on march 4 2004 horst kohler resigned as managing director md of the international monetary fund imf following his nomination for the presidency of germany until new permanent director is chosen anne krueger the imfs first deputy managing director will serve as acting managing director this sudden opening of the top management position has reopened an active debate on leadership selection for the top management positions at the major multilateral organizations selecting the leadership at the two major international financial institutions ifis the imf and the world bank is guided by 60year old convention assuring that the world bank president is an american and that the imf managing director is european this convention was the outcome of gentlemans agreement struck at the 1944 bretton woods conference establishing these institutions background an informal agreement not written into the imf articles the convention reflected the political and economic world map at the end of world war ii at the time the united states believed that the world bank should be headed by an american since the united states was the only capital surplus nation and world bank lending would be congressional research service the library of congress crs2 dependent on american financial markets the us secretary of the treasury at the time fred vinson believed that if an american representative headed the world bank the imf must be headed by nonamerican1 deputy managing director position in the imf was established in 1949 and an american citizen nominated by the us department of the treasury has always filled the position in 1994 the board of executive directors bed increased the number of deputy directors from one to three in order to increase the regional diversity of the top management team2 currently agustin carsens formerly mexicos deputy secretary of finance and takatoshi kato former advisor to the president tokyomitsubishi bank serve as deputy directors once the managing director position is filled mrs krueger currently serving as acting managing director will likely return to her position as first deputy managing director ms krueger was appointed to serve fiveyear term in june 2001 although the informal convention virtually ensures that the final candidate will be european the european member countries cannot independently appoint the managing director in current practice the managing decision making process is constrained by httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21810 formal and informal guideline formal guidelines for selecting the imf md the formal guidelines for choosing the imf managing director are laid out in article xii section 4 of the imf articles of agreement it states that the executive board shall select managing director who shall not be governor or an executive director3 this decision may be reached by 50 majority there is mention of the nationality principle in the articles referenced in section 4 the board of governors bog is the highest authority in the imf and all countries are represented often at the finance ministry of treasury level the executive board handles daytoday authority over operational policy lending and other matters it is 24 member body that usually meets three or more times week to oversee and supervise the activities of the imf the united states japan germany britain and france are the five largest shareholders in the imf and thus allowed to appoint their own representatives on the board the remaining members are elected for twoyear terms by groups of countries generally on the basis of geographical or historical affinity in addition to the five largest shareholders saudi arabia china and russia have enough votes to elect their own executive directors eds the us executive director is nominated by the president confirmed by the senate and directed by the department of the treasurys office of the undersecretary for international affairs informal guidelines for selecting the imf md the selection process is also constrained by informal guidelines among the executive board although any executive director can nominate an individual as candidate for the managing director position 1 kahler miles leadership selection in the major multilaterals institute for international economics 2001 p 25 2 van houtven leo governance of the imf decision making institutional oversight transparency and accountability international monetary fund 2002 p 16 3 imf articles of agreement are available at httpwwwimforgexternalpubsftaa crs3 the board has never had an official vote among plethora of candidates4 within the executive board there is very strong institutional aversion to voting executive board rule c10 states that the chairman managing director shall ordinarily ascertain the sense of the meeting in lieu of formal vote5 in deciding on the managing director potential candidates are weeded out by the executive board through informal straw polls to summerize the formal requirements that the articles of agreement lay out for the selection of the imf managing director is that the executive directors appoint by at least 50 majority an individual who is neither member of the board of governors or board of executive directors there are requirements on how individuals are selected on what criteria or by what process they are vetted moreover although the imf executive directors may select its managing director by simple majority vote they historically aim to reach agreement by consensus with these factors combined the convention guaranteeing european leadership at the imf and american leadership at the world bank has remained in force for almost 60 years the debate over the useu convention httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21810 the europeanunited states arrangement to split leadership at the imf and world bank has created lasting and lingering resentment throughout much of the world the globalization of finance has had lasting changes on the international economy over the past decades whereas united states and europe overtly dominated the postworld war two economy the current international economy is less easily categorized more and more countries are relevant and can impact the tenor of global finance the transition from dollar based fixed exchange rate system to floating exchange rate system has changed the imfs role dramatically since the early 1980s its primary work has been balance of payments and financial crisis support to its developing country members this has led the imf to embark on numerous governance and institutional policy reforms stressing increased transparency accountability and inclusion of the developing countries in imf decisionmaking6 critics of the current selection process make two general arguments first any agreement that grants the leadership position based on nationality must by done away with they argue that nationality principle limits the pool of potential candidates excluding noneuropeans that may be better versed in the financial and development needs of the developing countries who are the major recipients of ifi assistance many also argue that the current system lends itself to political horsetrading among the eu countries as they divide up leadership positions themselves it is important to raise the concern that broadening the process to include many other countries does not inherently 4 for example in 2000 the g11 group of eds representing the developing countries nominated acting managing director stanley fischer us appointee for the managing director position although his nomination was backed by outgoing managing director michel camdessus the united states and europe were unwilling to break the convention and support mr fischers candidacy 5 kahler p 23 6 see crs report rs21330 the international monetary fund current reforms crs4 solve the horsetrading problem the election of imf officials like at any other major multilateral agencies is political process and electing the best candidate if such person can be identified without engaging the realities of international politics is virtually impossible second they argue that the current system where the executive board decides among candidates in secret closed door sessions is nontransparent and potentially undermines the legitimacy of the eventual managing director for any managing director to be successful they need to garner the respect and confidence of the imf staff and member countries since approximately twothirds of the imf membership have expressed their view that the current process is not appropriate any selection process that does not enfranchise the developing countries will be strained at best there is also the concern that the imf practice what it preaches the imf along with the world bank is at the forefront of promoting good governance reforms throughout the world critics argue that the reform agenda pushed forward by the imfs staff of international civil servants may be compromised by the way it selects its own leadership practical concern though is that the united states and the europeans are the largest contributors to the imf and the world bank by forcing situation where the largest shareholders are httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21810 not necessarily the largest stakeholders could fundamentally change the organizations most importantly the willingness of the united states to support these institutions could be diminished if its increased contributions did not necessarily lead to greater influence the 2000 selection process horst kohler was appointed as the imfs eighth managing director on march 23 2000 after the retirement of michel camdessus french national who was the only managing director appointed to three 5year terms mr kohlers appointment came at difficult time for the imf the late 1990s were period of numerous international financial crises during which the imfs involvement was heavily criticized many observers believed that the imf was too heavyhanded in its imposing rigorous macroeconomic reforms as conditionality for accepting imf financial assistance to some extent this criticism has been acknowledged and accepted by the imf in its internal evaluations of its lending during the socalled asian financial crisis7 mr kohler was not europes first choice camdessuss retirement sparked passionate debate over who his successor would be since german had yet to hold the position germany assumed that it should be able to select the next managing director after european negotiations european consensus emerged around caio kochweser the german deputy minister of finance although kochweser received formal european union eu support for his candidacy at the february 28 2000 meeting of eu finance ministers ecofin and was nominated on behalf of the eu memberstates on february 29 2000 the united states did not support his candidacy after kochwesers formal proposal joe lockhart president bill clintons press secretary officially announced the us veto of kochwesers candidacy8 without the support of the united states and many developing countries who were supporting the candidacy of acting 7 see the imf and recent capital account crises indonesia korea and brazil the independent evaluation office of the imf september 12 2003 8 kahler p 38 crs5 managing director stanley fischer kochweser was unable to get majority in the informal strawpoll vote after month of debate kochwesers name was removed from contention and was replaced by horst kohler also german national who was serving as the president of the european bank for reconstruction and development kohler was selected as the new managing director on march 23 2000 less than one month after the eu had endorsed kochwesers candidacy although the euus convention emerged unscathed this was the first time that the official eu candidate was openly rejected by the united states morever the large amount of press coverage that the selection process received gave the imfs critics ample opportunities to press for reforms to open up the managing director selection process making it more transparent more orderly and more receptive to the needs of imf borrowers the agenda for reforming the md section process in july 2000 the international monetary fund working group to review the process for selection of the managing director was created to discuss the selection httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21810 procedure draft report of the working group was endorsed by the executive directors on april 26 2001 as guidance for the future selection of managing directors there is requirement that the imf executive board follow the guidelines proposed in the report for the following guidelines to be required the articles would need to be amended the report issued five recommendations 1 executive directors should establish clear criteria for identifying nominating and selecting qualified candidates for the post 2 executive directors should be informed in timely manner regarding candidates including their credentials and knowledge of the institution 3 there should be channel for facilitating smooth communication 4 transparency and accountability are critical 5 any decision concerning the selection process should take into account any impact on the selection process at other international financial institutions9 immediately following mr kohlers resignation wide range of experts advocated revision of the imf managing director selection process augosto carloslopez chief economist at the world economic forum called for choosing the new managing director from the entire imf membership in order to serve the interests of the entire international community10 moises naim editor of foreign policy magazine agreed the next chief executive of the imf and the world bank must be selected through process that gives them and their institutions the legitimacy that only competitive and transparent process 9 kahler p 114 10 lopezcarlos augusto the imf is not the property of the rich international herald tribune march 15 2004 crs6 can bestow11 nancy birdsall of the center for global development specifically points out the need to involve the major emerging markets of south american and asia as well as the worlds poorest countries these are the major recipients of imf lending and according to dr birdsall the unwillingness of the us and the g7 to share power and responsibility in the global financial institutions is already undermining the legitimacy and effectiveness of these institutions12 within the imf developing country executive directors have voting group known as the group of eleven g11 to advocate their concerns this group represents over 100 countries and has an approximately 30 vote on the executive board large enough to veto imf special majority decisions those requiring an 85 majority vote such as increasing the size of the fund adjustments to members quotas admitting new members and revisions to the articles of agreements the g11 along with the russian australian and swiss eds released public statement on march 19 2004 stating the process of identifying and selecting the candidate must be open and transparent with the goal of attracting the best person for the job regardless of nationality plurality of candidates representing the diversity of members across regions would be in the best interest of the fund13 in follow up release issued on march 21 2004 the g11 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21810 executive directors acknowledge that although abolishing the nationality principle and completely ensuring an open and transparent process are unlikely at the present time they propose few procedures to ensure that candidates are proposed and vetted in clear and systematic process the proposed guidelines would require among other things that once an individual is nominated their credentials are made available to all executive directors and that the candidates should meet with the executive board before decision is reached14 for the 2004 selection it appears however that the europeans are determined to go ahead with the former process efforts are currently underway to identify common european candidate who will likely be acceptable to the united states and the developing countries nonetheless the issue of procedure for selection remains an active concern presuming major controversy remains after the europeans select the current nominee international attention is likely to shift towards preparing for the election of the next president of the world bank in 2005 11 naim moises end the funds succession fiasco financial times march 4 2004 12 birdsall nancy broaden the race for imf post financial times march 11 2004 13 statement by group of
