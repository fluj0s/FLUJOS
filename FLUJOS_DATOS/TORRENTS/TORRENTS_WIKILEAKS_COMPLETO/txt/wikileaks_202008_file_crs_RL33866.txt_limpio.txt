baseline medicaid and schip spending2 and estimates for legislative proposals are presented separately in general cbo assesses the likelihood that particular administrative action will take place

httpcbogovbudgetfactsheets2007bmedicaid_schip_prespdf note numbers in parentheses represent savings estimates for proposals that do not show dollar figure were not provided in the documents cited above in executive branch documents describing the presidents budget implementation of proposed administrative changes is assumed in estimates of baseline medicaid and schip spending and estimates for legislative proposals are presented separately in general cbo only adjusts its baseline estimates to account for administrative changes as they are implemented rather than as they are proposed and only provides separate estimates for legislative proposals medicaid streamline administrative match rates background the federal government pays share of every states spending on medicaid services and program administration for medicaid services this share is called the federal medical assistance percentage fmap the fmap is based on formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes and vice versa it has statutory minimum of 50 and maximum of 83 the federal match for administrative expenditures does not vary by state and is generally 50 but certain administrative functions have higher federal match functions with 75 federal match include compensation or training of skilled professional medical personnel and their direct support staff of the state medicaid or other public agency preadmission screening and resident review for individuals with mental illness or mental retardation who are admitted to nursing facility survey and certification of nursing facilities operation of an approved medicaid management information system mmis for claims and information processing performance of medical and utilization review activities or external independent review of managed care activities and operation of state medicaid fraud control unit mfcu in the case of mmiss and mfcus the federal match is 90 for startup expenses there is 100 match for the implementation and operation of immigration status verification systems section 1903a7 of the social security act specifies that 50 match will be provided for remaining expenditures that are found necessary by the secretary of hhs for the proper and efficient administration of the state medicaid program proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to align all administrative reimbursement rates in medicaid at 50 hhs estimates that the proposal would save 945 million in fy2008 and 5315 billion over the fy2008fy2012 period cbo estimates that the proposal would save 1160 billion in fy2008 and 8380 billion over the fy2008fy2012 period reports see crs report rs22101 state medicaid program administration brief overview by april grady crs5 medicaid implement cost allocation background because of the overlap in eligible populations states often undertake administrative activities that benefit more than one program under the former aid to families with dependent children afdc cash welfare program afdc and medicaid program eligibility were linked and many afdc families also qualified for food stamps as result states often collected necessary information for all three programs during single eligibility interview or performed other shared administrative tasks and charged the full amount of the cost to afdc as matter of convenience since the federal government reimbursed states for 50 of administrative expenditures for all three programs total federal spending was not affected by the way in which states allocated the programs common administrative costs when congress replaced afdc with the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant program in 1996 the 50 federal match for expenditures related to cash welfare assistance ended and the automatic link between cash welfare and medicaid eligibility was severed later hhs clarified that states are required to allocate common administrative costs for tanf medicaid and food stamps based on the relative benefits derived by each program remaining issue of controversy stems from the fact that tanf block grants are calculated in part on the basis of pre1996 federal welfare spending including any amounts received by states as reimbursement for common administrative costs as result tanf block grants are higher in many states than they would be if common administrative costs attributable to medicaid and food stamps were excluded from block grant calculations to compensate congress has permanently reduced federal reimbursement for food stamp administrative costs in most states by flat dollar amount that reflects the administrative costs attributable to food stamps that are included in each states tanf block grant the annual reductions total nearly 200 million congress has not reduced federal reimbursement for medicaid administrative costs in similar manner proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to recoup medicaid administrative costs assumed in states tanf block grants hhs and cbo both estimate that the proposal would save 280 million in fy2008 and 1770 billion over the fy2008fy2012 period reports see crs report rs22101 state medicaid program administration brief overview by april grady medicaid require state reporting and link performance to reimbursement background the budget act of 1997 mandated performance monitoring as tool for ensuring the delivery of quality services in medicaid and schip among several initiatives the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms formed the performance measurement partnership project pmpp to select common set of measures that can be used by medicaid and schip programs on voluntary basis to assess the quality of care crs6 proposal the presidents budget proposal would seek legislation to require states to monitor and report on medicaid performance measures aimed at improving quality of care program integrity and efficiency and would link performance to federal medicaid grant awards reporting would begin in fy2008 with threeyear phasein for each of the measures beginning in 2011 states that fail to meet targeted thresholds for each performance measure would be subject to an fmap or medicaid grant award reduction depending on the performance measure these reductions would remain in effect until the state meets the designated thresholds for specific performance measures budget documents further indicate that performance measures currently being considered include increasing estate recovery collection rates and reducing the prevalence of daily physical restraints in nursing homes for this proposal hhs estimates cost impact in fy2008 and savings of 330 million over the fy2008fy2012 period cbo estimates cost impact in fy2008 and savings of 350 million over the fy2008fy2012 period reports currently other crs reports address this topic medicaid reimburse targeted case management at 50 percent rate background under current law case management is an optional benefit under the medicaid state plan that assists medicaid beneficiaries in gaining access to needed medical social educational and other services the term targeted case management refers to situations in which these services are not provided statewide to all medicaid beneficiaries but rather are provided only to specific classes of individuals eg those with aids tuberculosis chronic physical or mental illness developmental disabilities or children in foster care or to persons who reside in specific area the federal government matches payments for such services using the federal medical assistance percentage fmap which is the rate applicable to medicaid benefits fmaps can range from 50 to 83 statutory upper boundary depending on the state in fy2008 13 states will have an fmap equal to 50 case management can also be claimed as an administrative activity rather than as medicaid benefit when claimed as an administrative service the federal government matches case management at the 50 rate applicable to most administrative services proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation that would set the federal reimbursement rate for all case management activities at 50 to ensure that such services are reimbursed in cost effective and efficient manner the administration maintains that case management activities are inherently the same regardless of how federal matching funds are claimed and that the availability of different matching rates has resulted in states choosing to submit claims for case management that will yield the highest reimbursement rate for example states may claim case management services as benefit rather than as an administrative activity when the fmap for the state is higher than the standard 50 match rate for administrative activities hhs estimates that the proposal would save 200 million in fy2008 and 1160 billion over the fy2008fy2012 period cbo estimates that the proposal crs7 would save 225 million in fy2008 and 1370 billion over the fy2008fy2012 period reports for general information on medicaid administrative costs see crs report rs22101 state medicaid program administration brief overview by april grady medicaid rationalize pharmacy reimbursement background under current law state medicaid programs set the prices paid to pharmacies for medicaid outpatient drugs federal reimbursements for those drugs however are limited to federal upper limit ful the ful that applies to drugs available from multiple sources generic drugs for the most part is calculated by cms to be equal to 250 of the average manufacturers price amp the average price paid by wholesalers to manufacturers as reported to cms by the manufacturers proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation that would build on changes made by the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra to achieve additional savings in the medicaid program the proposal would reduce the fuls on multiple source drugs from 250 of the amp to 150 of the amp of the lowest priced drug in the group hhs estimates that the proposal would save 160 million in fy2008 and 1200 billion over the fy2008fy2012 period cbo estimates that the proposal would save 325 million in fy2008 and 2225 billion over the fy2008fy2012 period reports for more information on the medicaid provisions of dra 2005 see crs report rl33131 budget reconciliation fy2006 medicaid medicare and state childrens health insurance program schip provisions by evelyne p baumrucker et and crs report rl33251 sidebyside comparison of medicare medicaid and schip provisions in the deficit reduction act of 2005 by karen tritz et additional background information on medicaid prescription drugs can be found in crs report rl30726 prescription drug coverage under medicaid by jean hearne medicaid allow optional managed formulary background federal statute allows state medicaid programs to establish formularies or lists of preferred pharmaceuticals to be made available to medicaid beneficiaries when health care insurers or providers cover only those drugs on the list and deny payment for others the list is referred to as closed formulary medicaid formularies are seldom as restrictive as the closed formularies found in the private market for insurance because of two requirements 1 states are required to provide any nonformulary drug with the exception of drugs in specific categories described below that is specifically requested and approved through prior authorization process and 2 states are required to cover all drugs offered by manufacturers entering into rebate agreements with the secretary of hhs crs8 states on the other hand are permitted to exclude certain categories of drug products from medicaid coverage these include drugs used to treat anorexia weight loss or weight gain b to promote fertility c for cosmetic purposes or hair growth d for the relief of coughs and colds for smoking cessation and f prescription vitamins and mineral products except prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparations g nonprescription drugs h barbiturates i benzodiazepines and j drugs requiring tests or monitoring that can only be provided by the drug manufacturer formularies may also exclude drug for which there is significant therapeutic advantage over other drugs that are included in the formularies as long as there is written explanation of the reason for its exclusion and the explanation is available to the public as of january 1 2006 federal law also prohibits federal medicaid funds from being used to pay for drugs for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to allow states to use private sector management techniques to leverage greater discounts through negotiations with drug manufacturers the managed formulary is described as list of prescription drug products that are not covered under the program hhs estimates that the proposal would save 160 million in fy2008 and 870 million over the fy2008fy2012 period cbo estimates that the proposal would save 10 million in fy2008 and 175 million over the fy2008fy2012 period reports for general background on medicaid prescription drug benefits formularies and other cost control mechanisms used in administering those benefits see crs report rl30726 prescription drug coverage under medicaid by jean hearne medicaid require tamperresistant prescription pads background there are currently federal medicaid laws or rules regarding the use of prescription pads thirteen states however utilize tamperresistant pads proposal the presidents budget proposed to require all states where providers use handwritten prescription pads to use tamperresistant pads hhs estimates that the proposal would save 35 million in fy2008 and 210 million over the fy2008fy2012 period cbo estimates that the proposal would save 15 million in fy2008 and 150 million over the fy2008fy2012 period recent action war supplemental appropriations bill that was vetoed on may 1 2007 hr 1591 included provision that would have required the use of tamperresistant pads for medicaid prescriptions subsequent war supplemental enacted on may 25 pl 11028 included the same provision which will apply to prescriptions executed after september 30 2007 legislation to delay implementation of the new requirement for six months pl 11090 was enacted at the end of september reports for general background on medicaid prescription drug benefits formularies and other cost control mechanisms used in administering those benefits crs9 see crs report rl30726 prescription drug coverage under medicaid by jean hearne medicaid replace best price with budget neutral rebate background under medicaid drug manufacturers that wish to have their drugs available for medicaid enrollees are required to enter into rebate agreements with the secretary of hhs on behalf of the states under the agreements pharmaceutical manufacturers must provide state medicaid programs with rebates on drugs paid on behalf of medicaid beneficiaries the formulas used to compute the rebates are intended to ensure that medicaid pays the lowest price that the manufacturers offer for the drugs rebate calculations depend on the type of drug for single source and innovator multiple source drugs basic rebate amounts are determined by comparing the average manufacturer price amp for drug the average price paid by wholesalers to the best price which is the lowest price offered by the manufacturer in the same period to any wholesaler retailer nonprofit or public entity the basic rebate is the greater of 151 of the amp or the difference between the amp and the best price additional rebates are required if the weighted average prices for all of given manufacturers single source and innovator multiple source drugs rise faster than inflation for noninnovator multiple source drugs basic rebates are equal to 11 of the amp proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to eliminate the best price from the rebate formula for single source and innovator multiple source drugs changing the best pricebased formula to flat rebate this change is intended to be made in budget neutral manner hhs explanatory materials describe the proposal as way to simplify drug rebate calculations and as way to allow private purchasers to negotiate lower prices without affecting medicaid drug costs hhs and cbo both estimate that the proposal would have cost impact in fy2008 or over the fy2008fy2012 period reports for general background on medicaid prescription drug coverage and pricing including description of drug rebates see crs report rl30726 prescription drug coverage under medicaid by jean hearne medicaid expand asset verification system background the social security administration is piloting financial account verification system in field offices located in new york and new jersey that uses an electronic asset verification system to help confirm that individuals who apply for supplemental security income ssi benefits are eligible the process permits automated paperless transmission of asset verification requests between ssa field offices and financial institutions part of this pilot involved comprehensive study to measure the value of such system for ssi applicants as well as recipients already on the payment rolls this study identified small percentage about 5 percent of applicants and recipients who were overpaid based on this financial account verification system crs10 proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to expand the ssa pilot to cms programs whose eligibility criteria include limitations on financial resources cms would work with states to establish medicaid pilots in the same locations as ssa hhs estimates that the proposal would save 65 million in fy2008 and 640 million over the fy2008fy2012 period cbo estimates that the proposal would save 50 million in fy2008 and 460 million over the fy2008fy2012 period recent action hr 3162 the schip reauthorization bill passed by the house on august 1 would implement similar proposal legislation pl 11090 to apply the ssa pilot to medicaid beginning on october 1 2007 and ending on september 30 2012 was enacted at the end of september two schip bills vetoed by president bush hr 976 and hr 3963 would have applied the pilot beginning on october 1 2012 reports for information on the provisions in schip reauthorization legislation see crs report rl34129 medicaid and schip provisions in hr 3162 and s 1893hr 976 by evelyne baumrucker et medicaid enhance third party liability background third party liability tpl refers to the legal obligation of third parties individuals entities or programs to pay all or part of the expenditures for medical assistance furnished under medicaid in general federal law requires medicaid to be the payer of last resort meaning that all other available third parties must meet their legal obligation to pay claims before the medicaid program pays for the care of an individual states are required to take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay for care and services available under the state medicaid plan if state has determined that probable liability exists at the time claim for reimbursement is filed it generally must reject the claim and return it to the provider for determination of the amount of thirdparty liability referred to as cost avoidance if probable liability has not been established or the third party is not available to pay the individuals medical expenses the state must pay the claim and then attempt to recover the amount paid referred to as pay and chase states are generally required to cost avoid claims unless they have an approved waiver that allows them to use the payandchase method however there are two statutory exceptions to this rule in the case of prenatal and preventive pediatric care states are required to use pay and chase in the case of medicaid beneficiary whose parent provides medical support eg health insurance coverage via an employer as part of child support order being enforced by the state the state must use pay and chase if provider has not been paid under the medical support arrangement within 30 days in some cases medicaid beneficiary may be required to reimburse the state for medicaid expenses paid on his or her behalf to facilitate such reimbursement the state may place lien on the medicaid beneficiarys property with certain exceptions federal law generally prohibits states from imposing medicaid liens on crs11 the property of living beneficiaries in contrast federal law permits medicaid liens on the estates of deceased beneficiaries in wider variety of situations proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to allow states to avoid costs for prenatal and preventive pediatric claims where third party is responsible collect for medical child support where health insurance is derived from noncustodial parents obligation to provide coverage and recover medicaid expenditures from beneficiary liability settlements hhs estimates that the proposal would save 10 million in fy2008 and 85 million over the fy2008fy2012 period cbo estimates that the proposal would save 40 million in fy2008 and 235 million over the fy2008fy2012 period reports currently other crs reports address this topic medicaid define home equity limit at 500000 background the deficit reduction act of 2005 amended the social security act to exclude from medicaid eligibility for nursing facility or other longterm care services certain individuals with an equity interest in their home of greater than 500000 under the law the state may elect without regard to medicaids requirements concerning statewideness and comparability to substitute an amount that exceeds 500000 but does not exceed 750000 these dollar amounts are increased beginning in 2011 from year to year based on the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers all items united states city average rounded to the nearest 1000 the secretary establishes process for waiving this provision in the case of demonstrated hardship individuals whose spouse child under age 21 or child who is blind or disabled as defined by the section 1614 of the social security act lawfully resides in the individuals home would not be excluded from eligibility proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation that would limit the allowable home equity amount to 500000 for all states by eliminating the state option to increase the equity limit to number between 500000 and 750000 hhs estimates that the proposal would save 70 million in fy2008 and 430 million over the fy2008fy2012 period cbo estimates that the proposal would save 70 million in fy2008 and 415 million over the fy2008fy2012 period reports for more information about home equity and medicaid eligibility see crs report rl33593 medicaid coverage for longterm care eligibility asset transfers and estate recovery by julie stone medicaid extend section 1915b waiver period background section 1915b of the social security act gives the secretary of hhs the authority to waive certain medicaid program requirements including statewideness comparability of services and freedom of choice of provider4 to 4 freedom of choice refers to requirement that medicaid beneficiaries have the freedom continued crs12 allow states to establish mandatory managed care programs that restrict the providers from whom beneficiary may obtain covered services or that create carve out delivery system for specialty care as long as such programs do not negatively impact beneficiary access and quality of care of services prior to passage of the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 state had to obtain section 1115 or section 1915b freedomofchoice waiver from the secretary of hhs if it wanted to require medicaid recipients to enroll in managed care program5 section 1915b waiver programs are generally approved for twoyear period and must be cost effective cannot cost more than what the medicaid program would have cost without the waiver they may not be used to expand eligibility to individuals not otherwise eligible under the approved medicaid state plan but cost savings achieved under the waivers may used to provide additional services ie those not typically provided under the state plan to medicaid beneficiaries proposal the presidents budget seeks legislation to extend the renewal period for 1915b freedom of choice waivers from two years to three years hhs estimates that the proposal would have cost impact in fy2008 or over the fy2008fy2012 period cbo did not provide an estimate for the proposal reports for more information on medicaid managed care see crs report rl33711 medicaid managed care an overview and key issues for congress by elicia j herz medicaid modify the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa background the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa pl 104191 established number of rules for employerbased health insurance plans to improve access to and portability of plans for people enrolled or enrolling into those plans one of those provisions requires employerbased health plans to allow for new enrollment into the plan during periods outside of the typical annual open enrollment period for certain special reasons examples of those reasons include when an eligible employee or their dependent exhausts cobra continuation coverage or when an employee gains new dependent through birth or adoption another hipaa provision limits the ability of private health insurance plans to exclude coverage for preexisting conditions during what are known as pre existing condition exclusion periods the allowable length of such preexisting condition exclusion periods depends on the amount of time the new enrollee had 4 continued to choose their medical care providers

coverage6 beneficiary can prove they have had prior creditable coverage by providing certificates issued by insurers at the end of each year because hipaa was created in law before schip was established schip was not included on the list of types of health insurance that can be considered as prior creditable coverage proposal the presidents budget seeks several legislative changes relating to hipaa the first would define determination of medicaid or schip eligibility as qualifying event allowing for special enrollment period into employerbased health insurance plans this provision is intended to improve medicaid and schip programs ability to coordinate coverage with private employeroffered coverage the second proposal would require schip programs to issue certificates of creditable coverage this provision is intended to improve the reach of hipaas portability provisions by recognizing schip coverage as prior creditable coverage both of these interpretations have

for families who lose medicaid eligibility due to an increase in earned income or hours of employment however congress expanded workrelated tma benefits in 1988 requiring states to provide at least six and up to 12 months of tma coverage to families losing medicaid eligibility due to increased hours of work or income from employment as well as to families who lose eligibility due to the loss of timelimited earned income disregard such disregards allow families to qualify for medicaid at higher income levels for set period of time congress has acted on numerous occasions to extend these

policy overview and trends ruth ellen wasem medicaid revise payments for government providers background aggregate medicaid payments to specific groups of institutional providers eg hospitals and nursing facilities cannot exceed reasonable estimate of what would have been paid under medicare payment principles this is called the medicaid upper payment limit upl rule in many states medicare payment rates for hospital and nursing home care are higher than corresponding medicaid payment rates the upl based on medicare payment principles has enabled some states to draw down additional federal dollars that exceed what they would have received based on medicaid payment rates these additional funds are paid to government providers which are sometimes required by states to transfer all or portion of the extra payments received ie some or all of the difference between the medicare and medicaid payment rates back to the state through an intergovernmental transfer igt instead of financing more or improved medicaid services in some cases states have used the additional federal dollars for nonhealth services or to make up part of the state share of medicaid costs to draw down another round of federal dollars during 20002002 congress and the clinton and bush administrations revised upl rules by changing permissible accounting methods used to claim federal crs16 matching payments these changes significantly reduced the excess federal dollars states received under approved upl plans that involved igts however these reforms did not eliminate all such excess payments because changes were made to the medicaid upl standard which remains tied to the medicare payment rate nor to federal statute or regulations governing igts administration officials have taken additional steps to curb what they have identified as improper state financing mechanisms especially certain intergovernmental transfers in late 2003 cms began requesting detailed information regarding the sources of the state share of medicaid costs from states applying for medicaid waivers and submitting medicaid state plan amendments in some cases these proposals were modified to minimize the use of improper igts ie igts that use recycling mechanisms under which payments to providers are returned to the state artificially inflating the federal matching rate proposal the presidents budget would through administrative action 1 clarify that only units of government are able to contribute to the financing of the nonfederal share of medicaid costs 2 establish minimum requirements for documenting cost when using certified public expenditure as part of the nonfederal share 3 cap payments to government providers to more than the cost of providing services to medicaid

providerspecific taxes to fund its state share of medicaid expenditures is limited if states establish providerspecific taxes the taxes must be broad based in that they apply to all providers within class they cannot exceed 25 of the state or nonfederal share of medicaid expenditures and the state cannot provide guarantee to the providers that the taxes will be returned to them however if the taxes returned to provider are less than 6 of the providers revenues ceiling created in regulation by hhs the prohibition on guaranteeing the return of tax funds is not violated as result state could impose provider tax of 6 of revenues return those revenues to the provider in the form of medicaid payment and receive federal match for those amounts in effect the state has temporarily borrowed funds from the provider for the purpose of inflating federal matching funds in 2006 congress included provision in the tax relief and health care act of 2006 trhca pl 109432 preventing the secretary of hhs from taking action to reduce this percentage the law fixed the provider tax ceiling in statute at 6 except for the period january 1 2008september 31 2011 during which the rate is fixed at 55

that is above medicaid eligibility levels states may choose among three benefit options when designing their schip programs they may enroll targeted lowincome children in medicaid create separate state program or devise combination of both approaches all states the district of columbia and five territories have schip programs nearly 40 billion has been appropriated for schip for fy1998fy2007 the authorized appropriation for fy2007 is 504 billion annual allotments among the states are determined by formula that is based on combination of the number of lowincome children and lowincome uninsured children in the state and includes cost factor that represents the average health service industry wages in the state compared to the national average states that set up an schip program are entitled to federal reimbursement up to cap for percentage of the incurred costs of covering enrolled individuals this percentage which varies by state is called the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage fmap it is based on the fmap used for the medicaid program but is higher in schip than in medicaid in other words the federal government contributes more toward the coverage of individuals in schip 65 to 83 in fy2008 than it does for those covered under medicaid 50 to 76 in fy200812 states have three years to spend each annual allotment eg states have until the end of fy2007 to spend their fy2005 allotments at the end of the applicable threeyear period unspent funds are reallocated among states based on yearspecific rules in the early years of the schip both states that did and did not fully exhaust their original allotments received unspent funds for more recent years only those states that fully exhaust their original allotments receive unspent funds some states have experienced shortfalls in schip funds meaning at the end of given fiscal year they have spent all federal schip funds available to them at that point in time including original allotments and reallocations of unspent funds from other states although schip appropriations are currently slated for fy2008 forward both omb and cbo assume that the program continues at the fy2007 appropriation

states already covering them childless adults schip eligibility could not be expanded to new groups of nonpregnant adults13 for fy2008 the presidents budget calls for more additional schip appropriations above the 504 billion assumed in the baseline however the presidents budget would reduce the period of availability of original allotments from three years to single year this means that as of the end of fy2007 any remaining balances of states fy2006 and fy2007 federal schip funds would be available for redistribution in addition to the redistribution of unspent fy2005 funds slated under current law crs currently projects that reducing the period of availability of these original allotments would make nearly 4 billion of federal schip funds available for potential redistribution in fy2008 depending on how the funds are targeted this could be enough to cover the fy2008 projected shortfalls less any applicable reduction in shortfalls from the reduction in the fmap discussed above although additional schip appropriations are called for in fy2008 because of the availability of redistribution funds as described above 4813 billion in additional allotment funds would be appropriated over the fy2009fy2012 period hhs estimates that the proposal would have impact on schip outlays in fy2007 and that it would increase schip outlays by 1220 billion in fy2008 and

medicare and unemployment taxes the income and employment tax exclusions apply to both single and family coverage which includes the employees spouse and dependents the employees share of the premium may be paid with aftertax dollars in which case they can be taken in consideration for the medical expenses itemized deduction or subject to premium conversion arrangement insurance benefits paid from employmentbased plans are generally excluded from gross income if they are reimbursements for medical expenses or payments for permanent physical injuries benefits not meeting these tests are taxable in proportion to the share of the insurance costs paid by the employer that were previously excluded from gross income benefits received by highly compensated employees under discriminatory selfinsured plans may be partly taxable selfinsured plan is one in which the employer assumes the risk for health care plan and does not shift it to third party employers may deduct their insurance and other health care payments as business expense the deduction is not tax benefit but calculation necessary for the proper measurement of the net income that is subject to taxation revenue loss attributable to this deduction is not considered tax expenditure background on premium conversions under cafeteria plan option known as premium conversion employees may elect to reduce their taxable wages in exchange for having their share of health insurance premiums paid on pretax basis15 the arrangement saves both income and employment taxes premium conversion is not available to retirees however employer payments for retiree health insurance is excluded from taxes just as they are for active workers for many retirees the employer pays much of the premium background on flexible spending accounts flexible spending accounts fsas are employerestablished benefit plans that reimburse employees for specified expenses as they are incurred fsa reimbursements funded through salary reduction agreements the most common arrangement are exempt from income and employment taxes under cafeteria plan provisions because employees have choice between cash their regular salary and nontaxable benefit in contrast fsa reimbursements funded by nonelective employer contributions are exempt from taxation directly under provisions applying to employerpaid dependent care or health insurance background on unreimbursed medical expenses itemized deduction taxpayers who itemize their deductions may deduct unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 75 of adjusted gross income agi medical expenses include health insurance premiums paid by the taxpayer principally premiums for individual market 15 cafeteria plans are employerestablished benefit plans under which employees may choose between receiving cash typically additional takehome pay and certain normally nontaxable benefits such as employerpaid health insurance without being taxed on the value of the benefits if they select the latter crs27 policies and the employees share of premiums for employment based coverage aside from those subject to premium conversion arrangement more generally medical expenses include amounts paid for the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body they also include certain transportation and lodging expenditures qualified longterm care costs and longterm care insurance premiums that do not exceed certain amounts the jct estimated that the fy2007 tax expenditure attributable to the medical expense deduction including longterm care expenses will be about 82 billion proposal the presidents budget proposes new health insurance tax deduction of 7500 for selfonly coverage or 15000 for family coverage the deduction would apply to both income and payroll taxes and would be the same regardless of the cost of the insurance or whether it was obtained in the individual and small group markets or through ones employer the proposal would terminate the exclusion for employer provided health insurance the selfemployed premium deduction the exclusion or deduction of health care spending for insurance premiums and outofpocket expenses except for expenses covered under hsas the exclusion of fsas from income and employment taxes and the itemized deduction for medical expenses for those not enrolled in medicare employers would be required to report the value of health insurance coverage to their employees on their annual form w2 and such amounts would be subject to withholding and employment taxes businesses would continue to deduct employerprovided health insurance as business expense the exclusion and deduction for health savings account contributions would not be affected effective for tax years beginning after 2008 omb estimates that the proposal would increase outlays by 231 million and reduce revenue by 31433 billion in 2009 increase outlays by 14280 billion and

medical expenses deductibles copayments and services not covered by insurance on taxadvantaged basis hsas can be established and funded by eligible individuals when they have qualifying high deductible health plan hdhp ie high deductible insurance with deductible in 2007 of at least 1100 for selfonly coverage and 2200 for family coverage qualifying hdhps must also limit outofpocket expenses for covered benefits to certain amounts with some exceptions eligible individuals cannot have other health insurance coverage hsa tax advantages can be significant for some people contributions are deductible or excluded from income that is taxable if made by employers withdrawals are not taxed if used for medical expenses and account earnings are tax exempt hsas are included in what some call consumerdriven health plans one objective of these plans is to encourage individuals and families to set money aside for their health care expenses another is to give them financial incentive for spending health care dollars prudently still another goal is to give them the means to pay for health care services of their own choosing without constraint by insurers or employers proposal the presidents fy2008 budget proposes to allow health plans to be considered hsaeligible if they meet all the existing requirements of an hdhp except that in lieu of satisfying the minimum deductible requirement they have at least 50 coinsurance requirement and minimum outofpocket risk that under guidelines established by the secretary would result in the same or lower premium as hdhp would under current law the proposal includes additional changes be made to hsas including 1 allowing family coverage to include coverage where each individual in the family can receive benefits once they have reached the minimum deductible for an individual hdhp 2 allowing both spouses to contribute the catchup contribution to single hsa owned by one spouse if both spouses are eligible individuals 3 allowing an individual to be covered by flexible spending arrangement fsa or health reimbursement arrangement hra with first dollar coverage and still contribute to an hsa but offset the maximum allowable hsa contribution by the level of fsa or hra coverage 4 allowing qualified medical expenses to include any medical expense incurred on or after the first day of hdhp coverage if individuals have established an hsa by their return filing date for that year and 5 excluding from the comparability rules extra employer contributions to hsas on behalf of employees who are chronically ill or employees who have spouses or dependents who are chronically ill all of the hsarelated proposals would be effective for years beginning after december 31 2007 crs29 while the presidents proposal would replace the current law tax exclusion of employerprovided health insurance with flat deduction the current exclusion or deduction for hsa contributions would not be affected

coverage tax credit background the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 authorized federal income tax credit of 65 of what eligible taxpayers pay for qualified health insurance for themselves and their family members the credit is refundable so taxpayers may claim the full credit even if they have little or federal income tax liability the credit can also be advanced so taxpayers need not wait until they file their tax returns in order to benefit from it eligibility for the hctc is limited to three groups of taxpayers the first two consist of individuals who are eligible for trade adjustment assistance allowances because they have lost manufacturing jobs due to increased foreign imports or shifts in production outside the united states the third consists of individuals whose defined benefit pension plans were taken over by the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc due to financial difficulties eligible individuals cannot be enrolled in certain other health insurance eg medicaid or entitled to certain other coverage eg medicare part eligible individuals can claim the hctc only if they make payments for qualified insurance the statute limits qualified insurance to ten different categories of coverage three of the coverage categories are known as automatically qualified health plans the other seven categories of coverage are known as state qualified plans individuals may choose these options only if their state has chosen or established these plans to be included as qualified coverage coverage under state qualified plans must provide consumer protections to all qualifying individuals plans must guarantee issue offer coverage to all qualifying applicants and not deny coverage based on preexisting conditions premiums without regard to subsidies must not be greater for qualifying individuals than for other similarly situated individuals and benefits for qualifying individuals must be the same as or substantially similar to those for others in short the statute attempts to ensure that state qualified plans are open to all qualifying applicants and do not charge more or provide fewer benefits to people who are receiving the credit the consumer protections do not preclude use of medical underwriting to set premiums crs30 proposal the presidents fy2008 budget includes proposal that would allow state qualified plans to impose preexisting condition exclusion for period of up to 12 months provided the plan reduces the restriction period by the length of the eligible individuals creditable coverage as of the date of application for the state qualified plan the fy2008 budget also proposes allowing the spouse of an hctceligible individual to claim the credit when the hctceligible individual becomes entitled to medicare the spouse would have to be at least 55 years of age omb estimates that the proposal would increase outlays by 4 million and reduce revenue by 1 million in 2008 increase outlays by 55 million and reduce revenue by 18 million for 2008 through 2012 and increase outlays by 139 million and reduce revenue by 51 million for 2008 through 2017 jct estimates that the proposal would reduce net

whitaker health insurance establishing association health plans background most individuals obtain their health insurance at work with both employers and workers contributing to the cost or monthly premiums of the health insurance plans sometimes employers will sponsor health insurance coverage offered through trade or professional associations for smaller employers insurance purchased through such an association can be easier to obtain compared with having to negotiate through the confusing offerings of the private insurance market on their own associations with members that cross state lines however have argued that their plans could be more affordable if they were exempt from multiple state insurance laws under current law plans offered by any insurer or multiple employer16 group such as an association are subject to the entire body of state insurance law for any state in which those products are offered proposal the presidents budget proposes an initiative to establish association health plans such plans could allow small employers civic groups and community organizations to band together and use their purchasing power to obtain health coverage for their employees members and their families 16 under federal law the term for groups of two or more employers that purchase insurance together is multiple employer welfare arrangement mewa crs31 reports for

creating competitive marketplace across state lines background states have primary jurisdiction over the regulation of health insurance carriers and products states have passed laws on numerous topics in this area benefit mandates patient protections rating laws grievance and appeals processes just to name few this has resulted in health insurance requirements totaling in the thousands insurance carriers and other health insurers particularly those that operate in multiple states have sought relief from these requirements they argue that reducing the number of applicable state laws will lead to more plan options at affordable prices in the private market one possible approach to reducing state regulation of health insurance is for multistate carriers to designate one state as the primary state with respect to applicable insurance laws another approach is to allow qualified insurers to offer coverage that does not meet any state benefit mandates both approaches could provide flexibility to carriers to design cheaper lessgenerous health insurance products but maintain some level of existing consumer protections proposal the presidents budget proposes an initiative to

rs22476 standardizing state health insurance regulation by jean hearne and bernadette fernandez and crs report rl31963 association sponsored health plans legislation in the 109th congress by jean hearne health insurance reforming medical liability law background the rising cost of medical malpractice insurance is public policy concern because of its potential impact on the availability of health care providers and services as malpractice insurance becomes increasingly expensive some physicians claim that premium increases have forced them to limit the services they provide move their practice locations or leave medicine altogether they cite frivolous lawsuits and unreasonably large jury awards as the causes of the malpractice insurance crisis however lawyer and consumer groups counter that the insurance industry is to blame for the rapid rise in malpractice insurance premiums these groups contend that bad investment choices in addition to the underwriting cycle have led to dwindling profits for insurers who then try to recoup their losses through expensive insurance products there is third perspective which has not generated the same level of attention or controversy that sees the overall medical error rate as the root of the problem proposal the presidents budget proposes an initiative to reform medical liability law with the expectation it will increase access to quality affordable health crs32 care while reducing nonmeritorious lawsuits against doctors and other health care providers reports for more information on reforming medical liability see crs report rl33358 medical malpractice an overview by bernadette fernandez and baird webel health insurance fostering affordable choices background under current law uninsured individuals in need of medical care must either selfpay for health care services or forego them for very large inpatient hospital costs uninsured individuals are sometimes able to negotiate price reduction the unpaid portion of the bills are written off as bad debt or charity care certain hospitals provide disproportionate share of charity care and uncompensated care to people who are not able to pay under medicaid states are required to make special payments to hospitals that provide disproportionate amount relative to other hospitals of uncompensated care and care to medicaid beneficiaries proposal the presidents budget proposes to have the secretary of hhs work with congress on establishing more efficient distribution of institutional payments redirecting some portion toward health insurance for people with poor health or limited income the proposal seeks to focus on helping the uninsured purchase private insurance in order to improve the likelihood that people would receive the care they need in the most appropriate setting such health care reforms would be statebased and budget neutral reports for background information on medicaid dsh payments see crs report 97483 medicaid

discretionary funding for the health care fraud and abuse control program at hhs two sense of the congress provisions regarding health care cost growth and affordable health coverage appropriations in general spending for medicaid and schip is not controlled through the annual appropriations process medicaid is an entitlement program meaning that its spending level is based on the underlying benefit and eligibility criteria established in law19 schip is capped grant program with appropriation amounts authorized for set period of time currently through march 31 2009 however the annual appropriations process does provide an opportunity for congress to place limitations on the availability of funds for specified activities20 for example the labor health and human services and education bill regularly contains restrictions that limit the circumstances under which federal funds can be used to pay for abortions21 spending for other health insurance provisions is more complicated and must be examined on casebycase basis as with medicaid and schip some spending including tax expenditures may be based on underlying statute other spending may occur through the annual appropriations process eg certain state grants associated with the health coverage tax credit 19 see crs report rs20129 entitlements and appropriated entitlements in the federal budget process by bill
