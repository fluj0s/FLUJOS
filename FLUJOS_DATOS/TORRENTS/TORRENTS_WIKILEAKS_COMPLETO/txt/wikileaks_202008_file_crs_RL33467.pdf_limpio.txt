wade that the us constitution protects womans decision to terminate her pregnancy in doe v bolton companion decision the court found that state may not unduly burden the exercise of that fundamental right with regulations that prohibit or substantially limit access to the means of effectuating the decision to have an abortion rather than settle the issue the courts rulings since roe and doe have continued to generate debate and have precipitated variety of governmental actions at the national state and local levels designed either to nullify the ru lings or limit their effect these governmental regulations have in turn spawned further litigatio n in which resulting judicial refinements in the law have been more successful in dampening the controversy in recent years the rights enumerated in roe have been redefined by decisions such as webster v reproductive health services which gave greater leeway to the states to restrict abortion and rust v sullivan which narrowed the scope of permissible abortionrelated activities that are linked to federal funding the courts decision in planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey which established the undue burden standard for determining whether abortion restrictions are permissible gave congress additional impetus to move on statutory responses to the abortion issue such as the freedom of choice act in each congress since 1973 constitutional amendments to prohibit abortion have been introduced these measures have been considered in committee but none has been passed by either the house or the senate legislation to prohibit specific abortion procedure the socalled partialbirth abortion procedure was passed in the 108 th congress the partialbirth abortion ban act appears to be one of the only examples of congress restrict ing the performance of medical procedure legislation that would prohibit the knowing transport of minor across state lines for the purpose of obtaining an abortion has

implement existing federal health care consci ence protection laws under the socalled church amendments the weldon amendment and certain pr ovisions of the public health service act specified individuals or entities may not be discriminated against for failing to participate in activities related to abortion1 the new rule provides definitions for some of the terms used in the conscience protection laws establishes written certification of compliance requirement for recipients of federal health care funds and identifies hhss office of civil rights as the entity responsible for complaint handling and investigation hhs maintains that the new rule is necessary to educate the public and health care providers on the protections afforded by federal law2 the agency also notes that the new rule will foster more inclusive tolerant environment in the he alth care industry than may currently exist3 opponents of the new rule however contend that the new rule could jeopardize the health of individuals by making it more difficult to obtain health care services and information they argue for example that the new rule could limit the availability of oral contraceptives legislation that would appear to have halted the new rule was introduced in the 110th congress the protecting patients and health care act s 20hr 7310 was introduced by senator hillary rodham clinton and representative diana degette but was not considered by either chamber the 111th congress may attempt to address the new ru pursuant to the congressional review act which permits the use of expedited procedures to disapprove an agencys final rule4 alternately congress could enact legislation that amends the conscience protection laws to establish new definitions and procedures such legislation would have the likely effect of overriding the new rule the rule could also be amended or rescinded by further administrative action such action however would have to follow procedures established by the administrative procedure act 5 g12g158g141g146g140g146g138g149g561g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561 the primary focus of this report is legislative action with respect to abortion

g6g152g142g561g159g495g561g4g152g149g157g152g151 g561 in 1973 the supreme court issued its landmark abortion rulings in roe v wade 410 us 113 1973 and doe v bolton 410 us 179 1973 in those cases the court found that texas and georgia statutes regulating abortion interfered to an unconstitutional extent with womans right to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy the texas statute forbade all abortions not necessary for the purpose of saving the life of the mother the georgia enactment permitted abortions when continued pregnancy seriously threatened the womans life or health when the fetus was very likely to have severe birth defects or when the pregnancy resulted from rape the georgia statute required however that abortions be performed only at accredited hospitals and only after approval by hospital committee and two consulting physicians the courts decisions were delivered by justice blackmun for himself and six other justices justices white and rehnquist dissented the court ruled that states may not categorically proscribe abortions by making their performance crime and that states may not make abortions unnecessarily difficult to obtain by prescribing elaborate procedural guidelines the constitutional basis for the decisions rested upon the conclusion that the fourteenth amendment right of personal privacy embraced womans decision whether to carry pregnancy to term with regard to the scope of that privacy right the court stated that it included only personal rights that can be deemed fundamental or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty and bears some extension to activities related to marriage procreation contraception family relationship and child rearing and education roe 410 us at 15253 such right the court concluded is broad enough to encompass womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy id at 153 with respect to protection of the right against state interference the court held that since the right of personal privacy is fundamental right only compelling state interest could justify its limitation by state thus while it recognized the legitimacy of the state interest in protecting maternal health and the preservation of the fetus potential life id at 148150 as well as the existence of rational connection between these two interests and the states antiabortion law the court held these interests insufficient to justify an absolute ban on abortions instead the court emphasized the durational nature of pregnancy and found the states interests to be sufficiently compelling to permit curtailment or prohibition of abortion only during specified stages of pregnancy the high court concluded that until the end of the first trimester an abortion is more dangerous to maternal health than childbirth itself and found that with respect to the states important and legitimate interest in the health of the mother the compelling point in light of present medical knowledge is at approximately the end of the first trimester id at 163 only after the first trimester does the states interest in protecting maternal health provide sufficient basis to justify state regulation of abortion and then only to protect this interest id at 16364 the compelling point with respect to the states in terest in the potential life of the fetus is at viability following viability the states interest permits it to regulate and even proscribe an abortion except when necessary in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the woman id at 160 in summary the courts holding was grounded in this trimester framework analysis and the concept of fetal viability which was defined in postnatal terms id at 16465

just as states may not prevent abortion by making the performance crime states may not make abortions unreasonably difficult to obtain by prescribing elaborate procedural barriers in doe the court struck down state requirements that abortions be performed in licensed hospitals that abortions be approved beforehand by hospital committee and that two physicians concur in the abortion decision id at 19699 the court appeared to note however that this would not apply to statute that protected the religious or moral beliefs of denominational hospitals and their employees id at 19798 the court in roe also dealt with the question whether fetus is person under the fourteenth amendment and other provisions of the constitution the court indicated that the constitution never specifically defines person but added that in nearly all the sections where the word person appears the use of the word is such that it has application only postnatally none indicates with any assurance that it has any possible prenatal application 410 us at 157 the court emphasized that given the fact that in the major part of the 19 th century prevailing legal abortion practices were far freer than today the court was persuaded that the word person as used in the fourteenth amendment does not include the unborn id at 158 the court did not however resolve the question of when life actually begins while noting the divergence of thinking on this issue it instead articulated the legal concept of viability defined as the point at which the fetus is potentially able to live outside the womb although the fetus may require artificial aid id at 160 many other questions were also not addressed in roe and doe but instead led to wealth of post roe litigation

planning funding from using federal funds to counsel women about the option of abortion while rust is probably better understood as case involving first amendment free speech rights rather than as challenge to the constitutionally guaranteed substantive right to abortion the court following its earlier public funding cases maher v roe and harris v mcrae did conclude that womans right to an abortion was not burdened by the title x regulations the court reasoned that there was constitutional violation because the government has duty to subsidize an activity simply

position than if congress had never enacted title x in addition to rust the court decided several other noteworthy cases involving abortion following roe webster v reproductive health services 492 us 490 1989 and planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey 505 us 833 1992 illustrate shift in direction by the court from the type of constitutional analysis it articulated in roe these cases and other more recent cases such as stenberg v carhart 530 us 914 2000 and ayotte v planned parenthood of northern new england 126 sct 961 2006 have implications for future legislative action and how enactments will be judged by the courts in the years to come webster casey and ayotte are discussed in the subsequent sections of this report discussion of stenberg is included in the partialbirth abortion section of the report g25g142g139g156g157g142g155g561 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the state of missouris abortion statute in webster v reproductive health services 492 us 49 1989 in this 54 decision while the majority did not overrule roe it indicated that it was willing to apply less stringent standard of review to state restrictions on abortion webster made it clear that state legislatures have considerable discretion to pass restrictive legislation in the future with the likelihood that such laws would probably pass constitutional muster the main provisions in the 1986 missouri law upheld by the court included 1 barring public employees from performing or assisting in abortions not necessary to save the life of the mother 2 barring the use of public buildings for performing abortions despite the fact that there were public monies involved eg building situated on public land and 3 requiring physicians believing woman desiring an abortion to be at least 20 weeks pregnant to perform tests to determine whether the fetus is viable the webster ruling was narrow in that it did not affect private doctors offices or clinics where most abortions are performed its significance derives more from the rationales articulated by the five ju stices regarding how abortion restrictions would be reviewed in the future however because the missouri law did not limit abortion prior to viability the plurality did not believe it was necessary to consider overruling roe webster set the stage for the courts 1992 decision in casey where real shift in direction was pronounced g5g138g156g142g162g561 both webster and rust energized legislative activity the former at both the federal and state levels and the latter at the federal level some of the state legislative proposals that became law were challenged in the courts eg pennsylvania guam louisiana and utah the pennsylvania case planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey 505 us 833 1992 was decided by the supreme court on june 29 1992 in highly fractionated 54 decision the court reaffirmed the basic constitutional right to an abortion while simultaneously allowing some new restrictions justices oconnor kennedy and s outer wrote the plurality opinion and they were joined in part by justices stevens and blackmun chief justice rehnquist and justices white scalia and thomas dissented the court refused to overrule roe and the plurality explained at length why it was important to follow precedent at the same time the plurality indicated that state laws which contained an outright ban on ab ortion would be unconstitutional nevertheless the court abandoned the trimester framework articulated in roe and the strict scrutiny standard of judicial review of abortion restrictions inst ead it adopted new analysis undue burden

restriction has the effect of imposing an undue burden on womans right to obtain an abortion undue burden was defined as substantial obstacle in the path of woman seeking an abortion of nonviable fetus 505 us at 877 the court applied this new analysis to the pennsylvania statute and concluded that four of the provisions did not impose an undue burden on the right to abortion and were constitutional the provisions that were upheld involved the 24hour waiting period informed consent parental consent for minors abortions with judicial bypass and reporting requirements the spousal notification provision which required married woman to tell her husband if she intended to have an abortion did not survive the undue burden test and was struck down as unconstitutional the courts decision in casey was significant because the new standard of review appeared to allow more state restrictions to pass constitutional muster in addition the casey court found that the states interest in protecting the potentiality of human life extended throughout the course of the pregnancy thus the state could regulate even to the point of favoring childbirth over abortion from the outset under roe which utilized the trimester framework womans decision to terminate her pregnancy was reached in consultation with her doctor with virtually state involvement during the first trimester of pregnancy moreover under roe abortion was fundamental right that could not be restricted by the state except to serve compelling state interest roes strict scrutiny form of review resulted in most state regulations being invalidated during the fi rst two trimesters of pregnancy the undue burden standard allowed greater regulation during that period this is evident from the fact that the casey court overruled in part two of its earlier decisions which had followed roe city of akron v akron center of reproductive health 462 us 416 1983 and thornburgh v american college of obstetricians and gynecologists 476 us 747 1986 in these cases the court applying strict scrutiny struck down 24hour waiting periods and informed consent provisions whereas in casey applying the undue burden standard the court upheld similar provisions casey had its greatest immediate effect on women in the state of pennsylvania however its reasoning prompted other states to pass similar restrictions that could withstand challenge under the undue burden standard g3g162g152g157g157g142g561 in ayotte v planned parenthood of northern new england 546 us 320 2006 the court concluded that wholesale invalidation of new hampshires parental notification prior to abortion act was inappropriate finding that only few applications of the act raised constitutional concerns the court remanded the case to the lower courts to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief the new hampshire law at issue in ayotte prohibited physicians from performing an abortion on pregnant minor or woman for whom guardi an or conservator was appointed until 48 hours after written notice was delivered to at least one parent or guardian the notification requirement could be waived under certain specified circumstances for example notification was not required if the attending abortion provider certified that an abortion was necessary to prevent the womans death and there was insufficient time to provide the required notice httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33467g3g139g152g155g157g146g152g151g497g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g20g142g156g153g152g151g156 g142g561 g561

providers challenged the new hampshire statute on the grounds that it did not include an explicit waiver that would allow an abortion to be performed to protect the health of the woman the first circuit invalidated the statute in its entirety on that basis the first circuit also maintained that the acts life exception was impermissibly vague and forced physicians to gamble with their patients lives by preventing them from performing an abortion without notification until they were certain that death was imminent declining to revisit its prior abortion decisions the court insisted that ayotte presented question of remedy maintaining that the act would be unconstitutional only in medical emergencies the court determined that more narrow remedy rath er than the wholesale invalidation of the act was appropriate generally speaking when confron ting constitutional flaw in statute we try to limit the solution to the problem we prefer for example to enjoin only the unconstitutional applications of statute while leaving other applications in force or to sever its problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact id at 32829 the court identified three interrelated principles that inform its approach to remedies first the court tries not to nullify more of legislatures work than is necessary because ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives of the people second the court restrains itself from rewriting state law to conform to constitutional requirements even as it attempts to salvage the law the court explained that its constitutional mandate and institutional competence are limited noting that making distinctions in murky constitutional context may involve far more serious invasion of the legislative domain than the court ought to take id at 330 third the touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent that is court cannot use its remedial powers to circumvent the intent of the legislature the court observed that after finding an application or portion of statute unconstitutional we must next ask would the legislature have preferred what is left of its statute to statute at all id on remand the lower courts were expected to determine the intent of the new hampshire legislature when it enacted the parental notification statute although the state argued that the measures severability clause illustrated the legislatures understanding that the act should continue in force even if certain provisions were invalidated the respondents insisted that new hampshire legislators actually preferred statute rather than one that would be enjoined in the manner described by the court on february 1 2007 federal district court in new hampshire entered procedural order that stayed consideration of the case while bill to repeal the parental notification prior to abortion act was pending in the state legislature 7 the act was subsequently repealed by the legislature effective june 29 2007 some criticized the courts willingness to invalidate the new hampshire statute only as it applied during medical emergencies while it is not uncommon for federal courts to save statute from invalidation by severing unconstitutional provisions these courts have generally limited this practice to federal statutes critics maintained that the courts opinion represented an impermissible expansion of federal judicial power over the states they also argued that the opinion could encourage states to enact legislation with provisions that are possibly or clearly 7 see planned parenthood

elective abortions or provide access to public facilities for such abortions beal v doe 432 us 438 1977 maher v roe 432 us 464 1977 and poelker v doe 432 us 519 1977 per curiam in beal v doe the court held that nothing in the language or legislative history of title xix of the social security act medicaid requires participating state to fund every medical procedure falling within the delineated categories of medical care the court ruled that it was not inconsistent with the acts goals to refuse to fund unnecessary medical services however the court did indicate that title xix left state free to include coverage for nontherapeutic abortions should it choose to do so similarly in maher v roe the court held that the equal protection clause does not require state participating in the medicaid program to pay expenses incident to nontherapeutic abortions simply because the state has made policy choice to pay expenses incident to childbirth more particularly connecticuts policy of favoring childbirth over abortion was held not to impinge upon the fundamental right of privacy recognized in roe which protects woman from undue interference in her decision to terminate pregnancy finally in poelker v doe the court upheld municipal regulation that denied indigent pregnant women nontherapeutic abortions at public hospitals it also held that staffing those hospitals with personnel opposed to the performance of abortions did not violate the equal protection clause of the constitution poelker however did not deal with the question of private hospitals and their authority to prohibit abortion services

stenberg v carhart 530 us 914 2000 its first substantive abortion case since casey in stenberg the court determined that nebraska statute that prohibited the performance of socalled partialbirth abortions was unconstitutional because it failed to include an exception to protect the health of the mother and because the language defining the prohibited procedure was too vague 8 in affirming the decision of the eighth circuit the court agreed that the language of the nebraska statute could be interpreted to prohibit not just the dilation and extraction dx procedure that prolife advocates oppose but the standard dilation and evacuation procedure that is the most common abortion procedure during the second trimester of pregnancy the court believed that the statute was likely to prompt those who perform the procedure to stop because of fear of prosecution and conviction the result would be the imposition of an undue burden on womans ability to have an abortion during the 106 th congress both the senate and house passed bills that would have prohibited the performance of partialbirth abortions the senate passed the partialbirth abortion ban act of 1999 s 1692 on october 21 1999 by vote of 6334 hr 3660 the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2000 was passed by the house on april 5 2000 by vote of 287141 although the house requested conference further action was taken similar partialbirth abortion measures were vetoed during the 104 th and 105th congresses in both instances president william j clinton focused on the failure to include an exception to the ban when the mothers health is an issue during the 107th congress the house passed hr 4965 the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2002 by vote of 274151 hr 4965 would have prohibited physicians from performing partialbirth abortion except when it was necessary to save the life of mother whose life was endangered by physical disorder physical illness or physical injury including life endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself the bill defined the term partialbirth abortion to mean an abortion in which the person performing the abortion deliberately and intentionally vaginally deliv ers living fetus until in the case of head first presentation the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother or in the case of breech presentation any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus physicians who violated the act would ve been subject to fine imprisonment for not more than two years or both hr 4965 was not considered by the senate during the 108 th congress on november 5 2003 the president signed s 3 the

agreed to the conference report by vote of 6434 on october 21 2003 in general the act prohibits physicians from performing partialbirth abortion except when it is necessary to save the life of mother whose life is endangered by physical disorder physical illness or physical injury including lifeendangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself physicians who violate the act are subject to fine imprisonment for not more than two years or both despite the courts holding in stenberg and past decisions that have found that restrictions on abortion must allow for the performance of an abortion when it is necessary to protect the health of the mother the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2003 does not include such an exception in his introductory statement for the act senator rick santorum discussed the measures lack of health exception 9 he maintained that an exception is not necessary because of the risks associated with partialbirth abortions senator santorum insisted that congressional hearings and expert testimony demonstrate that partial birth abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of the mother poses significant health risks to the woman and is outside the standard of medical care10 within two days of the acts signing federal courts in nebraska california and new york blocked its enforcement on april 18 2007 the court upheld the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2003 finding that as facial matter it is not unconstitutionally vague and does not impose an undue burden on womans right to terminate her pregnancy11 in gonzales v carhart 127 sct 1610 2007 the court distinguished the federal statute from the nebraska law at issue in stenberg according to the court the federal statut is not unconstitutionally vague because it provides doctors with reasonable opportunity to know what conduct is prohibited id at 1628 unlike the nebraska law which prohibited the delivery of substantial portion of the fetus the federal statute includes anatomical landmarks that identify when an abortion procedure will be subject to the acts prohibitions the court noted if an abortion procedure does not involve the delivery of living fetus to one of these anatomical landmarkswhere depending on the presentation either the fetal head or the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the b ody of the motherthe prohibitions of the act do not apply id at 1627 the court also maintained that the inclusion of scienter or knowledge requirement in the federal statute alleviates any vagueness concerns because the act applies only when doctor deliberately and intentionally delivers the fetus to an anatomical landmark the court concluded that doctor performing the procedure would not face criminal liability if fetus is 9 149 cong rec s2523

court observed the scienter requirements narrow the scope of the acts prohibition and limit prosecutorial discretion id at 1629 in reaching its conclusion that the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2003 does not impose an undue burden on womans right to terminate her pregnancy the court considered whether the federal statute is overbroad prohibiting both the dx and procedures the court also considered the statutes lack of health exception relying on the plain language of the act the court determined that the federal statute could not be interpreted to encompass the procedure the court maintained that the procedure involves the removal of the fetus in pieces in contrast the federal statute uses the phrase delivers living fetus the court stated does not involve the delivery of fetus because it requires the removal of fetal parts that are ripped from the fetus as they are pulled through the cervix id at 1630 the court also identified the acts specific requirement of an overt act that kills the fetus as evidence of its inapplicability to the procedure the court indicated this distinction matters because unlike dx standard does not involve delivery followed by fatal act id at 1631 because the act was found not to prohibit the procedure the court concluded that it is not overbroad and does not impose an undue burden womans ability to terminate her pregnancy according to the court the absence of health exception also did not result in an undue burden citing its decision in ayotte the court noted that health exception would be required if the act subjected women to significant health risks id at 1635 however acknowledging medical disagreement about the acts requirements ever imposing significant health risks on women the court maintained that the question becomes whether the act can stand when this medical uncertainty persists id at 1636 reviewing its past decisions the court indicated that it has given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty id the court concluded that this medical uncertainty provides sufficient basis to conclude in facial challenge of the statute that it does not impose an undue burden id at 1637 although the court upheld the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2003 without health exception it acknowledged that there may be discrete and welldefined instances where the prohibited procedure must be used id at 1638 however the court indicated that exceptions to the act should be considered in asapplied challenges br ought by individual plaintiffs in an asapplied challenge the nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced than in facial attack id at 163839 justice ginsburg authored the dissent in gonzales she was joined by justices stevens souter and breyer describing the courts decision as alarming justice ginsburg questioned upholding the federal statute when the relevant procedure has been found to be appropriate in certain cases id at 1641 citing expert testimony that had been introduced justice ginsburg maintained that the prohibited procedure has safety advantages for women with certain medical conditions including bleeding disorders and heart disease id at 164445 justice ginsburg also criticized the courts decision to uphold the statute without health exception justice ginsburg declared not only does it defy the courts longstanding precedent affirming the necessity of health exception with carveout for circumstances of medical uncertainty it gives short shrift to the record s before us

refusal to invalidate the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2003 on facial gr ounds was perplexing in light of the courts decision in stenberg id at 1650 justice ginsburg noted in materially identical circumstances we held that statute lacking health exception was unconstitutional on its face id finally justice ginsburg contended that the courts decision cannot be understood as anything more than an effort to chip away at right declared again and again by the courtand with increasing comprehension of its centrality to womens lives id at 1653 citing the language used by the court including the phrase abortion doctor to describe obstetriciangynecologists and surgeons who perform abortions justice ginsbur g maintained that the courts hostility to the right roe and casey secured is not

governmental actions at the national state and local levels to limit their effect the 110th congress continued to be forum for proposed legislation and constitutional amendments aimed at limiting or prohibiting the practice of abortion this section examines the history of the federal legislative response to the abortion issue in the decade prior to the decision in roe 10 pieces of legislation relating to abortion were introduced in either the house or the senate since 1973 more than 1000 separate legislative proposals have been introduced the wide disparity in these statistics illustrates the impetus that the courts 1973 decisions gave to congressional action by far most of these proposals have sought to restrict the availability of abortions few measures have been introduced to better secure the right to terminate pregnancy the freedom of choice act foca for example was introduced and debated in both the 102 nd and 103rd congresses but was never enacted foca attempts to codify roe legislatively and was reintroduced in the 110th congress the freedom of access to clinic entrances act of 1994 pl 103259 18 usc 248 made it federal crime to use force or the threat of force to intimidate abortion clinic workers or women seeking abortions proponents of more restrictive abortion legislation have employed variety of legislative initiatives to achieve this end with varying degrees of success initially legislators focused their efforts on the passage of constitutional amendment which would overrule the supreme courts decision in roe this course however proved to be

measures reported out of committee inte rest in the constitutional approach peaked in the 94th congress when nearly 80 amendments were introduced by the 98th congress the number had significantly

as an alternative to constitutional amendment to prohibit or limit the practice of abortion opponents of abortion have introduced variety of bills designed to accomplish the same objective without resorting to the complex proc ess of amending the constitution authority for such action is said to emanate from section 5 of the fourteenth amendment which empowers the congress to enforce the due process and equal protection guarantees of the amendment by appropriate legislation one such bill s 158 introduced during the 97th congress would have declared as congressional finding of fact that human life begins at conception and would it was contended by its sponsors allow states to enact laws protecting human life including fetuses hearings on the bill were marked by controversy over the constitutionality of the declaration that human life begins at conception which contradicted the supreme courts specific holding in roe and over the withdrawal of lower federal court jurisdiction over suits challenging state laws enacted pursuant to federal legislation modified version of s 158 was approved in subcommittee but that bill s 1741 had further action in the 97 th congress

unsuccessful attempts to prohibit abortion outright opponents of abortion sought to ban the use of federal monies to pay for the performance of abortions they focused their efforts primarily on the medicaid program since the vast majority of federally funded abortions were reimbursed under medicaid the medicaid program was established in 1965 to f und medical care for indigent persons through federalstate costsharing arrangement however abortions were not initially covered under the program during the nixon administration the partment of health education and welfare hew decided to

act of 1973 pl 93189 was the first such enactment the greatest focus has been on restricting medicaid abortions under the annual appropriations for the department of health education and welfare hew now the department of health and human services the first of series of restrictions popularly referred to as the hyde amendments was attached to the fy1977 departments of labor nd health education and welfare appropriation act pl 94439 as originally offered by representative hyde the proposal would have prohibited the funding of all abortions compromise amendment offered by representative conte was eventually agreed to providing that none of the funds contained in this act shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term in subsequent years hyde amendments were sometimes reworded to include exceptions for rape and incest or longlasting physical health damage to the mother however from the 97 th congress until recently the language has been identical to the original enactment allowing only an exception to preserve the life of the mother in 1993 during the first year of the clinton administration coverage under the hyde amendment was expanded to again include cases of rape and incest efforts to restore the original language providing for only the life of the woman exception failed in the 104 th congress the hyde amendment process has not been limited to the laborhhs appropriation beginning with pl 95457 the department of defense appropriation acts have contained hydetype abortion limitations this recurring prohibition was eventually codified and made permanent by pl 98525 the department of fense authorization act of 1984 beginning with pl 9693 the district of columb ia dc appropriations acts have contained restrictive abortion provisions in recent years there have been efforts to expand the prohibitions to district funds as well as the federal funds appropriated the passage of pl 100462 the fy1989 dc appropriations act marked the first successful attempt to extend abortion restrictions to the use of district funds in 1993 and 1994 lawmakers approved prohibition that applied only to federal monies the 104 th congress approved ban on all government funding of abortion federal and dc except in cases of rape incest or danger to womans life this ban has continued in recent appropriations measures for the district in 1983 the hyde amendment process was extended to the department of the treasury and postal service appropriations act prohibiting the use of federal employee health benefits to pay for abortions except when the life of the woman was in danger prior to this it had been reported that in 1980 for instance federal government health insurance plans paid an estimated 9 million for abortions both therapeutic and nontherapeutic the following year the office of personnel management opm attempted through administrative action to eliminate nonlife saving abortion coverage this action was challenged by federal employee unions and the us district court held that opm acted outside the scope of its authority and that absent specific congressional statutory directive there was basis for opms decision american federation of government employees v aflcio 525 fsupp 250 1981 it was this background that led to the 1983 congressional action to include the prohibition on coverage for abortion in federal
