whether the senators approve or disapprove of the nomination as matter of recent policy the committee does not wait indefinitely for the return of positive blue slips in practice committee action on

the committee members present vote to report favorably without recommendation or unfavorably the nomination moves to the senate floor if majority votes either to table the nomination or in the negative on the other motions then the nomination remains in committee once the nomination is reported out of committee the senate may consider and vote on it if the senate votes on the nominati on it
