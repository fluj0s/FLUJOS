the investigation summary the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 led many to inquire whether there had been failure by united states intelligence agencies to collect all available information about the plots that led to the attacks to analyze it properly and disseminate it in time to protect the am erican public congressional intelligence committees responded by launching an unpreceden ted joint inquiry to investigate the intelligence communitys record in regard to the 911 attacks and make recommendations for further legislativ action the joint inquiry began its investigation in february 2002 and held public hearings in september and october findings conclusions and recommendati ons were made public in december 2002 release of the final report is anticipated in 2003 in public hearings the joint inquirys sta ff director traced salient aspects of the inquirys work and emphasized that wh ereas the intelligence community provided ample warning of an impending attack in mid2001 against the us by the islamic terrorist group headed by osama bin laden the community did not learn in advance the plans for the aircra ft hijackings that occurred on september 11 the joint inquiry focused on several underlying problems for number of constitutional statutory and organization reasons information collected by intelligence agencies has historically not been routinely used for law enforcement purposes similarly information collected in preparation for trials has not been routinely forwarded to intelligence agencies in an era in which terrorists work abroad to launch attacks in the us some have argued that the walls between intelligence and law enforcement have complicated the ability of any agency to put together complete picture of evolving pl ots explaining the complexity of this situation was major contribution of th inquiry although the issue of breaching these walls remains complicated and controversial in addition the inquiry examined the role of the fbi there were criticisms of the bureaus ability to process and store information provide communications links between field offices and h eadquarters process applica tions for surveillance and coordinate with intelligence agencies more fundamentally the intelligence committees examined priorities that prio r to september 11 2001 did not emphasize counterterrorism to the extent that has s ubsequently been considered necessary the intelligence authorization act fo r fy2003 pl 107306 establishes an independent commission to assess the role of agencies throughout the government with regard to the 911 attacks this independent commission to be headed by former new jersey governor thomas h kean will build upon the investigatory record of the joint inquiry but might reach further to assess

an investigation of the perfo rmance of relevant agencies would be necessary following in part the precedent of the congressional investigation of the japanese attack on pearl harbor in 19413 the administration indicated some concern at the time that wideranging investigation could make heavy demands on senior policymakers at time of crisis similar arguments had been made during world war ii and the major congressional inqui ry of pearl harbor did not begin until after hostilities ended in 1945 nevertheless public an xieties about possible intelligence failure led to the conclusion that an official investigation was needed the house voted to establish an inde pendent commission to investigate the attacks during consideration of the fy2002 intelligence authorization bill hr 2883 but the provision was dropped by the conference committee because some members preferred that congress conduct its own investigation with mandate focused primarily on the role of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in february 2002 the two intelligence committees initiated joint inquiry with staff separate from that of the existing intelligence committees difficulties over staff assignments

within the ctc to monitor osama bin laden had been created in 1996 ms hill traced the response of agencies to the series of terrorist attacks including the one on the new york world trade center in

costly ms hill surveyed the response of governme nt agencies to terrorist attacks prior to 2001 and noted that they represented threat much diffe rent from those that existed during the cold war by th mid1990s however national intelligence estimate called atte ntion to new breed of terrori sts who had state sponsor was loosely organized had an islamic ag enda and penchant for violence8 by1996 attention had focused on osama bin laden and qaeda operating out of afghanistan ms hill discussed the increasing focus of intelligence and law enforcement agencies on terrorism and the augmentation and creation of special units to track them cooperative efforts with foreign governments to suppress terrorist groups and to arrest individuals involved in terrorism the development of new legal strategies and the expansion of the fbi presence overseas ms hill noted that intelligence agencies issued growing warnings of attacks in the spring and summer of 2001 although sh acknowledged that it was the general view of intelligence officials that an attack was more likely to occur overseas she cited briefing prepared for senior government officials in early july 2001 based on review of

not comprehensive effort to educate the american public as ms hill indicated in lengthy statement on september 24 the inquiry devoted extensive attention to an elect ronic communication sent in july 2001 from the fbi field office in phoenix ariz ona calling for further investigation of individuals with possible ties to foreign terrorist organizations who were attending flight colleges and universities in the us the communication often referred to as the phoenix memorandum was forwarde d to fbi headquart ers but did not receive sustained attention there nor we re its recommendations acted upon prior to september 11 the episode re flected number of administr ative legal and policy barriers that taken together ms hill argued may have prevented the fbi from perceiving pattern of planning for terro rist attack using commercial aircraft she concluded the fbi handling of the phoenix ec is symptomatic of focus on short term operational priorities often at the expense of longterm strategic analysis10 the inquiry also addressed the question of three of the hijackers who had come to the attention of the intelligence comm unity prior to september 11 2001 except for two who had received speeding tickets none of the hijackers had come to the attention of law enforcement agencies khalid almihdhar and nawaf alhazmi hijackers of flight 77 which crashed into the pentagon were identified in early 2000 as having attended meeting in malaysia with known qaeda operative as the staff director stated on ptember 20 the joint inquiry staff concluded that the names of these individuals should have been included in watchlists maintained by the state department the immigration and naturalization service and the customs service that might have led to their being denied entry into the us11 in subsequent testimony the dci concurred in this judgme nt and indicated that the reason for the failure was the absence of formal system in place for watchlisting suspected terrorists lack of form training and the heavy counterterrorist workload12 it was only in august 2001 that the cia reco mmended that four bin ladenrelated individuals including alm ihdhar and nawaf alhazmi be watchlisted and denied entry into the us although by this time bot h of the latter were already present in this country the failure by cia to provi earlier information on these men drew particular criticism from members some of whom questioned whether individual intelligence officials had been held accountable13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31650crs6 14the effects of the provisions of

stigate his notes and computer disks but authorization was not approved prior to september 11 there was according to ms hill excessive cau tion along with misunderstandings of the requirements of the relevant statutes and lengthy debates over the advisability of criminal search warrant vs search under the provisions of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa14 at one point the fbi d intended to deport moussaoui to france in order that french officials could search his belongings and forward the results back to the us moving to more general concerns ms hill described number of basic limitations to the us response to the rise of qaeda first was the unsolved problem of sanctuary th us had little capability to oppose or even to closely monitor the network of training cam ps and headquarters in afghanistan15 some diplomatic pressure was brought to bear on the then government of afghanistan and president clinton ordered missile strikes on presumed qaeda site in august 1998

the qaeda cell leader in nairobi nearly year prior to the 1998 embassy bombings almost all of the results of this effort were never shared with the terrorism analy tical community due to concerns

their most potent weapon in that effort an alert and committed american public17 she stated that while senior intelligence and law enforcement officials were well aware of the threat from qaeda there had been little effort to mobilize public opinion she added that neither the clinton nor the bush administration before septembe r 11 brought home to the american public the extent of danger they faced from terrorist attacks secondly the staff director expressed specific concerns bout the performance of the fbi she concluded that the bureau remained focused on individual prosecutions and did not systematically and thoroughly make the changes necessary to fight terrorism in the united states the bureau she argued had very few officials assigned to counter terrorism especially outside the new york field office and give the effort relatively low priority fundamental problem ms hill argue d was an inability to systematically collect information on terrorist plots against targets in the us the fbi was not able to gather intellig ence from disparate cases nationwide to produce an overall assessment of qaedas presence in the united states the fbis decentralized structure cont ributed to the bureaus inability to correlate the knowledge its components possessed in addition the fbis case based approach led the terrorist threat to be viewed through narrow lens18 according to ms hills statement the fbi did not concentrate on radical activity in the us she stated that former national security adviser berger had testified that the fbi assured him that there was little radical activity in the united states and that this activity was fully covered there was she added particular disinclination to target suspects residing outside the us who could of course subsequently enter the country she concluded the fbi s limited attention to the danger at home reflects huge gap in the us government s counterterrorism st ructure lack of focus on how an international terrorist gr oup might target the united states itself agency appears to have been responsible for regularly assessing the threat to the homeland19 the joint inquiry staff concluded that the fbi has been structured to concentrate on gathering evidence on crimes to an extent that strategic analysis of threats to the homeland did not receive adequate attention20 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31650crs8 20continued also noted that the arrest of one individual in 1990 suspected of terrorist ties produced forty seven boxes of notes and paramilitary manuals but it would be at least two years before much of the

the fb i didnt provide some of this information regarding terrorist plots in fairness to the fbi it ought to be pointed out that for very good substantial reasons they are not supposed to report information on americans to intelligence agencies this is an issue wev go to confront now but they werentits not that they were stupid theyre there under diffe rent set of rules rules that require

22see elizabeth b bazan the foreign intelligence surveillance act an overview of the statutory framework crs report rl40465 updated april 29 2002 the national security act of 1947 specifically provided that the cia would have domestic law enforcement powers or internal security func tions 50 usc 4033d1 in order to avoid creating the sort of intelligence organizations that existed in european dictatorships during the cold war it was relatively simple to disc riminate between foreign and domestic threats but even during that time procedures that ve complicated intelligence collection against terrorist groups were established as result of criticisms of expansive intelligence collection efforts against domestic opponents of the vietnam war who were alleged in large measure incorrectly to have been working on behalf of foreign communist elements 23the foreign intelligence surveillance court of review made public its decision in case dealing with processes for obtaining fisa c ourt orders on november 18 2002 that reflected continuedms hill addressed the question of the extent to which law enforcement approach to terrorist attack s was appropriate us government officials apparently never intended to rely exclusively on law enforcement to fight terrorism by default however law enforcement tools became the primary instrument of american counterterrorism strategy21 number of individuals with terrorist connections were prosecuted for immigration law violations such efforts complicated the efforts of terrorists but they concentrated on underlin gs rather than the masterminds who were abroad and beyond the reach of us justice in addition the need to prepare for trials led to disinclination by the fbi to c ooperate with intellig ence agencies out of concern that evidence might be tainted by link with intelligence agencies and not usable in court proceedings osama bin laden was himself indicted in june 1998 but that did not obstruct his activities the staff director drew attention to the institutional walls that had been erected to govern the use of information acquired by intelligence and law enforcement agencies many of the walls derived from the provisions of the foreign intelligence surveillance act which was enacted in 1978 in order to ensure that the fourth amendment protections against unreasonable searches were not undermined by employing electronic surveillance that had been authorized for foreign intelligencegathering purposes22 ms hill noted that many of the walls derived from guidance provided by the fisa cour t and that fisa procedures have been under judicial review23 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31650crs9 23continued in part the evidence presented to the joint inquiry 24prepared statement of

into an unworkable and counterproductive set of bureau cratic hurdles snowballe d was the term employed by an fbi official in the new york fiel d office who complained when information on khalid almihdhar and nawaf alhazmi was not made available to him out of concern that his role as criminal case investigator would be contaminated by intelligence materials he wrote on august 29 2001 whatever has happened to thissomeday someone will dieand wall or notthe public will not understand why we were not more effective and throwing every resource we had at certain problems24 ms hill noted that walls between law enforcement and intelligence also came into play in regard to efforts by the new york fbi office to use full criminal investigative resources against almihdha r after information was obt ained about tangential connection to the cole attack once it was determined in late august 2001 that khalid almihdhar was in the united states the search to determine his whereabouts was constrained by fbi policies and practices regarding the us of intelligence information in fbi criminal investigations this limited the resources that were made available for the fbi to conduct the search during time in which almihdhar and alhazmi were purchasing their september 11 tickets and traveling to their last rallying points25 major theme of the investigation has been inadequate communication between and among the various intelligence and law enforcement agencies ms hill noted that former fbi director freeh had maintained that the bureau had provided all available intelligence acquired by the bureau to the cia but this was an assertion that individuals at the working vel at the cia strongly contest26 she concluded the events of september 11 2001 have d to an almost universal acknowledgment in the united states government of the need for consolidating and streamlining collection analysis and dissemination of information concerning threats to the united states and its interests27 there was single point at which all the evidence relating to terrorist threats within the u s could be sifted and the various dots

criminal justice purposes and much wider dissemination of sensitive grand jury information to large number of intelligence agencies public testimony by witnesses the public hearings conducted by th two intelligence committees provided an opportunity to describe how intelligence nd law enforcement ag encies had reacted to the rise of radical islamic terrorism in the 1990s and the attacks on bin ladens organization by the clinton administrati on although covert operations were only briefly mentioned considerable attention was given to explaining why intelligence on the terrorist connections of two individua ls who turned out to be hijackers had not been passed on to the state department nd ins as soon as the information had been acquired in addition the hearings addre ssed the history of memorandum from the fbis phoenix office calling attention to th presence of flight school students with possible terrorist connections28 the committees also focused on unsuccessful efforts by the fbis minneapolis field office to seek legal approval to search moussaouis affects29 finally the hearings included di scussion of proposals to reorganize intelligence and law enforcement agenci to improve their counterterrorism capabilities in general the testimony suggested that government agencies were well aware of the hostile intentions of qaed and similar groups number of serious terrorist attacks were thwarted and thos who planned them were arrested and convicted efforts were made to enlist the assistance of foreign governments with mixed success the hearings provided desc riptions of complex procedural problems relating to the sharing of information from intelligence and law enforcement sources and suggestions were made that agencies need better guidance on dealing with these issues30 the hearings also reflected number of instances when information could have been shared in accordance with th enexisting procedures that might have provided clues to the unfolding september 11 plot the

he noted however that the fbi was not as focused on counterterrori sm as the cia the view we received from the bureau was that qaeda had limited capacity to operate in the us and any presence here was under surveillance33 berger urged the improvement of coordination and integration of intelligence strengthening the role of the dci over the entire intelligence effort while establishi ng separate position of director of the cia and greater emphasis on predictive intelligence which would provide tactical warning berger also emphasized the importance of human intelligence covert action capability and adding resources to the analytical effort berger indicated that by and large if there was flood of in telligence information from the cia there was hardly trickle from the fbi34 fbi

lawfully they simply relied upon everything from the vastness of the internet to the openness of our society to do what they wanted to do without detection35 mueller acknowledged we have heard and we acknowledge the valid criticisms many of which have been reiterated by this committee for example the phoenix memo should have been disseminated to all field offices nd to our sister agencies and the 26page request form minneapolis for fisa warrant should have been reviewed by attorneys handling the request36 testimony from mueller was s upplemented by his predecessor louis freeh who had left office in june 2001 on october 8 2002 freeh described the counterterrorist efforts of the bureau dur ing his tenure the number of fbi special agents assigned to counterterrorism more than doubled the stationing of some 44 legal attaches in us embassies thr oughout the world represented one step to improve the acquisition of information on terrorist activities the legal attaches have also been helpful in facilitating the extradition or transfer of suspected terrorists to the us or other countries in addition some 56 joint terrorism task forces jttfs have been established to integrate the investigative capabilities of the fbi with those of local law enforcemen t agencies the fbis counterterrorism center was established in 1996 to coordinate threat an alysis and counterterrorist operations in the us in lengthy stimony on october 8 freeh described his involvement in the investigation of the 1996 bombing of the khobar towers apartment complex in saudi arabia that resulted in the deaths of 19 american servicemen with 500 wounded the fbi received cooperation from the saudi government and acquired direct access to veral suspects who may have had iranian connections freeh acknowledged that khoba r represented national security threat far beyond the capability or authority of the fbi or department of justice to address neither the fbi director nor the attorney general could or shoul d decide americas response to such grave threat37 freeh acknowledged longstanding pr oblems in the fbis often criticized information technology it capabilities we didnt just wake up one

public meetings39 in may 2002 the justice department issued new guidelines to remove such restrictions40 admiral lowell jacoby the director of the defense intelligence agency dia expressed his concern about barrier s that prevent analysts from having access to all available information in one of the few presentations that directly addressed the analytical process he argued that there is need to create new paradigm wherein ownership of information bel onged with the analysts and not the collectors in my opinion one of the most prolonged and troubling trends in the intelligence community is the degree to which analys tswhile being expected to incorporate the full range of source information into their assessmentshave been systematically separated from the raw mate rial of their trade in fact while i acknowledge there are many pockets where groundbreaking innovative true all source analysis is occurring they are the exception not the rule41 testimony in public sessions suggested widespread support for breaking down barriers to freer exchange of information among law enforcement and intelligence agencies especially emphatic was mary jo white the former us attorney for the southern district of new york and lead figure in important terrorism investigations who stated the single most important recommendation i would make to the committees would be to address the full range of issues presented by the bifurcation of the intelligence and w enforcement communities and functions as they operate in international rrorism investigations including the permissible use of fisa and the disse mination and use of the product of fisa searches and surveillances42 her comments were echoed by th director of nsa general michael hayden who testified on october 17 that as

terrorism involvi ng weapons of mass destruction also testified that his panel continues to believe that improvements in intelligence and information sharing are central to the nations efforts to combat terrorism they are as we see it the most crucia l and fundamental requirement44 the director of central intelligence george j tenet testified in public hearing on october 17 in his prepared

of various fatwas against the us and hi s involvement in terrorist attacks on us forces45 tenet alluded to comprehensive operation plan prepared in 1999 to disrupt qaeda finances impede their activities and bring osama bin laden to justice the plan included not only heightened analytical efforts to track qaeda but also to act against the terrorist organi zation seeking candidates fluent in

preventing any terrorists attacks at the time of the millennium and other efforts taken in conjunction with several european governments to identify nd shatter terrorist groups operating against american and local interests in europe other ci initiatives were c onducted in the middle east and east asia tenet noted the upsurge in reports of potential terrorist activities in the spring and summer of 2001 as being the only occasions in this reporting where there was geographic context either explicit or implicit and it appeared to point abroad especially to the middle east47 in general tenet and other executive branch officials were well aware of the danger of an qaeda attack especia lly in midsummer 2001 but had the perception that nearterm attack was most likely to occur abroad most likely in the middle east there was also focus on longert erm threat of catastrophic attack within the us that would employ chemi cal biological or nuclear weapons48 while there had been instances in the past when airp lanes had been hijacked by terrorists and reports of plots to drive airplanes into buildings these reports appeared within vast flow of data and analysts saw reason to concentrate on them they also suggest that clues are far easier to perceive in hindsight rather than when they first come in mixed with many thousands of other bits of information that were irrelevant as was the case with other intelligence community leaders tenet noted the effect of budgetary reductions in the early 1990s he claimed that cia lost nearly one in four of its positions although he did not indicat whether these positions were tied to cold war missions that were longer relevant to the concerns of policymakers at the same time howev er tenet argued that funding for counterterrorism had increased cias funding level for counterterrorism just prior to september 11 was more than fifty pe rcent above the fy1997 level tenet argued that in the fall of 1998 he asked that intelligence funding for fys20002005 be increased by more than 2 billion annually and that similar reque sts were made for fys 20012005 and fys 20022007 only sma ll portions of these requests were approved he noted that supplemen tal appropriations beginning in fy1999 supported the counterterrorist mission but argued that supplemental appropriations could not be counted on to build multiyear programs49

extensive statement of his additional views these documents are available on the web site of the senate select committee on intelligence50 in large measure the findings conclu sions and recommendati ons are consistent with ms hills earlier public assessments the findings emphasize that agency had information on the time place or specific nature of the attacks they describe however specific information that was available to agencies and that appears relevant to the events of september 11 but was not fully exploited the findings further suggested systemic weaknesses of intelligence and law enforcement communities an absence of emphasis on the counterterrorist mission decline in funding limited use of information tec hnology poor intera gency coordination insufficient analytic focus and quality nd inadequate human intelligence above all there was lack of governmentwide strategy for acquiring and analyzing intelligence and for acting on it to eliminate or reduce terrorist threats on the basis of these findings the two intelligence committees made number of recommendations including the creation of cabinetlevel position of director of national intelligence separate from the position of director of the cia who would establish priorities for collection analysis and dissemination throughout the intelligence community and manage and oversee the execution of intelligence community budgets also included was recommendation calling for governmentwide strategy for combating terrorism prepared by the nsc with an intelligence component prepared by the director of national

intelligence provisions of the national security act of 1947 he expressed concern about the failure of the joint inquiry to identify any of the individuals whose decisions in his view left the country unprepared on ptember 11 2001 he identified several senior intelligence community leaders w hom he believes shoul d be faulted for inadequate efforts to overcome the institutional and cultural obstacles to inter agency cooperation and coordination that bedeviled counterterro rism efforts before the attacks54 senator shelby noted that the us intelligence community is hardwired to fight the cold war and must be more agile and responsive to vague shifting transnational threats nevertheless he does not argue that the intelligence communities should be hardwired to fight terrorists but rather we need an intelligence community agile enough to evo lve as threats evolve on continuing basis further we must not only learn th lessons of the past but learn how to keep learning lessons as we change and adapt in the future the intelligence community must he suggests develop ways to s warm personnel and resources from various portions of the community upon issues of particular importan

director in calling for informationholders to give analysts deeper and less conditional access to data than they have ever before enjoyed and he continued we must equip analysts with the tools needed to mine these datastreams for useful information56 he recalled that law enfo rcement agencies during the 1990s accumulated great deal of information about qaeda and other terrorist groups that remained locked away in law forcement evidence rooms unknown to and unstudied by counterterrori sm ct analysts within the intelligence community57 the fbi was particular target of the vice chairman the bureau has shown disturbing pattern of collapse and dysfunction in its counterintelligence and counterterrorism functions58 senator shelby suggested that some kind of radical reform of the fbi is in order indee d is long overdue although he did not specifically advocate new domestic intelligence collection agency59 senator shelby also addressed the role of human intelligence humint in counterterrorism although cia officials ve stated that they had operatives in afghanistan before september 11 careful observers should not confuse the periodic infiltration of operations for brief liaison meetings with friendly warlords for real humint or paramilitary presence60 shelby criticized the excessive dependence on traditional human agents based in em bassies whose primary function involves contact with the intelligence services of the host government there is he argues need for getting undercover agents out and at risk amongst the target population61 this he also suggests is an area in which the law enforcement agencies have valuable experience from which the cia could learn an independent commission possible issues with the passage of the intelligence authorization act for

expected to secure information from government ag encies by subpoena if necessary conduct hearings and submit findings conclusions and recommendations within 18 months an independent commission may make farreaching study of organizational arrangements for collecting analyzing and disseminating information about terrorist threats it might address the question of whether the dci should have additional authority to manage intelligence resources to focus on key priorities this proposal has been made number of times over the years and although the dcis authorities to establish priorities and oversee budget submissions ve been strengthened in recent years consensus has not yet emerge d that the dci should have direct control of the major intelligence agencies in the defense department another issue concerns the appropriate role of intelligence agencies in tracking terrorists who may conduct opera tions in the us this includes the role of long established walls that separate intelligence and law enforcement that have been partially dismantled by th usa patriot act and othe r legislation also some observers believe that an independent commission coul d usefully review the

between intelligence and law enforcement requires detached scrutiny frederick hitz former cia inspector general testified on october 3 that ther is need for congress to revisit the prohibition in the national security act of 1947 against cia involvement in domestic law enforcement activities since the public will insist that the various agencies cooperate in preven ting future terrorist attacks64

civil liberty and privacy concerns with the need to pr otect our nation this will not be easy65 the joint inquiry has sought to determine and describe the background to the attacks of september 11 2001 in describing procedures that may have affected the ability of governmental officials to gain advance notice of the terrorists plans the inquiry focused on testimony that suggested available information in the possession of some agencies was not fully shared with others in timely manner congress and the executive branch have acted in the usa patriot act in other legislation and in changed administrative procedures to address these issues some observers however have criticized these changes arguing that the roles of intelligence and law enforcement are inherently different and that mixing them can undermine the civil liberties of us persons some observers suggest that the independent commission receiving extended testimony from intelligen ce law enforcement and legal experts could play useful role in the achieve ment of public consensus on the proper balance between needs to protect the nati on against international terrorists and to protect civil liberties conclusion the final report of the two intelligence committees is expected to be submitted in 2003 after it has been declassified it will reflect the views of members which may not necessarily coincide w ith the conclusions of the joint inquiry staff it may include judgments on the performance of agen cies and their leaders it may propose changes in the responsibilities of agencies it will undoubtedly influence the oversight of the counterterrorist effort during the 108th congress the two committees have however already made pub lic considerable amount of evidence analysis and testimony that will support deeper understanding of the background to the september 11 attacks the empha sis appears to be focused on perceived need to bridge the walls between intelligence and law enforcement and to encourage the fbis current c oncentration on counterterrorism the investigations and the assessments of the tragic events of september 11 2001 have not yet been concluded thus far number of statutory
