the potential problems inherent in us overreliance on president gen pervez musharraf as an individual at the potential cost of more positive development of pakistans democratic institutions and civil

to be remnants of the islamic movement of uzbekistan led many observers to call the operation failure marked by poor intelligence and hasty planning123 during the course of the battle pakistani troops
