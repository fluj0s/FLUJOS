louisiana in the following three weeks it was discovered in eight additional southern states alabama arkansas florida georgia mississippi missouri south ca rolina and tennessee because asrs arrival in the united states came late in th crop year it is not thought to have had any measurable effect on 2004 soybean produc tion furthermore its detection has provided an early warning and has given the us soybean sector time to prepare strategies to guard against possibl asr damage to the 2005 soybean crop asr is harmful fungal disease that affects the growth of several commercial plants most notably soybeans the rust spores once windborne can spread rapidly and have been known to infect an entire re gion the same year the disease is first detected asr has reduced soybean yields by 10 to 80 in infected areas the diseases rapid transmission rate coupled with an abundance of host species suggests that eradication would be unlikely once the f ungus is established in the united states as result the most effective treatment is thought to be the development and use of resistant plant varieties however commercial us soybean cultivar is resistant to or tolerant of asr in the short term the only effective responses are costly fungicides and the use of earlymaturing soybean cultivars three chemicals are presently registered with the us environmental protection agency epa for treatment of rust on soybeans in addition epa has approved several temporary emergency exempti ons under section 18 of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act for additional fungicides estimates suggest that the us currently has fungicide capacity to treat up to 12 million acres during the past three years 20022004 u s soybean plantings have averaged 742 million acres thus available fungicide ppears sufficient to treat about 16 of average plantings shortage of fungicides could lead to constituent call for congressional action the us department of agriculture us da is coordinating plan to deal with asr that encompasses various usda agencies state landgrant universities and industry participants widespread asr in fection in the united states would likely have significant regional and

in the contin ental united states for the first time in an experimental field in louisiana2 in the following three weeks it was discovered in eight dditional southern states alabama arkansas florida georgia mississippi missouri south carolina and tennessee3 most experts expect the pathogen to spread into the more northerly us soybeangrowing areas of the corn belt during the 2005 growing season aprilnovember although there remains considerable uncer tainty about the likely timing location and degree of infestation and its economic impact experts suggest that asr spores were ca rried to the southeastern united states from south america on upper eleva tion winds during the 2004 hurricane season because asr arrived late in the crop year it is not thought to have had any measurable effect on 2004 us soybean production by november 9 2004 nearly 90 of the us soybean crop had already been harvested4 furthermore its detection has provided an early warning and has given the us soybean sector time to prepare strategies for establishing regional sentinel crops5 and distributing information on methods for field scouting detection and treatment to guard against possible asr damage to the 2005 soybean crophttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32225crs2 6 usda aphis ppq asr strategic plan nov 2004most experts anticipate the pathogens northward spread in 2005 into the corn belt states for three primary reasons first conditions eg mild temperatures and yearround presence of host species in the southern united states where the asr first appeared tend to favor pathogen survival during the winter months second spring planting occurs in the southeast and delta several weeks ahead of planting in the major soybean growing regions of the corn belt this would give the pathogen time to establish itself and be available for windborne transmission as the primary soybean plantings of the corn belt reach vege tative stage third rust spores are very light and move easily on winds sometimes traveling hundreds of miles in single day consolation to more northerly soybean producers is that because asr must have living host to survive the winter asr will only successfully overwinter in the most southerly extremes of the united states and must be reintroduced each successive year into more nor therly soybean production areas background on asr nature of the disease asian soybean rust asr is harmful disease caused by either of two fungal species phakopsora pachyrhizi and phakopsora meibomiae that affects the growth of several plant species of commercial importance most notably soybeans p pachyrhizi is much more virulent pathogen of soybeans than p meibomiae environmental factors are critical to the incidence and severity of asr long periods of leaf wetness are needed for spore germination as well as temperatures between 60o and 85o fahrenheit and high relative humidity of 7580 as result asr has been most destructive in the tropical and subtropical regions of asia africa australia and more recently south america asr is an obligate pathogen which means it needs living host cells to survive the pathogen can infect and reproduce on 90 known plant species 20 of which are found in the united states and are most co mmon in southern states including dry beans kidney beans peas leguminous forage crops such as trefoil and sweet clover and weeds such as kudzu6 the rust spores once windborne can be moved long distances reportedly up to 400 miles in sing day recent infestations in africa have been widespread in the same year that they were first detected in contrast in south america two to three years elapsed between detection and widespread onset historical expansion based on its recent history of geographic expansion asr was expected to enter the mainla nd united states sometime within the 2004 2007 period the virulent form of asr p pachyrhizi was first discovered in japan in 1902 the next reports were in 1934 from australia and india and again in 1940 in china the pathogen then showed up in africa in 1997 spores are believed to have crossed from asia to africa in wi nd currents of the upper atmosphere it was initially identified in uganda kenya nd rwanda in 1997 then in zimbabwe in 1998 zimbabwe suffered significant yield loss to the aggressive form of rust much of what is known today about the effects and control of this pathogen has been learned from scientists and farmers in zimbabwe the pathogen subsequently showed up in south africa in 2001 it is believed to have been spread throughout africa by prevailing winds httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32225crs3 7 the corn soybean digest vol 64 8 soybean rust marches north by greg lamp sept 1 2004 8 glen hartman usda ars plant patholog ist quoted in rob wynstra

made to fight soybean continuedthe rust surfaced in argentina in 2000 then year later in paraguay along the border of southern brazil although major outbreak did not occur in either argentina or paraguay by 2002 the pathogen is believe d to have moved approximately 1000 miles from th southern tip of brazil to the heartland of soybean production in central brazil causing signifi cant yield losses one of the reasons the pathogen could have proliferated and spread so quickly in central brazil is because the region experiences very humid conditions ideal for the proliferation of the disease another potential factor is th discovery of rust reproduction on volunteer soybeans unlike in the us corn belt where harsh winter conditions preclude volunteer germination for several months in brazils tropical climate fallen soybeans can germinate and grow into the vegetative stage shortly after harvest this extends the window of spore production and enables th pathogen to move more quickly via prevalent winds by september 2004 asr spores had continued their northward travel appearing near cali columbia about 5 degrees north of the equator7 yield loss once soybean plant is infected rust lesions tend to cover most of the leaf stem and pods the lesi ons cause premature defoliation thereby reducing photosynthesis and the number of days to maturity heavily infected plants have fewer pods and lighter seeds market able yields are further reduced by the resulting poor seed quality8 the pathogen has been shown to reduce soybean yield as much as 80 when left untreated yi eld losses of 10 to 50 are quite common during the 200203 crop year soybean producer s in mato grosso and other brazilian states were caught unaware by asr in most cases fungicides either were not available or were applie d too late brazils soybean crop losses in 200203 were estimated at 34 million metric tons mmt out of total crop of 526 mmt loss of value of about 13 billion9 the brazilian government subsequently took measures to alleviate the asr problem brazils agricultural research network was mobilized and effective fungicides were identified and made available on the marketplace the following year soybean yield damage in 200304 in brazil due to asr was difficult to assess due to the s imultaneous occurrence of drought and flood across major soybeangrowing areas however some analysts suggest that soybean rust damage had grown to nearly 5 million metric tons10 treatment and control according to an expert at usdas agricultural research service ars th diseases rapid transmi

strategy for minimizing the effects of asr is the development of resistant varieties however current commercial us soybean cultivars are not resistant to or tolerant of asr in the short run industry participants nd the scientific community suggest that access to registered fungicides and the pl anting of earlymaturing soybean cultivars are the primary means of mitigating producti on losses due to asr fungicides have been used effectively in other countri to mitigate the impacts of asr on soybean production in addition the planting of earlymaturing soybean cultivars has been found to reduce asrs harmful effects by minimizing the extent of growing time under warmhumid conditions when the disease proliferates responding to asrs arrival what is being done to prepare usda has taken the lead in coordinating activities to prepare for the introduction of asr into the united states since may 2002 an ad hoc working group composed of usda agencies aphis ars and the cooperative state research extensi on and education service csrees and the national plant board as well as several major landgrant universities and industry participants has been working to develop and implement fourpronged approach to asr that includes protec tion detection respons and recovery12 protection initially this com ponent involved identif ying and protecting possible pathogen entryways into the united states to slow or prevent the arrival of asr in particular aphis sought to us its legislative authority under the plant protection act title iv of pl 106224 to control th importation of commodities that may serve as pathways for the introduc tion of foreign plant and animal pests and diseases during the 108th congress legislation was proposed hr 3775 with the support of both the american farm bur eau federation and the american soybean association to ban soybean imports from countries known to harbor the pathogen however action was taken as the confirmed arrival of asr into the united states has refocused work to the remain ing three components of the plan detection the detection plan is designed to ensure the early detection and rapid identification of asr once it reaches the united states specifics include the distribution of information c oncerning field characteristic s about the disease details on collection and submission of specimens as well as diagnostics and confirmation procedures according to usda accurate and timely identification is the key to determining whether response will be attempted nd if so the extent direction and magnitude of that response sentinel soybean plantings made bout three weeks prior to commercial plantings throughout major soybean growing areas will be used to provide early detection thereby allowing time to control the pat hogen in

into the united states s r i s potentially devastating to temperate soybean producers because it easily adapts to diverse environments it is prolific under the right envi ronmental conditions and it is very mobile in april 2004 usda s economic research service ers completed simulation modeling exercise to project the potential economic losses associated with various degrees of asr infestation in the united states31 according to ers the extent of economic impact s will depend on the timing location spread and severity of rust establishment nd outbreaks and on how soybean and crop producers livestock producers and consumers of agricultural commodities respond32 early asr detection combined with widespread fungicide availability can greatly reduce yield losses and economic damage however the added cost of fungicide application would lower soybean returns relative to other field crops such as corn that are unaffected by the pathogen as result it is likely that the presence of asr would lead to some acreage shifting away from soybeans and toward other crops these effects would vary regiona lly and would depend on relative expected returns of different crops and alternate landuse activities corn would likely be the primary beneficiary of displaced soybean acres especially in the corn belt in the plains states wheat other small grains and possibly pastureland could gain some area in the delta and southeast cotton probably would be the primary beneficiary of soybean acreage shifts ers mediumterm results which assume that asr is already established and endemic to the united states suggest that annual ec onomic losses could range between 240 million and 2 billion depending on the severity and extent of subsequent outbreaks the large range of damage estimates reflects the uncertainty associated with the eventual effects of soybean rust in the united states under highinfestation scenario ers assumes na tional average yield losses of 95 in contrast under lowinfestation scenario ers actually assumes some yield gains due to shifting of soybean area out of loweryielding regions such as the southeast and delta states the ers simulation mode l suggests that soybean producers would bear most 60 to 70 of the costs of adjusting to soybean rust while consumers and livestock producers assume the remai nder of the economic cost although not specifically included in

soybean net returns decline livestock producers in all regions suffer economic losses due to higher feed costs usdas research suggests that because of the potential severity of the disease and fungicide costs needed to control field infections significant share of soybean production in the southernmost states c ould become unprofitable during the 1996 to 2002 period soybean yields in appalachia ap the delta dl and the southeast averaged about 26 be low the national average see table 1 yet soybean production has been valuable agricultura l activity for both regions during that same

aphis to mitigate the adverse effects of asrs rrival in the united states is well underway until asr resistant soybean varieties are developed soybean producers will have to rely on fungicides and
