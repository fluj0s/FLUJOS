the former soviet union administration proposals for fy2000 amy f woolf and curt tarnoff foreign affairs defense and trade division summary responding to the impact of russias financial crisis president clintons budget requests 1 billion for fy2000 and 45 billion over five years for nuclear biological and chemical weapons threat reduction programs in the former soviet union the added funds in this expanded threat reduction initiative etr 35 over fy1999 levels will augment many ongoing programs funded under department of defense energy and water and foreign operations appropriations and significantly expand efforts in science and technology nonproliferation some members of congress may question the initiatives new priorities and some may question whether it serves us national security and nonproliferation objectives this report will not be updated for updated tracking of etr authorizations and appropriations and further discussion of threat reduction and other nis aid programs see crs issue brief 98038 nuclear weapons in russia and crs issue brief 95077 the former soviet union and us foreign assistance and crs report 971027 nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction programs issues for congress background when the soviet union collapsed in late 1991 congress responded to concerns about the safety and security of soviet nuclear chemical and other weapons by establishing the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction ctr program it has allocated total of 27 billion to this effort since 1992 projects funded by the ctr program assist the new independent states nis of the former soviet union with the safe and secure transportation storage and dismantling of nuclear chemical and other weapons of mass destruction wmd and related materials the united states expects to help russia and other nis reduce the threat these weapons and materials might pose to the united states for several years congress authorized and appropriated almost all ctrrelated funds through the department of defense dod budget even though interagency teams which congressional research service the library of congress crs2 often included experts from the state department and department of energy doe would negotiate and implement specific projects although dod served as the executive agent for the funding of threat reduction programs responsibility for coordination has rested with the coordinator of us assistance to the nis in the department of state in fy1996 the clinton administration began to request funding for several threat reduction programs in the budgets of the agencies that managed and implemented them by fy1999 total funding for the range of threat reduction programs in dod state and doe had nearly doubled from the 1992 level of 400 million the expanded threat reduction initiative in the wake of the financial crisis that began in russia in august 1998 many analysts began to believe that economic pressures could undermine russias interests and efforts in safeguarding weapons and materials as evidence of this they cited reports that some scientific and research facilities that house nuclear materials have disconnected their security and monitoring systems to save money on electric bills and that they have been unable to pay the guards and officers charged with maintaining security in addition many scientists and engineers who worked in soviet nuclear chemical and biological programs have not been paid for months at time some analysts fear that these scientists might be tempted to accept work from other nations seeking weapons of mass destruction threat reduction funding in millions agency fy9299 app fy99 app fy00 req fy0004 req dod 27010 4504 4855 24639 energy 9500 2389 2647 13237 state 800 531 2505 7385 total 37310 7424 10007 45261 source department of state the clinton administration has responded by proposing the expanded threat reduction etr initiative according to the presidents budget for fy2000 funding for threat reduction programs would increase from 742 million in fy1999 to 1 billion in fy2000 over the next five years planned spending would increase from 27 billion to 45 billion the added funds would not only augment ongoing programs to secure nuclear chemical and biological weapons and materials it would also expand programs that focus on keeping scientists and engineers away from rogue nations specifically in fy2000 funding for dod programs and doe programs both authorized in the dod authorization and appropriated in the dod and energy and water appropriations bills respectively would increase small amount over fy1999 levels 35 million and 28 million respectively while state department programs funded in the foreign operations appropriations bill would increase by nearly 200 million from fy1999 to fy2000 in the long term 11 billion of the 18 billion that the initiative adds to planned threat reduction programs between fy2000 and fy2004 would go to dods ctr program another 500 million of the proposed addition would go to doe programs and the state department would receive the remaining 200 million in added funds crs3 the next section of this report provides details on the administrations expanded threat reduction initiative the report concludes with discussion of issues that congress might consider when it reviews the funding requests for these programs department of defense programs to date dods ctr projects fy2000 request 476 million have helped russia to transport nuclear warheads from locations in other nis states to storage areas inside russia and to improve security and weapons accounting at these storage areas ctr projects have also funded the elimination of strategic nuclear weapon delivery systems and facilities in russia belarus ukraine and kazakhstan the united states is also helping russia construct facility to store plutonium removed from russias nuclear weapons and facility that will house and destroy russias chemical weapons stockpile the etr initiative will add 11 billion to the dod budget from fy2000fy2004 dod plans to use much of this added funding to accelerate the elimination of strategic offensive arms in russia if and when the russian parliament approves ratification of start ii and to construct an additional wing for the storage of plutonium removed from nuclear weapons at the mayak facility in russia the most significant increase however in the ctr budget proposed for fy2000 is in the area of chemical weapons destruction in fy1999 this activity received 88 million the president has requested 130 million for fy2000 some members of the house have criticized this project in the past arguing that it does little to reduce the threat to the united states state department programs three fourths of the higher funding level requested in the first year of the etr would be in state department programs these would increase from 531 million in fy1999 to 2505 million in fy2000 before dropping to 120 million in each of the four remaining years of the initiative state programs would expand in three areas nonproliferation of weapons expertise export controls and forces reallocation science and technology nonproliferation fy2000 request 1465 million the state department manages several programs that offer nis scientists employment and research opportunities so that they will be less likely to sell their knowledge to rogue nations the international science and technology center istc in moscow and the science and technology center in ukraine stcu multilateral programs supported by the eu japan and others fund research in such areas as nuclear reactor safety medicine civil aviation and energy production partners program links nis scientists with contributing us private sector companies such as general electric and lockheed martin and academic institutes to assist their own rd efforts the civilian research and development foundation crdf is private nonprofit foundation originally funded by matching grants from dod and george soros it supports us collaboration and exchanges with former nis defense scientists on civilian basic and applied research and supports projects with commercial applications the state department also implements pilot project for biological weapons scientists to redirect their expertise toward commercial endeavors among other activities it has established collaborative program between the department of agricultures agricultural research crs4 service and russian scientists on agriculture research and between the department of health and human services centers for disease control national institutes of health and food and drug administration and russian biomedical scientists to conduct research on infectious diseases export control and border security program fy2000 request 665 million to prevent the transfer of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems the state department coordinates the activities of number of us agencies including the fbi and the us customs service these agencies provide training technical expertise and equipment including large xray trucks to strengthen georgian and central asian border security and to improve russia and ukraine export controls forces relocation and ammo disposal fy2000 request 43 million under the etr the administration is proposing that the united states lead an international effort to assist with the removal of russian forces and equipment from bases outside russias borders in particular there is concern that ammo and equipment in georgia and moldova are vulnerable to theft while russia needs help constructing housing for retired officers to meet its armed forces downsizing goals congress has prohibited such assistance since fy1996 and etr funds have been requested for this purpose instead the administration is hoping that germany or other countries will step into the breach department of energy programs materials protection control and accounting fy2000 request 145 million the department of energys materials protection control and accounting mpca program focuses on improving security and accounting at the civilian institutes that house russias nuclear materials to date the mpca program has provided assistance at 53 facilities in the former soviet union including the installation of improved security systems that use modern technology and the development of material control and accounting systems the program has also provided security training for russian nuclear specialists although doe originally expected to phase out mpca after 2001 the etr initiative adds approximately 500 million to mpca funding to maintain its current level of effort through that period according to rose gottemoeller the director of does office of nonproliferation and national security in addition to improving security at existing facilities some mpca funds may be used to help russia consolidate its nuclear materials at smaller number of facilities initiatives for proliferation prevention fy2000 request 30 million the department of energys initiatives for proliferation prevention ipp program which began in 1994 matches us government funds with us corporate funds in projects with nonmilitary applications as with the state departmentfunded programs it is designed to provide employment for nis nuclear chemical and biological weapons scientists and engineers so that they will not seek employment in other nations doe describes the program as one focused on the elite of the nis scientific establishment and geared towards projects with high science and technology content through fy1998 the ipp program had obligated 115 million to 435 projects involving more than 4400 scientists throughout the former soviet republics crs5 in fy1999 doe requested 15 million noting that it had sufficient unexpended funds from previous years to continue ongoing projects congress however provided 20 million for fy1999 this program has however attracted more scrutiny this year in february 1999 the general accounting office gao issued report that criticized ipp implementation it noted among other things that majority of the funds allocated to ipp had been spent at us nuclear weapons labs and not sent to nis institutions in its version of the fy2000 defense authorization bill s 1059 the senate armed services committee introduced number of restrictions including provision mandating that greater proportion of the funds go to russian scientists nuclear cities initiative fy2000 request 30 million in august 1998 vice president gore and thenrussian prime minister kiriyenko signed an agreement establishing the nuclear cities initiative nci this program is designed to establish commercial enterprises and create new jobs in russias closed nuclear cities to help ease unemployment and displacement as russia downsizes and restructures its nuclear weapons complex and to prevent nuclear science proliferation in contrast with ipp the this program is designed to create range of jobs not just those that are technologybased and to employ all types of workers not just the elite scientists from the nuclear weapons complex fy2000 funds would be used to initiate projects in 3 of the 10 closed nuclear cities doe expects the funding to increase under etr in future years as it expands the program to other cities in russias nuclear weapons complex issues for congress project priorities in the expanded threat reduction initiative most members of congress have supported projects funded by dods ctr programs and does mpca programs when they address the security and elimination of weapons and materials that can pose direct threat to us national security however members have been less supportive of projects that appear to stray from this core objective some therefore may question expanded funding of individual projects supported by the etr initiative for example much of the fy2000 increase in ctr funding is allocated to the construction of chemical weapons destruction facility in the past the house national securityarmed services committee has reduced funding for this project in part because it has viewed russias chemical weapons as more of threat to the russian environment than threat to us security further some may not perceive export of scientific know how in the form of personnel as posing the same level of threat as the sale of actual weapons system hardware especially as indications that russian scientists are currently helping us adversaries are hard to verify and some may not be convinced that offering alternative employment will be sufficient preventative measure for weapons scientists however administration officials point out that there is strong evidence that there is an active market for such expertise and strong anecdotal evidence as well that were it not for us and multilateral preventative programs key weapons experts would have accepted other options that could have resulted in serious weapons proliferation does us assistance subsidize russian weapons programs several members of congress have noted that russia continues to modernize its strategic offensive nuclear weapons and some have questioned whether the united states might be subsidizing this modernization with threat reduction assistance few argue that russia is actually diverting us funds most assistance is provided inkind by us contractors but some note that russia does not have to spend its own funds to dismantle its older weapons because crs6 us funds achieve that objective so it can afford to continue with its modernization programs the clinton administration argues that ongoing modernization programs particularly production of the new ss27 icbm are consistent with russias arms control obligations and are proceeding at such slow pace that it would be difficult to argue that us aid had enriched the programs furthermore officials argue that an absence of us assistance probably would not stop russias modernization programs instead russia would continue to build new weapons to meet its security needs and would simply cease to implement safety security and destruction programs for its existing weapons the gao raised the issue of possible subsidy or diversion with regard to weapons scientists in its february 1999 report the report noted that the program had successfully employed weapons scientists in rd projects but it stated that some of these scientists might still be working in russias wmd programs the gao also questioned whether the program was contributing to broader us nonproliferation objectives because none of the projects was yet commercial success the administration argues that any scientist who stays in russia is one less hired by rogue states or terrorists while the etr program does not support any researchers or institutes that continue to work on illegitimate or illegal activities including biological and chemical weapons it will fund continuing work in nuclear weapons facilities as long as the work focuses on safeguarding and eliminating old rather than producing new weapons budget concerns the fy2000 request would increase state department etr programs funded by the foreign operations appropriations bill and falling under the larger 150 international affairs account by 371 to 2505 million under the current congressional budget resolution however overall foreign affairs spending may shrink significantly instead of expanding as the presidents budget assumes as result etr programs could compete with many other foreign policy and assistance priorities further 241 million of the foreign operations etr request is in the nis account which traditionally supports the economic free market and political democratization objectives of the freedom support act and has only been used to very limited extent in the past in support of its nonproliferation goals roughly 5 each year versus 23 in the request within that account etr programs may also be competing with other program priorities potential restrictions on assistance one perennial legislative restriction would severely affect etr programs if approved every year since fy1996 congress has enacted legislation that threatens to cut foreign operations nis account assistance to the government of russia if it continues to transfer nuclear reactor technology to iran in fy1998 half the aid allocated to the government was cut the same result is likely for fy1999 if state etr programs are funded under the nis account as proposed similar legislative language for fy2000 would cut the aid to russian scientists because they are employed by governmentrun institutes furthermore in response to reports that chinese spies obtained nuclear secrets from doe labs members of congress have introduced legislation that would greatly restrict entry of certain country nationals to doe nuclear weapons laboratories s 887 shelby and hr 1348 ryun referring to etrtype programs president clinton has said that the measure would halt valuable scientific exchange programs with russian scientists washington post april 28 1999 rose gottemoeller stated that this legislation could shut down
