science and industry division january 3 2007 abstract climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions were issues in the 109th congress as they had been in past congresses bills directly addressing climate change issues ranged from those focused primarily on climate change research to comprehensive emissions capandtrade programs for the six greenhouse gases covered under the united nations framework convention on climate change additional bills focused on ghg reporting and registries or on power plant emissions of carbon dioxide as part of wider controls on pollutant emissions within several broad categories the bills varied in their approaches to climate change issues for example some bills covering research issues focused solely on modeling the eﬀects of future climate change whereas others addressed the development of monitoring technologies bills focusing on technology deployment did so through tax incentives and creditbased programs within the united states or by promoting deployment in developing countries bills with greenhouse gas registries were either voluntary or mandatory and varied in the entities covered and the gases registered bills with emission reduction requirements also varied in the entities covered the gases limited and the target emissions levels most notably on august 8 2005 president bush signed the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958

carbon dioxide co2 the most ubiquitous and primary greenhouse gas methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o hydrofluorocarbons hfcs perfluorocarbons pfcs and sulfur hexafluorane sf6 some other greenhouse gases are controlled under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer 2 greenhouse gas intensity is measure of the amount of carbon dioxide or equivalent emitted per unit of gross domestic productclimate change legislation in the 109th congress climate change is viewed as global issue but proposed responses generally require action at the national level in 1992 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industrialized countries to take the lead in making voluntary efforts to reduce greenhouse gases1 over the past 15 years va riety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states including monitoring of utility carbon dioxide emissions improved appliance efficiency and incentives for developing renewable energy sources in 2001 president george w bush rejected the kyoto protocol to the unfccc which called for legally binding commitments by developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions instead the bush administration has focused on re ducing the greenhouse gas intensity2 of the us economy in the meantime some states nd local governments as well as private entities have taken actions to reduce emissions and limit the potential impacts of climate change in light of these acti ons number of bills were introduced in congress to address climate change in the 109th congress numerous bills were intr oduced that directly or indirectly address climate change seve ral bills addressed the climate change issue directly either through emissions limits incentives fo r reductions or research and information gathering on climate change and greenhous gas emissions mitigation this report describes and compares bills that directly addressed climate change as opposed to those that addressed other issues but could have had ancillary impacts eg energy efficiency and conservation topics covered by these bills fall into four major categories 1 those that would have promoted research on the effects of climate change and on methods to measure and pred ict climate change 2 those that would have created incentives for the deployment of emissionreducing technologies in the united states or other countries 3 thos that would have established greenhouse gas ghg monitoring systems as basis for research or for any potential reduction program and 4 those that would have established marketbased programs to directly limit greenhouse gas emissions thes categories are not mutually exclusive and several bills addressed more than one of the bove categories the major provisions of these bills are categorized in appendix 1 and summarized in appendix 2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32955crs2 in several cases bill sponsors introduced modified versions of their climate change bills for the purposes of the discussion below it is assumed that the newest version supersedes earlier ve rsions these bills include s 1151 for s 342 mccain s 883 for s 386 hagel s 887 for s 388 hagel and s 1203 for s 387 hagel energy bill amendments on august 8 2005 president bush signed the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 title xvi established voluntary national program designed to accelerate demonstration and deployme nt of lesscarbonintensive technology to encourage voluntary reductions in greenhouse gases the title attempts to support actions focused on reducing us carbon intensity t he ratio of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross domestic product the prog ram would not establish requirement to reduce emissions this title also establishes program to encourage exports of carbon intensityreducing technologie s to developing countries as part of the senate debate over the energy policy act of 2005 several amendments on climate change were offe red samdt 817 which inserted new title xvi in the bill incorporated language from s 883 and s 887 this amendment was agreed to on 6629 vote these provisions are similar to those included in the final version of the bill the house version of the bill did not expressly address climate change issues not included in the final law was secti on 1612 of the senate bill samdt 866 which expressed the sense of the senate that human activities are substantial cause of greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmos phere causing average temperatures to rise further the resolution stated that congress should enact comprehensive and effective national program of mandatory marketbased limits and incentives on emissions of greenhouse gases that slow stop and reverse the growth of such emissions at rate and in manner that 1 will not significantly harm the united states economy and 2 will encourage comp arable action by other nations that are major trading partners and ke contributors to global emissi ons this was the first sense of the senate reso lution on climate change since sres 98 in 1997 which voiced concern over the economic effects of emissions limits and the sense that developing countries must participate in meaningful action to control emissions similar to samdt 866 sjres 5 also urge d us action on climate change but this resolution saw action after being referred to committee the senate also debated whether to adopt samdt 826 which contained language similar to s 1151 this amendm ent would have blished mandatory capandtrade system to limit greenhouse gas emissions from covered entities to year 2000 levels by 2010 this amendment was rejected on 3860 vote climate change research bills global climate change is complex issue while most scientists agree that the climate is changing in response to gr eenhouse gas ghg emissions uncertainties concerning the causes and the effects of climate change remain and are

emissions research bills one bill in the 109th congress s 245 collins focused solely on climate change research4 it called for the velopment and testing of climate change models based on historic climatic changes and to incorporate nonlinear aspects of geophysical systems that could lead to abrupt changes in climate research provisions in broader bills several bills included climate change research provisions as part of broader climate change legislation specifically research in s 1151 s 3698 s 4039 hr 759 and hr 2828 would have focused on abrupt climate change research and new climate change measurement technologies hr 5049 w ould have established new advanced research projects agency within the department of energy deployment of greenhouse gas reduction technology in the 109th congress several bills would ve promoted the deployment and diffusion of technologies to reduce greenh ouse gas emissions either as part of broader legislation to limit greenhouse gase s or as standalone legislation deployment strategies included tax incen tives for investment in technologies to improve efficiency andor lower emissions and grants loans and other incentives for technology tran sfer to developing countries s 1203 hagel and h r 6417 meehan would have estab lished tax incentives for investment in technologies to reduce greenhouse gas intensity s 745 byrd s 883 hagel s

titled federal climate change expenditures report to congress 5 ghg reporting and registry bills under the unfccc the united states annually publishes reports on its ghg emissions6 the united states environmenta l protection agency epa does this reporting using various technique s eg fuel analysis for co2 the three dominant sources of ghg emissions are electricity generation 331 transportation 269 and industry 197 at the national level most electric utilities must report their ghg emissions pursuant to the 1990 clean ai r act but there is overall national ghg reporting requirement however some states also gather data through voluntary or mandatory ghg emi ssions reporting mechanisms8 hr 955 olver focused primarily on expanding emissions reporting to include broad array of sources all entities th at emit more than 10000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent would have been required to report their emissions except that farms were exempt further manufact urers and importers of automobiles and department of ergylisted products9 would have been required to report the emissions from their products the purpos of the bill was to promote greenhouse gas reductions and to generate accurate emissions data that can be used by public and private entities for various purposes in addition to hr 955 which focused solely on ghg reportin g several other bills would have required emissions monitoring and reporting as part of program to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide or of all greenhouse gases these emissions reductions efforts are discussed in the follo wing section s 150 jeffords s 730 leahy hr 1451 waxman and hr 1873 bass would have required electricity producers to report their carbon dioxide emi ssions in order to determine compliance with carbon dioxide caps s 1151 mccain hr 759 gilchrest and hr 2828 inslee would have required major emitters of all six gr eenhouse gases to report their emissions the bills requi red reporting from entities th at emit more than 10000 metric tons 11000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent hr 5049 udall t would have required all fossil fuel suppliers to report the amount of greenhouse gases that will result from combustion of the fuel supplied s 4039 kerry would havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32955crs5 10 the acid rain program caps emissions from each source but allows sources to exceed their caps if they purchase credits from sources th at achieve emissions reductions beyond those requiredrequired reporting from all major sources as defined by section 169a of the clean air act ghg emissionreduction bills the united states has federal ghg reduction requirements though there have been proposals to require such re ductions these proposals include command and control regulations on emissions ghg emission taxes and marketbased techniques to limit emissions the latter marketbased programs typically take as their model the clean air acts acid rain program10 in the 109th congress bills were introduced th at would have established market based caps on ghg emissions these bills are compared in table 1 three bills s 1151 mccain hr 759 gilchrest and h r 2828 inslee would have capped the emissions of the six greenhouse gases speci fied in the united nations framework convention on climate change five othe r bills s 150 jeffords s 730 leahy s 2724 carper hr 1451 waxman and hr 1873 bass would have focused on reducing carbon dioxide from electric ut ilities each of th bills would have used marketbased trading mechanisms to limit ghg emissions capandtrade programs set strict limits on specific emi ssions from particular group of sources allowing individual sources to trade reductions this flexibility in who makes reductions can lead to lower costs in an efficient market entities that face relatively low emissionreduction costs could achieve extra emission reductions these entities could then sell their unused allowances to entities that face higher emissionreduction costs an entity facing higher costs could purchase allowances that would allow it to emit more than its initial emissions allotment would ot herwise permit it should be noted that in all cases total us emissions may decrease or increase depending on the entities covered the greenhouse gases controlled and the emissions trading schemes another marketbased option is to require tradeable emissions permits but establish safety valve price in this scenario if the market value of permit exceeds set price the safety valve covered entities can purchase an unlimited number of permits from the government in this way the overall price to covered entities and the economy is limited but specific emission reduction targets may not be reached hr 5049 udall t w ould have established such system carbon dioxide reduction bills as shown in table 1 s 150 s 730 hr 1451 and hr 1873 focused on electric u tility emissions these multi pollutant bills would have limited emissions of carbon dioxide along with other airhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32955crs6 11 s 131 inhofe and hr 227 sweeny would also establish capandtrade program for nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide and mercury from utilities however the bills do not address carbon dioxide emissions 12 for more information on multipollutant bills see crs report rl32755 air quality multipollutant legislation in the 109th congress by larry parker and john

congress the climate stewar dship act of 2005 hr 759 the new apollo energy act of 2005 hr 2828 and the climate stewardship and innovation act of 2005 s 1151 focused on achieving marketdriven reductions in all six greenhouse gases see table 1 the legislation applied to entities in the electricity transportation industry nd commercial sectors that emit over 10000 metric tons 11000 t ons of greenhouse gases per year starting in 2010 the bills would have capped total ghg emissions from all these sources at 65 billion tons co2 equivalent emissions reduced by the amount of co2 equivalent emissions from noncovered entities in the year 2000 th bills would also have established formula for allocating ghg emissions allo wances and climate change credit corporation to manage allo wance trading language similar to s 1151 was offered as an amendment on the senate floor to hr 6 this amendment was rejected on 3860 vote in addition to establishing caps on ll six greenhouse gases the above bills would have supported c limate change research and established ghg emissions inventory see above the bills also in cluded requirement that the administrator of the epa establish national ghg databa and develop met hods and standards to measure and verify ghg emissions the safe climate act of 2006 hr 5642 the global warming pollution act s 3698 and the global warming reduc tion act of 2006 s 4039 would have granted epa broad authority to establish regulations such that total greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to 80 65 in the case of hr 4039 below 1990 levels by 2050 these bills did not designate covere d entities or required reduction levels for specific sectors but would have left those decisions to epas discretion safety valve bills the keep america competitive global
