unpreventable consistent discovery through the visitor location register vlr occurs every quarter and provides analysts with timely information to place lectors into candidate status or detask analysis identified that these incidents coul d be reduced if analysts removed detasked selectors more quickly upon learning that the status of the select or had changed and more regularly mon itored target activity this analysis indicates that continued research on ways to exploit new technologies and researching the various aspects of personal communications systems to include gsm are an
