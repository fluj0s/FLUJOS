efficient vehicle technologies has been ongoing for the past few decades much of this research started in response to the oil shocks of the 1970s which triggered concerns about rising fuel costs and growing dependence on imported fuel the urgency of those concerns was lost as fuel prices declined in the 1980s and 1990s at the same time however rising concerns about vehicle contributions to air pollution and global climate change added new dimension to the issue recently instability in world oil prices and political concerns have reawakened the energy dependence concerns of the 1970s meanwhile research on new technologies continues with particular focus on commercialization despite widespread agreement in principle on the benefits of decreased dependence on petroleum and the internal combustion engine the practical challenges posed by transition to advanced vehicle technologies are formidable nonetheless sign ificant research and development progress has been made since the 1970s these new technologies have sparked more interest as some major auto manufacturers have introduced highefficiency production vehicles to the american market and others have plans to introduce similar vehicles in the future furthermore interest has grown recently as result of higher petroleum prices and the announcement of new emission regulations for passenger vehicles in january 2002 the bush administration announced the freedomcar initiative which focuses federal research on fuel cell vehicles in conjunction with freedomcar in january 2003 president bush announced the hydrogen fuel initiative which focuses federal research on hydrogen fuel and fuel cells for stationary applications the goal of these initiatives is to improve the competitiveness of hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technologies however fuel cell vehicles share many components with hybrid and pure electric vehicles thus this research will likely promote advanced vehicle technologies in general this report discusses four major vehicle technologieselectric vehicles hybrid electric vehicles plugin hybrids and fuel cell vehiclesas well as advanced component technologies each technology is discussed in terms of cost fueling and maintenance infrastructure and performance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30484g3g141g159g138g151g140g142g141g561g24g142g145g146g140g149g142g561g22g142g140g145g151g152g149g152

using electrical energy to power autom obiles has been in existence for over century however for number of reasons including the energy density of petroleum fuels the internal combustion engine has been the power source of choice for automobiles and most other vehicles however with the oil shocks of the past few decades as well as an increasing awareness of the emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases from cars and trucks interest in the use of electrical power train systems has grown while there are other potential replacements for the internal combustion engine such as compressed air these other technologies have not been the subject of much interest scientifically or politically much of the federal advanced vehicle research has come through the partnership for new generation of vehicles pngv and the freedomcar program consortia of the federal government and the big three american automobile manufacturers pngv focused on near term goals and the development of hybrid electric vehicles while freedomcar which replaced pngv in 2002 focuses on longterm research on fuel cells and hydrogen fuel the united states is not alone in pursuing these new technologies japanese manufacturers were the first to introduce highefficiency gasolineelec tric hybrid vehicles in the us market the development of these vehicles is response to global pressures to lower emissions and improve fuel economy in that context it is worth noting that in most developed countries gasoline and diesel fuel prices are considerably higher than they are in the united states four advanced propulsion technologies of key inte rest are electric vehicles hybrid vehicles plug in hybrids and fuel cell vehicles in an electric vehicle the vehicle runs exclusively on electricity that is supplied from an electric utility provider eliminating combustion onboard the vehicle hybrid vehicle integrates an electrical system w ith an internal combustion engine to utilize the benefits of each system plugin hybrid system allows vehicle to be charged in the same manner as pure electric vehicle allowing an allelectric range the additional hybrid system allows for the vehicle to use combustion engine when the batteries are depleted in fuel cell vehicle instead of combustion chemical conversi on process is used leading to higher levels of efficiency in addition to altering the propulsion system many other efficiencyrelated technologies such as improved aerodynamics and lowresistance tires can be incorporated into both new and conventional vehicles while these various technologies are promising they must overcome certain obstacles before they will be competitive in the marketplace there are three main barriers to their widespread use cost infrastructure and performance cost is factor since without subsidies consumers are unlikely to purchase new vehicles in large numbers if the new vehicles are not costcompetitive with conventional vehicles also convenient infrastructure must exist for both fueling and maintenance of these vehicles finally the performance of the new vehicles must be comparable to that of conventional vehicles

consumed in evs and the vehicles therefore do not produce emissions they are considered to be zero emission vehicles zevs in certain air quality control regions although there are emissions attributable to the production of electricity to charge the vehicles the overall fuelcycle of evs tends to lead to lower levels of toxic and ozoneforming emissionsas well as greenhouse gasesthan those of conventional vehicles also since pollution attributable to electric vehicles occurs at power plants it is generally emitted in areas with relatively low population density 1 another potential public policy benefit of electric vehicles is that they can reduce us dependence on foreign oil since only about 3 of electricity in the united states is generated from petroleum furthermore transportation dependence on all forms of fossil fuels can be reduced since approximately 30 to 35 of electricity in the us is generated from nonfossil fuels however high electricity costs in recent years have led to questions about the longterm viability of evs commercially these vehicles have not been wellreceived by consumers 2 by 1998 only about 4200 evs were on the road mainly in california3 by 2005 this number had increased to roughly 510004 however only few car companies currently produce electric vehicles and most of those are only available for lease by large fleets evs for personal use have declined as automakers have taken most personal evs off the market5 while the number of evs has increased the amount of fuel used per vehicle has decreased as have presumably miles traveled per vehicle between 1998 and 2005 while the number of evs increased more than 10fold electricity for vehicle fuel increased only about fivefold6 g5g152g156g157g561 one of the most significant barriers to wide acceptance of electric vehicles is their higher purchase cost for example the manufacturers suggested retail price for 1999 general motors ev1 was approximately 33995 7 which was considerably higher than comparable 1999 chevrolet cavalier at 136708 1 however there may be concerns over increasing pollution in areas near power generation facility though it is generally easier to control criteria pollutant emissions for st ationary source than from mobile source in addition the development of carbon capture and storage at powerplants could improve the greenhouse gas balance of electric vehicles 2 it is important to note that many of the technologies disc ussed in this report are in relatively early stages of research and development and thus are not directly comparable to the internal combustion engine which has been mass market product for nearly century 3 department of energy energy information administration eia alternatives to traditional transportation fuels 2000

conventional vehicles in 2002 small conventional vehicle could achieve fuel cost of approximately 690 per year9 an electric vehicle however could achieve considerably lower cost of 390 to 480 per year10 this difference while significant fails to make up for the additional purchase or lease cost for an electric vehicle with increased petroleum prices the cost savings for evs may make them more attractive however its is unlikely that even very large increase in petroleum prices would be sufficient to make the current generation of electric vehicles costcompetitive in terms of maintenance costs electric vehicles have fewer moving parts which reduces wear however certain parts such as replacement batteries tend to be expensive 11 through 2006 there was federal tax credit for the purchase of an electric vehicle the federal credit was worth 10 of the purchase price of the vehicle up to 2000 this credit was part of the energy policy act of 1992 12 in some areas evs are also exempted from high occupancy vehicle hov lane restrictions parking restrictions andor vehicle registration fees which may provide an additional incentive for their use g11g151g143g155g138g156g157g155g158g140g157g158g155g142g561 another key obstacle to more widespread use of electric vehicles is the lack of fueling charging and maintenance infrastructure for example there were approximately 700 public charging stations in 2004 mostly in california and arizona13 currently that number is only 440 this represents less than 1 of the roughly 125000 gasoline stations nationwide14 the lack of recharging infrastructure is not only inconvenient but also limits longdistance travel since arizona and california account for the vast majority of all recharging sites currently in operation adding to the problem of fueling infrastructure is the lack of maintenance infrastructure few mechanics have experience servicing evs and most work must be done at certified dealer for this reason most ev leases include free dealer maintenance over the period of the contract on the other hand one advantage of electric vehicles is that they have fewer moving parts and thus may be more durable and require less frequent maintenance g18g142g155g143g152g155g150g138g151g140g142g561 another major concern with electric vehicles is their performance the batteries used to power the vehicles tend to be quite heavy limiting the range of these vehicles15 while conventional 9 john decicco jim kliesch and martin tomas aceees green book the environmental guide to cars trucks washington dc 2000 10 ibid 11 most manufacturers are researching to improve battery life and are also considering warrantying batteries for the life of the vehicle 12 pl 102486 26 usc 30 for more

recently electric cars generally could only travel about 100 to 150 miles before needing to be recharged with new developments in battery technology ev range has increased however even new evs are unlikely to have the range of conventional vehicle furthermore while refilling the tank of conventional vehicle requires only few minutes full residential recharge for an electric vehicle can take five to eight hours although new chargers may shorten this time significantly 16 for fleet vehicles or for shortdistance commuting these performance characteristics might not greatly affect their marketability but the feasibility of evs for longdistance intercity travel is unlikely with current technology even if the fueling infrastructure is greatly expanded17 lesser concern with electric vehicles is an unconventional driving style to provide maximum efficiency and range the driver must accelerate and brake very smoothly or range is significantly diminished because of this some drivers may not be comfortable or proficient operating an electric vehicle18 the greatest performance benefit from an ev is that as was stated above there are emissions from the vehicle itself furthermore the overall toxic and ozoneforming emissions tend to be much lower than with conventional vehicles since it can be easier to control emissions at power plant than it is to control combustion vehicle emissions an added benefit is reduction in noise pollution since evs are significantly quieter than conventional vehicles greenhouse gas emissions caused by evs tend to be lower than those from conventional vehicles depending on the local fuel mix used in power generation 19 and the efficiency of the power distribution grid but if electricity transmission and distribution losses are high total energy consumption attributable to electric vehicles may exceed conventional vehicles g17g157g145g142g155g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 major issue for vehicle manufacturers and motivation for increased research and development on electric vehicles is californias zeroemissions mandate 20 this mandate would require manufacturers to sell zevs and other superlowemission vehicles however many technical and market barriers have hindered the implementation of the program most recently the california air resources board amended the program allowing manufacturers two methods to certify compliance first manufacturers were able to generate credits for future use by introducing limited number of fuel cell vehicles see discussion below on fuel cells by 2005 continued extended ev range significantly 16 john odell clean air detour fuelefficient lowemissions hybrids are here angeles times february 2 2000 p g1 17 there has been some research into the use of modular battery packs to eliminate the need for rechargingdepleted batteries are exchanged for fully charged batteries at service stationbut problems with design and feasibility have hindered progress in this area 18 in fact these techniques can also affect the range and fuel economy of conventional vehicles but to much lesser degree 19 this is especially true of the high greenhouse gas emissions from coalfired power plants 20 california code of regulations section 1962e title 13

sales coming from zevs 2 from other advancedtechnology vehicles and 6 from conventional superlowemission vehicles sulevs environmentalists have criticized the most recent amendments to the program for not requiring more extensive mandates21 the original legislation required 2 of my 1998 vehicle sales to be zevs and sulevs and 5 of my 2001 sales but these initial requirements were removed in 1996 to encourage marketbased introduction of zevs other states have adopted the california program including new york maine massachusetts new jersey and maryland 22

electric vehicle hev hevs combine an electric motor and battery pack with an internal combustion engine to improve efficiency in current hevs the batteries are recharged during operation eliminating the need for an external charger in development are plugin hybrids phevs that combine some of the benefits of hevs and pure evs see the next section either way range and performance can be significantly improved over electric vehicles the combustion and electric systems of hevs are combined in various configurations in one configuration series hybrid the electric motor supplies power to move the wheels while the combustion engine is connected to generator that powers the motor and recharges the batteries in another configuration parallel hybrid the combustion engine provides primary power while the electric motor adds extra power for acceleration and climbing or the electric motor is the primary power source with extra power provided by the engine in some parallel hybrid systems the engine and electric motor work in tandem w ith either system providing primary or secondary power depending on driving conditions the hybrid drive train allows the combustion engine to operate at or near peak efficiency most of the time this can lead to significantly higher levels of overall vehicle system efficiency the higher efficiency of these vehicles allows th em to achieve very high fuel economy and lower emissions for example the hybrid honda civic is rated at 40 miles per gallon mpg in the city and 45 mpg on the highway gasolinefueled honda civic sedan by comparison achieves rating of 25 mpg city and 36 mpg highway 23 fuel economy improvements can help cut demand for foreign petroleum and the higher efficiency enables hybrid vehicles to attain and even surpass the range of conventional vehicles even with smaller fuel tank furthermore since these vehicles utilize conventional fuel the ling infrastructure problems associated with electric vehicles can be eliminated hev

plan to do so over the next few years25 currently purchasers of an hev may qualify for tax credit the credit established in the energy policy act of 2005 is based on the fuel economy and projected fuel savings compared to baseline conventional vehicle the value of the tax credit is up to 3400 depending on those factors26 the number of vehicles produced by single manufacturer eligible for the

200727 g5g152g156g157g561 one of the key selling points for hybrids is that while they are more expensive than conventional vehicles they are much less expensive than pure electric vehicles however these vehicles are still relatively expensive all of the current hybrids are priced several thousand dollars above comparable conventional vehicles further it has been claimed that current hybrid prices are subsidized by the manufacturers 28 the higher purchase price of these vehicles is offset to some degree by lower fuel costs due to the higher fuel efficiency of hybrids fuel can be significantly lower with hybrids than with conventional vehicles see table 1 these savings along with proposed tax credits for the purchase of hybrids could cover the incremental cost of purchasing

another key advantage of hybrid vehicles over pure electrics is that new fueling infrastructure must be installed since the vehicles are fueled by gasoline or diesel this allows hybrid owners to purchase and operate these vehicles anywhere in th country and longdistance travel will not be limited by the fueling infrastructure furthermore maintenance of the combustion components in the vehicle can rely on the existing service infrastructure however as with pure electric vehicles maintenance of the electric components in hybrid vehicles generally must happen at licensed dealers who will have more access to the technology this may limit the acceptability for rural customers who may live good distance from the dealership but is less likely to harm ac ceptance of urban and suburban customers g18g142g155g143g152g155g150g138g151g140g142g561 the most notable features of hybrid vehicles are higher fuel economy and extended range the efficiency of the hybrid drive system allows significant increase in fuel economy compared to conventional vehicles cutting fuel costs also the improved fuel economy means that vehicle range is greatly extended with hybrids even if slightly smaller fuel tank is used this higher efficiency also leads to lower emissions of greenhouse gases as well as lower emissions of toxic and ozoneforming pollutants further depending on design the hybrid system can also be used to boost horsepower and acceleration 29 g18g149g158g144g556g146g151g561g10g162g139g155g146g141g561g24g142g145g146g140g149g142g156g561 recent development in advanced vehicle technologies is the expected introduction in the next few years of plugin hybrid electric vehicles phevs phev uses much highercapacity battery pack than typical hybrid and adds the ability to charge the vehicle on grid power with the larger batteries an allelectric range of 20 to 40 miles or more could be achieved in this way most commuters might be able to travel to and from work solely on electrical grid power only when traveling long distances might the combustion engine be necessary potential advantages include the ability to use electric power which tends to be less expensive per mile than gasoline thus some of the increased purchase cost of phev over conventional vehicle could be made up in future fuel saving s in addition phevs could provide some of the environmental benefits of pure electric vehicles including lower fuelcycle pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions without some of the performance drawbacks 29 however increasing power necessarily compromises some or all of the fuel economy

batteries necessary for phevs compared to hybrids costs could be several thousand dollars more than hybrid and thus significantly more expensive than conventional vehicle some or all of this additional cost could be made up through energy cost savings over the life of the vehicle electricity tends to be less expensive than gasoline per mile and it is expected that most consumers would be able to run most of the time on electricity one key concern is that the duty cycle of phev batteries is far more rigorous than that of conventional hybrids and thus the batteries may need to be replaced more often increasing lifecycle costs g11g151g143g155g138g156g157g155g158g140g157g158g155g142g561 key question on the infrastructure for phevs is whether they will be able to be plugged into standard household outlet 30 or whether an additional charging station would be necessary if additional charging station is required then presumably consumers could recharge their vehicles overnight at their homes31 beyond those requirements concerns have been raised over the additional electric power needed if large number of phevs are plugged into the grid g18g142g155g143g152g155g150g138g151g140g142g561 key benefit of phev is that it can run on electric power but without the range limitations of pure ev phevs allelectric range would likel be limited to commuting distances with the combustion engine engaging on longer trips another key benefit to phevs is that by relying mainly on electric power total fuel cycle pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions will likely be lower than those of conventional vehicles although the degree of reduction will depend on the source of the electric power coal natural gas nuclear or renewable and the amount of electric vs gasoline fuel used by the vehicle 32 g8g158g142g149g561g5g142g149g149g561g24g142g145g146g140g149g142g156g561 an advanced vehicle further from commercializati on is fuel cell vehicle fcv fuel cell can be likened to chemical battery33 unlike battery however fuel cell can run continuously as long as the fuel supply is not exhausted in fuel cell hydrogen reacts with oxygen to generate an electric current hydrogen is supplied to the fuel cell as either pure hydrogen or through hydrogenrich fuel such as methanol natural gas or gasoline that is processed reformed on board the vehicle there is physical limit to the voltage that one fuel cell can provide so fuel cells are arranged in stacks to generate high voltage that is used to power an electric motor 30 either 120volt outlet or highervoltage 240volt outlet like those used for electric clothes dryers 31 in the case of 240volt outlet an electrician would likely be needed to install it 32 electric power research institute and

which is necessary with electric vehicles while producing much lower emissions than combustion vehicles in fact if pure hydrogen fuel is used the only product from the reaction will be water with hydrogen fuel an fcv would qualify as zero emission vehicle34 using other fuels35 while the vehicle is longer zev emissions would still be drastica lly cut as compared to conventional vehicles furthermore because potential fuel supplies for fcvs include natural gas methanol or pure hydrogenthe latter two produced from natural gas 36another potential benefit from fuel cells will be their ability to reduce the transportation demand for foreign petroleum37 while currently available only to few consumers on demonstration basis fuel cells have been touted as likely to be one of the most important technologies in the history of the automobile38 they are currently very expensive and thus there has been great deal of interest in research and development to improve their marketability because of their potential to revolutionize the automotive industry all major manufacturers are working to develop fuel cell vehicles and some manufacturers have introduced limited number of vehicles for lease others intend to introduce vehicles for limited leases in the near future39 demonstration projects are ongoing with fuel cell passenger cars sport utility vehicles and transit buses many of these demonstrations are in conjunction with the california fuel cell partnership consortium of auto manufacturers fuel providers fuel cell developers and state and federal agencies g5g152g156g157g561 arguably the largest barrier to the production of fcvs is cost it currently costs approximately 2000 to 3000 to produce gasoline engine for conventional passenger car 40 in the early 2000s comparable fuel cell stack cost around 35000 according to industry estimates but leading producer of fuel cells estimates that costs could be cut to 3500 in the future41 since there are fewer moving parts in fuel cell vehicle maintenance costs would likely be lower so the added cost of the fuel cell system may be offset by lower maintenance costs further research and development would be necessary to achieve these benefits another key cost issue will be fuel costs fuel costs are concern because there is hydrogen fueling infrastructure currently and the use of methanol and natural gas as transportation fuels is currently limited 42 consumers might have to pay premium for these fuels in order to support growing infrastructure however since hydrogen fuel and methanol would likely be produced from natural gas price fluctuations caused by changing supply in petroleum markets could be dampened although natural gas price fluctuations would certainly have an effect 34 like electric cars however there will be emissions due to the production and distribution of the hydrogen fuel 35 in these cases an extra component called reformer is used to separate hydrogen from the fuel 36 the eventual goal is to produce hydrogen fuel from renewable sources but that technology not yet marketable 37 recent high natural gas prices have led to questions of the viability of natural gas as fuel source for fcvs 38 environmental and energy study institute eesi fuel cell fact sheet february 2000 39 because of pr oduction costs and other barriers these will likely be very small production runs

another major barrier to the use of fcvs is that there is infrastructure for the distribution of hydrogen fuel and little methanol or natural gas infrastructure for transportation as of december 2007 there were only about 750 natural gas refueling sites in the united states and few if any methanol sites the feedstock for methanol and the likely feedstock in the near future for hydrogen fuel is natural gas although other feed stocks such as biomass or coal could be used43 hydrogen derived from renewable energy could also be possible in the future but that technology is far from commercialization until the distribution infrastructure for hydrogen methanol or natural gas is developed it is possible that gasoline will be the fuel of choice for fuel cell passenger vehicles as with electric vehicles maintenance infrastructure exists for servicing these vehicles the technology is radically different from conventional vehicles and most maintenance would likely have to occur at certified dealers g18g142g155g143g152g155g150g138g151g140g142g561 one limit on the performance of fuel cell vehicles has been their weight fuel cells have been demonstrated on larger vehicles such as buse s however because of size and weight until recently passenger and cargo space has been sacrificed in prototypes of smaller fuel cell vehicles however many of these issues have been addressed in more recent prototypes another potential concern is that onboard reformers for converting gasoline or other fuels to hydrogen are very heavy therefore much research has focused not only on cutting the cost of fuel cell systems but decreasing their weight as well another performance concern is one of fuel storage since hydrogen is not very dense the fuel must be highly concentrated and must be compressed requiring highpressure tank liquified requiring cooling system for the storage tank chemically bonded with storage material such as chemical or metal hydride or stored in tank with complicated geometry eg nanotubules each of these storage systems has pr oblems such as added weight safety risks or expensive raw materials that limit their acceptability 44 therefore research is ongoing to improve both the storage capacity and safety of hydrogen fuel on the environmental side the emissions from fuel cell vehicles are extremely low using hydrogen there are emissions of toxic or ozoneforming pollutants using other fuels the reformer limits the efficiency of the fuel cell system but emissions are still much lower than with conventional engines depending on the emissions attributable to the production and distribution of the fuel fuel cell vehicles may perform be tter environmentally than any other technology for all types of emissions including greenhouse gases however this is not guarantee especially if coal is used to generate hydrogen and tec hnology is developed to recapture carbon dioxide from the production process 43 department of energy alternative fuels data center hydrogen general information httpwwwafdcdoegov altfuelhyd_generalhtml 44 it should be noted that highpressure onboard storage of hydrogen could potentially be safer than current gasoline tanks

components that reduce friction decrease vehicle weight or improve system efficiency many hightechnology vehicles that are available to the public utilize these technologies but some of these

efficiency is to reduce the weight of the vehicle however simply reducing weight while using the same materials and structural design can compromise passenger safety therefore newer vehicles are making extensive use of advanced materials such as composite or plastic body panels and highs trength lightweight aluminum structural components the use of some of these materials may even make vehicle more recyclable 45 furthermore conventional materials can improve safety while reducing weight if more sophisticated structural designs are used

the road wind resistance can be decreased through redesigning the body to more aerodynamic shape in addition the use of slippery body panels 46 can further decrease drag as can decreasing the profile of parts such as sideview mirrors tires and the radio antenna rolling friction can be limited through the use of lowresistance tires

consumption and improve acceleration as with hybrid vehicle using the hightorque device allows the engine to shut off when the vehicle is stopped when power is applied the engine can restart in less than one second 49 it is believed that the integrated startergenerator could improve fuel economy of conventional vehicles by as much as 20 however because the integrated starter generator requires considerable amount of electrical power it is being developed concurrently with 42volt electrical systems g5g162g149g146g151g141g142g155g561g6g142g138g140g157g146g159g138g157g146g152g151g561 fuel consumption can also be reduced through cylinder deactivation when less power is needed one or more engine cylinders can be deactivated these cylinders can then be reactivated if power needs increase this technology could be particularly useful in applications where six eight or tencylinder engine may be needed to boost acceleration haul trailer or carry large payload but is not needed when loads are lighter cylinder deactivation is currently available in several vehicles including certain models of the chrysler 300 sedan the gmc envoy suv and the honda odyssey minivan 47 in fact the efficiency of the regenerative braking system is key factor in the amount of the credit available in the administrations proposed tax credit for hybrid vehicles 48 paul sharke power of 42 mechanical

advanced vehicle technologies can help curb consumption of fossil fuels especially petroleum and reduce emissions of toxic and ozoneforming pollutants as well as greenhouse gases in general the most promising current technologies incorporate electric motors and batteries in their design while all take advantage of new design techniques and advanced materials to reduce resistance cut vehicle weight and better conserve energy however most of these technologies are still in various stages of development and have not yet proven marketable to most consumers the three key issues for the marketability of advanced technology vehicles are cost infrastructure and performance consumers must be willing and able to purchase the vehicles so purchase cost and overall lifecycle cost of these vehicles must be competitive in addition consumers must be able to expect that refueling and servicing these vehicles will be relatively convenient finally the overall performance of the vehiclesin terms of fuel economy range driveability safety and emissionsmust be acceptable while most advanced vehicles meet some of these requirements new vehicle has yet met all of them therefore research and development has been key issue in the discussion of these vehicles as have efforts to make the vehicles more affordable and the infrastructure more accessible these vehicles may help the federal government in its role of promoting energy security and environmental protection if research and development can bring them to point where they can be successfully marketed to american consumers
