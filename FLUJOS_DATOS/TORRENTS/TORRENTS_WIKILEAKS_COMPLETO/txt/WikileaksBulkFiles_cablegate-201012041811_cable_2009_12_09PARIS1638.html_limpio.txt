paris 1521 classified by ambassador charles rivkin for reasons 14b and d 1 cnf summary at the midpoint of his fiveyear term french president sarkozy continues to be the dominant virtually unchallenged political force in france slowed in domestic reform efforts by entrenched interests and the worldwide financial crisis sarkozy is increasingly focused on successfully leveraging frances foreign policy influence on the global stage ambitious and actionoriented sarkozy doesnt hesitate to break traditional french policies and reach out to new partners from saudi arabia and syria to india and brazil his impatience for results and desire to seize the initiative with or without the support of international partners and his own advisors challenges us to channel his impulsive proposals into constructive directions with an eye to longterm results sarkozy himself is firmly convinced of the need for strong transatlantic partnership and he has long desired to be the major partner to the us in europe whether on climate change and nonproliferation or iran and the middle east our effort to secure increased french contributions in afghanistan offers an interesting perspective on the centralization of key decisionmaking powers in the french president and how to best work with sarkozy as valued and valuable partner with highprofile events like the nonproliferation treaty npt prepcom next spring and sarkozy preparing to lead frances chairmanship of the g8g20 in 2011 we believe we can best secure our interests across broad front through continued close consultations with our french partners including and perhaps especially at the highest levels with an eye to leveraging sarkozys strong political standing desire for action and willingness to make difficult decisions into force multipliers for our foreign policy interests end summary domestic drama but domestic opposition 2 cnf sarkozys domestic standing is virtually unchallenged despite lagging opinion polls which place his personal approval ratings at 39 percent his centerright ump party controls both houses of parliament and opposition leaders in france have spent the past two years fighting among themselves rather than mounting any serious political challenge to the incumbent president sarkozys policy of openness in appointing opposition politicians to highprofile positions has contributed to the leadership drain on the left imf president dominique strausskahn and fm kouchner are just two examples of this successful political ploy despite this political security or perhaps because of it there is some internal grumbling about sarkozys highhanded style within his own party revealed by the recent attempt to name his 23year old jean sarkozy who is still an undergraduate student to position at the head of pariss most prestigious business development commission brilliant political tactician sarkozy is raising the profile of the march 2010 regional elections to rally his base and steal voters from the far right as part of rampup to his reelection bid in 2012 while this makes him more sensitive to the nearterm domestic political impact of certain foreign policy issues like afghanistan his domestic stature remains fundamentally secure freeing him to focus on his goal of leveraging french power in europe and globally foreign policy successes and challenges 3 cnf the net result of sarkozys dominance of the domestic political scene is that he is also one of the most secure leaders in europe with awkward coalition partner or imminent presidential elections to distract or hinder him sarkozy occasionally recognizes that to be heard on the world stage whether on strategic questions or the global financial crisis frances voice is amplified when speaking in concert with others sarkozy has worked hard to successfully parlay an initially awkward personal relationship with german chancellor merkel into smoothly paris 00001638 002 of 004 coordinated tandem that drives much of european policy likewise he will frequently pair with merkel and uk pm brown to add needed clout to messages in brussels and washington sarkozys ability to leverage his and frances voice on the world stage by building on strategic partnerships is one of his greatest strengths one of his greatest weaknesses however may be his impatience and penchant to launch proposals with insufficient consultation with other major players 4 cnf sarkozys most visible successes to date are largely in the foreign affairs domain with his greatest achievements within europe he championed the lisbon treaty in his first months in office helping to end the stalemate over reform of eu institutions this was succeeded by his leadership of the rotating eu presidency in the second half of 2008 which included the creation of the union for the mediterranean ufm the launch of the eus counterpiracy operation and his negotiation of ceasefire after the russian invasion of georgia characteristically he didnt hesitate to disregard european sensitivities by attempting to retain the lead on specific portfolios where he doubted the czech ability to provide the necessary followon eu lead after prague took over the rotating presidency in january 2009 on security issues sarkozy is equally bold he personally authorized additional french troops for afghanistan at the 2008 bucharest nato summit and this year he fought to bring france back into natos integrated military command reversing more than 40 years of bipartisan french policy in spite of strong skepticism within his own party and intense opposition from others new partners new ideas 5 cnf in departure from previous french leaders sarkozy has also devoted great deal of effort to reaching out bilaterally to countries like israel saudi arabia and syria recognizing that they are major players in the middle east where french ambitions have been frustrated french officials are convinced that sarkozys outreach to syria has made syrian president asad more productive partner in resolving middle east issues although they are hardpressed to provide concrete examples of change sarkozy fully recognizes the growing role played by emerging powers like brazil he has meet with brazilian president lula nine times in the past two years and india whose troops he invited to star in the july 14 2009 military parade he lobbied successfully for the g20 meeting in washington to address the global financial crisis and he supports an expanded security council which earns him additional popularity among rising powers the elysee has also looked to brazil as partner in climate change negotiations and buyer of french defense equipment including potentially the first overseas sale of the rafale fighter aircraft all of these outreach efforts stem from genuine convictions as well as an eye to the image of france at the center of global network of influential leaders 6 cnf sarkozy is most prone to disappoint when in his impatience for action he effectively gets ahead of other key players and his own advisors sarkozy is firmly convinced that the most intractable diplomatic problems can only be solved by getting leaders together in person to cut through bureaucratic red tape and make bold decisions hence his predilection for proposing summits he has little patience for the incremental steps of diplomacy and once he latches onto an idea he is loath to let it go impatient for progress in the middle east he has sought ways to make france player first through creation of the ufm and second by championing summit either in the guise of the ufm or now through other partners such as the us the quartet etc to achieve his goals in another example his surprise announcement last june in support of new treaty on european security architecture took many allies and his own staff by surprise although that debate has been channelled into the osce corfu process for the present sarkozy is already chafing at what he considers lack of progress on this strategic issue and is continuously tasking his staff to come up with new proposals to address the impasse of cfe improve the partnership with russia and provide other ideas to overcome blocked initiatives paris 00001638 003 of 004 one to say 7 cnf sarkozy has few restraints political personal or ideological to act as brake on his global ambitions domestically he rewards party leaders prepared to adopt his policies and marginalizes any opponents with diverse view several favored cabinet ministers with high profiles early in his administration including rama yade and rachida dati were subsequently bumped into secondary jobs after having disagreed with sarkozy on the other hand state secretary for european affairs pierre lellouche willingly muzzled his longterm outspoken support for turkish accession to the eu in exchange for his current post while diplomatic advisor nsaequivalent jeandavid levitte remains key player with an extensive background in diplomacy and calming personality other advisors like secretary general claude gueant are playing an increasingly public role despite having sarkozys ear to various degrees few appear to exercise any significant degree of influence over the activist president 8 cnf sarkozys own advisors likewise demonstrate little independence and appear to have little effect on curbing the hyperactive president even when he is at his most mercurial elysee contacts have reported to us the great lengths they will go to avoid disagreeing with him or provoking his displeasure even recently reportedly rerouting the presidents plane to avoid his seeing the eiffel tower lit up in turkeys colors on the visit of pm erdogan decision made by the paris city hall after two years in office many seasoned key elysee staff are leaving for prestigious onward assignments as reward for their hard work raising questions as to whether new faces will be any more willqg to point out when the emperor is less than fully dressed working together in the future 9 cnf when he was elected in 2007 sarkozy was among the first french leaders to openly embrace the united states despite us administration very unpopular in europe at the time this was due to sarkozys conviction that france can accomplish more in cooperation with rather than opposition to the united states when thensenator and presidential candidate obama came to france in july 2008 sarkozy cleared his schedule to meet with him and further broke his own protocol rules and held joint press conference privilege normally reserved exclusively for visiting heads of state sarkozy is prepared to be the uss key partner in europe and is hoping for intense regular contact with president obama which enhances sarkozys domestic stature and therefore directly increases his ability to make hard decisions french journalists are pointing out with increasing frequency that sarkozy has not paid white house call on president obama and french officials are beginning to express concern over this perceived lack of highlevel visits and other regular consultations journalists and officials alike are expressing the concern that france and europe as whole may be of less strategic importance to the united states today view that all things being equal does not enhance their incentives to work closely with us 10 cnf on strategic questions paris is frequently willing to back us positions even in the face of general european reluctance paris has welcomed us efforts to reset relations with russia and has consistently emphasized developing common approach with washington toward moscow on iran presidents sarkozy remains personally engaged and is willing to work intensely within europe both institutionally in the eu and through efforts to persuade individual countries to adopt national measures on nonproliferation and disarmament issues the gof has urged regular consultations in the run up to the 2010 npt review conference and launch of discussions on fmct treaty the most important thing for french officials and sarkozy himself is to feel like they are part oqthe decisionmaking process and not simply called in to ratify decisions after they have been made in washington afghanistan an illustrative case paris 00001638 004 of 004 11 cnf our effort to secure increased french contributions to afghanistan underlines how much decisionmaking power is vested in the french president and how best we can work with him to achieve desired results last year on our request president sarkozy went against all of his political and military advisors to deploy french omlt to assist the dutch forces in uruzgan critical reinforcement of key ally it was also sarkozy alone who made the decision to deploy an additional 700 troops at last years bucharest summit at the time of the announcement even key staff were still unsure what the final decision would be this year in intense exchanges with all the major french players including fm kouchner nsaequivalent levitte and french chod georgelin each one expressed support for us policy but were doubtful about additional french financial or military resources frequently citing sarkozys earlier statement of additional troops 12 cnf however following direct conversation with president obama president sarkozy dropped the formerly firm position and moved forward more quickly and proactively than we envisioned opening the door to military reinforcements in time and promising increased financial and training assistance although the specifics are not yet provided the personal outreach to president sarkozy made the difference between getting cautious bureaucratic response and genuine commitment from key ally when we needed it the french press led their reports noting sarkozy was the first foreign leader on obamas call sheet thereby increasing the pressure on sarkozy to respond favorably comment 13 cnf comment as one of europes most politically secure leaders at the head of country with significant ability to contribute more to global problemsolving across broad front from afghanistan to climate change economic stabilization iran and the middle east peace process sarkozy represents key actor in the fulfillment of our shared policy goals we will not always see eyetoeye and differences on key issues such as nonproliferation and disarmament which are seen as critical to french national interests are looming however though enhanced consultation including and perhaps especially at the highest levels i believe we can address these differences minimize unhelpful proposals and foster increased collaboration to better leverage french interests to fulfill ours france is likeminded country with major economy and the secondlargest deployed military and diplomatic forces in the world by striking the right note in our bilateral relationship we can leverage sarkozys strengths including his willingness to take stand on unpopular issues to be major contributor to us goals we must also recognize that sarkozy has an extraordinary degree of decisionmaking power which is vested in him alone as the french president in my opinion it will necessitqe periodic preqntial intervention to reassure sarkozy of our commitment as an ally and partner and in many cases to close the deal sarkozy will remain power to be reckoned with in france and significant driver of europe for the foreseeable future it is clearly in our interest to work hard to channel his energy and initiatives into constructive form of cooperation that enhances our ability to solve global issues together end comment rivkin
