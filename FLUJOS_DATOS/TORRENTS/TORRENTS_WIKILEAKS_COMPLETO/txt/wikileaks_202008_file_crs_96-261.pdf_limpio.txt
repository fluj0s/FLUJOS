leve ls types of programs and problems in implementation of us assi stance to other countries as defined by congress in the fr eedom support act nd the pr onouncem ents of two administrations among key objectives of us foreign policy toward russia are the promotion of democratic syst em and free market economy foreign assistance has been prominent tool of that policy many factors in the united states and russia have affected the course of the us program of assistance to russia in the united states there has been some expectation that the program would succeed quickly when that did not happen and russian government behavior did not meet expectations some sought to cut the program us budget pre ssures also have affected the russia program although russia has experienced much economic and political progress in relatively short time this has been accompanied by an certain political situation exacerbated by growing economic inequality nevertheless supporters of reform are reportedly emerging in all corners of russia and these appear very prounited states criticisms raised regarding the assistance program during its first years are being addressed by the administr ation interagency coordi nation has improved problem programs cut or eliminated reformers targeted and assi stance funds leveraged to bring in other donors large contract ors and grantees have improved their operations but some observers still feel that while small us organizations can best implement the program they are the most threatened by cuts the assistance program is seeking to engage all levels of private sector and democratic system development at th top to promote policy reform at the institutional level helping to strengthen government and private sector organizations and at the grassroots to help indivi dual businesses and ngos nongovernmental organizations in order to expedite the reform process and help them avoid mistakes major focus of assistance activity is the transfer of information to reformist russians who want to know how things are done elsewhere the budget for russia has gone from 13 billion in fy1994 to 341 million in fy1995 and an estimated 168 million in fy 1996 many programs are ending earlier than originally anticipated and new ones not starting up the consequences of such an abrupt decrease in funding are not clear with regard to russian development in general but some fear th at us objectives in the country will be retarded in 1994 the administration informed congress that technical assistance requests would largely end after the fy 1998 appropriation realizing that us interests regarding russia would also not nd at that point individuals in the state department have beg to ponder the shape of usrussian relations in the future and

us foreign assistance 1992 1996 this report written in 1996 provides hist orical background that may be useful to congress as it considers funding levels types of programs and problems in implementation of us assistance to other countries introduction four years have passed since the sovi et union dissolved into 12 separate nations during this time the russian federation the largest of these states geographically and demographi cally has figured most prominently in the minds of us decisionmakers for its continuing ar senal of nuclear w eapons and its current and perhaps more important potenti political economic and commercial role in the world determining that it was in the us interest to see democratic free market more nuclearsecure russia the united states initiated program of assistance to promote these objectives the 1992 fr eedom support act program funded annually out of the foreign operations ppropriations concentrated resources on the first two objectives1 much has changed since the program be gan and the issues of congressional concern have also changed at first congress debated the level of assistance appropriate for the region in general and russia in particular by 1994 with large sums having been appropriate d specifically for russia the tone of the debate shifted to two issues implementation of the program the pace of implementation effectiveness of activities and adequacy of coordination among us agencies and russian behavior both intern ationally and domestically now in 1996 new set of issues is begi nning to define itself for congressional consideration these issues result largel from the strong downward trend in funds for russia programs and from other intern ational and domestic events taking place in russia and the united states in the past three years allocations for russia from the nis new independent states account of the foreign oper ations appropriationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs2 2 russias continuing importance to the ited states has been asserted by numerous analysts and decisionmakers recently this wa s professed in series of speeches by vice president gore on october 13 17 and 19 1995 and by assistant secretary of defense for international security policy ashton cart er on june 20 1995 see also crs report 95 1126 russias future issues and options for us policy by jim nichol november 15 1995have gone from 13 billion in fy1994 to 341 million in fy1995 and an estimated 168 million in fy1996 administration offici als and some russia observers believe this declining funding may directly affect the achievement of us foreign policy goals in russia this report based in part on an extensive series of interviews and site visits conducted in russia from september 12 to october 2 1995 discusses the political and economic climate in which the assistance program is currently operating how earlier concerns regarding the implementation of the program have been dealt with the impact the program has had to date the effect of proposed budget cuts and earmarks and finally the long term future of the program the united states and russia the domestic and foreign policy context of the assistance program although all foreign aid is an instrument of foreign policy intended to meet us interests both short and long term the program of assistance in russia in the view of many is more strongly rooted in us policy priorities than similar programs undertaken in other countries since 1992 the united states has sought to be actively engaged in encouraging the transition of russia from one party socialist economy to democratic po litical and free market economic system in the freedom support act congress suggested th at the outcome of this transition was vital interest of both the united states and the international community2 in the debate leading to the freedom support act and in the language of the act itself congress stressed the threat to us national security interests that the assistance program would seek to overcome congress intended that the program be as much direct tool of foreign policy as possible it gave decisionmaking power over the program to an nis coordinator in th department of state not to the chief implementor of the program and traditiona l foreign aid arm of government the agency for international development usa id it provided waiver authority to allow the administration to ignore other constraints on traditional foreign aid programs in implementing the program for th nis and due to its pivotal foreign policy purpose the program has been more closely watched by congress than most other assistance programs the executive branch has shared this view in his early testimony on the program secretary of st ate baker noted that the freedom support act supported us efforts to build democratic peace in this regard he said it is every bit as much policyas legislative package stressing the policy objectives that the program sought to achieve he hoped that p eople would not look at this as foreignhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs3 3 testimony before the house foreign affairs committee april 30 1992 reuters transcriptaid bill because it is not foreign aid bill3 it was instead once in century opportunity to advance our national interests the clinton administration has continued to stress the specific foreign po licy objectives of the russia program but greatly increased the amount of resources devoted to that effort and upgraded its foreign policy importance an additional notch by associating it with the gore chernomyrdin commission process of ex panded cooperation and more recently strengthening the role of the state department while its distinctive and immediate foreign policy goals set it apart from other foreign aid programs there are aspects of the russia program that have served more traditional foreign policy purposes from th beginning the program was seen as an expression of support for broad events ta king place in the region and in 1993 the administrations request for 18 billion ru ssian assistance package was described as specific demonstration of support fo r yeltsin the program like assistance programs elsewhere has also served s hortterm objectives program offering apartments to former russian officers for example reportedly encouraged the withdrawal of russian troops from the baltic states by august 1994 but in the main the program has sought to facilitate the move toward democracy and free market economy the ccess of that effort depends in part on the way in which the program is implemented in the field but it also depends on political and economic developments em anating from both russia and the united states us context although it is tied closely to us fo reign policy objectives the assistance program has come under periodi c challenge and now appears headed toward an early end without any close reconsideration of those objectives number of factors have contributed to this turn of events one has been the perhaps unrealistic expectation that the transformation of russia to free markets and democracy woul d be relatively smoot h and shortterm while administration figures repeatedly noted the difficulties the program faced they raised expectations by suggesting that the program might achieve its objectives by the turn of the century some doubt how ever that feasible aid programs can have more than marginal effects on nation of russias size and complexity further although there has been strong bipartisan support for the broad objectives of the program in the foreign policy community and among members of congress details of program implementation nd the behavior of the russi an government have drawn heavy criticism since the program was launched concerns regarding how the program wa s being carried out on the ground in its first three years its speed coordinati on impact and the like have seriouslyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs4 4 these concerns are discussed in detail in crs report 95170 the former soviet union and us foreign aid implem enting the assistance program by curt tarnoff january 18 1995 5 russia activities have received major portion of freedom support act funding in absolute terms accounting for 54 of fy199293 61 of fy 1994 42 of fy1995 funds and expected to receive about 25 of fy1996 funding russi is

1996affected current attitudes4 some of the criticisms now appear unfounded and some derived from misunderstood accountability nd legislative requirements some concerns were clearly leg itimate and needed attention since great many people had personal or professiona l interest in this program among them potential contractors nongovernmental organiza tions and russia experts there were diverse and contradictory expectations of what s ectors and projects it should emphasize and what it should ignore the unique level of attention paid to the russia program heightened the sound of critical voices and created the impression still difficult to mend that it was failure and mess disappointment of early expectations by some observers that its economic and political transformation might mean compliant russia has probably helped undermine support for the assistance program while usrussian relations are significant improvement on the soviet era certain russian government domestic and international policies have caused some members of congress to question the programs emphasis on russia to the excl usion in their view of other nis countries5 in addition many members of congress continued to associate it negatively with other foreign aid efforts as giveaway program suggesting to many that cash was being transferred di rectly to the russian government the perception that the russian government was the chief beneficiary was exacerbated in late 1994 by growing disgr untlement over the chechnya situation and the potential sale of nuclear energy facilities to iran in the 1995 debate on both the fy1996 foreign aid authorization and appropr iations bills some members sought to cut off aid unless russia changed its policie s in these and other areas defenders of the program including the administration pointed out that us aid levels were hardly enough to compensate for profits lost from the iran sale they further argued that little of the assistance actually went to the russian government but instead to reformist elements whom it remained in the us interest to support the deficit reduction prior ities of the 104th congress combined with the above perceptions contributed to the cuts in the russia program in the fy1996 foreign aid appropriations bill as congress take s up fy1997 appropria tion debate it faces new concerns the december 1995 parlia mentary election saw resurgence in communist support that suggests the possib ility of communist victory in the june 1996 presidential election subsequent an tireformist moves by president yeltsin have further exacerbated concerns some suggest it is not now clear that it is in the us interest to help russia become economically strong6 this argument seems to caution that russias antireformist course is the most likely outcome with orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs5 without aid others believe this may ignore the complexity of the change going on at every level of government and society russian context number of features of modern russia mig ht be seen to bear on the shape and conduct of the us assistance program there is both good news and bad news what seems certain is that the country is in flux it is mass of contrasts and contradictions and clear pattern has emerged from wh ich us policymakers and analysts of any stripe can take comfort on the positive side the pace of russia s transformation is stunning tens of thousands of businesses have been privatized and new ones established inflation has fallen from 2600 in 1992 to 131 in 1995 following years of negative growth the imf predicts gdp growth of between 22 and 4 in 1996 and perhaps more than 6 in 1997 certainly visual impressi ons of moscow support the predictions during the past two years moscow has re made itself there are now supermarkets restaurants attractive shop display windows and construction ev erywhere middle class is being established russia has dopted constitution that provides protections for individual rights and s held several free and fair elections whatever the changing composition of executive or legisl ative branches adoption of reforms has continued to advance although in some what wobbly course these are remarkable developments given the distance the country has had to come since 1991 growth however has not occurred evenly either in geographic sense or for all income levels to an american observer ekaterinburg in the urals appears perhaps two years behind moscow and novosib irsk in western siberia appears stuck in the soviet era some of the contrast is attributable to the presence or absence of reformist elements in different legislat ures and city governments throughout the country an underfunded and mismanaged social safety net has contributed to an ever widening gap between rich and poor but new opportunities for innovative and creative capitalists as well as for selfaggr andizing politicians ar also responsible further economic progress is hostage to the uncertain out come of national elections while past experience indicates that even nationalist or communist political figures may support limited reformist agenda the unpredictability of the political situation works against broad economic progress economic success might suggest more positive political outcome but perhaps the chief beneficiaries of the transition to free markets are the new generation of entrepre neurs great many under 35 years of age however this group is notoriously cyni cal about politics and many are thought not to have voted in the december 1995 electi on that saw great advances for communist and nationalist forces russian views regarding the united states have been as varied and contradictory as the twists and turns of their economic and political affairs these past few years one encounters business and government fi gures at all levels who voice the desire for us investment the germans are here the dutch are here why dont the americans come parliamentary staff at the national level as well as local city government officials express strong desire to see the assistance program evolve into higher level of mutual cooperation between the two c ountries in wide range of sectors respect for the united states is embodied in their strongly expressed interesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs6 7 for broad list of activities funded from all sources and managed by all us government agencies see gao report former soviet union information on us bilateral program continuedin learning from american experience in all areas where reform is being initiated on the other hand one encounters consider able cynicism about the western effort to help russia during its difficult time of transition some individuals suggest that the aim of all us activities in russia is to undermine the russian economy and make it dependent on us bus iness businessmen and other private sector leaders however seem consistently favorable to reform and the united states major challenge for the us assistance program has been to work within this uncertain everchanging landscape im plementors of the program have had to identify the reformers in each sector and determine where assistance might most effectively be used although american s and even russians ask whether the aid effort is invisible nationalist sensitivities prevent the united states from advertising its presence too broadly despite the difficulties inherent in the russian scene however the us assistance program as disc ussed in part three of this report has managed to craft numerous poi nts of cooperation with russi ans at all levels of the public and private sector and in all parts of the country assistance program implementation issues as noted above number of concerns nd criticisms of the assistance program have been raised since its inception january 1995 crs report the former soviet union and us foreign aid implementing the assistance program crs report 95 170f reviewed these issues and conclude d that while many of the criticisms longer held true for the program there remained issues that congress might wish to track carefully in order to insure well implemented and successful program these issues included the extent to which programs were implemented rapidly reached the grassroots advanced priv atization fostered agency and project coordination produced visible results were subjected to regular evaluations terminated bad projects targeted reformers and leverage d private sector funds many of these concerns are updated and discussed in this and the following section speed of implementation perhaps the most important criticism of the program in its first years was that it was slow in getting activities on the ground visitors in 1993 found dearth of projects in russia and as late as ap ril 1994 house leaders richard gephardt and robert michel found the program slow in delivery and lacking intensity but the september 1994 bipartisan delegation led by senator patrick leahy returned with quite different picture it found the program in full operation and visit one year later supports that judgment there is now wealth of activities underway and hundreds of organizations contractor s grantees ngos nongovernmental organizations and russian indigenous groups funded in some way by the nis account with funding on the decline the program has apparently hit its peak and the number of project activities can be ex pected to decrease noticeably during 19967httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs7 7 continued funding december 1995

on coordination of us assistance and economic cooperation programs december 1995 gaonsiad96 16 9 much of the infighting was between usaid and other agencies to which it transferred funds as directed by the coordinators office without necessarily transferring responsibility for accounting for use of those funds as usaid source noted early on there were questions as to the level of usaids accountability for the use of these funds this still remains problem in few cases where the other agency and usaid actually participate jointly in activities and where other usaid contractors are also involved eg epa work on environmental problems treasury work in the tax reform area however in other cases it has been determined that usaid is not ac countable doe work in nuclear safety tda feasibility studies docs american business center program performance of the enterprise funds this has led to satis factory from usaids point of view delineation of relative responsibilities but may not be cont ributing to the most effective russia program overallcoordination and strategy there are two key players under the freedom support act program usaid and the state department foreign opera tions funds are appropriated to usaid which transfers some of the money to other agencies but has maintained responsibility for 85 of the program the state department through its nis coordinator has been responsible for overa ll design direction nd oversight of the program but more than 20 us agenci are in some way involved in program implementation some using their own budget funds in addition to those supplied under the foreign operations nis account most of the early coordination cerns for program implemented by numerous agencies are largely resolved8 in sum the few apparent activities and the quite apparent bureaucratic infighting had led to criticisms regarding lack of leadership and direction in the program proliferation of activities and the more regularized drawing of agency respons ibilities over time suggest that the nis coordinator in the department of stat ambassador thomas simons had the problem in hand by mid19949 however the original expression of congressional concern ultimately led after prolonged talent search to his replacement in march 1995 richard morningstar former vice president of the overseas private investment corporation and businessman arrived with different perspective and with expanded authority as an adviser to the president and mandate that includes the department of defenses nunnlugar program he initiated topdown review that included putting holds on all obligations he considered questionable until they could be justified coming late in the fi scal year the holds created added pressure and paperwork for usaid staff nd slowed its obligation rate httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs8 10 the g7 are the seven most powerful industria l countries which meet annually to discuss economic and political issues with different leadership styles both coordinators have shaped the program through their authority over the pursestrings as such the coordinator is the final arbiter of interagency disputes these di sputes may well increase as funding levels decline and difficult decisions regarding priorities are made the topdown review was beginning of such process in the field an early response to coor dination concerns was the appointment in september 1994 of an assistant to the am bassador susan johnson to head newly setup ambassadors assistance unit aau her primary role is to track monitor and assess us programs on be half of us ambassador to russia pickering in the summer of 1995 she began to provide assistan ce to the coordinator as well starting informally with the topdown review during her tenure she has attempted to facilitate bottom up coordination there is h eadsofagency meeting in moscow twice month she has also developed relationships with the three consulates general in russia st petersburg ekater inburg and vladivostok and uses them to facilitate coordination in the field each of these has monthly meetings to brief and debrief contractors and grantees an ever shifting series of issues captures the attention of both the aau in moscow and the nis coordinator in wa shington for which specific disagreements between players must be sorted out for example usia and the embassy economics section raised the political sensitivity of usaid proposed public education project on economic reform th at would be run by first deputy prime minister chubais press representative the aau arranged meeting of all concerned that reporte dly led to reworking of the project both the aau and the coordinators offi ce have recently been examining the division of labor between usaid and usia in their respective conduct of training and exchange programs both types of programs are sometimes subtly different but their targeted recipi ents at times overlap the goal is to avoid redundancy and use more efficiently the greatly reduced f unds available for these activities usia exchanges already complement usaid project activities to some extent they can be used to support economic nd democratic reform by brin ging appropriate officials and private sector individuals to the unite d states for focused tours and educational programs targeting of usia exchanges to support usaid project objectives could likely be increased the role of the support implementation group sig has also been an interest of state and the embassy the sig was established by the g7 to help them coordinate bilateral assi stance programs for russia10 while it has served as forum for exchange of information some questi on whether there have been any concrete results increasingly both the embassy and the state department are turning their attention to the future of usrussian re lations in the long term and what kind of programs and the financial re sources to support them will be needed this issue is discussed in the last section of this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs9 the purpose of state department coordination is to better accomplish the objectives of us foreign policy in russia to that end the coordinators office developed written strategy which was approved in ma 1994 it has evolved as circumstances change but the assistance program continues to reflect focus on the two key objectives firs t enunciated in the freedom support act the establishment of democratic institutions and free market economy there is ample evidence that individual projects are not pproved unless they f it within the overall strategy and most projects can be said to contribute to the two main objectives even programs in the health environment ergy and housing sectors some the result of congressional or other political pressures are molded so that they feed into the two strategic goals as the largest agency implementor usaid continues to play major role in shaping the strategy and the program the state department the embassy usaidwashington the bureau for europe and the nis and the usaid mission in moscow are all attuned to different features of the assistance landscape usaidmoscow in particular is dealing with the nitty gritty of developing projects and working perhaps most closely with the russian beneficiaries all four appear to have significant input in most programma tic decisions some observers find their disagreements messy but if properly coor dinated their diverse range of views can strengthen the quality of implementation and results current evidence suggests that this is what is happening effectiveness there are numerous elements explicit and implicit in the us assistance strategy that seek to make the program more effective chief among these are getting implementors to work together targeting reformers terminating bad programs and leveraging private sector funds working together while state coordinates nd shapes the program at the level of us government agencies and programs usaid coordinates the activities of hundreds of project contractors and gr antees under its broad program each month heads of democracy projects meet at the usaid mission in moscow to exchange information implementors re port that they are being encouraged by usaid to find ways to work together for example every month all of the rule of law implementing organizations in mo scow meet without usaid and try to coordinate activities from observations made in 1995 it appears that implementors outside moscow are substantially better informed regarding other assistance activities that might facilitate their own than d been the case in 1993 entrepreneurial centers established in number of cities draw on the expertise and programs offered by other us organizations working to he lp the indigenous and us private sectors russian businessmen are informed about relevant opportunities at these centers targeting reformers seeking to promote profound economic and political change in russia the program has been hi ghly responsive to re formist tendencies in both central and local government one r eason that the program was slow to get underway was dearth of identifiable re formers in many sectors early on therefore when then minister for privatization chubais and the privatization agency gki requested assistance usaid heavily supported its activ ities to privatizehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs10 11 in numerous interviews contractors and grante generally praised their relationships with aid mission staff but expressed di smay that their projects were rarely if ever visited gao report assessment of selected usaid projects in russia gaonsiad95156 august 1995 also suggested inadequate usaid monitoring however in spite of existing and growing constraints on administrative fundi ng and personnel levels in russia there is evidence that the mission is at least closely fo llowing priority issues and problem areas as noted in this section 12 12 there are other more generic potential pr oblems with enterprise funds especially the conflict between their developmental purpose and profitmaking mandate also many argue that if business is economically viable particularly the mediumsized businesses continuedbusiness and it continues to devote re sources there the united states now underwrites the development of legal financial market tax and other reforms these efforts are discussed in the following section in the hinterlands the assistance progra m has ferreted out reformist oblast and city governments pilot demonstration projects such as an effort to test new health care systems and financing arrangements and housing reform are being conducted in select towns receptive to new approaches in the expectation that success at one level will be translated more broadly to some extent however there has been disconnect between the emer gence of reformers and th availability of funding now as more institutions are coming to understand the need to reform it appears that the funding to help them do so has begun to disappear program quality control one sign of well monitored and evaluated program is the extent to which inade quate programs are revised and bad ones terminated despite an apparent insufficiency of usaid staff for tracking projects in the field there is substantially more evidence of this process now than one or two years ago11 among projects found wanting was the h ealth care financing project usaid was unhappy with the speed of implementa tion was dissatisfied with the workplan and did not respect the project manage r consequently usaid forced his replacement trimmed back the project cutting funding from 26 million to 193 million and focused the progra m on one region siberia in the spring of 1995 the nis coordinator combined the russianamerican enterprise fund with the fund for large enterprises in russia the russian american fund had once been called an unde monstrated ccess by the us ambassador because it had only one loan to show in its first oneandahalf years of existence the fund for large enterpri ses was likewise unimp ressive it had only three investments one of which was joint venture with caterpillar and another with pepsi cola the new entity the us russia investment fund tusrif has reduced overhead and appears to be making greater effort to locate appropriate investments by sending staff into the field to seek out new businesses and by working with the business service centers nevertheless to some it remains an example of poor quality control because of its status independent of nor mal us government accountability requirements12httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs11 12 continued targeted by these funds private investment w ould occur they argue that tusrif diverts assistance money that would be better employed creating the environment for private sector investment supporting policy reforms and small business development and training see crs report 9627f enterprise funds overview and issues of concern by mary reintsma and curt tarnoff january 3 1996 for further discussionthere is ample evidence of continuous reworking of the assistance program reassessment of priorities and efforts to mold the program to meet core objectives for instance in its first incarnation usaid program to help emerging ngos the nuts and bolts of democratic societies focused on essentials getting some up and running through partnerships with u s ngos followon project now focuses on helping ngos advocate their views to gove rnment as well as raise funds from the private sector to make them sustainable it concentrates on ngos with potential to have an impact on economic and democratic reform congressionally mandate d rescissions cancellation of previously appropriated funds for the russia program in fy1995 have been taken in part from slowmoving programs such as the commodity import program cip and the pharmaceutical production program some questionable activitie s have been terminated entirely such as the russian social conversion project roscon an effort at social marketing of the economic reform program certainly there remain questionable or problematic activities as with all projects some will have defenders some critics for instance some think the morozov project which franchises business education to institutes of education throughout russia may be stre tched too thin that there are insufficient funds to pay for study materials and equipment and as result quality suffers some suggest that the commerce departments american bu siness centers set up to assist us businesses seeking to invest or trade in russia are not likely to succeed as self financing entities in some of the less frequented locations but more important issue is that their presence and name seem to confuse russians who are often turned away when they go for help this contributes to the russian notion that the united states is only out to help itself after taking an extremely long time to get underway the ardchecchi rule of law project may not be well focused or perhaps suffers because the indigenous desire to reform the judicial sector has arrived too late for us funding availability to have an impact some projects still suffer from delays in the provision of equipment the commodity import program the epa program in nizhny tagil the business support centers and the moroz ov project to name few and some question priorities should bus iness assistance for instance rely on seminars geared to tens or hundreds of attendees or should f unds be used more for direct and pertinent business advice to dozen entreprene urs or even single businesses leveraging funds from the start policymak ers believed that funding from the us government program alone would be inadequate to achieve the objectives they sought private sector and othe r donor organizations particularly the international monetary fund

resources to have major impact on russias economic and social system some wonder if its activities can fully compensate for programs geared toward meeting us po licy objectives and providing us point of view implementors some controversy has existed over which entities could better implement the assistance program on behalf of the us government16 some argued for small organizations versus large ones and p vos private voluntary organizations or ngos versus forprofits the distinctions between these categories are too blurry to track precisely all have their share of ccesses as well as incidents of delay and poor leadership however some of the rger organizations including both non and forprofits have drawn attention because they won sizable contracts to undertake significant portions of the assistance program yet they had particularly hard time getting their programs underway and ther efore may have wasted funds in the process critics suggest one reason for th problems these programs encountered was their lack of previous russia experience and failure to utilize russian nationals since these charges were originally made it would appear that usaid has moved more funding to smaller organiza tions although designation as pvo or ngo is not precise reflection of size usaid statistics do indicate that in fy1994 6 of obligations went to such orga nizations while they accounted for 16 of fy1995 obligations17 supporters of small or ganizations however remain concerned that future budget cuts will affect the small organizations disproportionately and are further concer ned that only limited mechanisms exist to fund small projects at the under 1 million ma rk for either for or nonprofit us organizations they argue that funds should be found perhaps shifted from large programs to support the proposals of small us organizations including support for us partnerships with indigenous russian groups with the advantage of hindsight small organizations should probably have been used more extensively in the first years of the program they have often done an outstanding job at relatively low cost and stories about th eir activities carry an almost visceral public relations appeal given the risks inherent in the assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs14 18 rather than direct funds through large orga nizations with excessive overhead costs and experience in these matters critics argued that it would have been more effective and efficient to funnel grants through umbr organizations like eurasia foundati on world learning longer funded and isar that were alr eady dedicated to the function of providing grants to ngos in russiaprogram one could take more chances w ith small amounts of money without fear of wasting alot however earlier concerns raised about large entities appear increasingly moot those with problems getting underway are now up and running there is much less of the flyin flyout mentality that disturbed russian recipients generally large programs have come to rely on longterm resident us citizens to manage their programs and act as liaisons with the ru ssian government shortterm technical assistance personnel supplement their work and respond to specific needs moreover longterm staff have now b een incountry long enough to develop considerably more knowledge about the count ry and sensitivity to russian recipients than before the vast majority of staff at all levels are russian nationals portions of their budgets are also subc ontracted out to smaller organizations including ngos18 further the downsizing that has occurred as result of budget cuts and program revisions has cut into some of the most criticized large implementor programs it could be argued that the size of the implementing organization has been of less importance to the quality of the pr oduct than has been failure of project conception at the outset large implementors initially were working with very broad and changing terms of reference where the project objectives have been fairly clear cut such as in privatization and economic reform projects the large contractors appear to have done well drawing on their strength of being able to provide top expertise quickly and saving usaid mana gement problems that might come from working with multiple small organizations where proj ects are not well thoughtout and agreed in advance between all parties or are dispersed over numerous activities the rule of law health reform and business assistance projects there are more instances of questionable activity which may have led to more usaid micromanagement rather than less impact of assistance program while critics were assailing the program during its first three years it was still too early to know whether the vast majority of programs were having any impact on us policy objectives now however with hundreds of projects on the ground many of them about two years old one can begin to assess their worth single project or group of projects can be said to decisively bring about democracy and free market economies in russia or anywhere else there are just too many variables exclusive of the projects themselves that can work to bring about these objectives or to thwart their achievement but one can discern albeithttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs15 somewhat subjectively how projects may or may not be contributing to the ultimate objectives several things can be said about the u s assistance program at this time one is that however disparate the program may appear most activities even many of those in the health environment and other sectors are mainly geared toward affecting adoption of demo cratic institutions and fr ee markets second the substantial influx of funds that came out of the fy 1993 supplemen talfy1994 appropriations has been used to move towards these objectives from all angles some activities will have more impact than others but for the short period of time that the surge in funds lasts the us assistance program has become dynamic program third many of these projects are contributing in small and large ways towards the two key us foreign policy objectiv it can be argued that the program might be strengthened that projects might be made more ffective but overall measurable progre ss is being made topdownbottomup strategy the methodology employed by the united states to encourage the desired ends in russia of democratic in stitutions and free market economy is essentially two pronged approach some projects seek to strengthen the institutions that make policy and help them to reform that policy meanwhile other projects target organizations and institutions at the grassroots level of society whose voices might impact the higher level institutions this approach is occurring in most of the sectors targeted by us assistance but it is most pronoun ced in the two areas of greatest resource concentration influencing the top has largely meant offering us technical expertise to lawmakers in the duma policymakers in the presidents administration and to lesser extent regional and cal government officials both of the national bodies have been seeking to rewrite the laws of the old order and establish rule of law to reflect the new system of government us officials and contractors have found reformminded russians to be interested pr imarily in learning from us and other country experiences both bad and good as th ey attempt to refo rm tax commercial criminal civil election and other laws at the grassroots level us programs respond to the russian desire for knowledge of how it is done elsewhere bu t there is also great deal of training activity and smallscale funding of charity business and public interest organizations most of which did not exis t under the soviet regime and which want to learn how to become sustainable and more effective at this level too individual businessmen and farmers are learning the ropes and seeking

set up small business loan window although many discrete s upport activities were active in the first years of the assistance program the business service centers and incubato rs noted above were set

form was being favored at its expense it is true that very broadly defined bout 18 of russia obligations through fy1995 have been dedicated to democratic initiatives and 73 went to facilitate economic ones22 but distinctions between the two categories are imprecise it can be argued that many of the activities that di rectly target business housing and health for instance are also building democracy by empowering individuals and associations further efforts to prom ote economic policy re form are conducted in manner that fosters democratic coope ration between the russian executive and legislature23 helping to formulate commercial law contributes as much to the rule of law socalled democratic initiative as does efforts on behalf of criminal law although not reliable gauge at leadership levels at the grassr oots level supporters of economic reform probably overlap with those who support democratic institutions while there are also distinct limitations on the ability of the united states to openly promote democracy in russia without rubbing up against russian nationalist sensitivities and creating backlash great many programs are currently being implemented that might be called democracystrengthening despite concerns regarding the ability of russian grassroots public interest organizations to absorb largescale assistance many observers believe there is still room to

first few years of the program are being addressed while th program may never satisfy critics it appears to be effectively contributing to key us foreign policy objectives as set forth by congress in the freedom support act in the past year congress has focused considerable criticism on policy decisions of the russian government especially the military effort to put down the chechnya secession movement and the plan to sell nuclear power plan t technology to iran the negative mood regarding russian behavior during consideration of the fy1996 bill contributed to adoption of language in the house that would have placed 195 million cap on assistance to russia significant decrease from previous years although the final bill eliminated this cap it contains earmarks for countries other than russia that leave fewer funds av ailable to russia than the house cap congress of course often expresses its views and priorities through its power over the appropriations process concerns regarding what was perceived by some influential members as toostrong emphasis on russia relative to other nis countries especially arising fro m the fy1993fy1994 22 billion appropriation much of which was intended for russia had earlier led c ongress to introduce country earmarks to the nis account earm arking by sector and project is not unusual and both practices grew markedly in the fy1996 bill it

r the nis account was 788 million for fy1996 its request for the whole nis was in actuality more than 936 million as it sought to curtail the practice of funding the activities of many u s government agencies out of the foreign operations account by having the agencies reque st funds for their nis programs out of their own budgets as all these other agencies especially usia and commerce were ultimately cut in fy1996 it is doubtful that their funds will be used for the nis in the case of the energy department however the administra tions 231 million request for nuclear reactor safety was cut to 77 million the shortfall will be made up by the nis account house and senate reports both supported continued funding of peace corps activities through the nis accountgovernment or register us dissatisfaction with events in russia they will also have consequences for the beneficiaries of us assistance and the foreign policy objectives that the assistance program has been trying to meet further the administration has contended since 1994 that the technical assistance program for russia would end with the fy1998 appropria tions but this raises the question of what kind of relationship the united states may seek with russia after the year 2000 when these funds will be exhausted these issues are discussed below impact of budget cuts the level of funding available for russi has fallen substan tially during the past two years the amount the administration sought for fy1995 was 3855 million in the end 3407 million was allocated for fy1996 the administration requested 260 million the russia program is now expected to receive roughly 168 million27 this means that most of the current programs are living off of the singular surge infunding that occurred in fy1994 when 13 billion was made available to fund russia activities it is expected that most of that money will be exhausted by mid 1996 the consequences of these cuts are manifold it appears that new activities are not being initiated many exis ting programs will soon be rminated and the rest will be reduced for example usaid ready has ended ne w involvements in agriculture it expects to end its pharmaceutical security and health information programs when current funding lapses it will terminate postpr ivatization assistance to individual firms and reduce support fo r land and capital markets new business development and policy legal and regulatory reform usaid also anticipates that rule of law activities including support for the judicial system will be cut support for new ngos and exchanges and training are likely to be reduced the housing reform program will also be cut subs tantially from the original fy1996 proposed level the only proposed increase for fy1996 appears to be in the area of financial sector reform although at lower leve ls than anticipated by usaid there is some logic to the usaid choice of targets for reductions some usaid and state officials have indicated that as much as possible they believe thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs24 28 28 there are many examples of programs di sparaged by usaid and state officers as not useful to key us policy objectives one is the title v iii program which f unds us academic research on the nis continued funding for which was recommended by both house and senate appropriations committees in their fy1996 funding bill the senate suggested at least 75 million another is the new transcaucasus enterprise fund 15 million for which was provided in the fy1996 bill as other enterprise funds have taken more than year before the first investments are made some observers have asked if most of this money could not be better utilized elsewhere third example is the 20 million intended for hospital partnerships and infectious diseases in the fy1996 bill which like the oftencited fy1995 15 million for family planni ng supports benign and useful activities however these are not viewed by many of those interviewed for this paper as the top priorities of program longer flush with fundsprojects which do not directly support mocratic and economic reform should be eliminated first not everyone including those at state would agree with usaids priorities however congre ssional sector and project earmarks and support for such programs as hospital partnerships and ex changes and the vicepresidents personal support for environmental programs for in stance might protect those programs this would force usaid and state to cu t other programs which one or both might consider more essential to meeting key us objectives28 in one case an earlier funding commitment could severely constrain flexibility of the russia program the two predecesso rs to the usrussia investment fund established when there were plenty of funds available were both slow to get investments off the ground of the tota l 440 million capitalization for the combined funds only 90 million had been committed by january 1996 the socalled mortgage capitalization amount still owed the fund is 280 million although there is an understanding that the administration will supply the needed amounts as the fund makes investments if promised monies were to be paid out between now and fy1998 there would be little left for other russia activ ities usaid has suggested that the fund change its practices and become guarantor as well as supplier of equity allowing the us government to appropriate less for the fund the subsidy amount and still meet the earlier commitment but there are other broader consequences resulting from greatly reduced funding

restructurin g and privatization cuts prevent largescale help usaid will stop its oil and gas activities and focus on electrical generation it will work in two regions rather than the four planned and will get companies in the electric sector to pay for some assistance themselves cuts also have an impact on the rela tionship between russians and the united states for many russians the program is viewed as statement of usrussian cooperation and goodwill they may see the contraction of the program as somewhat threatening to that new relationship that began with the end of the cold war reformers

yet have develope d usaid officials expect that the business support centers in active commercial locales such as petersburg ekaterinburg and vladivostok will be able to recover 40 of thei r local costs this year the bankers training program requires participating banks to contribute 20000 nevertheless it may end up short of the number of shareholder banks it needs to sustain its operations when us funding ends in mid1996formulated the ngo community is still in its infancy the assistance program at least opened russians ears to american advice and counsel on these issues and created linkages between american specialists and russians that could lead to future cooperation though russias transition w ill likely continue there are those who argue that to disengage abruptly might have severe consequences for russias future and usrussian relations the budget cuts in the russia progra m have left the admin istration with some choices regarding priorities within congressional project earmarks it must decide what programs contribute most toward foreign policy objectives ultimately the trend is to end the whole program sooner than expected so usaid officials are seeking to phase the program out in the most efficient manner this means finding ways to hand projects over to world bank or other donor funding where possible to end participation with the l east alienation of russian c ounterparts and to finalize projects where goals might be near completion29 the cuts force the administration to choos its policy priorities and they raise two issues for congress as well regarding the immediate future first are funding levels for the russia program sufficient to meet the objectives set by congress of facilitating the economic and political transition of russia whether the decline in funding is consequence of budget prior ities or an expression of discouragement with the russian government it seems clear that congress is downsizing the program for reasons not directly related to whethe r the core objectives are being achieved second are the broad policy parameters established by congress in the authorizing language of the freedom suppor t act being served or frustrated by the inclusion of earmarks in appropriati ons language the fy1996 appropriations debate suggests some dispar ity of views here while the house foreign operations appropriations bill contai ned few earmarks the only country earmark 195 million ceiling for russia was added on the floor the senate bill contained many funding directives most of which were adopted by the conference report in deliberating the fy1997 budget congress will again have to decide how much flexibility to give the administration in determining how to meet priorities and how much to specify in country allocations and projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs26 30 this was more likely an effort to convince congress that the program was limited in cost and would not go on forever rather than based on rigorous analysis of what it would take to accomplish us objectives what kind of program after fy1998 although the administration did not antic ipate the dramatic cuts in funding levels that congress imposed subsequent to the fy1994 appropriations surge it has maintained since 1994 that fy1998 would be the last year it would seek economic transition funds ie the technical assi stance program would end by the year 200030 one would suggest that this means us objectives in russia will be fully met by then or that there will longer be role for some of the activities currently being funded out of the nis account the united st ates will continue to have interests in russia for decades to come as it has in decades past the question asked now in state department and other ci rcles is what will us interests be after fy1998 and what kind of activities would support those in terests that the united states will wish to fund this discussion regarding the b aseline program is just beginning but is likely to be joined by members of congress in the near future the appeal of declaring an end date to us assistance in russia notwithstanding some would argue that efforts to encourage democracy and free markets even at greatly reduced fundi ng levels should be continued after fy1998 however trying to define base line program for russia highlights the fact that the program has not been solely bout democracy and free markets there is another longer term foreig n policy objective cooperation currently the united states has vari ety of cooperation programs that it conducts with other countries including t hose in western europe while many of these are funded from state department and usia appropriations others scientific and technical exchanges for instance are conducted out of individual agency budgets few of these have been considered foreign aid several elements of the current nis account including the usia exchange programs are s imilarly aimed at goodwill and cooperation many of the russia assistance progra m efforts have had the effect of establishing cooperative ties that the ited states might or might not wish to continue after the assistance program s effectively ended whereas the united states had somewhat restrict ed relations with noncentral government entities in the soviet union the assistance progra m for russia has opened doors to local governments citizens groups scientific and business organizations and the like throughout the country some would argue that maintaining relations with these groups is in the longterm interest of the united states the importance of such relations to us longrange interests may be heightened by the fact that the russian road to democracy and free market economy is not going to be smooth nor even as these objec tives are met is it at all guaranteed that usrussian relations will be warm and friendly httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96261crs27 31 as this report went to press the admini stration issued its fy1997 international affairs budget request with the nis request straightlined at the fy1996 level the request for russia is 173 million versus an estimated 168 million in fy1996the baseline program would ideally deri ve from serious evaluation of the possibilities and permutations of future usrussian relations and weighing of the uses of us assistance funds for their valu in shaping that future still in an early stage of formulation baseline program propos als from officials at state the embassy in moscow and usaid currently share so common features there is general agreement among these executiv branch participants that total annual funding for russia should be in th 50 million to 100 million range in the post fy1998 era the thinking appears to be that this range may be acceptable to congress in budget terms it may not be reflection of critical estimate of us objectives there is some agreement that the baseline progra m should include exchanges trade and investment activities tda opic and eximbank and variety of grassroots volunteer activities some suggest that nuclear reactor safety and nunnlugar non proliferation activities are also both strongly in the us national interest and should be maintained the administration has not sought fro m congress its thoughts and approval of baseline program with the fy1997 foreig n aid request that will be presented in the near future and debated in the coming months congress will have the opportunity to address both the future of the us foreign assistance program in russia as well as the longer term character of usrussian relations31
