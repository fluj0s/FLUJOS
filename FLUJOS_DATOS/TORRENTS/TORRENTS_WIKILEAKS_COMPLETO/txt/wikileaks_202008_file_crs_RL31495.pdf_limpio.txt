to the treaty is the iccs possible assertion of ju risdiction over us soldiers charged with war crimes resulting from legitimate uses of force and perhaps over civilian policymakers even if the united states does not ratify the rome statute the united states sought to exempt us soldiers nd employees from the jurisdiction of the icc based on the unique position the united states occupies with regard to international peacekeeping18 on june 30 2002 the united states threaten ed to veto draft resolution to extend the peacekeeping mission in bosnia because the members of the security council refused to add guarantee of full immunity for us personnel from the jurisdiction of the icc move that provoked strong opposition from icc supporters concerned with the viability of that institu tion and that also raised some concerns about the future of united nations peacekeeping19 ultimately however the security council and the us delegation were ab to reach compromise and adopted unanimously resolution requesting the icc defer for an initial period of one year any prosecution of persons participating in peacekeeping efforts who are nationals of states not parties to the icc20 the compromise reached by the security council did not provide permanent immunity for us soldiers and officials from prosecution by the icc rather it invoked article 16 of the rome statute21 to defer potential prosecutions for one year some states parties to the rome statute and other supporters have argued that article 16 was meant onl to apply to specific cases and was not intended to per mit blanket waiver for citiz ens of specific country the security council adopted another resolution extending the deferral to july 1 200422 however during the summer of 2004 opposition to extending the deferral through 2005

of prosecution by the icc it is argued could impede the united states in carrying out military operations and foreign policy programs impinging on the sovereignty of the united states detractor s of the us position depict the objection as reluctance on the part of the united states to be held accountable for gross human rights violations or to the standa rd established for the rest of the world below in bold type are summarized some of the main objections voiced by us officials and other critics of the rome statute each objection is followed by the counterpositions likely to be voiced by

current debate and not to provide an ex haustive analysis of the issues24 none of the statements in the section below should be interpreted to represent the view of crs since crs does not take positions on policy issues issue 1 jurisdiction over nationals of nonparties only nations that ratify treaties are bound to observe them the icc purports to subject to its jurisdiction citizens of nonparty nations thus binding non party nations25 icc supporters may argue that the icc has jurisdiction over persons not nations nonparty states are not obligated to do anything under the treaty therefore the rome statute doe s not purport to bind nonparties although nonparty states may cooperate or defend their own interest s that may be affected by pending case icc opponents however ma point out that if individuals are charged for conduct related to carrying out official policy the difference between asserting jurisdiction over i ndividuals and over the nati on itself becomes less

delegating national criminal jurisdiction to another tribunal international or national without consent of the affected states except in the aftermath of international belligerency some observers however note that one of the reasons for constituting an international criminal court was to do away with the need for m ilitary conquest prior to prosecuting war crimes in the hope of elimin ating the perception of victors justice 29 rome statute supra note 2 art 12 see generally crs report rl31437 international criminal court overview and selected legal issues by jennifer elsea at 2126 summarizing jurisdictional requirements there is consent requirement in cases referred by the security councilafter all it is arguably the policy deci sion and not the individual conduct that is actually at issue the threat of prosecu tion however could inhibit the conduct of us officials in implementing us foreign policy in this way it is argued the icc may be seen to infringe us sovereignty some icc supporters have sserted that the crimes cove red by the rome statute are already prohibited under in ternational law either by treaty or under the concept of universal jurisdiction or both therefore all nations may assert jurisdiction to try persons for these crimes the icc they argue would merely be exercising the collective jurisdiction of its members any of which could independently assert jurisdiction over the accused persons under th eory of universal jurisdiction the nuremberg trials serve as an example of such collective jurisdiction27 i c c opponents may note that the existence of uni versal jurisdiction has been disputed by some academics who argue that actual state practice does not provide as much support for the concept as many icc supporters may claim28 however icc supporters note the rome statute does not rely entirely on universal jurisdiction certain preconditions to jurisdiction must be met including the consent of either the state on whose territory the crime occurred or the state of nationality of the accused29 the united states is already party to most of the treaties that form the basis for the definitions of crimes in the rome statute meaning us citizens are already subject to the prohibitions for which the icc will have jurisdiction icc supporters may further argue that if the icc could not assert jurisdiction over nonparty states socalle d rogue regimes could in sulate themselves from the reach of the icc simply by not ratifying the rome statute the purpose for creating the icc would be subverted the united st ates had proposed to resolve this problem by creating mandatory role for the security council in deciding when the icc should assert jurisdiction but the majority of other countries refused to adopt such rule on the stated grounds that it w ould mirror the uneven prosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity under the present system of ad hoc tribunalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31495crs7 30

id at 9 the prosecutor also seemed satisfi ed with us efforts to investigate and prosecute possible war crimes in light of the conclusion reached on gravity it was unnecessary to reach conclusion on complementarity it may be observed however that the office also collected information on national proceedings including commentaries from various sources and that national proceedings had been initiated with respect to each of the relevant incidents idissue 2 politicized prosecution the iccs flaws may allow it to be used by some countries to bring trumpedup charges against american citizens who due to the prominent role played by the united states in world affairs may have greater exposure to such charges than citizens of other nations30 icc supporters argue that the principle of complementarity will ensure that the icc does not take jurisdiction over case involving an american citizen unless th united states is unwilling or unable genuinely to investigate the allegations itself scenario some argue is virtually unthinkable some also take exception to the notion that americans are more likely to be targeted for prosecution although ma ny other countries that participate in peacekeeping operations for ex ample are willing to subj ect their soldiers and officials to the jurisdiction of the icc many us opponents of the icc express concern that the icc will be able to s econdguess valid termination by us prosecutors to terminate an investigation or decline to prosecute person it is not uncommon for unfriendly countries to char acterize us foreign policy decisions as criminal the icc could provide foru m for such charges some icc supporters dispute the likelihood of such an occurre nce and express confidence that unfounded charges would be dismissed recent determination by the iccs chief prosecutor seems to demonstrate reluctance to launch an investigation agai nst the united states based on allegations regarding its conduct in iraq on febr uary 9 2006 the chief prosecutor issued letter explaining his reasons for declining to launch an investigation despite multiple submissions by private groups urging action against the united states31 in addition to acknowledging the limits of the court s jurisdic tion whic h he noted precluded pursuing charges based on the legality of the decision to invade32 the prosecutor noted that the allegations about us nati onals behavior during the iraq occupation were of different order than the number of victims found in ot her situations under investigation and c oncluded that the allegations were of insufficient gravity to warrant an investigation33 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31495crs8 34 see grossman supra note 12 35 rome statute supra note 2 art 46 provides procedures for removing prosecutor who

prosecutor the office of the prosecutor an organ of the icc that is not controlled by any separate political authority has unchecked discretion to initiate cases which could lead to polit icized prosecutions34 icc supporters may counter that the icc statute does contain some restraints on the prosecutor including provision that the prosecutor must seek permission from pretrial chamber to carry out self initiated prosecution and provision for rem oval of the prosecutor by vote of the assembly of states parties35 the independence of the prosecutor it is argued is vital in order to ensure just results free from political control us negotiators at the rome conference had pressed for role for the security council to check possible overzealous prosecutors and prevent politicized prosecutions the majority of nations represen ted at the rome conference took the view that the security council with its structure nd permanent members would pose an even greater danger of politiciz ing icc prosecutions thereby guaranteeing impunity for some crimes while prosecuting others base d on the national inte rests of powerful nations issue 4 usurpation of the role of the security council the icc statute gives the icc the authority to define and punish the crime of aggression which is solely the prerogative of the security council of the united nations under the charter36 icc supporters may argue that all states parties will have the opportunity to vote on definition of aggression after the treaty has been in effect for seven years wh ich definition must comport with the charter thereby preserving the ro of the security council37 the icc under this view is merely providing forum for trying persons accused of committing aggression under internati onal law opponents of th icc however may argue that the lack of agreement among nations as to the definition of aggression suggests that any definition adopted only by major ity of member states of the icc may not be

inconsistent continuedforeign relations held hearings46 the same day the bill was introduced but did not report it prohibitions nd requirements the aspa prohibits cooperation with the icc by any

200350 section 2005 of the aspa restricts us participation in peacekeeping ope rations to missions where the president certifies us troops may par ticipate without risk of prosecution by the icc because the security council has permanently exem pted us personnel from prosecution for activity conducted as participants51 or because each other country in which us personnel will participate in the mission is either not party to the icc and does not consent to its jurisdiction or has entere d into an agreement in accordance with article 98 of the rome statute52 the latter option may not provide as muchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31495crs12 52 continued with finding 11 of section 2 which states that the united states will not be bound by any of the terms of the rome statute 53 article 98 appears to cover only persons sent by the government to the requested state on official business such as officials and m ilitary personnel and would not cover private citizens who are present in the requested state for reasons unrelated to official duty an agreement signed by state party to the i cc that promises not to surrender any other citizens of another state to the icc would appear to be covered by art 97 of the rome statute which requires the requested state to consult with the icc if honoring request for surrender to the icc would cause the requested state to breach its international obligations see infra note 113 54 see eg 22 usc 287be2b requiring as pa rt of an annual report to congress on activities information about possible authorization for peacekeeping

taiwan is also exempt under 2007 the president may designate other nations as major nonnato allies under 22 usc 2321k by notifying congress 30 days in advanceassurance as the first an article 98 agr eement would prevent the surrender of certain persons to the icc by parties to the article 98 agreement53 but would not bind the icc if it were to obtain custody of the accused through other means if the alleged crime is committed on the territory of state party to the rome statute the consent requirement for the jurisdiction of the icc would be met despite the existence of the article 98 agreement that country coul d however carry out its own investigation and invoke complementarity to preclude the iccs jurisdiction additionally the country that is the object of the peacek eeping mission may consent to the iccs jurisdiction over us participants for alleged crimes committed on its territory whether or not it is member of the icc the restriction may also be waived for peacekeeping missions where the president certifies that us participation is in the national interest of the united states the national interest qualification would appear to be the most easily met of the three waiver options whenever the united states uses its vote in the security council to approve peacekeeping operation the mission presumably is deemed to serve the national interest54 this section could conceiva bly be interpreted to suggest the president has the authority to co mmit us troops to participate in peacekeeping missions without the prior appr oval of congress the restriction does not apply to peacekeeping missions established prior to july 1 200355 restriction on provision of military assistance effective 1 july 2003 the aspa also prohibits military assistance

proceeding against us personnel present in such country the restriction does not appear to apply to any regional organizations that may receive military assistance the restrictions on military

waivers of sections 2005 and 2007 restriction on us participa tion in peacekeeping missions and prohibition on military assistance if the president certifies to congress that the icc has agreed not to seek to assert jurisdiction over any covered us or allied person with respect to actions undertaken by ch person in an official capacity this blanket waiver may be extende d for successive periods of one year if the icc abides by the agreement as described above section 2005 may be waived under its own terms with respect to specific peacekeeping missions if satisfactory protection can be achieved through security council m easures or by agreement with other participants or if the national interests of the united states justify participation in the mission61 section 2007 also contains its own waiver provision allowing the president to provide military assistance to particular country if he determines and reports to congress that it is in the national interest or that the country in question has entered into an agreement with the united states pursuant to article 98 of the rome statute preventing the international crimin court from proceeding against united states personnel present in such country62 nato and major nonnato allies are excepted from the prohibition in section 200763 if the icc enters into and abides by an agreement under sections 2003a or b section 2003c permits the president to waive sections 2004 and 2006 prohibiting cooperation with the icc nd directing the president to implement measures to prohibit the transfer of classified information with respect to specific cases before the icc to waive the prohibitions nd allow cooperation with the icc the president must first certify to congress that there is reason to believe the accused is guilty as charged it is in the national interest to waive the prohibitions and that the investigation and prosecution by the icc will not result in the investigation or arrest of any covered us or allie d persons with respect to any actions undertaken by them in an official capacity it is somewhat unclear what waiver of section 2006 would entail in that the section does not directly prohibit any action instead it directs the president to implement rules to prevent transfer of classified national security information and law enforcement information to the icc and to prevent indirect transfer of material relate d to matters under investigati on or prosecution by the icc to the united nations and i cc member countries unless ssurances are received from the recipient that such information will not be made available to the icc waiverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31495crs15 64 22 usc 7430 65 22 usc 7430a 66 22 usc 7431 it is unclear what authority is meant with respect to section 2011a 22 usc 7430a since section 2011 does not vest any authority in the president see 22 usc 7430c perhaps section 2012 should be interpreted to prohibit delegation of the authorities to which sections 2004 and 2006 do not apply under section 2011 67 section 2004 22 usc 7423 restricts th conduct of federal and state agencies and courts therefore the exception in section 2011 could not be invoked with respect to state continuedof section 2006 could be inte rpreted to mean that the presidents requirement to implement the rules is waived or that the requirement to obtain assurances from recipients other than the icc is waived or that the rules themselves may be waived with respect to particular case section 2011 provides an exception for certa in presidential authorities stating that the restrictions on cooperation with the icc section 2004 and the requirement for procedures to protect certain sensitiv information section 2006 do not apply to any action or actions with respect to specific matter taken or directed by the president on casebycase basis in the exercise of the presidents authority as commander in chief of the armed forces of the united states under article ii section 2 of the united states constitution or in the exercise of the executive power under article ii section 1 of the united states constitution64 the section would require the president to notify congress within 15 days of the action unless such notification would jeopardize na tional security it further clarifies that nothing in the section shall be construed as grant of statutory authority to the president to take any action65 section 2012 prohibits delegation of the authorities vested in the president by sections 2003 waiver provision and 2011 constitutional exception66 inasmuch as sections 2004 and 2006 are ready subject to presidential waiver under section 2003c in the case of the i nvestigation or prosecution of named individual it appears that this section is drafted to avoid possible conflicts of the separation of powers between the president and congress in the event that the president takes the position that the prohi bitions of sections 2004 and 2006 infringe upon his constitutional authority in certain cas he might assert that congress has power even to require waiver under section 2003 section 2011 appears to ensure notification of congress at least at some point after the action has been taken regardless of whether the president belie ves that sections 2004 and 2006 impinge his constitutional authority the effect of section 2011 is not entir ely clear depending as it does on the interpretation of the presidents executive powers under article ii section 1 of the constitution and his authority as commander in chief of the armed forces interpreted broadly the constitutional executive power includes the power to execute the law meaning the execution of any law whether statutory or constitutional or even international law such an interp retation would seem to render sections 2004 and 2006 as well as the waiver provision of section 2003c largely superfluous67httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31495crs16 67 continued courts and other nonfederal entities section 2006 22 usc 7425 applies only to the president directing him to implement procedur to safeguard certain information from the icc broad interpretation of section 2011 would appear to render section 2006 nullity perhaps section 2011 is meant to provide the president authority to suspend regulations promulgated under section 2006 with respect to certain cases under the jurisdiction of the icc 68 22 usc 7433a 69 22 usc 7428 such report was made public but the report may have been submitted in classified form pursuant to subsection cinterpreted narrowly the executive author ities cited above could refer to those powers which the president does not sh are with congress under narrow interpretation congress would be deemed to be without authority to regulate such actions in any event in which case it would appear to make little sense to restrict its application to sections 2004 and 2006 the nguage could be c onstrued by court to imply waiver authority apart from the restrictions outlined in section 2003 section 2015 provides clarification with respect to assistance to international efforts it states nothing in this title shall prohibit the united states from rendering assistance to international efforts to bring to justice saddam hussein slobodan milosovic osama bin laden other members of qaeda leaders of islamic jihad and other foreign nationals accused of genocide war crimes or crimes against humanity68 this language would appear to have the effect of limiting the prohibitions in section 2004 to cases in which the icc prosecutes nonus citizens for the crimes currently under the jurisdiction of the icc althoug h the united states may be obligated to deny such assistance in the case of an accused foreign national who is national of country with which the united states s entered into reciprocal article 98 agreement the provision could also eliminate the restrictions on participation in peacekeeping missions or provision of military assistance where such participation or aid could be interpreted to further an international effort to prosecute the named crimes there is definition of foreign national in the aspa its use in section 2015 could lead to conflict with subsec tions d and f of section 2004 22 usc 7423 as they apply to pe rmanent resident aliens reporting requirements in addition to the congressional notifications required by some of the waiver author ities described above the aspa encourages the president to submit by february 2 2003 report for each military alliance to which the united states is party assessing the command arrangements they entail and the degree to which such arrangemen ts may place us servicemembers under the command or control of foreign officers subject to the jurisdiction of the icc69 later than

determin ed and reported to the appropriate committees that waiver was in the us national security interest the president could also waive the prohibition on economic assistance for countries that

constitute genocide under the rome stat ute except that the us code covers only conduct committed by us national or conduct committed within the united states75 some observers have expressed concern that war criminals or perpetrators of genocide from other countries could s eek refuge in the united states from extradition to and prosecution by the icc however the exception in section 2013 of the aspa which allows us entities to cooperate with the icc in the case of foreign nationals accused of war crimes may obviate the n eed for such legislation some have suggested that changes in us statutes to broaden the jurisdiction of federal courts to cover all crimes over which the icc might assert jurisdiction could enhance the implementa tion of complementarity by precluding finding by the icc that the united states is unable to prosecute one of its citizens76 for the most part war crimes committed by us persons are covered by the war crimes act although there may be some acts

mass crimes debate over the icc has created tension between enhancing the international legal justice system and encroaching on what some count ries perceive as their legitimate use of force the

for opening an investigation into any of those allegations or into other incidents relating to nato bombing94 while opponents of the icc interpret this event as an indication that the icc is likely to pursue spurious and politically motivated cases against us citizens pr oponents of the icc see it as illustrating that similar allegations would be dismissed by the icc prosecutor another

and damage its influence worldwide including its ability to influence the development of the law of war96 the perceived us willingness to hold peacekeeping missions hostage to us demands for immunity from the icc may deepen the rift between the united states and allies that support the icc the withholding of milita ry assistance and other economic aid to members of the icc may also be seen as an effort to coerce countries to refuse to ratify the rome statute or to sign an article 98 agreement which could appear to some as undermining the icc and negatin g the administrations stated intent to respect the decisions of ot her countries to join the icc by seemingly demanding special treatment in the form of immunity from the icc the united states may bolster the perception of its unilateral approach to world affairs and its unwillingness to abide by the same laws that apply to other nations this perception could undermine us efforts at coalitionbuilding to gain international support for the present war against terrorism and operations in iraq as well as future international endeavors97 others argue that the perception of us commitment to the rule of law has little effect on countries where hum an rights abuses are most rampant despots like cambodias pol pot or iraqs saddam hussein have not we ighed possible future legal ramifications before committing massive crimes98 under this view the establishment of the icc might have the uni ntended effect of hardening the resolve of ruthless tyrants who may feel they have nothing to gain by giving up their

government99 t h b u s h administration has pursued efforts in the security council and with individual states to prevent the possibility that american citizens could be prosecuted before the icc this effort has met with some success but also some resistance agreement with the security council on july 12 2002 in response to the us veto of the extensi on of peacekeeping operations in bosnia the security council adopted reso lution requesting blanket deferral of prosecutions by the icc of peacekeepers from states not parties to the rome statute for period of one year resoluti on 1422 provides in pertinent part acting under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations 1 requests consistent with the provisions of ar ticle 16 of the rome statute that the icc if case arises involving current or former officials or personnel from contributing state not party to the rome statute over acts or omissions relating to united nations established or authorized operation shall for twelvemonth period starting 1 july 2002 not commence or proceed with investigation or prosecution of any such case unless the secur ity council decides otherwise 2 expresses the intention to renew the request in paragraph 1 under the same conditions each 1 july for further 12month periods for as long as may be necessary 3 decides that member states shall take action inconsistent with paragraph 1 and with their international obligations 4 decides to remain seized of the matter100 the resolution which was renewed for another year under security council resolution 1487 appeared to fall short of

renewed by the council under the same conditions although some opponents of the us position had argued that article 16 was intended to be invoked only on casebycase basis the language of the article does not expressly state such requirement therefore resolutions 1422 and 1487 appear to be consistent with the rome statute the language deferred icc action for one year it does not provide absolute immunity for actions occurring during the deferral period because the security council did not extend the deferral past july 2004 it appears that the icc may investigate and prosecute any purported crimes under its subject matter jurisdiction that occurred at any time after the rome statutes entry into force subject to other provisions of the rome statute other missions us military personnel

all alleged acts or omissions arising out of or related to the multinational force or united nations stabilization force in liberia unless such exclusive jurisdiction has been expressly waived by that

situation in darfur was complicated by its position regarding th icc and its jurisdiction over nonmember states in september 2004 the united states concluded that ge nocide had taken place in darfur

states has so far concluded 100 bilate ral agreements whereby each signatory promises that it will not surrender citizens of the other signatory to the icc unless both parties consent in advance to the surrender113 the department of state is seeking to conclude these agreements with as many states as possible even those who are not parties to the icc and others who would not be subject to the sanctions under aspa the agreements are intended to make use of article 98 of the rome statute which states cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1 the court may not proceed with request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested state to act inconsisten tly with its obligations under international law with respect to the state or diplomatic imm unity of person or property of third state unless the court can first obtain the cooperation of that third state for the waiver of the immunity 2 the court may not proceed with reque st for surrender

state to the court unless the court can first obtain the cooperation of the sending state for the giving of consent for the surrender114 paragraph 1 of article 98 appears intended to retain diplomatic immunity and immunity for heads of state while paragraph 2 seems to contemplate typical sofa arrangements in which countries hosting mbers or units of the armed forces of allies agree to forego certain types of jurisdiction over the soldiers and other government officers stationed there the use of the term sending state in the second paragraph appears to indicate that it is meant to cover

to allow member countries to sign116 the eu issued guidelines for member countries for the acceptable terms of article 98 agreements specifying that coverage would be limited to government

reiterated the eu stand with respect to article 98 agreements referring to the 2002 guidelines118 despite the eu compromise the us pursuit of immunity has been criticized by some as unnecessary or as

122 see rome statute supra note 2 arts 97 98out the agreements are based on and consiste nt with article 98 of the rome statute and therefore cannot be sa id to undermine the icc the practical effect of the article 98 agreements is as of yet uncertain the use of such agreements with host countries does not provide absolute immunity from the icc they would bind only countries that choose to sign and would have the effect only of preventing the host nation from surrendering an accused to the icc for prosecution while the rome statute gives some discretion to st ates parties to honor their international obligations applicable to extradition of persons who are identified in an icc request for surrender122 there does not appear to be provision for accused persons or their states of nationality to challenge the jurisdiction of the icc based on the violation of bilateral agreement therefore states parties to the rome statute are not precluded from entering into article 98 agreements that provide for immunity of foreign troops from surrender but if th icc were neverthe less to gain custody over the accused through other means its jurisdiction may not be affected by the agreement options though the administration continue s to seek to conclude article 98 agreements with relevant countries it is not clear how many more such agreements are likely to be forthcoming to strengthen the administrations pursuit of these agreements congress could make more fo rms of aid contingent on the recipient countrys agreement to protect us troops from surrender to the icc or it could enact legislation to restrict the presidents discretion to grant waivers if further negotiations fail to garner necessary suppor t or in case the agreements should turn out to less effective than desired or counterproductive for other reasons policymakers may seek alternative avenues one option might be to implement policy of investigating and if warra nted prosecuting all crime s under the icc jurisdiction alleged to be committed by us pe rson thus preempting the icc through application of the complement arity principle such policy coupled with changes in us statutes to broaden the jurisdicti on of federal courts to cover all relevant crimes could further insulate us citizens from the reach of the icc the united states could seek to further enhance its reputation for conductin g fair and credible investigations and trials of suspected war criminals as well as perpetrators of crimes against humanity or genocide through the us of consistent procedures that are as open as security considerations permit such practice may help to overcome any charges that us investigation or prosecution of an accused is not genuine for the purposes of complementarity finally some have argued that polic of cooperation with the icc in the prosecution of persons accused of crimes that the united states agrees amount tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31495crs29 123 id art 51the most serious crimes of concern to the international community123 would enhance the reputation of the united states as promoter of human rights and the rule of law such polic could take the form of pa ssive noninterference with the icc to active assistance including working from within the security council to refer cases to the icc by actively keeping the security council involved in the referral of cases some of th predicted problems with refe rrals by states parties or by the prosecutor could be minimized on the other hand some argue cooperative posture with respect to the icc in the case of foreigners while pursuing immunity for us citizens would be per ceived as double standard
