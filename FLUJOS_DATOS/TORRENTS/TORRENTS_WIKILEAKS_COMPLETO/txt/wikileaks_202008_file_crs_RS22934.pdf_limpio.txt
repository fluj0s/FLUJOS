nonprofit had paid on behalf of the borrower plus processing fee for the nonprofit since the borrowers costs d already been paid by the nonprofit technically the contribution from the seller was not paying that borrowers costs it was replenishing the funds of the nonprofit and enabling the nonpr ofit to contribute to the downpayment of some future borrower structured in this manner the transaction did not appear to be prohibited by huds policy against having th borrowers required contribution paid by the sellers hud however did not agree with this interpretation the nehemiah progressive housing development corpora tion nehemiah of sacramen to ca was given approval of its dpa program by local hud office the hud national office reviewed the paperwork and concluded that gifts to borrowers by nehemiah would longer be counted as meeting the borrowers contributions nehemiah filed suit over huds decision9 settlement agreement was reached in 1998 whereby nehemiah was per mitted to continue operation of its dpa program and hud reserved th right to take regulatory actions with regard to dpa programs th agreement also provided that if hud took regulatory action regarding huds treatment of dpa provide rs the applicability of the changes to nehemiah would occur six months from the effective date of the new rule the nehemiah program has ex panded nationally and become

if 1 to finance its downpayment assistance activities the organization relies on sellers and other realestate rela ted businesses that stand to benefit from the transactions the organization facilitates 2 in deciding whether to provide assistance to lowincome applican t the organizations staff knows the identity of the home seller and may also know the identitie s of other interested

addition the agency not ed that it has denied applications for tax exemption from over 20 organizations th at seek to provide this service revisions to the hud regulations over the years thousands of families have become homeowners through fhainsured ans using nehemiahty pe dpa programs proponents of the programs point to these num bers and argue that without cost to the taxpayers the programs have been able to provide homeownership opportunities to low and moderateincome families hud argues however that the success of these sellerfunded dpa programs has not come without cost hud suggests that the programs have provided homeownership but they have not provided sustainable homeownership in too many cases12 hud notes that the rates of defaults foreclos ures and claims have increased so dramatically that the sellerfunded dpas jeopardize the solv ency of the fha insurance fund13 losses to the insurance fund could possibl be sustained if mortgages involving sellerfunded dpas were small part of the insurance pool bu t borrowers receiving gifts of the required funds have increasingly become larger part of the fha insurance pool in fy1996 borrowers who received gifts were 29 of fhainsured loans by fy2006 such borrowers had grown to nearly 42 of fhainsured loans14 about 50 of the gifts received by borrowers in fy2006 and fy2007 were those from the sellers of the property15 hud finds the default rate on loans with gifts from sellers to be nearly twice the default rate on loans with gifts from family members16 primary concern of hud is that the sales price is often increased on homes financed through sellerfunded dpa programs inflated sale s amounts result in inflated mortgage amounts and this increases the size of claims against the fha insurance fund when the loans default17 for these reasons hud has sought to curtail the sellerfunded dpa programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22934crs6 18 72 fr 27047 19 72 fr 56002 20 ameridream inc et v jackson 071752 ddc
