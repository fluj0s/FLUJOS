the 110th congress in the patent system has been evidenced by the advancement of substantial reform bills in both the house and senate alongside these congressional proposals the united states patent and trademark office uspto has engaged in significant rulemaking effort in recent years this process culminated in new rules that would make several significant changes to the patent acquisition process first the rules would limit the number of continued applications that could be filed absent petition and showing by the patent applicant of the need for such applications stated genera lly continued application is one that has been refiled at the uspto commonly following an examiners rejection the uspto has justified this limitation on the basis that the increasing number of continued examination filings is hampering its ability to review new applications second the rules would limit the number of claims that can be filed in particular patent application unless th applicant supplies the uspto with an examination support document in furthera nce of that application the uspto asserts that these rules would lead to more effective examination process critics of the new rules contend that they will negatively impact the ability of innovators to obtain effective proprietary rights legal challenges to the rules resulted in the april 1 2008 decision in tafas v dudas there the us district court for the eastern district of virgin ia concluded that the uspto claims and continued application rules were substan tive in nature because congress has not granted general substantive rulemaking power to the uspto the district court declared that the rules were void and th erefore unenforceable at the time of the publication of this report the uspto retains the option of appealing this judgment in addition the uspto s proposed reforms that would impose additional applicant disclosure obligations with respect to information disclosure statements filed in support of partic ular

they incurred cost to develop and perfect the technology involved copyists could undersell the original invent or aware that they would be unable to capitalize upon their inventions individuals might be discouraged from innovating in the first instance the patent system corrects th is market failure problem by providing innovators with an exclusive interest in their inventions thereby allowing them to capture their marketplace value29 the patent system purportedly serves ot her goals as well the patent law encourages the disclosure of new products and processes for each issued patent must include description sufficient to enable skilled artisans to practice the patented invention30 at the close of the patents twentyyear term31 others may employ the claimed invention without regard to the ex pired patent in this manner the patent system ultimately contributes to the growth of the public domain even during their term issued patents may encourage others to invent around the patentees proprietary in terest patentee may point the way to new products markets economies of producti on and even entire industries others can build upon the disclosure of patent instrument to produce their own technologies that fall outside the exclusive rights associated with the patent32 the regime of patents has also been identified as facilitator of markets absent patent rights an inve ntor may have scant tangible assets to sell or license in addition an inventor might otherwise be ble to police the conduct of contracting party any technology or knowhow that s been disclosed to prospective licensee might be appropriate d without compensation to the inventor the availability of patent protection decreases the ability of contracting parties to engage in opportunistic behavior by lowering

secret protection is sought taking the steps necessary to maintain secrecy such as implementing physical security measures also imposes costs that may ultimately be unproductive for society34 the patent system has long been subject to criticism however some observers have asserted that the patent system is unnecessary due to market forces that already suffice to create an optimal level of innovation the desire to obtain lead time advantage over competitors as well as the recognition that passive firms may lose out to their more innovative rivals may provide sufficient inducement to invent without the need for further incentives35 other commentators be lieve that the patent system encourages industry concentration and presents barrier to entry in some markets36 because the relationship between the ra of innovation and the availability of patent rights is not wellunderstood we lack rigorous analytical methods for studying the impact of the patent system upon the ec onomy as whole as result current economic and policy tools do not allow us to calibrate the patent system precisely in order to produce an optimal vel of investment in innova tion thus each of these arguments for and against the patent system remain open to challenge by those who are unpersuaded by their internal logic continuing application practice reform continued application practice the patent act allows inventors to file c ontinued applications37 stated generally continued application is one that has been refiled at the uspto commonly following the rejection of some or all of its claims continued patent applications allow inventors to extend the period of examination at the uspto in order to negotiate further with patent examiner amend claims submit new claims and gain

uspto approves the continuation app lication it will issue as patent that expires on january 1 2020 twenty years from the date of filing of the original or parent application section 120 of the patent

disclosure found within the predecessor application claims that reference new matter found in the continued application but not in the pred ecessor application are entitled only to the actual filing date of the tinued application as noted earlier such an application is termed continuationinpart or cip43 it should be appreciated that an appli cant may file tinuation application even though the

application as matter of right in order to file additional continued applications the applicant must submit petition showing an amendment argument or evidence that could not have been previously submitted the uspto issued the rules on august 21 2007 and followed them with an additional clarification memorandum on october 10 200746 the rules were to apply to applications filed after novemb er

its rule in part on the basis of administrative efficiency as explained by the uspto the volume of continued examination filings is having crippling effect on the offices ability to examine new ie noncontinuing applications the cumulative effect of these continued examination filings is too often to divert patent examining resources from the exam ination of new applications disclosing new technology and innovations to the exam ination of applications that are repetition of prior applications that have already been examined and have either issued or become abandoned47 the uspto has also

continued appli cation practice has introduced number of deleterious consequences into the patent law first at minimum continuation practice introduces substantial delay and uncertainty into the lives of patentees competitors who cannot know whether patent application is pending in most circumstances second the structure of the pto suggests that continuations may well succeed in wearing down the examiner so that the applicant obtains broad patent not because he deserves one but because the examiner has neith er incentive nor will to hold out any longer third continuation practice can be and has been used strategically to gain advantages over competitors by waiting to see what product the competitor will make and then drafting pa tent claims specifically designed to cover that product finally some patentees have used continuation practice to delay the issuance of their patent precisel in order to surprise mature industry process known as submarine patenting50 on the other hand critics of the uspto ru explain that continuation practice has number of beneficial ttributes first some obser vers believe that continued application practice allows inventors to pursue cautious deliberate strategy before the uspto allowing them to obtain robust patent rights this tactic may be appropriate in view of recent judicial opinions that have emphasized the doctrine of prosecution history estoppel51 broadly stated this principle allows courts to consider negotiations between the applicant and the examiner when determining the scope of rights associated with partic ular patent in view of these judicial developments some patent practitioners believe that it is unwise to make certain concessions to the examiner during the cour of prosecution the ability to file continued application supports this strategy by allowi ng additional opportunities for discourse between the applicant and examiner52 second critics of the uspto rules state that conti nued applications allow

claim rules following issuance of notice and pe riod of public commentary the uspto promulgated rules that would impose an obligation upon inventor s who file patent applications that have more than five independent claims or more than 25 total claims dependent or independent72 that obligation consists of the duty to prepare and file an examination s upport document or esd th esd contains information about the claimed inventions that may assist the uspto in conducting its examination tasks in order to prepare the esd the applicant must conduct search of databases of patents and the scientific literature the applicant must then provide detailed explanation of why the submitted claims are patentable over the prior art discovered during the search as well as pr ovide additional information pertinent to the patentability determination73 the uspto is concerned that applicants might attempt to file multiple applications directed toward the same or similar inventions in order to avoid the obligation to submit an esd the uspto rules therefore require applicants to disclose all applications that are commonl owned and have at least one inventor in common74 if the examiner determines that the applications have substantially overlapping disclosures the examiner may presume that the claims are not patentably distinct and will apply the 525 claim limitation to the total number of claims in the relevant applications the uspto further cautioned applicants fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34422crs14 75id at 46722 76id at 46721 77id at 46717 78id 79id at 46718 80see allison

permissibly file continued appli cations in order to obtain additi onal claims without the filing of an esd as the new continuation rules allow applicants to file two continuation applications and one rce without special justification applicants may potentially obtain 15 independent claims and 75 total claims without the filing of an esd76 as with the rules with respect to continued applications the claiming practice rules were to apply to app lications filed after novemb er 1 2007 in addition the rules were to apply to applications that had been filed at the uspto prior to november 1 2007 provided that they had not yet been reviewed by the uspto the uspto justified these restricti ons upon claiming practice on number of grounds one rationale was that these refo rms would lead to better focused and effective examination process that w ould allow examiners to concentrate upon smaller number of claims or in the alternative be assisted by an esd77 according to the uspto the result would be reduc tion in the large and growing backlog of unexamined applications while the quality of issued patents would be maintained or possibly improved78 the uspto also expressed concerns that absent rule changes the public would face difficulty in analyzing numerous claims in issued patents that were directed towards patentably indistinct inventions79 patents are often complex technical instruments that may prove difficult to parse80 it is not uncommon for jurists who frequently adjudicate disputes concerning patents to disagree on their appropriate construction81 the transaction costs and uncerta inty surrounding determinations of patent scope may be furthe r exaggerated if the patent includes large number of claims these circumstan ces may not favor the ability of others to innovate themselves and also to compete in the marketplace although the uspto rules place abso lute restrictions upon the number of claims that may be incorporated within particular application they

might therefore significantly increase the costs of procuring patent rights in the united states in addition some observe rs believe that esds will commonly incorporate statements and disclosures that might poten tially be viewed as admissions an esd might therefore limit the scope of protecti on and enforceability of any patent that resulted from its application83 other observers believed that the claim rules would negatively impact patent rights without m eaningfully serving the goals identified by the uspto as explained by patent atto rneys john r harris and daniel sineway for the uspto to claim that an esd will improve examination quality seems disingenuous the improvement in quality will likely result not from any greater scrutiny or effort by the patent examiner but from patent applicants providing the examiner with the ammunition to reject the application the esd will give examiners the information and reasoning needed to deny patent andor force the applicant to fill the f ile history with information that helps infringers avoid liability in later litigation84 as result patent attorney kevin noona n opined that an applicant should avoid filing an esd under any circumstances85 if inventors widely subscribe to this view then they will be practically limited in the number of claims that they can obtain from the uspto this effect may limit the extent of patent protection an inventor may effectively procure particularly in view of number of judicial opinions that have stressed that inventors possess the ability to draft claims usin g words of their own choosing86 courts have further observed that patents claims are intende d to provide notice to third parties of its owners proprietary rights87 if the claims do not match the accused infringers

will make the pate nt system less attractive thereby decreasing investment in rd diminishing innovation and encouraging use of trade secret law90 the tafas v dudas litigation criticisms over the propriety of the claims and continued application rules led to litigation against the uspto in federal court legal challenges to the rules resulted in the april 1 2008 decision in tafas v dudas 91 there the us district court for the eastern district of virginia concluded that the uspto claims and continued application rules were substan tive in nature because congress has not granted general substantive rulemaking power to the uspto the district court declared that the rules were void and therefore unenforceable at the time of the publication of this report the uspto retains the option of appealing this judgment the tafas v dudas ruling arose from lawsuits filed by two separate plaintiffs 1 individual inventor triantafyllos ta fas and 2 the multinational pharmaceutical enterprise

although number of arguments were befo re the district c ourt judge cacheris confined his ruling to the issue of whether the uspto claims and continued application rules were substa ntive or not he concluded that the rules were indeed substantive because they would affect individual rights and obligations93 in particular judge cacheris observed that the patent act placed strict limitations upon

frequently include numerous irrelevant or marginally relevant prior art reference that not only fail to bring the most relevant material to the attention of examiners but also require them to sort

respect to ids filings in particular the uspto proposes that if more than 20 documents ar disclosed in an ids the applicant must provide an explanation of each cited document that explanation consists of an identification of portion of document that caused it to be cited and an explanation of how the specific feature showing or teaching of the document correlates with language in one or more
