6301c10 shspec228 r212 the only commonwealth nation that has picked up on the fda raid was australia this shows the connections between australia and the us routine 2 has an important liability someone can be put off but good if you miss an item eg by giving the pc the wrong item since the missing item acts as supersized missed withhold you must get the item on the list or run into this missed withhold phenomenon on certain pc you may get away with having an incomplete list sixty to seventy percent of the time but the time you dont get away with it makes up for the lot the pc becomes unauditable he doesnt know why and he will just go round the bend further if all you do is to pull missed withholds without completing the list say you give him wrong item he may not arc break spectacularly then but his session goals in succeeding sessions will get less and less bright you should be able to see this as you go over the auditing reports and pick up the list where this goof occurred the pc will also be very massy arc breaky looking older darker skintoned etc he may also be arc broken when you tell him to complete the list this doesnt matter complete it anyway wrongwayto list doesnt produce the arc breaks neither does wrong source it is just incomplete lists so watch carefully when you abandon list or give pc an item if he goes out the bottom immediately or slowly repair by completing the list even if the pc has been doing lists off the wrong item for eighteen sessions on wrongway to list the rock slams keep increasing in frequency that is good way to spot one but beware of pcs wearing rings that can cause phantom slams on rightwayto list the slams will be less frequent from the third or fourth page on you may go another six pages before you get the next slam before the needle goes clean and the item is on the list if you give the pc wrong item he will do downcurve on the tone scale if the pc starts to go the slightest bit bis on being given an item tell him that you are sorry that is not his item and that you are going to extend and complete the list he should brighten up immediately thats all it takes dont ever shift pcs attention immediately after giving him an item watch him if it is the wrong item he will age subtly but definitively before your eyes you can watch his tone level go down by the second if you have handed him wrong item just tell him i dont think it was your item well extend the list and he will brighten up there are very few pcs around who are arc breaky as hell and have been for several years they can get audited but it is gruesome what is wrong with them is most likely an unflat repetitive process the omitted answer is the missed item of course there is list problems intensive approach sorting out when they were happy with auditing using the meter as necessary can be used in this case using suppress you can fish up what process it was theoretically then you could prepcheck it out but why not let him complete the process so when the pc is left arc broken with the auditing the organization or whatever find the unflat process and flatten it you wouldnt have to flatten everything ever left unflat it the unflat process missed item could also turn up on an oppose list to auditing but missed item could turn up on any case that you are doing list on so watch for it another source of missing items is failure to oppose this especially happened when the list one item was opposed but the item found from this was not opposed in its turn the rule is that anything that keeps slamming must be opposed so you could get two packages by the time you are through an item from wrong source will slam until you straighten up the source rockslamming item from right source should always be opposed routine 2 is like racing car it gets you there fast but if you drive it wrong you can really wrap someone around telephone pole so you have to be skilled at case repair this has become an important skill the reason the pc gets more upset if you try to pull missed withholds when it is missed item is that the item keeps getting restimulated but he cant give you the item because you are not listing the pc may not be enthusiastic about extending the list but he will do it and brighten up watch out for this situation if you had two items slamming on the list and when you null only the second one slams beware when you give it to him as an item watch his indicators for few seconds before you go on dont distract him at this point it will aggravate the arc break if it is the wrong item among other things if it is wrong backpedal gracefully and continue the list bit to get the item of course the list may go on for pages also
