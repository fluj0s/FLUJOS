their connecting waters form the largest fresh surface water system on earth the great lakes affect millions of people as well as aspects of the natural environment consequently law makers have now become sensitive to the industrial and environm ental needs of the lakes seve ral federal agencies play key roles in the management and protection of the great lakes by implementing programs for pollution control conserva tion navigation and sc ientific research lake saint clair is located between lakes huron and erie and is the smallest lake in the great lakes system although not recognized as traditional great lake lake saint clair is vital resource to many of the regions citizens animals and ecosystems this report focuses on the statutory nguage of the programs specifically authorized for the great lakes and di scusses various na tional programs as applicable in particular th is report discusses the statutor programs that benefit the great lakes and how these programs woul d benefit lake saint clair if designated as great lake this discussion howev er requires an initial consideration of the statutory language for each program to assess whether lake saint clair is not already either explicitly or implicitly eligible to receive the benefits of program review of the programs discussed here in demonstrates that lake saint clair is generally included in the statutory langua ge for programs that benefit the great lakes the great lakes basin or the g reat lakes region or for great lakes state in essence lake saint clair appears eligible for most of the programs and funding that are specifically designated for the traditional great lakes and may be eligible under others thus designation as great lake would appear to have little or legal significance for these purposes this report will be updated as warrantedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31714contents introduction 1 d p r t m n t f g r i c u l t u r e2 g r t l k s b s i n p r g r m 2 d p r t m n t f c m m r c 3

traditionally the term great lakes s always included lakes huron ontario michigan erie and superior beyond these bodies of water the broader great lakes system also includes all of the streams ri vers

the system although not normally characterized as g reat lake lake saint clair is located within the great lakes system see figure 1 and plays vital role in the livelihood of many americans and

nearly six million americans and canadians nevertheless lake saint clair is also plagued with variety of ills from toxic contamination to reoccurring dredging needs due to the multitude of interests that are affected by the great lakes law makers have attempted to address this natural resource from variety of environmental concerns in general gr eat lakes programs funded by the federal government

waters of the great lakes basin to manage the resources of the great lakes basin the compact established the great lakes commission which is specifically referred to in 16 usc 3839bb3 according to article iii of the great lakes basin compact the term basin specifically includes lake saint clair as well as the five traditional great lakes consequently if it is reasona ble to give great lakes basin the same meaning in the statute that it has in the compact designating lake saint clair great lake would likely have effect under this progra m since it appears to already be included within the

under the act 21 14 usc 2states15 this definition appears to include lake saint clair since the waters from lake saint clair drain into the basin of the saint lawrence river upstream from the point at

maintain the generally accepted concept31 of the five great lakes and did not intend to include lake saint clair within the meaning of great lakes however to accept the proposition that there are only five great lakes may frustrate the purpose of the clean air act which has the broa d purpose to enhance and protect the quality of the nations air supply32 furthermore the term great lakes as cited in various other statutes referenced throughout this report has always included lake saint clair therefore it may be reasonable to maintain consistent interpretation of the term although g reat lakes is not defined under the regulations promulgated for the clean air act various other epa regulations may support the inclusion of lake saint clair within the term great lakes for example epa regulations

clair great lake would probabl have little effect on its eligibility for corps programs under the wrda of 2000 many of the prog rams that benefit the great lakes do not define the term however there ar two programs that specifically define great lakes to include lake saint clair the great lakes fishery and ecosystem restoration program48 and the great lakes dredging levels adjustment program49 both include lake saint clair within the meaning of the term great lake as result the services under these programs could legally be provi ded to lake saint clair regardless of whether it is designat ed great lake conclusion from the preceding discussion it appears lake saint clair is covered by the statutory programs discussed herein that are generally designated for the great lakes the great lakes basin the gr eat lakes region or for great lakes state only the clean air act makes ambi guous references to the great lakes that could potentially exclude lake saint clair programs provided by the army corps of engineers may also be problematic because the vast majority of wrda programs do not contain definition for great lakes or any of its rela ted terms however the wrda does include few programs that either apply directly to lake saint clair or specifically define great lakes or use other applicable terms to include lake saint clair consequently there may be support for the in clusion of lake saint clair in the various corps programs if it reas onable to conclude that the term great lakes when it is defined in the various statutes has always included lake saint clair in general therefore designating lake saint clair great lake would apparently have little or legal effect on its eligibility for additional program benefits or sources of funding that are provided to the traditi onal five great lakes
