mark randol specialist in domestic intelligence and counterterrorism january 14 2009 abstract this report provides potential conceptual model of how to frame hsint including geographic structuralstatutory and holistic approaches given that state local tribal and private sector oﬃcials play such an important role in hsint the holistic model one not constrained by geography or levels of government strikes many as the most compelling the report argues that there is in eﬀect homeland security intelligence community hsic although the hsics members are diﬀused across the nation they share common counterterrorism interest the proliferation of intelligence and information fusion centers across the country indicate that state and local leaders believe there is value to centralizing intelligence gathering and analysis in manner that assists them in preventing and responding to local manifestations of terrorist threats to their people infrastructure and other assets at the policy and operational levels the communication and integration of federal hsint eﬀorts with these state and local fusion centers will likely remain an important priority and future

focused considerable attention on how intelligence is collected analyzed and disseminated in order to protect the homeland against terrorist threats prior to 911 it was possible to make distinction between domestic intelligenceprimarily law enforcement information collected within the united statesand foreign intelligence primarily military political and economic intelligence collected outside the country today threats to the homeland posed by terrorist groups are now national security threats intelligence collected outside the united states is often very relevant to the threat environment inside the united states and vice versa although the activities involved in homeland secu rity intelligence hsint itself are not new the relative importance of state local and private sector stakeholders the awareness of how law enforcement information might protect nationa l security and the importance attached to homeland security intelligence have all increased substantially since the events of 911 there are numerous intelligence collection disciplines through which the us intelligence community ic collects intelligence to support informed national security decisionmaking at the national level and the allocation of tactical military and law enforcement resources at the local level the collection disciplines are generally referred to as those which fall within national technical means or nontechnical means technical means include signals intelligence sigint measurement and signatures intelligence masint and imagery intelligence imint non technical means include human intelligence humint and open source intelligence osint each of these collection disciplines is sourcespecificthat is technical platform or human source generally managed by an agency or mission manager collects intelligence that is used for national intelligence purposes hsint however is generally not source specific as it includes both national technical and non technical means of collection for example hsint includes human intelligence collected by federal border security personnel or state and local law enforcement officials as well as sigint collected by the national security agency reasonable individuals can differ therefore with respect to the question of whether hsint is another collection discipline or whether homeland security is simply another purpose for which the current set of collection disciplines is being harnessed homeland security information as statutorily defined pertains directly to 1 terrorist intentions and capabilities to attack people and infrastructure within the united states and 2 us abilities to deter prevent and respond to potential terrorist attacks this report provides potential conceptual model of how to frame hsint including geographic structuralstatutory and holistic approaches given that state local tribal and private sector officials play such an important role in hsint the holistic model one not constrained by geography or levels of government strikes many as the most compelling the report argues that there is in effect homeland security inte lligence community hsic although the hsics members are diffused across the nation they share common counterterrorism interest the proliferation of intelligence and information fusion centers across the country indicate that state and local leaders believe there is value to centralizing intelligence gathering and analysis in manner that assists them in preventing and responding to local manifestations of terrorist threats to their people infrastructure and other assets at the policy and operational levels the communication and integration of federal hsint efforts with these state and local fusion centers will likely remain an important priority and future challenge this report will not be updated

disseminated in order to protect the homeland against terrorism but also what should such intelligence encompass discussion of what constitutes homeland security intelligence and how it nests within the broader intelligence discipline may be useful background as congress continues to examine broad range of homeland security issues prior to 911 it was possible to make distinction between domestic intelligenceprimarily law enforcement information collected within the united statesand foreign intelligence primarily military political and economic intelligence collected outside the country today this distinction is blurred threats to the homeland posed by terrorist groups are national security threats and intelligence collected outside the unit ed states is often very relevant to the threat environment inside the united states and vice versa the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states hereafter the 911 commission stated that one of the challenges in preventing terrorist attacks is bridging the foreigndomestic divide 2 the 911 commission used this term for the divide that it found not only within the intelligence community ic but so between the agencies of the ic dedicated to the traditional foreign intelligence mission and those agencies responsible for the homeland security intelligence hsint and law enforcement missions some might categorize security intelligence and law enforcement criminal intelligence as nontraditional intelligence3 yet the scope and composition of this nontraditional or homeland security intelligence remains somewhat nebulous 1 forthcoming report will describe the various elements of the dhs intelligence enterprise in homeland security intelligence and the implementation of dhs secretary mich ael chertoffs intelligence initiatives outlined in the departments 2005 second stage review the question of how the us government should organize to implement an effective homeland security intelligence function eg the appropriate roles and responsibilities and attendant deconfliction of overlapping jurisdictions of the fbi and dhs intelligence elements are beyond the scope of this report 2 see national commission

homeland security intelligence blend of traditiona l and nontraditional intelligence that produces unique and actionable insights takes its place alongside the other kinds of intelligence as an indispensable tool for securing the nation

intelligence4 most explain the various types of clandestine intelligence the methods of intelligence collection the ints intelligence consumers the purposes for which intelligence is collected and the intelligence cycle5 traditional intelligence collection done clandestinely6 and overtly7 largely at the federal level to inform nationallevel policymakers is often differen tiated from criminal intelligence gathered by broader set of federal state and local actors generally for law enforcement purposes some argue that given that the end result in criminal case is successful prosecution that criminal intelligence gathering is largely reactivea crime takes place and intelligence or evidence is collected to support prosecution however intelligence gathering can also be used to advance the causes of national security as state and local law enforcement agencies can be viewed as the nations counterterrorism eyes and ears 8 arguably not all criminal intelligence gathering is reactive as some law enforcement organizations and intelligence fusion centers use proactive intelligence gathering techniques such as the re cruitment of human assets to prevent terrorist attacks the terms domestic intelligence and homeland security intelligence are often used colloquially and interchangeably by some observers depending on how one defines homeland security this may be understandable if however one bounds the activities associated with intelligence geographically systemic malady which was at least proximate cause of the intelligence failure resulting in the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the two terms are inherently distinct that is domestic intelligence could be defined as that which is collected analyzed and disseminated within the united states yet homeland security intelligence may be much more broadly defined 4 the terms data information and intelligence are generally m isinterpreted to have the same meaning one manner of differentiating among these terms is the extent to which value has been added to the raw data regardless of whether it was collected through overt or clandestine means the terms exist along continuum with data at the far left and intelligence at the far right as one moves from left to right additional value and context is added to discrete or posited facts to provide enhanced meaning to an ultimate consumer information collected clandestinely may or may not be of any inherently greater value than information collected through open source methods information collected is raw until its sources have been evaluated the information is combined or corroborated by other sources and analytical and due diligence methodologies are applied to ascertain the informations value lack of such critical evaluations can lead to flawed intelligence being provided to consumers who may take action based on the intelligence 5 the intelligence cycle is an iterative process in which collection requirements based on national security threats are developed and intelligence is collected analyzed and di sseminated to broad range of consumers consumers sometimes provide feedback on the finished intelligence pro ducts which can be used to refine any part of the intelligence cycle to ensure that consum ers are getting the intelligence they need to make informed decisions andor take appropriate actions 6 intelligence is collected clandestinely by the us intelligence community and includes wide variety of human and national technical means as outlined below 7 opensource intelligence or that which is collected thr ough sources available to the general public globally while long tool of foreign intelligenceoriented agencies has become relatively more important in the postcold war era pursuant to recommendation of the wmd commission congress in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 identified open source intelligence as valuable source that must be integrated into the intelligence cycle the act recommended that the director of national intelligence establish an open source center and this was done in november 2005 the centers mission is to advance the intelligen ce communitys

collected the rationale for the integration of what is traditionally defined as foreign intelligence with that which is thought of as domestic intelligence is concisely stated by former director of national intelligence dni ambassador john negroponte what happens abroad can kill us at home9 one of the broadest definitions of intelligence is that intelligence is knowledge organization and activity10 arguably one of the most meaningful purposes of intelligence is to establish where the danger lies11 some would argue based on this definition that intelligence is intelligencethat is differentiating traditional from nontraditional intelligence is theoretical matter which may have little relation to the end resultprotecting national security this argument might continue that threats to us national security by and large originate overseas and since its formal and statutory inception in 1947 the us intelligence community has always been the first line of defense in identifying and understanding these threats alth ough compe lling this argument could lead some observers to conclude that the state local and private sector intelligence players are simply bolt on modules to the existing federal community such status quo plus model could be interpreted by some to mean that state local and private sector entities are new and passive consumers of federally gathered and analyzed intelligence products yet not necessarily full intelligence cycle partners this may not necessarily be the case as state local and private sector organizations have taken on more activist and proactive role in protecting their populations and infrastructure role that includes collecting their own intelligence while working with federal law enforcement and ic partners stationed in washington dc and within their respective districts 12 the intelligence is intelligence position might beg the question of what is the most appropriate strategy for homeland security intelligencea topdown federally driven model where the traditional ints are dominant bottomup state local and private sector model where the thousands of state and local law enforcement intelligence collectors are dominant or some unique partnership that strikes balance between thes two extreme models to some extent hsint may be perceived by some as federally led topdown model through which the federal governments intelligence entities provide raw intelligence andor finished terrorism threat assessments to state local and tribal law enforcement entities which may make independent determinations of whether the intelligence is actionable another alternative is bottom up 9 see speech of john d negroponte director of national in telligence before the us chamber of commerce july 10 2006 10 sherman kent strategic intelligence for american world policy hamden ct archon 1965 hereafter referred to as kent strategic intelligence dr kent was however quick to point out that the knowledge organization and activity to which he referred was highlevel foreign positive intelligence according to dr kent it was important to note that what was excluded from this definition of intellig ence was 1 the domestic scene it is not concerned with what goes on in the united states and 2 the police func tion the positive comes into the phrase to denote that the intelligence in question is not socalled counterintelligence and counterespionage nor any other sort of intelligence designed to uncover domestically produced traitors or imported foreign agents not that dr kent discounted the importance of this other type of intelligence indeed he re ferred to it as security intelligence definition which will be explored further below dr kent is the namesake fo r the central intelligence agencys sherman

long before the events of september 11 2001 provides an assessment of the local environments in which national security andor criminal threat might become reality third model among others might envision less hierarchical or more decentralized structure in which roles and responsibilities of federal state and local players are more clearly delineated information shared more widely and coordination between law enforcement and traditional intelligence actors closer these models will be highlighted below some perceptions of hsint among leaders in the ic and observers of the intelligence process are illustrative g21g152g150g142g561g18g142g155g140g142g153g157g146g152g151g156g561g152g143g561g10g21g11g16g22g561 leaders within the intelligence and homeland security communities often speak openly about the responsibilities priorities accomplishments and challenges their agencies face the nations first dni ambassador john negroponte stated that the intelligence community has tasked itself with bolstering intelligence support for homeland security as enterprise objective number one 14 he spoke of this priority within the context of the dnis mandate resulting from the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 irtp to integrate the foreign military and domestic dimensions of the united states intelligence into unified enterprise and connecting the dots across the foreigndomestic divide15 at the aggregate level even if it is assumed that there is one unified intelligence discipline according to ambassador negroponte there are three different dimensions of intelligenceforeign military16 and domestic under this school of thought hsint could become anothe r dimension of intelligence that is distinct in some manners yet overlaps with the aforementioned dimensions at relatively simplistic level the relationships among the dimensions of intelligence could be depicted according to figure 1 below 13 part of the complexity of framing hsint is the relati onship between criminal or law enforcement intelligence and traditional foreign intelligence generally the interpretation of traditional foreign intelligence is that it is collected covertly and overseas and is provided to policymakers to inform national security decisions and actions by contrast and in general criminal intelligence is gathered overtly or clandestinely and domestically as evidence to support prosecution of criminal act or to learn more about criminal enterprise for further information on criminal intelligence see rand state and local

of intelligence referred to above could be further subdivided the domestic intelligence dimension under broad understanding of the term would include the role state local tribal and private sector entities play in collecting analyzing and disseminating information and intelligence within their respective areas of jurisdiction or industries dni negroponte has defined the domestic agenda as institution building and information sharing without damaging the fabric and values of our political culture 17 with respect to institution building the approach remains federalcentric ambassador negroponte referred specifically to the refinement of the fbis national security branch the further development of the national counterterrorism center nctc as well as the development of the dhs office of intelligence and analysis state governments local law enforcement the private sector and tribal entities were mentioned at procedural levelthat is in the sense of facilitating these multidirectional flow of information 18 former secretary of homeland security michael chertoff provided his insights into and thoughts about defining the scope of hsint using the metaphor of intelligence as the radar of the 21st century to provide early warning of terrorist attacks he stated intelligence as you know is not only about spies and satellites intelligence is about the thousands and thousands of routine everyday observations and activities surveillance interactionseach of which may be taken in isolation as not particularly meaningful piece of information but when fused together gives us sense of the patterns and the flow that really is at the core of what intelligence analys is is all about we dhs actually generate lot of intelligence we have many interactions

following manner domestic intelligence entails the range of activities focused on protecting the united states from threats mostly of foreign origin focused narrowly it includes the fbis counterterrorism work with local law enforcement on much broader scale however it also involves broader set of intelligence activities overseen by the director of national intelligence the secretary of defense the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security the goal is to integrate federal state and local governments and when appropriate the private sector on secure collaborative network to stop our enemies before they act those enemies include individuals and groups attempting to transport weapons of mass destruction international terrorists organized criminals narcotics traffickers and countries that are working alone or in combination against us interests 20 another observer has defined domestic national security intelligence as intelligence concerning the threat of major politically motivated violence or equal grievous harm to national security or the economy inflicted within the nations territorial limits by international terrorists homegrown terrorists or spies of saboteurs employed or financed by foreign nations 21 according to dr sherman kent security intelligence is defined as the intelligence behind the police function its job is to protect the nation and its members from malefactors who are working to our national and individual hurt in one of its most dramatic forms it is the intelligence which continuously is trying to put the finger on clandestine agents sent here by foreign powers in another it is the activity which protects our frontiers against other undesirable gatecrashers illegal entrants smugglers dope r unners and so on by and large security intelligence is the knowledge and the activity which our defensive police forces must have before they take specific action against the individual illwisher or illdoer 22 some of the similarities between these perceptions include 1 fundamental belief that intelligence is the first line of defense for the nation23 2 threats to us national security are largely although not solely of foreign origin and 3 there is national intelligence role for non traditional players largely state local tribal law enforcement as well as the private sector role in which they make contributions to preventing terrorist attacks or other inimical acts directed against us citizens within the united states others however may account for the difference in these perceptions as being associated with the explicit roles and responsibilities that these non traditional entities play are these entities solely recipients of federally collected raw and finished intelligence products at policy and importantly local level are nontraditional players viewed by federal personnel as equal partners andor force multipliers at the federal level what continued department of justice and search

according to the dnis national intelligence strategy of the united states of america transformation through integration and innovation one of the basic objectives is to build an integrated intelligence capability to address threats to the homeland consistent with us laws and the protection of privacy and civil liberties24 the strategy stipulates that the nature of the transnational threats to the united states force us to rethink the way we conduct intelligence collection at home and its relationship with traditional intelligence methods abroad moreover the strategy states that us intelligence elements must focus their capabilities to ensure that 1 intelligence elements in the departments of justice and homeland security are properly resourced and closely integrated within the larger intelligence community 2 all inte lligence community components assist in facilitating the integration of collection and analysis against terrorists weapons of mass destruction and other threats to the homeland and 3 state local and tribal entities and the private sector are connect ed to our homeland security and intelligence efforts 25 any national strategy one could argue by definition focuses on and provides direction to only those agencies that the federal government controls broader reach andor direction to entities beyond this purview might run the risk of presupposing that the affected communityies agree with the national strategy andor have the resources to implement such direction therefore it may be appropriate that the national intelligence strategy while recognizing homeland security intelligence role for state local and tribal entities as well as the private sector does so only in general manner that does not stipulate the activities these communities will implement as part of the broader community of entities working to protect us national security it could also be argued that while the national intelligence strategy calls for state local and tribal entities to be connected to our homeland security and intelligence efforts it nevertheless envisions homeland security intelligence as being driven in large part by the federal entities most associated with the domestic intelligence ssionthat is the activities undertaken by the intelligence elements of the departments of justice and homeland security how the term connected is defined becomes of critical importance as it implies communication and the sharing of information among federal state and local intelligence officials 24 office of the director of national

2007 is more explicit about the role of state local tribal and even private sector elements it stresses that homeland security is shared responsibility26 consistent with this theme the strategy highlights the importance of collaboration in the realm of homeland security intelligence it characterizes the process of identifying locating and uncovering terrorist activitythe core objective of homeland security intelligenceas multifaceted the strategy specifies the ways government at all levels and the private sector need to contribute to the homeland security effort it also notes the importance of an integrated information sharing environment that supports the vertical and horizontal distribution of terrorismrelated information 27 the sharing of homeland security intelligence has been particular priority for the congress which directed the establishment of the information sharing environment in the irtp later in the implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 911 act congress directed dhs to undertake additional initiatives including the following28 establish departmentwide procedures for review and analysis of information provided by state local tribal and private sector elements integrate that information into dhs intelligence products and disseminate to federal partners within the ic evaluate how dhs components are utilizing homeland security information and participating in the information sharing environment establish dhs state local and regional fusion center initiative to establish partnerships with state local and regional fusion centers coordinate and oversee the creation of an interagency threat assessment and coordination group itacg that will bring state local and tribal law enforcement and intelligence analysts to work in the national counterterrorism center

associated with it includeand go beyondthe definitions of the two traditional types of intelligence commonly defined in law and executive orders foreign intelligence and counterintelligence and more recently definitions of these two types of intelligence have been supplemented by the terms national intelligence and intelligence related to national security as with most intelligencerelated terms individuals attach their own interpretations and perceptions to hsint while there may be some commonly held perceptions about how hsint is defined it is also possible that individuals use the terms freely but without true common understanding of the scope and breadth of activities that may be consistent with homeland security intelligence the primary statutory defini tion that applies is that which appears in the homeland security act of 2002 which defines homeland security information as any information possessed by federal state or local agency that related to the threat of terrorist activity b relates to the ability to prevent interdict or disrupt terrorist activity c would improve the identification or investigation of suspected terrorist or terrorist organization or d would improve the response to terrorist act 33 31 ibid 32 homeland security intelligence could likely be defined as more refined and finished version of homeland security information the nexus to terrorism and terroristrelated events is direct and compelling one complication of discerning what is homeland security information remains how the investigator or operator knows that the activity which they are investigating or monitoring is related to rrorism at the early stages of an investigation unless the predicate for the investigation is terrorismrelated eg pocket litter names phones numbers emails taken off of terrorist suspect or gathered from terrorist safe house an investigator may not know the possibly criminal activity they are monitoring is in preparation for terrorist event as result information gathered though investigation of criminal violation in the physical or cyber realm could very well be terrorism related and as such fall under the rubric of homeland security information given that there are substantial national and homeland security penalties for not sharing homeland security intelligence at least at the policy vel and to some extent at the operational level arguably there is now bias in favor of sharin g raw intelligence across levels of government more quickly than in the past the extent to which this information is shared systematically is an open question 33 see pl 107296 sec 892f the house committee on homeland security also defines homeland security information in terrorism context under rule iv subc ommittees it defines the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on intelligence information sharing and terrorism risk asse ssment as being in part intelligence and information sharing for the purpose of preventing preparing for

definition of homeland security information34 it is worthwhile to note that although dhs remains an organization designed to protect against all hazards the focus of homeland security information at least as defined in law is counterterrorism as illustrated below hsint can be more broadly interpreted to involve intelligence designed to protect against the inimical activities of narcotics traffickers organized criminals and others having international support networks and seeking to engage in activities that could undermine us national security another type of intelligence defined in statute is traditional or foreign intelligence which means information relating to the capabilities intentions and activities of foreign governments or elements thereof foreign organizations or foreign persons or international terrorism activities 35 the methods of traditional foreign intelligence collection fall into the following five areas imagery intelligence imint signals intellig ence sigint human intelligence humint measurement and signatures intelligence masint and open source intelligence osint36 while the meanings of these disciplines are relatively well known and commonly understood among intelligence professionals hsint is more nebulous because hsint is not necessarily sourcespecific some would question whether it should be referred to as collection discipline although it is true that numerous unique entities are within dhs and at the state and local government levels as well as within the private sector that are aggressively collecting homeland security information it is also true that many of the traditional aforementioned ints collect homeland security intelligence insofar as they provide information on terrorism threats that may originate globally yet are potentially manifested within us borders within dhs intelligence itself the osint 37 and humint38 collection methods are likely to be most prevalent39 the other type of intelligence codified in law is counterintelligence which is defined as information gathered and activities conducted to protect against espionage other intelligence activities sabotage or assassinations conducted for by or on behalf of foreign governments 34 dhs management directive 8110 intelligence integration and management issued january 30 2006 35 see 50 usc 401a 36 for detailed description for each of these

department against hostile intelligence and operational activities conducted by or on behalf of foreign powers or international terrorist activities 41 to some extent however at least for semantics if not necessarily for jurisdictional purposes the differences between foreign intelligence and counterintelligence were attenuated with the passage of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 the irtpa sought to remedy numerous problem s uncovered by the 911 commission one of which was the aforementioned gap between foreign and domestic intelligence the irtpa amended the national security act of 1947 50 usc 401a to read the terms national intelligence and intelligence related to national security refer to all intelligence regardless of source from which derived and including information gathered within or outside the united states that pertains as determined consistent with any guidance issued by the president to more than one united states government agency and b that involves i threats to the united states its people property or interests ii the development proliferation or use of weapons of mass destruction or iii any other matter bearing on us national or homeland security 42 as such hsint could be interpreted as synonymous with intelligence related to national security or some subset thereof framework for outlining the scope of hsint or at least the criteria by which it might be framed could prove helpful while there are numerous approaches to framing homeland security intelligence three possible approaches are discussed below

the limits and boundaries of these three possible approaches to framing hsint beyond geographic bounds another set of differentiating factors between these approaches is the extent to which if at all one believes homeland security intelligence is the sole purview of the federal government or more inclusive and cooperative federal state local tribal and private sector model 40 see 50 usc 401a 41

can be viewed some might argue rather simplistically in geographic and federalstatelocal government terms that is if the intelligence collection activity takes place within the united stateswhether it be by federal agency or state local tribal or private sector actor it would be considered hsint under this approach while hsints activities are constrained by borders the yield from homeland securitys collection and analysis could be combined with foreign intelligence to develop more complete picture of homeland security threats others might counter that the problem with this type of approach is that as the events of september 11 2001 demonstrated clearly national borders increasingly have little meaning in determining threats to us national and homeland security as has been well documented by numerous studies 43 the planning for the events of 911 took place largely overseas but the acts were executed within us borders an intelligence approach that considered only activities associated with homegrown threats without more integrated global perspective on the threat would miss one of the central lessons learned from 911the importance of integrating intelligence related to threats to national security regardless of the geographic location of the source g21g157g155g158g140g157g158g155g138g149g550g21g157g138g157g158g157g152g155g162g561g3g153g153g155g152g138g140g145g561 homeland security intelligence could be viewed as primarily federal activity geography is not as important under this approach as the federal entities that engage in homeland security intelligence may directly or indirectly collect information outside the united states for example the fbi through its legal attaché legat program has 75 legat offices and sub offices providing coverage for over 200 countries islands and territories 44 through these offices it collects principally criminal information through open liaison with international law enforcement counterparts more specifically under this approach hsint is federal activity that is engaged in by certain statutory members of the intelligence community thus of the 16 agencies that are statutory members of the ic under this approach perhaps only four would engage in domestic intelligence activitiesthe intelligence elements of the fbi 45 dhs ia and 43 see joint inquiry into intelligence community activities befo re and after the terrorist

this approach hsint is not bounded by geographic constraints level of government or perceived mutual mistrust between public and private sectors that is the approach recognizes borders and is neither top down nor bottom up it involves and values equally information collected by the us private sector owners of national critical infrastructure intelligence related to national security collected by federal state local and tribal law enforcement officers as well as the traditional ints collected by statutory members of the ic it involves strategic and tactical intelligence 46 designed to prevent attacks on the us homeland as well as highly tactical and eventdriven information coordination that must take place in response to terrorist attack or national disaster47 continued including criminal

widely held to be an undisputable public good48 achieving effective levels of information exchange is challenging goal49 as former vice chair of the 911 commission lee h hamilton stated you can change the law you can change the technology but you still need to change the culture you need to motivate institutions and individuals to share information50 administration officials have recognized these challenges ambassador thomas mcnamara the program manager for the information sharing environment ise 51 testified that the breadth and complexity of the information sharing challenge should not be underestimated information silos cultural issues and other barriers that inhibit sharing still exist today52 under the holistic approach the hsint community might include the 16 statutory members of the ic as each collects national intelligence or intelligence related to national security which could have profound impact on homeland secu rity the national counterterrorism center national counterintelligence center national counter proliferation center and the open source intelligence center the 14 existing private sector information sharing and analysis centers isacs 53 scores of state and local law enforcement entities charged with gathering criminal intelligence numerous state and regional intelligence fusion centers54 and federal entities with law enforcement responsibilities which may collect intelligence related to national security this holistic approach implies an interdependency between the diverse players of the statutory ic and the broader hsint community as ambassador henry crumpton former cia case officer 48 there are however some valid arguments for not sharing ll intelligence with all stakeholders information security operational security counterintelligence and the need to know principle remain valid concerns in the national security community moreover some would argue that there may be limited utility to sharing classified information with stakeholders that dont have appropriate dedicated resources to enable them to take security and other countermeasure actions based on the intelligence provided 49 for an assessment of

state department states although there are differences between intelligence and law enforcement the primary customer for domestic foreign intelligence on nearterm threats is law enforcement and law enforcement can provide valuable leads for intelligence officers the intelligence collector and the law enforcement consumer therefore must strive for more than information sharing they must seek interdependence55 calls for interdependence between foreign intelligence and security or criminal intelligence today mirror those made nearly thirty years ago by dr kent who wrote the real picture of the diversity in kinds of intelligence lies in this truth very great many of the arbitrarily defined branches of intelligence are interdependent each may have its welldefined primary target which it makes its primary concern but both the pursuit of this target and the byproducts of pursuing it bring most of the independent branches into some sort of relationship with the others intelligence as an activity is at its best when this fact is realized and acted upon in good faith 56 the challenge then as now is to implement such vision where all players in the facto hsint community would be treated as partners with value to add what has changed substantially since dr kents seminal work is the addition of state local and private sector actors as both producers and consumers of intelligence it is herein the interaction with these relatively new players that the dhs intelligence enterprise has great role to play the clear elucidation of hsint role and responsibilities and implementation particularly between the fbi and dhs intelligence remains an evolving process broader understanding of the members and functions of the hsint community and the dhs members of the community may be helpful in assessment of these matters

in jennifer sims and burton gerber transforming us intelligence georgetown university press 2005 p 210 ambassador crumpton differentiates domestic foreign intelligence from domestic security intelligence the former according to ambassador crumpton would best be collected by formally trained intelligence cas officers analogous to those within the central intelligence agencys directorate of operations by contrast domestic security intelligence according to crumpton would best be undertaken by new hybrid of professional the special agentcase officer saco ambassador crumpton recommends the establishment of domestic security intelligence corps with its own budget and personnel preferably as part of the fbi but under the explicit direction of us intelligence leadership some would argue

members and collective responsibilities of this community depend to some extent on how one bounds the function of hsint as mentioned bove the broader the definition of hsint the wider the range of players in the community if one adopts the holistic model of hsint the hsic would include broad range of agencies many of which are hybrid agencies undertaking homeland security law enforcement

treasurys office of terrorism and financial intelligence and the department of energys doe office of intelligence and counterintelligence 60 numerous state and local law enforcement entities and the state and regional intelligence fusion centers would fall under broad interpretation of homeland security intelligence finally the private sector particularly those sectors outlined as being part of us critical infrastructure as fined under hspd7 would also fall into broadly defined concept of homeland intelligence community an interesting comparison can be drawn between the hsic and the statutory ic as defined in the national security act of 1947 as amended and in subsequent executive orders one general definition of the ic is federation of executive branch agencies and organizations that conduct intelligence activities necessary for the conduct of foreign relations and protection of national security61 federation differs from community insofar as the constituent elements of federation by definition give up some degree of authority to more central body community by contrast implies group of persons or entities merely having common interests but not necessarily bound together by any formal power sharing arrangements or agreements while the ic has arguably moved more in the direction of federation with the establishment of director of national intelligence dni62 one could argue the hsic broadly defined remains very much community spread across federal state local go vernment sectors as well as the private sector the diffuse nature of broadly defined hsic may be dictated by the very nature of the function itself that is if state local tribal and private sector members are valued and contributing 58 ibid 59 the mission of usnorthcom is to anticipate and
