financing and related programs summary the annual foreign operations appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which congress reviews the us foreign aid budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally it contains the largest share over twothirds of total us international affairs spending president bush requested 15167 billion for fy2002 foreign operations an amount 15 higher than enacted fy2001 appropriations by comparison foreign policy resources proposed for state department contributions and other non foreign aid activities would increase by 132 from fy2001 in nominal terms although the overall fy2002 foreign operations proposed increase was relatively small 224 million some activities funded in fy2001 would either not need new appropriations or would require smaller resources in fy2002 thereby freeing up funds for other initiatives after adjusting the fy2001 base amount to reflect these reduced funding requirements that did not alter current policy the request represented higher increase for foreign operations 698 million or 48 more in nominal terms the fy2002 foreign operations request set most accounts at or near fy2001 funding levels while largely concentrating proposals to increase spending in few areas disaster aid global health international narcotics control and contributions to the world bank and other international financial institutions likewise the budget submission recommended cutting appropriations significantly in two accounts debt reduction resources for the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative and the exportimport bank but only the latter represented policy shift except in one area the fy2002 budget request represented few changes in the list of top us foreign aid recipients israel egypt and jordan remained the leading recipients the most significant change was the increase in aid for latin american drug producing nations under the administrations andean counterdrug initiative colombia peru and bolivia would be among the leading 10 recipients of us aid following nearly six months of debate congress cleared for the president on december 20 2001 1535 billion foreign operations appropriations for fy2002 pl 107115 hr 2506 the measure is roughly midway between levels passed earlier by the house 1517 billion and the senate 1552 billion and 178 million higher than requested by the president this marks one of the few occasions when congress has approved more spending for foreign operations than sought by the administration the amount is about 400 million or 27 higher than for fy2001 excluding the 11 billion for foreign operations programs allocated from the terrorism emergency supplemental measure pl 10738 highlights of the bill include 779 million for the exportimport bank nearly 100 million more than requested 475 million for hivaids up from the 429 million proposal and 625 million for the andean counternarc otics initiative cut of 106 million

hr 2506 president bush signed the measure on january 10 2002 pl 107115 passage of the bill broke monthlong impasse over housesenate disagreements concerning international family planning and abortion issues as enacted hr 2506 drops senate language that would have overturned the presidents abortion restrictions on bilateral us population assistance but appropriates funding for family planning programs closer to the higher amounts recommended by the senate 4465 million for usaid activities and 34 million for the population fund unfpa subsequently the white house placed hold on unfpa funds while it reviews the organizations program in china decision on how much if any of the 34 million will be released has been made the 1535 billion appropriation is roughly midway betwe levels passed earlier by the house 1517 billion and the senate 1552 billion and 178 million higher than requested by the president this marks one of the few occasions when congress has approved more spending for foreign operations than sought by the administration the amount is about 400 million or 27 higher than for fy2001 excluding the 11 billion for foreign operations programs allocated from the terrorism emergency supplemental measure pl 10738 highlights of the enacted bill include 779 million for the exportimport bank nearly 100 million more than requested 475 million for hivaids up from the 429 million proposal and 625 million for the andean counternarcotics initiative cut of 106 million from the request hr 2506 further allows the president to waive restrictions on aid to azerbaijan through at least december 31 2002 azerbaijan is one of several regional states that has offered support in the war against terrorism the measure also provides armenia with 90 million in economic aid and 43 million in military assistance introduction the annual foreign operations appropr iations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which congress reviews and votes on the us foreign assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs2 1 although the foreign operations appropriations bill is often characterized as the foreign aid spending measure it does not include funding for all foreign aid programs food aid administered under the pl 480 program is appropriated in the agriculture appropriations bill foreign operations also includes funds for the exportimport bank an activity that is not regarded as foreign aid but as trade promotion program in recent years funding for food aid and the eximbank have been about the same so that foreign operations and the official foreign aid budget are nearly identical throughout this report references to foreign operations and foreign aid are used interchangeably 2 another international humanitarian aid program food assistance or pl 480 title ii grants is funded under the agriculture appropriations billfigure 1 foreign policy budget fy2002budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally1 it contains the largest share about twothirds of total international affairs spending by the united states see figure 1 the legislation funds all us bilateral development assistance programs managed mostly by the us agency for international development usaid together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies such as the peace corps and the interamerican and african development foundations most humanitarian aid activities are funded within foreign operations including usaids disaster program and the state departments refugee relief support 2 foreign operations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the former soviet union also referred to as the independent states account and centraleastern europe activities that are jointly managed by usaid and the state department security assistance economic and military aid for israel and egypt is also part of the foreign operations spending measure as are smaller security aid programs administered largely by the state department in conjunction with usaid and the pentagon us contributions to the world bank and other regional multilateral development banks managed by the treasury department and voluntary payments to international organizations handled by the state department are also funded in the foreign operations bill finally the legislation includes appropriations for three export promotion agencies the overseas private investment corporation opic the exportimport bank and the trade and development agencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs3 from the perspective of congressional oversight and involvement in us foreign aid policymaking the foreign operations bill has taken on even greater significance during the past 16 years congress has not enacted foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 leaving most foreign assistance programs without regular authorizations emanating from the legislative oversight committees as result foreign operations spending measures developed by the appropriations committees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues and played major role in shaping authorizing and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war the legislation has also been key tool used by congress to apply restrictions and conditions on administration management of foreign assistance actions that have frequently resulted in executivelegislativ

budget request to congress on april 9 2001 including funding proposals for foreign operations appropriations programs house and senate appropriations committees are holding hearings on the proposal prior to marking up funding legislation the house foreign operations subcommittee adopted draft spending bill on june 27 measure that was amended and approved by the full appropriations committee on july 10 the bill hr 2506 was reported on july 17 the house passed hr 2506 on july 24 after adopting several amendments the senate appropriations committee ordered reported its fy2002 foreign operations appropriations measure on july 26 but did not file its report until september 4 the senate passed hr 2506 on october 24 adopting numerous amendments including some addressing antiterrorism issues conferees met on november 14 to work out differences between the two bills but could not finalize few issues in dispute until december 19 when conference report was filed the house passed the conference measure on the same day 35666 while the senate adopted it on december 20 by voice vote president bush signed the legislation on january 10 2002 pl 107115 earlier the senate as part of hr 2216 fy2001 supplemental appropriations act voted to include 100 million for an initial us contribution to new global fund to fight hivaids malaria and tuberculosis conferees approved the additional 100 million for the global fund partially offsetting the new resourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs4 figure 2 foreign operations appropriations fy19772002with 20 million rescissions in prior year child survival and esf appropriations congress cleared the measure on july 20 pl 10720 the administration requested 200 million 100 million of which would be drawn from foreign operations spending but for fy2002 not from fy2001 as pl 10720 provided foreign operations funding trends in real terms taking into account the effects of inflation foreign operations funding levels have fluctuated widely over the past 25 years some of these swings however are not the result of policy decisions but due to technical budget accounting changes involving how congress scores various programs for example the large increase in fy1981 did not represent higher funding levels but rather the fact that export credit programs began to be counted as appropriations rather than as off budget items part of the substantial rise in spending in fy1985 came as result of the requirement to appropriate the full amount of military aid loans rather than only partial appropriation required in the past beginning in fy1992 congress changed how all federal credit programs are scored in appropriation bills which further altered the scoring of foreign aid loans funded in foreign operations all of these factors make it very difficult to present precise and consistent data trend line in foreign operations funding levels nevertheless the data shown in figure 2 can be regarded as illustrative of general trends in congressional decisions regarding foreign operations appropriations over the past 25 years after peaking at nearly 33 billion in fy1985 constant fy2002 dollars foreign operations appropri ations began period of decline to 136 billion in fy1997 with only brief period of higher amounts in the early 1990s due to special supplementals for panama and nicaragua 1990 countries affected by the gulf war 1991 and the former soviet states 1993 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs5 arguing that declining international affairs resources seriously undermined us foreign policy interests and limited the ability of american officials to influence overseas events administration officials and other outside groups vigorously campaigned to reverse the decadelong decline in the foreign policy budget for fy1998 congress approved 6 increase for foreign operations followed by an even larger 155 increase for fy1999 levels rose further to 174 billion 5 in fy2000 marking the highest foreign operations appropriations in eight years all figures in constant fy2002 dollars similar to increased funding during the early 1990s the large additional foreign operation budgets in fy1999 and fy2000 resulted from significant supplemental spending addressing international contingencies including central american hurricane relief kosovo emergency assistance wye rivermiddle east peace accord support and counternarcotics initiative in colombia table 2 foreign operations appropriations fy1995 to fy2002 discretionary budget authority in billions of current dollars fy1995 fy1996 fy1997 fy1998 fy1999

terrorism emergency supplemental appropriation pl 10738 for foreign operations programs with much smaller supplemental 80 million for the global health fund enacted for fy2001 foreign operations fell to 154 billion in real terms the fy2002 enacted amount is 1535 billion slightly less than fy2001 calculated using constant fy2002 dollars table 2 above presents the enacted foreign operations funding levels for recent years expressed in nominal or current dollars that does not take into account the effects of inflation examined in nominal terms the fy2002 amount represents 27 increase over fy2001 as share of the entire 19 trillion us budget for fy2001 foreign operations represented 079 share as portion of discretionary budget authority that part of the budget provided in annual appropriation acts other than appropriated entitlements foreign operations consumed 23 by comparison at the high point of foreign operations spending in fy1985 foreign aid funds represented 2 of the total us budget and 46 of discretionary budget authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs6 data notes unless otherwise indicated this report expresses dollar amounts in terms of discretionary budget authority the foreign operations appropriations bill includes one mandatory program that is not included in figures and tables usaids foreign service retirement fund the retirement fund is scheduled to receive 445 million for fy2002 in addition funding levels and trends discussed in this report exclude us contributions to the international monetary fund imf proposals that are enacted periodically about every five years in foreign operations bills congress approved 179 billion for the imf in fy1999 the first appropriation since fy1993 including these large infrequent and uniquely scored imf appropriations tends to distort general analysis of foreign operations funding trends although congress provides new budget authority through appropriations for the full amount of us participation the transaction is considered an exchange of assets between the united states and the imf and results in outlays from the us treasury in short the appropriations are offset by the creation of us counterpart claim on the imf that is liquid and interest bearing for more see crs report 96279 us budgetary treatment of the imf foreign operations the fy2002 budget resolution and sec 302b allocations usually appropriation committees begin markups of their spending bills only after congress has adopted budget resolution and funds have been distributed to the appropriations panels under what is referred to as the section 302a allocation process reference to the pertinent authority in the congressional budget act following this house and senate appropriations committees separately decide how to allot the total amount available among their 13 subcommittees staying within the functional guidelines set in the budget resolution this second step is referred to as the section 302b allocation foreign operations funds fall within the international affairs budget function function 150 representing in most years about 65 of the function total smaller amounts of function 150 are included in three other appropriation bills how much international affairs money to allocate to each of the four subcommittees and how to distribute the funds among the numerous programs remain decisions exclusively reserved for the appropriations committees nevertheless overall ceilings set in the budget resolution can have significant implications for the budget limitations within which the house and senate foreign operations subcommittees will operate when they meet to mark up their annual appropriation bills in march and april 2001 the house and senate respectively adopted different versions of an fy2002 budget blueprint hconres 83 for international affairs the housepassed measure supported the bush administration request of 239 billion in discretionary budget authority the resolution adopted by the senate increasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs7 foreign policy spending to 242 billion by adopting an amendment by senator frist to boost international hivaids resources by 200 million in fy2002 and 500 million in fy2003 the senate further approved kerry amendment adding 50 million annually for 10 years for international climate change programs the conference agreement on hconres 83 as passed by both houses during the week of may 7 however modified the approach taken by house and senate approved resolutions the approved version of hconres 83 set discretionary budget authority for each budget function including international affairs at the cbo baseline estimate the cbo baseline estimate was roughly the fy2001 level plus inflation based on the cbo baseline estimate the international affairs discretionary budget for fy2002 in hconres 83 was 232 billion an amount 700 million below the presidents request conferees however noted in their report hrept 10755 that figures for each budget function were included for presentation purposes and except for the defense function which assumes the presidents request the amounts do not reflect any specific policy orientation instead house and senate appropriations committees became responsible for allocating total discretionary budget authority to each of their 13 subcommittees to address specific policy priorities the only requirement was that the appropriation committees remained within the 6613 billion total discretionary budget authority level approved in the resolution prior to marking up the first of the 13 appropriation bills for fy2002 house and senate appropriation committees issued their initial sec 302b allocations the house panel provided 15168 billion the same amount as president bushs request the senate committee provided 15524 billion 357 million more than the proposal this marked the first time in several years that the initial foreign operations allocation had been set at or above the presidents request more common had been the practice of setting the early mark 12 billion below the budget recommendation level that was later revised upwards the difference earlier this year was that both committees had sufficient funds during their initial markups to accommodate if they chose the presidents request and in the senates case some additional funding initiatives while the overall level basically matched or exceeded the executives proposed budget the house made several changes in how the funds would be allocated among the various accounts and programs as did the senate appropriations committee when it met in late july postterrorist attack foreign operations allocation even before the september 11 terrorist strikes congress was debating whether to increase the 561 billion discretionary budget ceiling for fy2002 in order to augment funding for defense education and several natural disasters following the attacks congressional leaders and the white house agreed to add 25 billion to accommodate increasing spending needs move pushing the ceiling up to 686 billion under revised 302b subcommittee allocation foreign operations received 1535 billion midway between the earlier house and senate levels and reflecting the amount available for conference committee negotiators when they met to reconcile differences between house and senate versions of the foreign operations spending billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs8 3 all comparisons between the fy2002 request and enacted fy2001 appropriations include for fy2001 80 million in additional foreign operations spending approved in pl 10720 the fy2001 supplemental appropriations in real terms taking into the effects of inflation the fy2002 proposal is about 06 less than current spendingforeign operations appropriations request for fy2002 and congressional consideration request overview in april 2001 president bush asked congress to appropriate 15167 billion for fy2002 foreign operations he subsequently amended the request on june 11 adding 200 million for us contribution to the new global fund to fight hivaids malaria and tuberculosis since the entire amount consists of transfers from existing requests and prior year appropriations including 100 million from the health and human services request there is change to the overall amount of foreign operations the amended foreign operations fy2002 request stands at 15167 billion an amount 15 higher than enacted fy2001 appropriations3 in contrast foreign policy resources for state department assessed contributions and other nonforeign aid activities in the commerce justice and state departments appropriation bill would increase by 132 from fy2001 in nominal terms although the overall fy2002 foreign operations proposed increase was relatively small 224 million or 15 some activities funded in fy2001 either did not need new appropriati ons or would require smaller resources in fy2002 thereby freeing up funds for other initiatives for example fy2001 totals included onetime funding for southern africa flood relief 135 million and compensation to china for the mistaken bombing of its embassy in belgrade 28 million ten year plan to reduce aid to israel and egypt will enter its fourth year resulting in net reduction of 100 million for the two largest american aid recipients the third and final year of us pledged contributions to the heavily indebted poor country hipc debt initiative required roughly half the amount appropriated in fy2001 435 million after revising the fy2001 base amount to reflect these reduced funding requirements that did not alter current policy the request represented somewhat higher increase for foreign operations 698 million or 48 more in nominal terms the fy2002 foreign operations request set most accounts at or near fy2001 funding levels while largely concentrating proposals to increase spending in few areas disaster aid would grow by 22 to 200 million international narcotics control funding including the new andean initiative would nearly triple to 948 million global fund to fight hivaids malari and tuberculosis would receive 200 million new initiative for fy2002 for which 100 million would be drawn from foreign operations and 100httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs9 million from the health and human services budget congress accelerated the us contribution by including 100 million from foreign operations spending in the fy2001 supplemental appropriations pl 10720 contributions to the world bank and other international financial institutions would increase by 6 to 12 billion and cover all scheduled us payments to the multilateral development banks the request however included funds for the 500 million arrears owed by the united states likewise the budget submission recommended cutting appropriations significantly in two accounts only the first of which represented policy shift exportimport bank funds would drop by 245 to 687 million debt reduction resources for the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative would fall by onehalf to 224 million but were sufficient to fully fund the pledged us contribution to the multi year debt relief program table 3 summary of foreign

would be among the leading 12 recipients of us aid in the aftermath of the september 11 terrorist attacks the planned allocation of foreign aid funds changed in few and significant ways the administration has used economic and military assistance as an additional tool in efforts to maintain cohesive international coalition to conduct the war on terrorism pakistan for example key

antiterrorism assistance and 4 million for terrorist interdiction senate debate on hr 2506 occurred after the september 11 terrorist attacks providing the opportunity to attach several amendments aimed at postattack relief and response the most actively debated amendment dealt with efforts to set aside prohibitions on us assistance to azerbaijan for nearly decade section 907 of the freedom support act pl 102511 has banned all but some export promotion humanitarian and democracy building us aid to azerbaijan until it ceases blockades and use of force against armenia and karabakh according to the state department azerbaijan has joined the international coalition to fight terrorism and granted the united states overflight rights the use of its air bases and has provided important intelligence cooperation the section 907 ban however stood in the way of utilizing the azerbaijan government support the senate amendment sponsored by senator brownback and modified by senator mcconnell allowed the president to waive section 907 until december 31 2002 if he certified that it was necessary to counter terrorism and that any us aid would not undermi ne or hamper ongoing efforts to negotiate peaceful settlement between armenia and azerbaijan or be used for offensive purposes against armenia the president could extend the waiver annually after the end of 2002 in addition the senate adopted an amendment by senator mcconnell earmarking 46 million in military aid and training to armenia the administration had not requested military assistance for armenia4 for

operating expenses account peaked in fy2000 at 226 million but fell to 125 million in fy2001 and would decline further to 106 million in fy2002 the administration says that the reduction is the result of variation in usaids relocation expenses to move to more secure temporary facilities or to colocate with an embassy5 some estimate that usaid needs over 140 million to bring its overseas facilities

spending bills routinely include general provisions prohibiting us assistance to countries engaged in terrorist activities or providing certain types of support to terrorist groups included in the fy2002 funding measure are two sec 527 prohibits bilateral us assistance to any country that the president determines grants sanctuary from prosecution to any individual or group which has committed an act of international terrorism or otherwise supports international terrorism the president may waive the restrictions for national security or humanitarian reasons sec 544 prohibits any us aid to government which provides lethal military equipment to country that the secretary of state has determined is headed by terrorist government the president may waive the requirement if it is important to us national interests despite these restrictions however certain types of humanitarian foreign assistance may be provided notwithstanding other provisions of law which would override the terrorism restrictions disaster and refugee relief child survival and hivaids programs emergency food and medicine and demining operations are among the categories of us assistance that could potentially be provided to country that would otherwise be ineligible additional aid debt relief and the relaxation of sanctions to countries supporting us counterterrorism efforts as the united states attempts to build strong international coalition of nations to combat terrorism steps have been take to augment levels of economic and security assistance and debt reliefhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs18 planned for fy2002 and beyond this is consistent with previous situations such as the persian gulf war during which the united states cancelled 67 billion of debt owed by egypt and increased bilateral aid to israel and turkey pakistan which has pledged full support to the united states has said it needs financial aid and debt cancellation to bolster its ailing economy pakistan owes the united states roughly 3 billion and was scheduled to receive economic aid totaling 7 million in fy2002 to support democracy promotion and basic education programs pakistan however was barred from receiving nonhumanitarian bilateral foreign aid due to two foreign operations restrictions of assisting countries that have undergone military coup and which are more than year in arrears on debt payments to the united states the president used his special but limited authority sec 614a of the foreign assistance act of 1961 on september 28 and october 16 to channel 100 million in economic assistance to pakistan but he required legislative authority as provided in s 1465 that passed congress and was signed by the president on october 27 pl 10757 to provide more assistance in the face of the two foreign operations restrictions the president further announced on november 10 1 billion aid package for pakistan that will include debt relief imf loans and trade assistance direct us economic aid for pakistan totals 600 million including 100 million from the earlier release of the 1 billion package the administration has also allocated 91 million in additional economic and military support for uzbekistan turkey and other central asian states all of these amounts are drawn from the 40 billion antiterrorism emergency supplement appropriations pl 10738 the congress approved in september congress further added an additional 50 million for humanitarian and reconstruction needs in afghanistan when it allocated hr 3338 the second 20 billion portion of pl 10738 funds congressional debate prior to the terrorist attacks of september 11 congress in preliminary action on hr 2506 had fully supporte d the presidents antiterrorism assistance 38 million and terrorist interdiction program requests 4 million house and senate bills further provided the requested total for usaid operating expenses which would permit the agency to move forward with its 106 million physical security plans for fy2002 these same levels are sustained in the enacted text of hr 2506 hr 2506 further continues for fy2002 the same two general provisions regarding aid restrictions for countries supporting terrorism sections 527 and 544 as noted above congress agreed to the senate provision lifting the ban on us aid to azerbaijan until at least december 31 2002 if the president certifies that the assistance is necessary to support american counterterrorism efforts finally hr 2506 as passed includes senate amendment earmarking 15 million for programs to foster democracy human rights press

million to train governments to combat terrorist financing the final 20 billion allocation notified to congress on october 16 did not include additional funds for foreign operations programs but did propose the transfer of 50 million from fy2001 state department embassy security funds to usaid for the construction of secure usaid facilities in kenya and uganda as enacted as part of the defense department appropriation bill hr 3338 congress did not approve the 50 million transfer but did add 50 million for additional usaid humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in afghanistanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs20 6 this section is drawn from crs report 98568 exportimport bank background and legislative issues by james k jackson for more information on the issue see the complete reportexportimport bank6 the exportimport bank is the chief us government agency that helps finance american exports with budget of nearly 1 billion the bank finances around 2 of us exports year eximbank provides guarantees and insurance to commercial banks to make trade credits available to us exporters the bank also offers direct financing to us exporters on limited basis primarily to counter subsidized trade credits offered to foreign exporters by their governments such governmentsponsored trade financing however has long been controversial one rationale for the exportimport bank is the acknowledged competition among nations official export financing agencies most economists doubt however that nation can improve its welfare over the long run by subsidizing exports economic policies within individual countries are the prime factors which determine interest rates capital flows and often exchange rates which in turn largely determine the overall level of nations exports this means that at the national level subsidized export financing merely shifts production among sectors within the economy rather than adding to the overall level of economic activity and subsidizes foreign consumption at the expense of the domestic economy this also means that promoting exports through subsidized financing or through governmentbacked insurance and guarantees will not permanently raise the level of employment in the economy but it will alter the composition of employment among the various sectors of the economy some eximbank opponents argue that the banks programs serve only to aid the richest american firms nevertheless the bank also is attempting to make its programs more accessible to small businesses which account for 12 to 15 of the banks total authorizations some opponents further argue that by providing financing or insurance for exporters that the market seems unwilling or unable to provide eximbanks activities draw from the financial resources within the economy that would be available for other uses another consideration is that subsidized export financing raises financing costs for all borrowers by drawing on financial resources that otherwise would be available for other uses thereby possibly crowding out some borrowers from the financial markets this crowdingout effect might nullify any positive impact subsidized export financing may have on the economy eximbank supporters maintain that the banks programs are necessary for us exporters to compete with foreign subsidized export financing and also to pressure foreign governments to eliminate concessionary financing as result eximbank is required in the banks act to provide us exporter s with financing terms that are competitive with those offered by other official trade financing institutions these and other supporters of the bank also stress that deficiencies in financial markets bias those markets against exports of high value longterm assets for fy2002 the bush administration proposed 223 million or 25 cut in spending for the exportimport bank the administration estimated that about 120 million of the reduction was the result of lower risks in countries where the eximbank would lend because the level of risk and prospects for repayment are factors inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs21 determining how much must be appropriated this part of the proposed cut would not affect the level of bank financing but the remaining reduction of about 100 million would limit the exportimport banks ability to meet continuing demands from american exporters the administration said that bank lending would focus on us businesses that have access to private financing and would seek to increase the risk sharing with the private sector export coalitions opposed the proposed funding reduction arguing that it would result in fewer us exports lost american jobs and would come at time when major trading competitors were increasing their own export credit activities congressional debate the house in hr 2506 provided 787 million for the exportimport bank about midway between the amounts for fy2001 and the administrations proposed cut for fy2002 the house appropriations committee had recommended 805 million level it believed would permit the bank to maintain authorizations about 2 billion higher than this year and 1 billion more than proposed for fy2002 the full house adopted an amendment visclosky reducing the appropriation level by 18 million an action some estimated would cut eximbank loan guarantees by 275 million from what the committee recommended amendment proponents argued that last year over the objections of the white house and some lawmakers the bank extended an 18 million loan guarantee package to benxi iron and steel in china this they claimed hurt american workers in the steel industry by extending credits to chinese firm that was involved in an antidumping case before the international trade commission critics of the amendment argued that reduced eximbank funding would have little impact on the loan guarantee issued last year to benxi iron and steel but would cut into resources available to other american exporters trying to compete internationally the senate bill as reported from committee had provided somewhat higher funding level than the house 806 million an amount the committee believed would increase bank financing in support of about 1 billion more exports than in fy2001 an amendment offered during senate debate on hr 2506 however reduced the banks funding level to 780 million slightly below the house amount the reduction was part of larger package of offsets for increases in hivaids and other global health funding as enacted hr 2506 provides 779 million slightly below house and senate passed levels but 92 million higher than the request conferees noted that the appropriation would provide the exim bank with an authorized operation level of 106 billion about 15 higher than for fy2001 as an interim measure the foreign operations appropriations further extends the banks operating authority which had expired on september 30 2001 to march 31 2002 pending legislation in the house and senate hr 2871 and s 1372 would extend the authority through 2005 and 2006 respectively development aid policy priorities since the end of the cold war recurring debate has focused on what should replace the anticommunist foreign aid rationale more fundamental question raised by some especially critics of development assistance is whether the united states needs to maintain an active globally focused economic aid program many of these critics argue that aid can be transformed into smaller more targeted and often privatized instrument to supporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs22 only the highest priority us foreign policy interests perspective promoted by senator helms and others suggests that development assistance could have more significant impact if it was managed to greater extent by nongovernmental organizations especially faithbased groups rather than by the us agency for international development usaid senator helms for number of years has advocated the abolishme nt of usaid the creation of separate foundation that would issue development aid bloc grants to ngos universities and other private groups and transfer the remaining responsibilities of usaid to the state department the clinton administration strongly supported the retention of an activist foreign aid policy which was used to bolster variety of us foreign policy initiatives around the world during the 1990s usaid based its program strategies around the principle of sustainable development and the goals of promoting economic growth stabilizing global population and protecting health protecting the environment advancing democracy developing human capacity through education and providing humanitarian relief congress maintains its own development aid funding priorities that in recent years have emphasized programs supporting child survival basic education and efforts to combat hivaids and other infectious diseases the administration also backed these programs but officials objected to congressional efforts to increase funding for children and health activities at the expense of other development sectors when congress increased appropriations for its priorities but cut the overall development aid budget some areas including economic growth and the environment received substantially reduced funding for fy2002 the bush administration sought 2368 billion for development aid funded in the two foreign operations accounts of child surviva lhealth programs and develop ment assistance this represented an increase of 133 million or 6 over fy2001 levels most of the additional resources would fall in three areas bilateral hivaids funding would grow by 30 million to 329 million basic education for children would increase by 20 million to 123 million and 80 million would be available for new global fund to fight hivaids malaria and tuberculosis the global fund contribution would total 200 million with 100 million coming from the department of health and human services budget and 20 million from the fy2001 foreign operations bill during testimony at his confirmat ion hearing on april 25 usaid administratordesignee andrew natsios expressed strong support for agriculture and food security programs areas that would also receive additional funding in the fy2002 request for most other development aid activities it appeared that spending would remain the same or decline beyond budget issues usaid has realigned the core goals of sustainable development of the previous administr ation and will allocate funds around three spheres of emphasis that include global health economic growth and agriculture and conflict prevention and developmental relief the bush administration further planned to launch new initiative the global development alliance in an effort to expand publicprivat partnerships in development program implementation under the proposal usaid would identify good development opportunit ies being conducted by private foundations nongovernmental organizations universities and forprofit organizations and provide parallel financing to leverage resources already committed to these activities usaid officials envision that the agency will becomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs23 7 all comparisons of development and child survivalhealth funding levels are based on the modified account structure proposed by the house and senate appropriations committees in the fy2002 funding bills the committees recommend four major changes in the grouping of programs funded within the development and child survivalhealth accounts 1 basic education is moved from child survival to the development account 2 reproductive healthpopulation aid is moved from the development to the child survival account 3 funds for the interamerican foundation and the african development foundation are not included in the development account but separately under independent agencies and 4 the proposed us contribution to the global

more of coordinating and integrating institution to expand and enhance development efforts of these nongovernmental development partners roughly 160 million would be set aside in fy2002 to finance these projects on the issue of usaid reorganization secretary of state powell told several congressional committees that he would listen to proposals to abolish usaid or merge it into the state department but that he was not inclined to propose any change in the current organizational alignment congressional debate legislation passed by the house included 2523 billion in development assistance for fy2002 level 155 million above the request and nearly 200 million higher than amounts for fy20017 the house considered several amendments adopting some and rejecting others that proposed increases beyond committeerecommend ed levels for health programs see above under house consideration of hr 2506 the house bill fully funded the proposed 100 million us contribution for the

table 5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs25 compares several development and child survivalhealth program funding levels that received specific attention in both house and senate versions of hr 2506 like the house the senate appropriations committee found merit with the concept of the global development alliance but felt insufficient details had been provided pending further consultations the committee directs that program funds can be set aside for gda activities as enacted hr 2506 provides 26 billion for the two usaid core development assistance accounts an amount roughly 12 higher than for fy2001 and the administrations request for fy2002 nearly every major program priority listed in table 5 receives significant funding boost over last year and in many cases above the presidents budget proposal although amounts for hivaids are set at 475 million below both the house and senate levels the conference report directs that fewer of these funds be transferred as part of us contribution to the global health trust fund for combating aids tuberculosis and malaria consequently 435 million of the earmark remains for bilateral hivaids programs rather than 427 million assumed in the house bill and 395 million assumed in the senate measure other significant increases above fy2001 levels enacted in hr 2506 include unicef contribution up 9 from fy2001 malaria up onethird micronutrients up 20 basic education up 46 women in development up 50 conferees also opened the way for usaid to launch its global development alliance initiative although with conditions usaid must first provide the appropriations committees with additional details about how the gda would operate and engage in further consultations if necessary the conference report further limits to 20 million rather than 160 million amounts that usaid can allocate or reserve for gda programs in fy2002 and requires the agency to notify the committees prior to obligating such funds family planning and abortion restrictions the debate over international family planning policy and abortion began nearly three decades ago when congress added provision to the foreign assistance act of 1961 prohibiting the use of us appropriated funds for abortionrelated activities and coercive family planning programs during the mid1980s in what has become known as the mexico city policy because it was first announced at the 1984 mexico city population conference the reagan and later the bush administrations restricted funds for foreign nongovernmental organizations ngos that were involved in performing or promoting abortions in countries where they worked even if such activities were undertaken with nonus funds several groups including international planned parenthood federationlondon ippflondon became ineligible for us financial support in some years congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibition but white house vetoes kept the policy in place president clinton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors allowing the united states to resume funding for all family planning organizations so long as us money was used by those involved in abortionrelated workhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs26 8 white house memorandum for the administrator of the united states agency for continuedduring the past five years the house and senate have taken opposing positions on the mexico city issue that in each case held up enactment of the final foreign operations spending measure the house position sponsored by representative smith nj and others supported reinstatement of the mexico city policy restricting us aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performing abortions or in lobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign countries the senate on the other hand has rejected in most cases house provisio ns dealing with mexico city policy favoring position that leaves these decisions in the hands of the administration unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides congress adopted interim arrangements for fy1996fy1999 that did not resolve the broad population program controversy but permitted the stalled foreign operations measure to move forward the annual compromise removed houseadded mexico city restrictions but reduced population assistance to 385 million and in several years metered the availability of the funds at rate of onetwelfth of the 385 million per month the fy2000 debate however concluded far differently than the previous four years as congress and the white house searched in november 1999 for final fy2000 budget agreement international family planning and population aid issues became one of the last and most contentious aspects of the negotiations congressional leaders insisted that if the president wanted congress to approve legislation authorizing the payment of nearly 1 billion of us arrears owed to the united nations the white house must also accept revised mexico city language adding abortion restrictions to us population assistance policy in order to remove the obstacles to arrears payments reluctant president clinton agreed to the abortion restrictions marking the first time that mexico city conditions had been included in legislation signed by the president enacted in the foreign operations act for fy2000 hr 3422 incorporated into hr 3194 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106113 because the president could waive the restrictions up to certain point there was major impact on usaid family planning programs in fy2000 other than the loss of 125 million in population assistance that the legislation required if the white house exercised the waiver authority congress again came to an impasse in 2000 over the international family issue and agreed to allow the new president to set policy early in 2001 under the fy2001 foreign operations measure none of the 425 million appropria tion could be obligated until after february 15 2001 subsequently on january 22 2001 two days after taking office president bush issued memorandum to the usaid administrator rescinding the 1993 memorandum from president clinton and directing the administrator to reinstate in full all of the requirements of the mexico city policy in effect on january 19 1993 the president further said that it was his conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion either here or abroad8 separate statement from the presidents press secretary stated thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs27 8

mexico city policy guidelines on march 28 as an executive memora ndum some lawmakers introduced legislation sjres 9 to reverse the policy and have congress take an early vote on the usaid guidelines under the process allowed by the congressional review act cra regarding agency rules and congressional review the new white house memorandum would not fall under the cra 11 on may 2 2001 the house international relations committee approved 2622 an amendment to hr 1646 foreign relations authorization fy20022003 that would have reversed the presidents mexico city policy the house however voted on may 16 218 210 to delete the amendment from hr 1646 thereby supporting the presidents positionpresident bush was committed to maintaining the 425 million funding level for population assistance because he knows that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planning services the press secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that any restrictions do not limit organizations from treating injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions for example post abortion care9 on february 15 the day on which fy2001 population aid funds became available for obligation usaid issued specific policy language and contract clauses to implement the presidents directive the guidelines are nearly identical to those used in the 1980s and early 1990s when the mexico city policy applied10 for fy2002 president bush seeks 425 million for usaid population assistance the same as appropriated for fy200111 the president also proposed us contribution to the population fund unfpa of 25 million the same as for fy2001 critics of the certification requirement oppose it on several grounds from an administrative standpoint they say it increases usaid costs to manage family planning programs because of the additional paperwork and delays implementat ion of projects usaid has contracted with john snow inc to track the certification process they further believe that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of the restrictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for usaid funding this they contend will lead to higher numbers of unwanted pregnancies and possibly more abortion s opponents also believe the new conditions undermine relations between the us government and foreign ngos and multilateral groups creating situation where the united states challenges their sovereignty on how to spend their own money and imposes socalled gag order on their ability to promote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations the latter these critics note would be unconstitutional if applied to american groups working in the united states supporters of the certification requirement argue that even though permanent law bans usaid funds from being used to perform or promote abortions money is fungible that organizations receiving americanta xpayer funding can simply usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs28 12 subsequently however the white house placed hold on unfpa funds while it reviews the organizat ions program in china and determines whether unfpa is eligible for us support under the terms of the kempkasten amendment decision has been made on how much if any of the 34 million will be released for more information on unfpa and the kempkasten amendment see crs issue brief 96026usaid resources for permitted activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws and regulations the certification process they contend stops the fungibility loophole congres sional debate during subcommittee markup on june 27 the house foreign operations panel rejected by voice vote an amendment by representative lowey that would have effectively reversed the presidents mexico city policy the lowey amendment would have allowed groups to receive usaid funding so long as they did not violate us laws or the laws of the countries in which they operate on funding issues hr 2506 assumes the complete 425 million administration request for population aid and 25 million for the population fund the mexico city issue was not raised during subsequent house consideration the senatepassed version of hr 2506 increased to 450 million family planning aid plus 40 million for the population fund committee amendment offered by senator leahy and adopted by the senate panel would have effectively overturned the presidents mexico city policy the senate provision blocked the white house from barring foreign ngos eligibility for usaid funding solely on the basis of health or medical services they offer with their own nonus government provided funds so long as they did not violate us laws or the laws of nations where which they operate foreign ngos would also not face limitations on advocacy or lobbying activities using their own nonus government funds that were more restrictive than those that apply to us ngos which receive us foreign aid grants this provision was very similar to measure included by the senate committee in the fy2001reported foreign operations bill to s 367 reported favorably on august 1 2001 by the senate foreign relations committee and to the lowey amendment defeated during house subcommittee markup after monthlong stalemate on family planning issues conferees agreed on december 19 to delete senate language that would have overturned the administrations mexico city policy but adopt funding levels for bilateral population assistance and unfpa closer to the senatepassed higher figures hr 2506 as enacted appropriates 4465 million for us bilateral family planning reproductive health programs in fy2002 only slightly less than the 450 million passed by the senate the legislation allocates the 205 million overall increase from fy2001 and the fy2002 request in such way that will add 105 million family planning amounts to the child survival account and 10 million to other economic aid accounts the conference agreement further provides us contribution to the unfpa of up to 34 million with the conditions that unfpa not fund abortions and that it segregate and not comingle us funds with other unfpa money so they are not used for unfpa programs in china conferees dropped the house restriction that would have reduced the contribution by whatever unfpa spent in china12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs29 13 world bank and imf heavily indebted poor countries hipc progress report april 19 2001 debt reduction hipc in 1996 international creditors including the world bank and the imf agreed to launch substantially expanded debt relief program for the worlds poorest most seriously debtstrapped nations the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative encompasses fortyone countries mostly in africa that are potentially eligible for hipc relief although only those determined to have unsustainable debt and those that maintain sound economic reform track record would qualify for the more generous hipc debt relief terms hipc implementation however moved slowly in the late 1990s debt relief critics including nongovernmental organizations religious groups and some donor governments charged that hipc terms were not deep enough that 90 or 100 of bilateral debt owed should be canceled and that six years was far too long qualificati on period for full hipc relief they further believed that the non sustainable debt criteria based largely on ratio of countrys debttoexports was too high and therefore excluded many countries that were also in need of debt relief number of organizations further advocated instituting mechanisms that would ensure that savings realized by debtor governments would be channeled into spending on poverty programs such as health and education with decisions on how to spend the money made jointly by government and civil society at the cologne summit in june 1999 g7 leaders endorsed most of the hipc reforms proposed by critics and the world bank and imf institutions that manage hipc debt relief adopted the enhancements in september by the end of 2000 22 countries had qualified for at least preliminary debt reduction although for nearly all nations full hipc relief is not expected for another year or more for these 22 qualifiers the hipc initiative together with existing debt relief mechanisms will result in the cancellation of 53 billion of their total 74 billion debt stock nominal terms annual debt service for these 22 nations will fall by about onehalf or 800 million each year during the period 20012003 poverty program expenditures by the 22 hipc qualifiers are estimated by the world bank to increase by 17 billion during the same time period there are 19 other hipc countries few of which are expected to provisionally qualify this year or next four nations are considered to have sustainable debt without hipc relief while one is not seeking hipc terms several others remain involved in regional conflicts or have not began required economic reform programs and are likely not to qualify in the near term total creditor costs of the hipc initiative are estimated at 293 billion because only about 3 of hipc debt is owed to the united states the us financial commitment is small relative to the cost to all creditors roughly 800 million13 number of ngos however remain critical of the hipc initiative arguing that the terms are still not generous enough to ensure that poor countries will have sufficient resources to invest in health education and other povertyoriented social programs they contend that the world bank and imf should cancel 100 debt owed by hipc in the same way as most bilateral creditors including the united states these critics point out that the degree of annual debt service relief fluctuates widely among qualifying nations and that for some the savings will not behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs30 substantial moreover they claim that the amount of debt service will still exceed poverty program expenditures even after hipc relief many further say that the qualification criteria should be lowered so that heavily indebted countries like bangladesh nigeria and haiti will also be able to benefit from the initiative world bank and imf officials as well as several creditor governments counter that these institutions do not have the resources to cancel total debt owed by hipc nations unless donors like the united states would be willing to increase contributions further hipc expansion of multilateral debt relief would wipe out bank reserves they further express concern that cancellation of all debt owed by these countries would create moral hazard and argue that some payment obligations should remain congress acted in 1999 and 2000 authorizing and appropriating most but not all funding for us pledged contributions to the hipc initiative for fy2000 lawmakers provided 110 million for the cancellation of hipc debt owed to the united states followed by an fy2001 appropriation of 435 million of which 75 million will cover the costs of writingoff bilateral debt the other 360 million is contribution to the hipc trust fund that assists the african development bank interamerican development bank and other multilateral creditors cover their costs of reducing debt owed by hipc countries because of concerns that hipc nations would accumulate new debt and fall back into debt trap congress stipulated that countries receiving benefits from us contributions must first agree not to borrow at market rate terms for two years and endorsed consideration of policy in which the world banks international development association would expand grant assistance to these governments for fy2002 the bush administration sought 224 million that together with 16 million available from prior year appropriations would complete the us commitment of 600 million for the hipc trust fund congressional debate the house provided full funding 224 million for us support of the hipc initiative in fy2002 the house appropriations commit tee directed the treasury secretary to press other donors to agree to the creation of grant aid facility at the world banks international development association for hipc beneficiary countries during the first three years following their qualification for hipc debt relief terms the senate bill also recommended the full 224 million funding level for hipc in addition both house and senate versions of hr 2506 provided resources for another debt relief initiative the tropical forestry conservation act tfca the tfca extends menu of debt reduction options for countries which are willing to expend resources and implement programs protecting their tropical forests the administration did not request funds for fy2002 tfca activities but rather sought authority to transfer 13 million from usaid development assistance resources the house bill directed that 25 million from prior year appropriations be used for tfca debt relief while the senate measure appropriated 11 million for the tfca and directed the use of 14 million in previously appropriated money for total funding level of 25 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31011crs31 14 this section is largely drawn from crs report rl31016 andean regional initiative ari fy2002 assistance

economic and counternarcotics assistance for colombia and regional neighbors as part of the andean counterdrug initiative the proposal differed from the fy2000 1 billion plan colombia program in two keys ways 1 economic and social program funding was roughly equal to the drug control and interdiction components which had been the key focus of the plan colombia effort and 2 more than half of the

operations rather than developmen t needs the house considered number of amendments seeking to reduce further funding for the initiative or limit us involvement in military operations adopted were conyers amendment that capped us civilian and military personnel involved in the andean counternarcotics initiative at 800 and hoekstra amendment that would withhold 65 million until the secretary of state reports on the april 20 2001 peruvian air force jet downing of civilian aircraft in which two americans were killed the house further decreased aci funding by 1 million but rejected other amendments that would have cut counternarcotics resources by 38 million and 100 million in order to increase health programs the senate measure cut deeper into the presidents aci request reducing funds to 547 million 128 million less than the house and 184 million below the administrations proposed budget alternative development for the andean region however was set at 151 million as requested an amendment offered by senators graham hagel and dodd that would have restored aci funding to 731 million as requested was voted out of order because it did not propose specific reductions to offset the additional spending for counternarcotics the enacted bill provides 625 million for the aci an amount between those passed by the house and senate earlier conferees further authorized the transfer of an additional 35 million from the regular international narcotics account subject to congressional notification although the conference committee encouraged the administration to provide bolivia with 86 million and ecuador with 33 million in alternative development funding the level for bolivia is roughly the same amount as requested under the aci and regular economic aid accounts while the amount for ecuador falls below the 59 million proposed aci and other economic assistance hr 2506 as passed further limits to 800 the number of us civilian and military personnel involved in the aci
