television dtv technology allows broadcaster to offer single program str eam of high definition television hdtv or alternatively multiple video program streams multicasts households with overtheair analogonly televisions will longer be able to receive fullpower television service unless they either 1 buy digitaltoanalog converter box to hook up to their analog television set 2 acquire digital television or an analog television equipped with digital tuner or 3 subscribe to cable satellite or telephone company television services which will likely provide for the conversion of digital signals to their analog customers the deficit reduction act of 2005 established digitaltoanalog converter box program administered by the national telecommunications and information administration ntia of the department of commercethat will partially subs idize consumer purchases of converter boxes ntia provides up to two fortydollar coupons to requesting us households the coupons are being issued between january 1 2008 and march 31 2009 and must be used within 90 days after issuance towards the purchase of standalone device used solely for digitaltoanalog conversion the preeminent goal for congress is ensuring that american households are prepared for the february 17 2009 dtv transition deadline thereby minimizing scenario where television sets across the nation go dark at issue is whether the federal governments current programs and reliance on private sector stakeholders will lead to successful digital transition with minimum amount of disruption to american tv households or alternatively whether additional legislative measures are warranted on january 8 2009 presidentelect obamas transition team asked leaders of the house and senate commerce committees to consider postponing the digital transition date citing the current unavailability of converter box coupons and what they view as insufficient federal support and education efforts to ensure that the most vulnerable populations are ready for the transition proposals for postponing the transition date possibly by several months have been sparked by the announcement from ntia on january 5 2009 that the funding ceiling for converter box coupons had been reached that all new requests would be put on waiting list and that growing numbers of households will likely not receive their coupons in time for the february 17 transition consequently there are concerns in congress that further legislation may be necessary to ensure to the extent possible successful digital transition with minimum amount of disruption to american tv households such legislation could include postponing the digital transition date addressing the statutory cap on the converter box coupon program by raising the cap or appropriating money to the program andor directing additional federal resources towards preparing american households for the digital television transition this report will be updated as events

congressional funding remedies see supply of coupons in this report groups also have concerns over the sufficiency of the fccs dtv call center efforts5 postponing the dtv transition date is supported by numerous entities many of which argue that delay would provide the extra time needed to enable sufficient additional federal resources to be directed towards helping households prepare for the transition few additional months they argue would enable congress to adequately fund the coupon program and ensure that all requesting households receive coupons in advance of the transition date delay would also allow more resources to be directed towards public outreach and education efforts including enhanced call centers and provide consumers and broadcasters with more time to address local dt v signal reception issues on january 16 2009 democratic fcc commissioners wrote letter to congressional leaders supporting delay arguing that fcc efforts to prepare for the digital transition have been inadequate and that factors such as coordination consumer education reception issues and call center support might be ameliorated with extra time offered by delay 6 opponents of delaying the transition7 argue that changing the date would sow confusion throughout the american public who have been long exposed to wide variety of outreach efforts public service announcements flyers billboards etc reiterating the february 17 transition date opponents also argue that delaying the date would be hardship for many local broadcast stations who would bear the added expense and logistical complications of operating and maintaining their analog signals for several more months additionally opponents argue dtv transition date delay could disrupt plans to use the vacated analog spectrum for variety of wireless services on january 14 2009 secret ary of commerce carlos gutierrez wrote congressional leaders letter opposing the delay and recommending that congress give ntia 250 million in increased budget authority whic h would enable the immediate distribution of coupons 8 g10g152g158g156g142g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 on january 15 2009 the house

the event that the dtv transition date is delayed on january 16 2009 representative waxman chairman of the house energy and commerce committee released draft legislation that would extend the digital transition deadline to june 12 20099 the draft legislation would modify the coupon program by extending the deadline for coupon applications from march 31 to july 31 2009 extending the expiration date of active coupons to september 15 2009 and allowing households whose coupons have already expired to request one replacement coupon directing ntia to deliver coupons via first class mail allowing broadcasters as long as they comply with fcc requirements to switch off their analog signal and go exclusively digital before the new deadline and directing the fcc to develop and implement program to encourage successful bidders of the analog spectrum auction to perform experiments and tests within that spectrum as long as it is technically feasible and does not interfere with digital television signals the committee scheduled markup of draft dtv legislation for january 21 but postponed the proceedings citing the senates inability on january 16 to pass dtv delay bill by unanimous consent

g22g142g149g142g159g146g156g146g152g151g501g561 one of the key drivers behind the digital transition is reclaiming portion of the analog spectrum broadcast channels 52 through 69 also known as the 700 mhz band currently occupied by television broadcasters digital television uses radio frequency spectrum more efficiently than traditional analog television thereby freeing up bandwidth the goal of the fcc and congress has been to complete the transition to dtv as quickly as is possible and feasible so that analog spectrum could be reclaimed and subsequently reallocated for other purposes some of the analog spectrum has been auctioned for commercial wire less services including wireless broadband and some will be used for new public safety communications services additionally it is mandated that some of the revenue raised in the spectrum auction will be returned to the us treasury thereby contributing toward federal deficit reduction another rationale often cited for the digital transition is thataside from offering superior television viewing experience to consumersdtv will give overtheair broadcasters the capability to offer more channels of programming via multicasting if they so choose as well as the ability to offer similar digitallybased services such as payperview or other interactive services offered by cable and satellite television providers

over the number of analog tv sets and households affected according to nielsen media research as of january 2009 57 of tv households about 65 million were completely unready for the digital transition and an additional 92 of households about 106 million were partially unready 12 table 1 shows the percentages of households completely and partially unready for the digital transition from may 2008 through january 2009 the national association of broadcasters nab has estimated that 12 unready means that all television sets in household are unable to receive digital signal partially unready means that at least one television set is ready and at leas t one television set is unready within household the nielsen company news release 57 of us households or 65 million homes still unprepared for the

of demand and redemption rates that some coupon requests may be ultimately unfulfilled if total of 335 million coupons the maximum amount of coupons that can be f unded by 134 billion are eventually redeemed25 in general as the transition date nears it is likely that more people will request coupons and that higher percentage of those people will redeem their coupons an increase in demand and redemption rates also may be due to the current economic downturn which could necessitate that more households will choose overtheair television with converter boxes rather than choosing more expensive options such as purchasing digital televisions or subscribing to cable or satellite service related issue is the administrative cost of the coupon program which is primarily the money that ntia uses to fund its contract with ibm and others for program operation during 2008 ntias ability to send out additional coupons due to recycled money from expired coupons led to administrative costs exceeding the original statutory limit of 160 million for administrative costs pl 110329 the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act 2009 addressed this issue by giving ntia the authority to spend up to 20 million in extra funds on administrative expenses 26 thus the current ceiling for administrative costs is 180 million however if the number of coupons requested continues to exceed ntias previous expectations it is possible that this ce iling could be reached and ntia would be unable to send out additional coupons given the waiting list for coupon applicants the possibility that households may await their coupons for unacceptable periods of time and the possibility that some applications may even go unfulfilled congressional policymakers are examining two main options for addressing the statutory funding cap for the converter box coupon program one option would be for congress to enact an exception to the antideficiency act for the converter box coupon program the antideficiency act ada prohibits the federal government from making an obligation that exceeds the amount available in an appropriation or fund for that obligation27 an exemption to the antideficiency act would allow ntia to immediately begin to send out coupons to new requests and all households currently on the waiting list without having to wait for funds to eventually become available from expiring unredeemed coupons the bush administration has opposed granting exemptions to the ada arguing that the ada provides well accepted principles of sound financial management that protect the taxpayer from spending in excess of appropriations 28 there is however precedent in the telecommunications area for granting exemptions to the ada specifically for erate commitments under the universal service fund program 29 24 currently the number of weekly coupon requests have roughly tripled over last years weekly average redemption rates have risen from roughly 50 to weekly redemption rate of 60 ntia is estimating potential weekly redemption rate up to 65 as the program goes forward 25 as of january 7 2009 there have been 188 million coupons redeemed 26 money is drawn from certain existing accounts created by title iii of the deficit reduction act of 2005 however money cannot be taken from the account authorized by section 3005 that directly funds the dtv coupons 27 31 usc 1341 28 meredith attwell baker acting assistant secret ary for communications and information national telecommunications and information administration responses to

appropriate new funding for the coupon program or to amend section 3005 of the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109 171 and statutorily raise the ceiling for the coupon program both coupon costs and administrative costs it should be noted that funding for the coupon program is currently not derived from appropriated funds rather it is funded by portion of the proceeds that have been garnered from auctioning the analog television spectrum vacated by broadcasters in the channels 5269 range as with the first option if the funding caps are raised ntia would have the authority to immediately send out coupons to all requesters on the waiting list raising the funding caps could also address concerns that greaterthanexpected demand for coupons and converter boxes might ultimately exceed the current limit of 335 million redeemed coupons ntia has estimated that if coupon demand continue s through february 17 at the rate experienced in december more than 15 million per week total of approximately 60 million coupons up from ntias previous estimate of 515 million would be requested through march 31 2009 the final day applications are accepted under this scenario and assuming redemption rates of 60 rising to 65 the program would require an additional 330 million of which 20 million would be required for additional administrative expenses 30 meanwhile on january 15 2009 the house appropriations committee released draft legislative language for the spending portion of the economic stimulus package the american recovery and reinvestment bill of 2009 the draft legislation includes 650 million in appropriated funds to ntia for dtv coupons and related activities including but not limited to education consumer support and outreach

by ntia according to ntia assuming the current distribution capability of 515 million coupons and 60 redemption rate it is therefore possible that total demand for cecbs couponeligible converter boxes using coupon could outpace availability by approximately 25 million boxes and that additional purchases of boxes could be made by consumers without coupons 31 ntia has sent letter to retailers emphasizing the increase in coupon demand and urging them to maintain sufficient inventory through the end of the program 32 g5g152g158g153g152g151g561g7g161g153g146g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 according to the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 all coupons shall expire 3 months after issuance section 3005c1c coupons first issued in february 2008 expired in may 2008 because some lowercost or more desirable converter box models were initially not readily available particularly boxes with analog passthrough necessary to watch analog low power television stations there have been

coupon program to support such reissuance ntias february 21 2008 response to the committee promised to address this issue and stated that ntia will have better understanding of the impact of the 90day expiration and the demands on coupon program funds as consumers begin to redeem coupons in the coming months on may 7 2008 the chairman and ranking minority member of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation along with nine other senators sent letter urging ntia to allow consumers to reapply for coupons funds permitting and to examine novel approaches to ensure consumers are able to purchase converter boxes in cases where there is shortage one possibility according to the letter would be the use of coupons to preorder converter boxes that are outofstock or not yet available33 at hearing held by the house committee on energy and commerce on september 16 2008 the acting administrator of ntia stated her view that the statute prevents ntia from allowing coupons to be reissued and added that doing so would add costs and delays that could jeopardize the success of the program34 given that coupons are transferable but cannot be sold ntia is encouraging consumers whose coupons have expired to ask friends relatives or neighbors for replacement according to ntia data as of january 14 2009 137 million coupons sent to requesting households were not redeemed and therefore expired g5g152g158g153g152g151g561g7g149g146g144g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561 under the march 12 2007 rule implementing the converter box program households eligible for converter box coupons were required to have united states postal service usps mailing address post office po box addresses were not accepted unless the applicant was resident of an indian reservation alaskan native

residents who prefer to utilize post office boxes on april 24 2008 the ntia issued notice of proposed rulemaking proposing certain waivers to ntia regulations regarding household eligibility and the necessity of usps mailing address on september 19 2008 ntia published revised rule that allows residents of nursing homes intermediate care facilities and assisted living facilities to be eligible for

signals overtheair antennas can range from simple indoor rabbit ears to large rooftop antennas of various shapes and configurations according to the fcc overtheair households that currently receive good quality reception of an analog television signal should be able to receive digital signal via converter box or digital television with the same antenna previously used to receive analog tv signals however some viewersparticularly those living near obstructions or towards the outer edges of stations broadcasting rangemay have difficulty receiving digital signal and may require repositioned bigger or different type of antenna also some television stations are temporarily operating their digital signal at reduced power level or at different channel than will be used after february 17 2009 36 the fcc provides publication antennas and digital television which offers tips and advice for consumers with overtheair digital signal reception problems37 also available from the fcc is trouble shooting guide for digitaltoanalog converter boxes and digital televisions38 results of the test pilot program in wilmington nc identified dtv signal reception issues as major challenge of the dtv transition there are two separate digital reception issues the digital cliff effect and reduced dtv coverage areas the digital cliff effect can be problem for viewers who currently receive weak analog signal unlike analog signals which when weak or obstructed may be received with fuzzy yet watchable reception digital signals are received either perfectly or not at all viewers experiencing the digital cliff effect will likely require an antenna modification the fcc has estimated that about 5 of overtheair viewers may need new antenna due to the digital cliff effect equivalent to about 1 of all tv households according to the fcc the wilmington data suggest similar estimate 39 the second dtv digital reception issue stems from the fact that some digital stations will have reduced service contour compared with their curren t analog service contour in other words their digital broadcasts may not reach all the households that these stations previously served in wilmington reduced service contour of the nbc affiliate was the leading single cause of consumer complaints to the fcc according to fcc estimates about 15 of television markets may have station with significantly reduced coverage after the transition the fcc is currently identifying these markets and analyzing how stations can fill these coverage gaps through such options as an additional antenna distributed transmission system or multiple towers or translator or repeater stations 40 on november 3 2008 the fcc approved an order which would permit stations to deploy distributed transmission systems small antennas that would fill gaps in 36 in survey conducted d ecember 2007 through february 2008 the general acc ountability office gao f ound that 68 of responding stations were operating their digital signals at full power and that 68 of stations were transmitting their digital signal on the channel from which they will broadcast after the transition see gao digital television

on how consumers should address digital reception problems and which stations and markets may have reduced service contours after the digital transition on december 23 2008 the fcc released data and maps showing digital and analog coverage areas for each of the 1749 fullpower television stations in the us the fcc found that 89 of stations 1553 stations will experience an overall net gain in the population that can receive their signals while 11 of stations 196 stations will experience net loss also on december 23 the fcc released notice of proposed rulemaking that would create new

broadcasting64 in preparation for the early transition the fcc coordinated with local officials and community groups in the wilmington nc area to accelerate and broaden consumer education outreach efforts the early dtv transition is intended to give the fcc the ntia and broadcasters test case that will supply valuable data and experiences that can be applied to the nationwide transition on february 17 2009 while some other full power television stations around the country are turning off their analog signals temporarily to raise public awareness wilmington is the only television market in the united states that has or will permanently turn off programs on full power analog broadcast signals before the nationwide transition date of february 17 2009 the fcc and the broadcasters are collecting feedback and data on the results of the test pilot program after the cutoff at noon on september 8 analog programming was replaced with screen telling consumers about the digital transition and how to get help over the first five days following the cutoff the fcc received 1828 calls to its dtv help line about 1 of the total number of tv households in wilmington of the total number of calls 5 were from consumers who were unaware of the transition 18 from c onsumers who had problems with their converter boxes 229 from consumers who had antenna and reception issues and 30 from households in out of market communities as far south as myrtle beach sc and as far north as raleigh nc who could longer receive the wilmington nbc affiliate whose digital coverage area longer extends to these out of market areas 65 general consensus has emerged that while the wilmington test proceeded relatively smoothly the experience has raised number of challenges that must be met in order to ensure the most successful transition possible on february 17 2009 while consumer awareness of the dtv transition in wilmington was at very high level much greater problem was consumers experiencing technical problems involving converter boxes antennas andor signal reception fcc chairman kevin martin testified before the house committee on energy and commerce that though our consumer education efforts appear to have been effective our focus now turns to resolving technical challenges 66 fcc commissioner michael copps has recommended that the fcc take number of steps including conduct additional field testing dedicate special fcc team to the needs of atrisk communities ramp up the fcc call center prepare comprehensive dtv contingency plans create an online dtv consumer forum educate consumers on dtv troubleshooting including antenna issues and the need to rescan converter boxes and sets ensure that broadcasters meet their constructi on deadlines encourage the rapid deployment of small batterypowered dtv sets and find way to broadcast an analog message to consumers following the transition 67 meanwhile on november 7 2008 the house committee on energy and commerce sent letters to the fcc ntia nab and the major television networks asking how they will specifically address the issues of consumer education with respect to the need to re scan converter boxes

refocused their outreach and public education efforts on consumer preparedness in addition to consumer awareness specifically consumers are being encouraged to apply for coupons as early as possible and to try out converter boxes in advance of the transition date in order to proactively address equipment issues such as rescanning the converter box or repositioning or upgrading antennas meanwhile many television stations across the nation are conducting soft analog cutoffs in which the analog signals are temporarily discontinued and replaced by an educational message on the dtv transition

would give television stations within 50 miles of the us mexican border the option of continuing their analog signal through february 17 2013 provided they can establish to the satisfaction of the fcc that continued analog broadcasting is in the public interest stations must also broadcast between channels 2 through 51 continued analog service cannot prevent the auction or public safety use of recovered spectrum cannot interfere with any channel reserved for public safety use and cannot interfere with any digital station opposition to s 2507 has been expressed by many englishlanguage television stations along the usmexico border these stations argue that prolonging the analog option for some stations would create confusing transition that future transition in four or five years for the border region will be problematic in the absence of national dtv transition effort and that stations planning to go alldigital on february 17 2009 may be compelled by competitive pressures to continue their analog signals thereby adding additional and otherwise unnecessary expense 68 on the other hand supporters of s 2507 including spanishlanguage stations argue that hispanic households in the border region are significantly more reliant on overtheair television than the general population and are likely to be less prepared for the digital transition especially given that they can continue to watch analog overtheair broadcasts from mexican television stations the legislation is particularly necessary they argue to ensure that these groups continue to receive important information over their televisions during an emergency or natural disaster

the switchover costs to consumers with analog televisions the key issue for congress is the extent to which american households will be ready for the digital transition and whether measures taken by the government and the private sector are sufficient to ensure that televisions across america do not go dark on february 17 2009 two lines of inquiry have repeatedly been raised in congressional hearings on the digital television transition first are public education and outreach efforts sufficient and is the federal government playing sufficient role in leading that effort with limited funding both the fcc and the ntia are relying heavily on strategy of leveraging private sector efforts on the one hand private sector groups have market incentive to ensure that the public is ready for the digital transition for example the consumer electronics industry wants to sell dtv products and broadcasters want their viewers to be able to continue watching their local broadcasts accordingly industry groups have begun to launch multifaceted public outreach campaigns on the other hand critics question whether market forces will ensure that public outreach efforts are sufficiently targeted to those segments of american society the elderly nonenglish speakers rural areas disabled citizens minorities the economically disadvantaged that may be more at risk of being adversely affected by the digital switchover critics also assert that industry outreach will likely reflect each industry sectors interests and that formal federal coordination and leadership effortsuch as task forcehas been needed to ensure that unified consistent and balanced message is conveyed to the public gao has found that comprehensive plan exists for the dtv transition and that
