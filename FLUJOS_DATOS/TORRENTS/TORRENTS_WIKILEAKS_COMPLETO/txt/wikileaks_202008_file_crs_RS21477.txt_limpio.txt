additional marriage penalty relief expand usage of the advance payment option for the eitc or make permanent the election to include combat pay for purposes of computing the eitc this report will be updated as legislative activity warrants crs2 the earned income tax credit eitc1 the eitc is refundable tax credit available to eligible workers earning relatively low wages under current law there are two categories of eitc recipients childless adults and families with children because the credit is refundable an eitc recipient need not owe taxes to receive the benefits however lowincome individual or family must file tax return to receive the eitc an eitceligible family may also receive portion of the credit in the form of advanced payments2 eligibility for and the size of the eitc is based on income age and the presence of qualifying children several policy and legislative issues are associated with the eitc compliance the use of refund anticipation loans marriage penalty and poverty relief family size compliance issue compliance with the eitc provisions has been an issue for the program since 1990 when the internal revenue service irs as part of the taxpayer compliance measurement program tcmp released study on 1985 tax year returns with the eitc the study concluded that there was an overclaim rate of 391 the overclaim rate represents the percentage of claimed eitc that was invalid some of these overclaims were recovered after the study by irs collection efforts later studies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21477 by the irs have resulted in lower overclaim rates the 1997 and 1999 tax return studies3 estimated that the unrecovered overclaim rates were 238 to 256 and 270 to 317 respectively these studies presented the rates as upper and lowerbound estimates because number of individuals contacted as part of the studies did not respond in the 1999 study 249 of overclaims with the errors known were due to the child claimed not meeting the eitc requirements for qualified child the most common qualifying child error was that the child did not meet the residency test living with the tax filer for at least six months in the case of certain blood relatives or one year for other individuals the second most common error was the child not meeting the relationship to the tax filer test particularly in the case of foster children where the child did not live with the tax filers for the full year or was not cared for as the tax filers own child the definition of child prior to tax year 2005 for the eitc was different from the definition of or requirements to claim child as dependent for the personal exemption as result single parent living in multigenerational household may have been able to claim the child for the eitc while the grandparent or the childs nonresident parent may have been able to claim the child for the personal exemption and child credit and not the eitc to reduce the complexity created by the different definitions of child proposals were made by both the us department of the treasury and the joint committee on taxation to conform the definition of child for purposes of the personal exemption 1 more detailed description of eitc eligibility and the calculation of the credit are in crs report rl31768 the earned income tax credit eitc an overview by christine scott 2 only small number of eitc recipients elect the advance payment option for the eitc 3 internal revenue service department of the treasury compliance estimates for earned income tax credit claimed on 1999 returns february 28 2002 p 18 crs3 child credit eitc dependent care and head of household filing status the working families tax relief act of 2004 pl 108311 created more uniform definition of child for tax purposes including the eitc this new definition became effective with tax year 20054 in 2003 the irs announced plans to conduct precertification effort for the tax year 2003 returns in which tax filers expecting to claim the eitc would need to precertify that any child claimed for the eitc met the residency requirement had resided with the tax filer for at least half of the tax year the precertification effort was converted to study of approximately 25000 returns expected to claim the eitc and combined with two other compliance studies related to the eitc 1 study of filing status and 2 an automated underreporter income study the consolidated appropriations act of 2004 pl 108199 required report to congress on the qualified child study the pre certification of child for the eitc residency requirement according to the irs5 the three studies uncovered and prevented payment of more than 275 million in erroneous claims for the eitc with approximately 250 million of the 275 million from the automated underreporter study in the automated underreporter httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21477 study the irs manually reviewed 300000 tax returns that claimed the eitc in tax year 2003 that also had indications of income misreporting for tax year 2002 approximately 83 of the tax returns had reduction or disallowance of the eitc as result of the manual review eitc and tax preparers large number of tax returns are completed by paid tax preparers 416 of tax returns filed last filing season through september 28 20076 however use of paid tax preparer does not guarantee an accurate tax return paid tax preparers also provide through refund anticipation loan ral immediate access to tax refunds the consumer federation of america7 reports that eitc tax filers paid approximately 17 billion in tax preparation ral and check cashing fees or 43 of the total eitc amount this estimate is based on fees of 120 for tax preparation 32 for application or administration 54 for check cashing and 75 for refund anticipation loan eitc recipients may use paid preparers for number of reasons including language differences literacy problems 4 for information on the new definition of child see crs report rs22016 tax benefits

slicing into lowincome americans hardearned tax refunds january 31 2005 p6 crs4 irss close review of eitc returns less effort work by the tax filer the belief that use of paid preparer prevents errors and the belief that refunds are received faster refund anticipation loans are often issued for set cost and an expected time period for repayment through assignment of the tax refund resulting in high effective rate of interest for the loan if tax filer uses refund anticipation loan and the tax refund is not issued during the time period specified for the loan the tax filer may be responsible for additional interest if there is an error on the tax return which reduces or eliminates the tax refund the tax filer may be responsible for repaying part or all of the principal amount of the loan for low income tax filers with an eitc irs inquires about the relationship or residency of qualifying child may result in the tax filers refund being delayed for significant period of time or denied marriage penalty the structure of the eitc may depending on the relative income levels of both parties impose marriage penalty8 on single lowincome parents if they choose to marry for example in tax year 2007 two single parents each with one httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21477 child and earned income of 15000 would each receive an eitc of 2853 for total of 5706 if they marry their combined income is 30000 and with two children the eitc is 2060 the eitc marriage penalty for the couple is 3646 the difference between 5706 and 2060 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 provided marriage penalty relief for the eitc by raising the phase out income level of the eitc for married couples egtrra reduced the marriage penalty for this family by 421 in 2007 the egtrra provisions for marriage penalty relief in the eitc will sunset at the end of 2010 eitc and poverty relief the differential in the eitc based on the number of children combined with the annual inflation adjustment is designed to help families stay above the poverty threshold over time however because the eitc adjustment for family size is limited to two children over time larger families may not be kept above the poverty threshold as shown in table 1 for tax year 2006 married couples with three or more children earning 20000 year have net income after taxes that is below the poverty threshold whereas similar couple with two children is above the poverty threshold9 8 the marriage penalty is the difference between the tax liability for married couple filing joint tax return and the sum of the tax liabilities for each person if they each filed using the single filing status for more on the marriage penalty and the proposed solutions see crs report rl30419 the marriage tax penalty
