ministers who have made their careers in paris he is native of poitou and was president of regional council his appointment is in part an effort by chirac to demonstrate that france will be governed

crimes against individuals in france in 2001 there were nearly 400000 jospin s calculation may have been to upstage chirac who for years had run on hard lawandorder platforms2 while chirac was mayor

his long political career on his attacks on immigrants particularly the 4 to 5 million moslems from north africa in total population of 59 million since september 11 he had claimed that terror comes from immigrants and that france is for the fren ch on several occasions during his public career he had been fined heavily for racist remarks or for denying the holocaust crimes under french law other parts of his often vague agenda have for years included antieu themes although he is member of the europ ean parliament seat he uses to ridicule the eu protectionist measur for french products and scoring of the united states as multicultural super power that has imposed globalization on an unwilling world apathy towards tired and familiar candidates led to firstround voter turnout of 72 the

of the two trotskyite candidates surpassed that of hue leaving th future of both hue and the communist party in doubt assessment of the election many journalists in europe and the united states drew the conclusion after the first round that france had become racist country and that pens relative success was sign of rising intolerance in the fifth republic most french officials and intellectuals not surprisingly deny this charge in fact there seem to be several themes dominating the minds of french voters that determined the election france has long struggled to integrate its north african population into the mainstream of its social and political life3 in contrast in the late 19th and early 20th centuries there was large inflow of poor ita lians and spaniards not few of whom had radical political ideas over time these immigrants were assimilated and many of their heirs enjoy senior positions in french politics business and universities north african immigrants came to france in large numbers in the wake of the algerian war some fleeing an authoritarian government and politi cal unrest others looking for work large numbers of such immigrants live in the shanty town apartment buildings that ring paris and major french industrial cities ong with them came large numbers of pieds noirs french citizens born in north africa but longer welcome there in the anticolonial climate pen was one such immigrant former army paratrooper he brought with him belief that the algerians were inferior capable only of menial work and view that islam would sully catholic france from the beginning of his political career in the 1960s he had following of 8 to 15 of th population mostly poorly educated workers and young people groups who feared that nor th africans would take their jobs in poor economic times during the campaign neither chirac nor jospin confronted the issue of the immigrant populations place in france jospin always vi ewed as man of probity and toleration may have legitimized the theme of insecurity by centering the crime rate as the key issue hoping to steal chiracs and pens principal issue by doing so he ensured perhaps inadvertently that it would dominate the campaign and lend legitimacy to chiracs and pens longstandi ng concentration on the issue4 the terrorist attacks of september 11 and rising tensions in the middle east appear to have fed the french populations fears the arrest of suspected rrorists connected with qaeda was seizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21216crs5 5 thenard clés dune débâclenicolas baverez chirac ducks the challenge

wellintegrated into french life perhaps because many of them are catholic and many came to france with good education one vignette of this tendency is that it is not uncommon to see french asians marching in pari s in monarchist demonstrations tiny part of the political spectrum but an enduring and often wealthy one 7 interviews with french officials and academics februarymay 2002upon in particular by pen as sign that fren ch citizens were in dang er of attack by the moslem minority the israelipalestinian conflic t led to sharp criticisms of israel by some leaders of frances moslem community and appears to have fed concern in france that such sympathy could lead to violence in french cities due to its large moslem population and its long colonial history in the arab middle east french observers have believed for half century that conflict in any part of the middle east would immediately be felt in social tensions at home chir ac promised tough measures against crime seen by the voters as his greatest area of competency the promised crackdown on crime became associated especially on the right with promised hard response to terrorism these sentiments dominated the minds of voters who turned out for chirac and pen5 some observers in france have long ca lled for measures primarily through the educational system to integrate the country s moslem population into french life by most accounts efforts to encourage cultural dive rsity especially if that diversity is non european and noncatholic in france have failed6 the french particularly french politicians believe that their educational system is exceptional and it is rare for the political elite to call for its reform perhaps because most of them are products of that system french intellectuals often state that france is egalitarian in that the capable and the hardworking are rewarded but th at the country does not embrace equal opportunity which implies that all have the same opportunity regardless of ability those who criticize the french social and educational system contend that it is geared for the privileged and for those of french herita ge and that it discriminates against the poor the rural and the immigrant7 some french observers believe that the political system has grown sclerotic dominated by aging political warhorses who void the countrys problems in addition to the refusal of cultural diversity the need for pension reform and improved productivity have troubled the political landscape in recent years chirac and jospin rarely discussed these issues in the pres idential campaign and pen never touched upon them in concrete meaningful way one of the reasons for chiracs poor showing in the first round was that many french believe that he is corrupt and opposed to reform in the past five years he was charged with corr uption from his period as mayor of paris only to see the investigation halted when france s highest court said that he could not be indicted while in office he blocked reform of the french senate and of the practice of holding multiple offices wi dely seen as an abuse of power and he opposed decentralization of number of the governme nts functions despite clear public sentiment in favor of giving more authority to re gional and local governments one respected french observer called the main candidates an ageing and corrupt clique mummified

united states and france have worked closely together in the conflict to subdue international terrorism france has forces in central asia that have engaged in combat missions against qaeda in afghanistan and has tightened its already tough antiterrorism laws at home to weaken elements of the qaeda network there chiracraffarin team is likely to take more assertive stance in the european union than the government of former prime minister jospin chirac in the past has said that france must take the lead in shaping the eu he has for example strongly supported european security and defense policy sdp under which the eu would develop defense capability both the clinton and bush administrations have supported this policy as long as it leads to greater burdensharing by the allies the bush administration has said that esdp must not become rival to nato and seek to use highreadiness nato forces or develop separate planning and command structur which might prove to be waste of valuable defense resources chirac and the new foreign minister dominique villepin fully back the eu position on middle east peace settlement which differs from that of president bush in several significant areas while president bush has called for an end to the rule of palestinian leader arafat the french government has said that the palestinians must elect their own leader and that othe r countries must work with arafat now as the duly elected palestinian leader in addition france unlik the united states echoes the eu call for an international peace conference to map future settlement of issues france believes that the eu along with the united states the and russia must have role in brokering peace agreement the united states and fran ce agree that there must eventually be palestinian state finally jacques chirac is bove all gaullist and views himself as the heir to general gaulles legacy chirac founded the gaullist part the rally for the republic rpr his descriptions of the united states are latterday gaullism he views the united states as unilateralist and too assertive nd independent in global affairs and he has criticized the congress as i solationist and lacking knowle dge about world events at the same time like gaulle in times of crisis chirac has strongly supported the united states after september 11 as already not ed he ordered the french military and intelligence community to provide important resources to the us effort in afghanistan
