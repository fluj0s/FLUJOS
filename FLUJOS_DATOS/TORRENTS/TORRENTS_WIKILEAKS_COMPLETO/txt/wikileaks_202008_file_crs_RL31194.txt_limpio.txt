updated may 23 2002 robert keith specialist in american national government government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress payasyougo requirement for fy2002 procedural assessment summary the 1985 balanced budget act as amended establishes payasyougo paygo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation under this procedure legislation proposing new direct spending or decreasing revenues for fiscal year must not result in net cost for that year on the paygo scorecard any violation of the paygo requirement would trigger sequester after the end of the session involving automatic largely acrosstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt programs this requirement presently applies to legislation enacted through the end of fy2002 on september 30 2002 and covers the effects of such legislation through fy2006 in determining whether sequester is needed for fiscal year the balances on the scorecard for that year and the preceding year are combined direct spending which is expected to amount to more than 12 trillion in fy2002 excluding net interest is controlled by the legislative committees of the house and senate and funds entitlement and other mandatory programs such as medicare and federal civilian retirement direct spending is distinguished from discretionary spending which is controlled by the house and senate appropriations committees social security is not subject to the paygo requirement revenues which are expected to amount to more than 20 trillion in fy2002 are under the jurisdiction of the house ways and means and senate finance committees president george w bush submitted his fy2002 budget to congress on april 9 2001 calling for 10year tax cut of 16 trillion and significant increases in direct spending for medicare reform and other initiatives the budget resolution for fy2002 hconres 83 adopted on may 10 largely accommodated the presidents overall requests under the budget resolution revenue reductions amounting to 653 billion for fy2002 and 1369 trillion over 10 years were expected to be achieved largely through the reconciliation process both the president and congress recognized that their policies regarding paygo legislation implied action later in the session on procedural device to prevent paygo sequester in late december the house and senate brought their budgetary actions during the 2001 session to close by enacting the defense appropriations act for fy2002 hr 3338 president george w bush signed the measure into law on january 10 2002 pl 107117 in addition to revising the discretionary spending limits the act also included provision to prevent paygo sequester for fy2002 section 102 in division c of the act 115 stat 2342 instructed the omb director in preparing his

procedural assessment the payasyougo requirement the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 established payasyougo paygo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation as part of an underlying law the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 19851 under this procedure legislation proposing new direct spending or decreasing revenues for fiscal year must not result in net cost for that year the paygo requirement is intended to keep the onbudget surplus from being reduced or the on budget deficit from being increased this requirement which has been revised and extended over the years presently applies to legislation enacted through the end of fy2002 on september 30 2002 and covers the effects of such legislation through fy2006 direct spending which is expected to amount to more than 12 trillion in fy2002 excluding net interest is controlled by the legislative committees of the house and senate through substantive law and funds entitlement and other mandatory programs such as medicare federal military and civilian retirement and unemployment compensation this amount includes about 450 billion in spending for social security which is not subject to the paygo requirement revenues which are expected to amount to more than 20 trillion in fy2002 including more than 500 billion for social security are under the jurisdiction of the house ways and means and senate finance committees direct spending is distinguished from discretionary spending which is expected to amount to more than 700 billion in fy2002 discretionary spending falls under the control of the house and senate appropriations committees and is provided in annual appropriations acts for the most part discretionary spending funds the routine operations of the federal government including the salaries and expenses accounts of most agencies the bea of 1990 subjects discretionary spending to different enforcement mechanism adjustable limits on budget authority and outlays rather than to the paygo process2 direct spending and discretionary spending together make up total federal spending 1 the bea of 1990 is title xiii of pl 101508 november 5 1990 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 see 104 stat 1388573 through 628 the 1985 act is title ii of pl 99177 december 12 1985 measure increasing the public debt limit see 99 stat 10371101 2 for more information on this topic see crs report rl31193 discretionary spending limits for fy2002 procedural assessment by robert keith crs2 the paygo requirement as originally set forth in the bea of 1990 covered fy19911995 it was extended by the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra of 1993 through fy1998 and the budget enforcement act bea of 1997 through fy20023 as mentioned previously the paygo requirement applies to legislation enacted through fy2002 but it covers the effects of such legislation through fy2006 with regard to direct spending the paygo requirement applies to outlay levels rather than levels of budget authority budget authority represents the legal authority for agencies to incur obligations annual appropriations are perhaps the most well known form of budget authority outlays represent the liquidation of the obligation usually in the form of an electronic funds transfer or the issuance of check by the treasury department outlays rather than budget authority are compared to revenue levels to determine the amount of the surplus or deficit the paygo balances for each fiscal year are maintained on rolling paygo scorecard that accumulates the budgetary effects of laws enacted during the session and in prior years beginning with fy19924 the threshold test for paygo sequester deals with how legislation affects the net cost for fiscal year on the paygo scorecard not how it changes the surplus or deficit for that fiscal year in the federal budget generally as the budget moved from an overall deficit to an overall surplus in recent years and as an onbudget surplus emerged there was some confusion regarding whether the paygo requirement would continue to apply the concern arose from the fact that the stated purpose of the paygo requirement in section 252a of the 1985 balanced budget act refers only to legislation that increases the deficit in the report accompanying the fy2000 budget resolution for example the house budget committee stated the law is somewhat unclear whether paygo lapses when there is an onbudget surplus omb has hinted that paygo would indeed lapse if the budget was in balance without counting excess social security receipts5 in response to this concern jacob lew then director of the office of management and budget omb issued statement indicating that such position was not correct stating we believe that paygo does apply when there is an on budget surplus6 the controlling factor as stated previously is how legislation changes the balance on the paygo scorecard 3 obra of 1993 is pl 10366 august 10 1993 see title xiv at 107 stat 683685 the bea of 1997 is title x of pl 10533 august 5 1997 see 111 stat 677712 4 on several occasions paygo balances have been reset to zero or otherwise modified pursuant to law primarily to prevent the sizeable savings from reconciliation legislation from being used as offsets to subsequent direct spending increases 5 see the report of the house budget committee to accompany hconres 68 hrept 106 73 march 23 1999 at page 87 6 letter of april 6 1999 from omb director jacob lew to the honorable john spratt ranking minority member of the house budget committee crs3 enforcement by sequestration the sequestration process established by the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 and used to enforce annual deficit targets was retained by the bea of 1990 and later laws as the means of enforcing the paygo requirement as well as the discretionary spending limits7 under current sequestration procedures the omb director issues sequestration report at the time the presidents budget is submitted to congress the preview report midway through the congressional session the update report and within 15 days after the end of the session the final report the congressional budget office cbo issues sequestration reports in advance of the omb reports but they are advisory only if the omb directors final sequestration report indicates that enacted direct spending and revenue levels have incurred net cost for the fiscal year on the paygo scorecard then the president must immediately issue sequestration order to remedy the violation through automatic acrosstheboard spending reductions if sequester under this process is required it must occur within 15 calendar days after congress adjourns at the end of session and on the same day as any sequestration tied to enforcement of the discretionary spending limits the sequester would eliminate any net positive balance on the paygo scorecard for that fiscal year and the prior fiscal year combined caused by the enactment of legislation during the session and in prior years any required reductions would be made in nonexempt direct spending programs emergency direct spending and revenue legislation so designated by the president and in statute is not covered by the paygo sequestration process as mentioned previously spending for the social security program except for administrative expenses is exempt from sequestration as are many other direct spending programs any reductions in medicare spending are limited to 4 enforcement in the congressional budget process the congressional budget process established by the congressional budget act of 1974 contains several mechanisms to enforce decisions regarding the recommended levels of direct spending and revenues first under section 311 of the act the aggregate levels in the budget resolution serve as ceiling on total spending and floor under total revenues second under section 302 of the act the total amount of direct spending in the budget resolution is allocated among the various legislative committees of jurisdiction third section 310 provides for reconciliation process under which the budget resolution may contain instructions to the legislative committees to develop changes to direct spending or revenue laws to bring them into conformity with budget resolution policies the resultant legislation is considered under expedited procedures in the house and senate usually in the form of an omnibus bill finally the socalled elastic clause in section 7 for more detailed discussion of the sequestration process see crs report rl31137 sequestration procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act by robert keith crs4 301b4 authorizes the budget resolution to set forth such other matters and require such other procedures relating to the budget as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this act pursuant to the elastic clause authority the house and senate sometimes include special procedural features in the budget resolution the senate for example established payasyougo point of order several years ago which remains in effect this provision most recently set forth in section 207 of the fy2000 budget resolution hconres 68 bars the consideration of any legislation that would increase or cause an onbudget deficit for any one of three applicable time periods 1 the first year covered by the budget resolution 2 the first 5 years covered by the budget resolution and 3 the 5 fiscal years following the first 5 years covered by the budget resolution although the senates paygo point of order is comparable in purpose to the statutory paygo requirement it differs in that it takes effect during the consideration of legislation rather than after the session ends and it applies to much longer time frame the policies in the budget resolution regarding direct spending and revenue levels may be at odds with the statutory paygo requirement during the past few years as the deficit changed to growing surplus the budget resolution has recommended substantial reductions in revenues coupled with increases in direct spending that would incur substantial nets costs on the paygo scorecard the firewall between the paygo process and procedures to enforce the discretionary spending limits does not permit savings from constraints on the growth of discretionary spending to offset or pay for revenue reductions accordingly congress has had to resort to procedural devices to prevent sequester from occurring while pursuing revenuereduction legislation see later discussion fy2002 policy regarding the paygo requirement the initial policy for fy2002 regarding the paygo requirement was established by the submission of the presidents budget and the adoption by the house and senate of the annual budget resolution as revenue and direct spending legislation is considered the initial policy may be modified by various means including the designation of revenue or direct spending changes as emergency requirements the presidents budget president george w bush submitted his budget for fy2002 on april 9 2001 recommending that congress pass legislation extending the paygo requirement and discretionary spending limits8 with regard to revenues and direct spending his budget proposed 10year tax cut of 16 trillion with revenue loss for fy2002 of 29 billion and direct spending increases 8 us executive office of the president office of management and budget budget of the united states government fiscal year 2002 analytical perspectives washington april 9 2001 see the preview report on pages 243251 crs5 amounting to 13 billion in fy2002 for medicare modernization his immediate helping hand proposal and other initiatives9 while the president indicated that his proposals would use only portion of the projected onbudget surplus for fy2002 and later years reserving some of it for debt reduction and contingencies he acknowledged that his proposals would incur sizeable impact on the paygo scorecard that would have to be remedied in order to prevent paygo sequester at the end of the session further the presidents fy2002 proposals would only compound an existing problem regarding the paygo scorecard which already recorded at the beginning of the session balance of 16053 billion for the fiscal year legislation enacted at the end of the second session of the 106th congress the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106554 december 21 2001 had instructed the omb director to reset the paygo balance for fy2001 to zero but such instructions applied to fy2002 or later years10 accordingly president bush pledged in his fy2002 budget to work with congress to ensure that any unintended sequester of spending does not occur under current law or from the enactment of any other proposals that meet the presidents objectives to reduce the debt fund priority initiatives and grant tax relief to all income tax paying americans11 in an analysis of the presidents budget the congressional budget office cbo estimated the revenue loss from his proposals to be somewhat greater over 10 years by 86 billion and direct spending increases from his proposals to be significantly greater over the same period by 160 billion including additional debt service and the outlay effects of tax proposals compared to his own estimates12 the congressional budget resolution on may 10 the house and senate reached final agreement on the budget resolution for fy2002 hconres 83 according to the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report the budget resolution assumed revenue reductions of 1369 trillion over 10 years beginning with 653 billion for fy2002 and rising to 1913 billion for fy201113 additionally the budget resolution assumed total surplus for fy2002 of 2186 billion and net increases for fy2002 and later years in direct spending to accommodate medicare reform and other initiatives consequently congressional 9 executive

budget policy for fy2002 implied action on procedural device later in the session to prevent paygo sequester for that year reconciliation instructions to the senate finance committee and the house ways and means committee were included in the budget resolution in sections 103 and 104 respectively the instructions were intended to enforce the policy calling for revenue reduction over 10 years revenue reductions were targeted at 1250 trillion during this period with associated outlay increases needed to accommodate refundable tax credits of 100 billion the reconciliation directives in total were expected to yield 135 trillion reduction in the surplus over the ensuing decade relatively small amount of revenue losses were expected to be associated with legislation considered outside of the reconciliation process implementation of the fy2002 policy congressional action on paygo legislation following adoption of the fy2002 budget resolution the house and senate began consideration of various paygo measures that is measures affecting direct spending revenues or both the centerpiece of congressional action on paygo measures during the 2001 session the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 107 16 115 stat 38150 was signed into law on june 7 2001 the measure which was developed in response to the presidents taxcut proposals and the reconciliation directives in the fy2002 budget resolution placed balances of 69501 billion and 35691 billion on the paygo scorecard for fy2001 and fy2002 respectively14 as previously stated the fy2001 and fy2002 balances are combined to determine whether paygo sequester for fy2002 is needed another major paygo measure enacted during the session was the crop year 2001 agricultural economic assistance act pl 10725 august 13 2001 although it had budgetary impact for fy2002 it added 55 billion to the paygo balance for fy2001 in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks on the united states congress and the president enacted the air transportation safety and system stabilization act into law pl 10742 september 22 2001 the act incurred over 1 billion in net costs in compensating air carriers for losses due to the attacks and for related purposes section 101b of the act 115 stat 230 designated the direct spending in the act to be an emergency requirement finally third major paygo measure completed by congress during the session was the investor and capital markets fee relief act pl 107123 january 16 2002 which also provided more than 1 billion for fy2002 in august 2001 the sequestration update report included in the midsession review of the presidents budget indicated combined balance for fy2001 and fy2002 on the paygo scorecard of 1267 billion15 this balanced was expected 14 the omb cost estimate

president office of management and budget budget of the continued crs7 to increase as congress and the president enacted additional paygo legislation during the session further the report noted that the maximum savings achievable from paygo sequester for fy2002 would be 333 billion consequently full paygo sequester including 4 cut in medicare still would leave balance on the scorecard violating the paygo requirement by nearly 100 billion the august omb estimates also showed paygo balances for fy20032006 exceeding 100 billion in each year in late december the house and senate brought their budgetary actions during the 2001 session to close by enacting the defense appropriations act for fy2002 hr 3338 president george w bush signed the measure into law on january 10 2002 pl 107117 in addition to revising the discretionary spending limits the act also included provision to prevent paygo sequester for fy2002 section 102 in division c of the act 115 stat 2342 instructed the omb

was issued on january 31 200216 as instructed by pl 107117 the omb director set the paygo balances to zero for fy2001 and fy2002 see table 1 and determined that paygo sequester was required the balances for fy20032006 were increased modestly above the levels reported in august ranging from over 110 billion to nearly 135 billion according to the omb directors report combined balance of 130279

washington august 2001 page 67 16 the final sequestration report for fy2002 is available on the omb website wwwombgov crs8 previous techniques for preventing sequester congress and the president have been able to avoid sequester under the paygo requirement largely by not enacting legislation that in the net would cause balance on the paygo scorecard at the end of the session in the two years prior to the fy2002 cycle however congress and the president intervened in the normal operation of the paygo process with the aim of preventing currentyear or future year sequester17 the intervention took the form of an instruction to the omb director either not to count the direct spending or revenue effects of legislation or to set the paygo balance for one or more years to zero it should be noted that legislative provisions containing such techniques could violate section 306 of the 1974 congressional budget act the section bars the consideration in the house or senate of any legislation containing subject matter within the jurisdiction of the respective budget committee unless it has been reported by or discharged from that committee violations of section 306 may be waived typically by special rule in the house or motion in the senate in the senate such waivers require threefifths majority further the prohibition in section 306 is not selfenforcing member must raise point of order to enforce the prohibition in 2000 the statutory intervention resulted in the removal from the paygo scorecard of costs that would have led to 105 billion paygo sequester for fy2001 for the year before that the statutory intervention removed futureyear costs to minimize the possibility of futureyear sequesters both vehicles were annual appropriations acts considered toward the very end of the session the consolidated appropriations acts for fy2000 and fy2001 the consolidated appropriations acts for fy2000 and fy2001 both enacted by crossreference legislation that made changes in direct spending and revenues under current scorekeeping rules any such changes made in an annual appropriations act must be scored under the discretionary spending limits rather than the paygo scorecard however provisions in the two consolidated appropriations acts set aside this requirement fy2000 section 1001 113 stat 1537 in division b of the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106113 november 29 1999 in addition to prohibiting the scoring of direct spending and revenue changes made in the act under the discretionary spending limits also prohibited the scoring of these changes under the paygo scorecard this prevented costs of 1552 billion for fy2000 and costs of 15193 billion for fy20002004 from being added to the paygo scorecard however even if the 1552 billion for fy2000 had been added to the paygo scorecard it would not have triggered paygo sequester for that year because savings balance of 1462 billion would have remained 17 for more detailed information on this matter see crs report 31155 techniques for preventing budget sequester by robert keith crs9 section 1001 of the act also instructed the omb director to change any balances on the scorecard for fy20002004 to zero on january 3 2000 this action removed the combined fy19992000 savings of 3014 billion from the scorecard but also removed costs for fy20012004 amounting to 15763 billion from the consolidated appropriations act and other measures that could have triggered paygo sequesters in those years if not offset or otherwise prevented fy2001 at the end of the 2000 session congress and the president wrapped up business by enacting the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106 554 114 stat 27632764 december 21 2000 which enacted regular appropriations as well as significant direct spending and revenue legislation by crossreference section 2 of the act prohibited scoring the direct spending and revenue changes made in the act under the discretionary spending limits but did require them to be scored on the paygo scorecard this resulted in costs of 7170 billion for fy2001 and costs of 49463 billion for fy20012005 being added to the paygo scorecard further section 2 of the act instructed the omb director to change the balance on the scorecard for fy2001 to zero in the course of preparing the final sequestration report for that year this action removed the combined fy20002001 costs of 10542 billion from the scorecard thereby preventing paygo sequester costs on the paygo scorecard for fy20022005 amounting to 74527 billion which will trigger paygo sequesters for those years if not offset or otherwise prevented were not affected for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31194
