income tax consequences when an item is disposed of whether by sale abandonment or contribution the initial basis is usually cost however the basis of gift is related to its basis in the donors hands and the basis of inher ited property is generally the propertys fair market value on the date of death the taxpayers us of the item and subsequent events may require adjusting the original basis which leads to the term adjusted basis adjustments may either increase or decrease the taxpayers basis in the property on july 30 2008 congress passed the h ousing assistance tax act of 2008 as part of the housing and economic recove ry act of 2008 pl 110289 it includes refundable credit for firsttime homebuyer s unlike other proposals for homebuyer tax credits considered by the 110th congress hr 5565 s 12 s 2566 s 2734 taxpayers generally are not required to re duce their basis in their newly acquired property by the amount of the credit but ar required to pay the credit back there is provision for reducing the basis by the credit if the taxpayer sells the property before repaying the credit in this case the reduced basis is used to determine whether the taxpayer must repay the remaining credit other recently passed legislation requires reduction in the basis of taxpayers principal residence if the taxpayer has cancelled mortgage debt that is excluded from gross income pl 110142 the internal revenue code ir c has number of provisions that require taxpayers to redu ce their basis in property and others that allow them to increase their basis in

report provides simplif ied explanation of the meaning of tax basis the factors that determine taxpayers tax basis and some of the ways in which tax basis is used it is intended to address some situati ons encountered by individual taxpayers and small businesses it doe s not address tax basis as it applies to corporate assets nor as it applies to sharehol ders basis in stock received in exchange for property contributed to corporation the tax basis and sale of inventor is also outside of the scope of this report as is the basis of property that is converted from personal use to business use the basis rules are found in the intern revenue code irc 1011 10231 this report is only general ove rview of very complex topic what is tax basis tax basis is the amount that taxpayer can use as the cost of property that is sold abandoned or given away when prope rty is sold taxpayers must report gain if the amount received for the property is more than the propertys tax basis gain must be reported even if th property was only used for personal purposes when the tax basis is more than the propertys sales price the result is loss however the loss generally cannot be used on tax re turn if the property was only used for personal purposes when property is aba ndoned taxpayer who used the property to produce income may be ab to deduct the basis of the property on the tax return for the year in which the property is aba ndoned when property is given as gift to another person the donors basis is important because it affects the recipients basis in the property how is the initial basis calculated there are basically three ways of acquiring property purchase inheritance and gift the basis of property depends on how it was acquired purchased property irc 1012 the initial basis of property that is purchased is the purchase price including sales tax if rebate is received the basis must be reduced by the amount of the rebate inherited property irc 1014 the initial basis of property that is inherited is what it was worth on the day that the person from whom it is inheritedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34662crs2 died there is an exception if the estate chose the alternative valuation date for valuing the entire estate in that case the initial basis of the property would be its valuation six months after the date of deat h whichever date is chosen by the estate for valuation generally the pr operty is valued at its fair market value on that date there are some special rules for family farm property and the value of minority shares of stock in closelyheld corporati ons may be reduced however the general rule is that when property is inherited th recipients basis in the inherited property is the fair market value of the property on th date of death this stepup in basis would be eliminated for one year in 2010 but under current law would be in effect for years after 2010 however number of laws were introduced in the 110th congress that would have changed this more information about these proposals can be found in crs report rl34374 estate tax legislation in the 110th congress by nonna noto gifts irc 1015 property that is received as gift is the most difficult category for determining initial basis if the gifts value required gift tax to be paid that tax may increase the recipients basis in the gift several factors determine the extent to which the basis would be increased therefore this report will not address the effect of gift tax on the reci pients basis in the property even if there is gift tax involved termining the recipients basis of gifts can be complex the basis may be the same as the donors adjusted basis discussed below this is always the case when the fair market value fmv of the gift at the time it is given is greater than the donors basis in the gift however in many cases the fmv is lower than the donors basis this must be considered in determining whether there is gain or loss when the recipient sells the property if the fmv of the gift was lower than the donors adjusted basis at the time of the gift the donors adjusted basis is the starting point for determining how much gain is realized when the property is sold by the recipient however if the sales price is lower than the donors adjusted basis the fmv at the time the gift was received will be the recipients initial basis in the property for determining the amount of loss from the sale in some cases there will be gain and loss as discussed later basis determination example fmv is greater than the donors basis mom gives daughter ring that mo m bought 10 years ago for 500 there are adjustments to the basis so moms basi s in the ring was 500 the rings current fmv is 1200 daughters basis in the ring is 500 basis determination example fmv is less than the donors basis mom gives desk when he goes away to college mom paid 400 for the desk when she bought it at resale s hop in 2000 has only used it for personal purposes and has adjustments to her basi s in the desk her basis is therefore 400 the fmv of the desk is only 300 when receives it if later sells the desk his basis will depend on the sales price of the desk sale price less than donors basis if sells the desk for 250 his basis for determining loss would be 300 the fmv when mom gave him the desk httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34662crs3 2 see 26 usc 162 167 179sale price more than donors ba sis if sells the desk for 425 his basis for determining ga in would be 400 moms basis in the desk how is basis adjusted taxpayers basis in property may be increased or decreased after the property is acquired the most common situation in which the basis in property is decreased is when the taxpayer uses the property for work or business and is allowed to take deduction for tax purposes the most co mmon situation in which the basis in property is increased is when the owner improves the property and incurs expenses in making the improvements decreases in basis although decreases in basis are most common for property used for work or bus iness decreases may also occur in property that is only used for personal purposes businessuse property tax deductions are often available for property that is used for work or business2 the basis of businessuse property must be reduced by the deductions that are allowed for the pr operty property that is expected to last more than year generally must be depreciated over its useful life this would mean that each year portion of its cost could be deducted on the taxpayers return in contrast the entire cost of property expected to last for more than one year would be deducted in the year it wa s first used thus this pr opertys basis would be zero at the end of the first tax year property with useful life of more one year includes equipment automobiles and buildings including rental property for this property the original basis of businessuse property is reduced each year by the depreciation that is allowable on the tax return whether or not that depreciation was actually claimed on the tax return if the taxpayer claimed more depreciation than was allowable the larger amount is used to reduce basis this means that if depreciation could ve been taken it will reduce the basis of the property even if th at depreciation was ne ver claimed on tax return this concept is particularly important for people who own residential property that they rent out even if ta xpayers do not take th depreciation deduction they will still have to reduce their basis in the property when calculating their gain on the sale of the property personaluse property taxpayer may need to reduce the basis in either business or personaluse prope rty if that property is da maged casualty loss and the taxpayer receives an insurance settlement or other payment for the damage if car is damaged by hail and the owner receives check from the insurance company for the damage the basis in the car must be reduced by the amount of the check if the car is later repaired the basis will be increased as explained later in some cases the basis in personal use property may need to be reduced because the buyer was able to reduce her tax liability as result of the purchase thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34662crs4 3 these are generally loan origination fee and discount points wh ich are both reported on the closing statement 4 this only applies to points paid by the seller points paid by the buyer do not reduce basis see rev proc 9427 19941 cb 613 mar 28 1994 5 hr 5565 s 12 s 2566 s 2734 6 for more information about the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act of 2007 please see crs report rl34212 analysis of the proposed tax excl usion for canceled mortgage debt income by mark p keightley and erika lunder 7 for more information about the firsttime homebuyer credit please see crs report rl34664 the firsttime homebuyer tax credit by carol pettit 8 if the right was for fixed period of time ra ther than perpetual money exchanged for the temporary easement would generally be consider ed rent and therefore includible in gross income when received rents received do not reduce the basis of the underlying propertymost common example of this involves the purchase of principal residence current law allows the buyer to take deduction on form 1040 schedule for the points3 that were paid by the seller the basis of the residence then must be reduced by the amount of the points4 tax credits for those who purchase certain financially distressed properties as th eir principal residence were proposed in the 110th congress5 each of the proposals would require buyers to reduce their basis in the residence by the amount of the credit the mortgage forgiveness debt re lief act of 2007 pl 110142 allows taxpayers to exclude debt cancellation from income when part of the acquisition debt on their principal residence is cancelled or forgiven however taxpayers taking advantage of this provision must reduce their basis in their principal residence by the amount of the debt cancellation inco that was excluded from income6 the housing assistance tax act of 2008 pl 110289 provides refundable tax credit to firsttime homebuyers who purchase principal residence after april 8 2008 and before july 1 2009 the credit is generally repaid over 15year period and the basis of the property is not reduced by the credit however if the property is sold before the credit is fully repaid the taxpayer generally must repay the remaining amount in the year of the sale an exception exists if the gain on the sale is less than the outstanding credit to determine whether any or all of the outstanding credit must be repaid the gain must be recalculated for this recalculation the adjusted basis of the pr operty must be reduced by the outstanding credit this reduction in basis is used only to determine repayment of the credit it is not used to determine the gain realized for tax purposes7 less common situation in which basi s in personaluse property would be reduced involves an easement in this situation the property owner grants someone else the perpetual right to nonexcl usive use of part of the property8 an example would be allowing an adjacent property owner to use driveway on the first owners land if payment was received in exchan ge for this perpetual right the amount received for the use of the driveway would reduce the basis of the land where the driveway was located another situation would involve severance award connected with an involuntary conversion or conde mnation an example would be househttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34662crs5 owned on narrow street that the city has decided to widen part of the land the house is on will be used for the wider st reet the land owner might be given severance award to compensate for expenses that would be incurred to replace fence trees etc the severance award would reduce the basis on the remaining property however that basis would be incr eased to the extent that money was spent to install new fence etc increases in basis the most common way in which basis in property is increased is by improvements made to the property improvements must be distinguished from repairs repairs are generally main tenance expenses these would include painting house repairin g roof sealing driveway cleaning airducts changing oil in car and having ring cleaned and prongs tightened in contrast improvements would include adding room to your house replacing the entire roof on building paving driveway putting new engine in car and replacing small stone in ring with larger one improvements also include restoring damaged property to the condition it was in before the casualty loss in the case of casualty loss such as the car with hail damage that was discussed above basis w ould have been reduced by the insurance ttlement but restoring the car to its previous cond ition would increase the basis by the amount spent on restoration as an example c onsider car whose adjusted basis was 11000 before the hail damage the insuran ce company determined that there was 1500 in damage to the car the owners policy had 500 ductible therefore the check from the insurance was only 1000 the adjusted basis in the car is 10000 11000 1000 after the owner receives the insurance check by shopping around the owner finds someone who will restore the car for 1200 the basis in the car after the owner pa ys 1200 for the restoration is 11200 10000 1200 it does not matter that the restor ation was done for less than the insurance company estimated similarly if the ow ner found that all th reputable repair facilities cost more than the 1500 estimated by the insurance company the basis would be increased by the amount paid for the restoration if the restoration cost 1800 the owners basis in the car would be 11800 after restoring it furthermore the cost of restoring damaged property increas the propertys basis even if there had been decrease in the basis from insu rance proceeds or other settlement when free labor by the owner or by fri ends and family is used to improve property there is increase in basis for the value of the work performed sometimes called sweat equity the value of the property may increase but the basis is unchanged unless there are out ofpocket expenses incurred for the improvements how is basis u sed in tax law basis determines whether there is gain or loss when property is sold for businessuse property basis is one factor used to dete rmine allowable depreciation depreciation of businessuse property irc 167 depreciation for businessuse property is based on the propertys basis and its classlife if improvements are made to the property those imp rovements are depreciatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34662crs6 separately from the original property but the adjusted basis of the improvements increases the adjusted basis in the property when it is sold determining gain or loss when property is sold irc 1001 when property is sold the gain or loss is determined by subtracting the adjusted basis of the property from the sales price if the difference is greater than zero there is taxable gain if less than zero there is loss but its deductibility for tax purposes will depend upon whether the property was used for business investment or personal purposes gains the taxable gain generally is the difference between the sales price and the adjusted basis but the gain can be reduced by expenses incurred in selling the property this is true whether the pr operty was businessuse property or only used for personal purposes gain calculation example man received stuffed animal costing 2 as gift from his parents thirty years ago this man has now discovered that this particular toy is considered rare and valuable and decides to sell it on an internet auction site the mans adjusted basis in the toy is 2 his parents basis when they gave it to him the sales price is 150 the difference is 148 but he had to pay 15 to the auction site and 5 to ship the toy to the buyer his gain on the sale is 128 150 2 15 5 128 losses calculating losses is done in similar way however only losses generated by business or investmentuse property can reduce taxable income losses on personaluse property cannot be deducted sales expenses increase the amount of loss loss calculation example businessuse property landscaper owns large mower that was purchased for 2500 in july 2005 the allowed and allowable depreciation is 1775 for the peri od of ownership and use thus the adjusted basis is 775 2500 1775 775 an advertisement costing 50 was placed in the local paper to sell the mower the mower was sold for 500 the landscapers tax return will report 325 loss from the sale of the mower 500 775 275 275 50 325 loss calculation example personaluse property couple received china gravy boat as wedding present the gift cost 150 they received other china in the pattern they had chosen and have realized they will not be using the gravy boat so they list the gravy boat on an internet auction site when the bidding closes the winning bid is only 100 the f ee for the auction site is 10 and it cost another 15 to ship the gravy boat to the buyer there is 75 loss on the sale 100 150 50 50 10 15 75 since the gravy boat was personaluse property the loss cannot be claimed on the couples tax retu rn however the 100 received is not included in gross income this is why money generated by personal garage sale is generally not includible in income for tax purposes gain loss gifts as noted earlier are complex in some cases property received as gift may be sold w ith resulting gain or loss this occurshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34662crs7 when the sale price is more than the propertys fmv at the time of the gift but less than the donors basis example of gain loss sale sale price less than donors basis but more than fmv at the time of the gift refer to the earlier example where received desk from mom the donors basis was 400 but fmv at the time of the gift was 300 if sells th desk for 325 he will have gain and loss donors basis is used to calculate gain 325 400 75 so there is gain fmv at the time of the gift is used to calculate loss 325 300 25 so there is loss
