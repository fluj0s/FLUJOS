trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division usmalaysia relations implications of the 2008 elections summary this report discusses key aspects of the usmalaysia relationship including economics and trade counterterrorism cooperation and defense ties and the possible impact of malaysias 2008 elections on the future of the relationship in parliamentary elections held on march 8 2008 the barisan nasional bn which has ruled malaysia since independence in 1957 was struck by political tsunami that saw it lose its twothirds supermajority for the first time since 1969 malaysias major opposition parties won 82 of the 222 parliamentary seats up for election in addition the opposition parties won control of five of malaysias 13 state governments the election results are widely seen as vote against the current policies of the malaysian government which could have implications for relations with the united states prior to the elections the bilateral relationship has been generally positive and constructive particularly in the area of trade malaysia is key trading partner of the united states and is regarded as an effective and cooperative regional player in the war against terror the united states and malaysia also have informal defense ties including commercial access to malaysian ports and repair facilities despite these positive dynamics the bilateral relationship has at times been strained past differences have stemmed from disagreements between malaysias former prime minister mahathir mohamad and the united states over such issues as the internal suppression of dissent in malaysia the israelipalestinian conflict iraq globalization western values and world trade policy relations are perceived as having improved since abdullah badawi became prime minister in 2003 after years of strong economic growth malaysia has become middle income country much of its gain in economic prosperity has come from the export of electronics and electrical products with the united states as its top export market according to us trade figures malaysia exports over 30 billion of goods each year to the united states and imports over 11 billion from the united states the united states and malaysia have enjoyed positive trade relationship over the last few years in part because both nations favor trade and investment liberalization in asia malaysia is the united states 10th largest trading partner building on their common perspective of international trade malaysia and the united states concluded trade and investment framework agreement in 2004 and are currently negotiating bilateral free trade agreement key issues still to be resolved in the negotiations principally revolve around market access for key goods and services in both the united states and malaysia and intellectual property rights protection in malaysia in addition the dismissal of malaysias chief negotiator trade minister datuk seri rafidah aziz may complicate future talks this report

ending 22 years of rule by mahathir however an unexpectedly weak showing for badawis political party the united malays national organization umno and its barisan nasional bn coalition partners in the march 8 2008 parliamentary elections may have implications for usmalaysian relations this report provides an overview of recent political and economic developments in malaysia and examines implications for us policy malaysias 2008 elections umno and its coalition partners have been in power since malaysias independence in 1957 in the first general election in 1959 umno and its coalition partners1 received just over half the votes but won 74 out of the 104 seats in the dewan rakyat peoples hall the more powerful lower house of malaysias 1 at that time umno was part of political coalition known as the alliance party predecessor to the bn crs2 parliament2 in every parliamentary election from 1959 to 20043 an umnoled coalition has won at least twothirds of the seats in parliament with the exception of 1969 when the coalition won 95 out of 144 seats 660 twothirds supermajority is important because it allows the bn to amend malaysias constitution without support from opposition parties in the election of 2004 the bn won 198 out of 219 or 904 of the seats political tsunami the outcome of the parliamentary elections of march 8 2008 surprised many people major malaysian newspaper the star quoted one opposition leader who compared the results to tsunami4 the bn barely received half of the popular vote and won just 140 of the 222 seats in the dewan rakyat eight seats less than it needed to retain supermajority the biggest losers among the bn members were umno which saw its seats decline from 109 to 79 the malaysian chinese association mca which dropped from 31 to 15 seats and the malaysian peoples movement party parti gerakan rakyat malaysia or gerakan which held onto only 2 of its 10 seats in the dewan rakyat most commentators stated the 2008 elections were the bns worst results since 1959 the main opposition parties the democratic action party dap the islamic party of malaysia parti islam semalaysia or pas and the peoples justice party parti keadilan rakyat or pkr all increased their number of seats in the parliament the pkr experienced the greatest rise jumping from just one to 31 seats the dap and pas both increased their seats on the dewan rakyat by 16 seats for total of 28 and 23 respectively altogether malaysias opposition parties received 468 of the popular vote and won 82 out of the 222 seats on the dewan rakyat the bns weakness was also reflected in the results of the 12 concurrent state elections5 opposition parties took control of five of the 13 malaysian states including surprise victories in kedah penang and selangor the pas retained its control over the state of kelantan and the dap leads small opposition majority in the state of perak among the seven contested states in which the bn retained control the opposition gained seats in all but two states perlis and sabah there are differing opinions on why the bn lost so much of its support and the opposition parties gained so much support some commentators maintain that badawi was responsible because he had failed to make adequate reforms within the 2 malaysia has bicameral parliament consisting of the elected dewan rakyat the lower house and the largelyappointed dewan negara national hall the upper house 3 under malaysian law parliamentary election must be held at least every five years however in many cases early elections were held after about four years 4 nik aziz likens big win to tsunami the star march 9 2008 5 the state of sarawak did not hold concurrent elections crs3 bn and the government others stated that economic factors and in particular rising income disparities and inflation had led voters to switch from the bn to the opposition parties another group of political observers saw the election results as evidence that malaysias ethnicitybased political system was obsolete and longer reliable base of power for the bn implications of the elections in the immediate aftermath of the elections exprime minister mahathir suggested badawi should consider resigning6 while badawi did not resign he did reorganize his cabinet reducing the number of ministers from 90 to 70 and removing several longstanding members according to badawi half of the members of the cabinet announced on march 18 2008 were new faces7 among the people removed from the cabinet was datuk seri rafidah aziz who had held the position of minister of international trade and industry for over 20 years aziz has been an important figure in usmalaysian trade relations it is unclear what impact if any the new cabinet will have on malaysias policies the dramatic drop in support for two of malaysias ethnicallybased political parties the mca and the malaysian indian congress mic has also led to calls for political changes gerakan party chief datuk chang ko youn who lost his seat in the parliament to dap candidate has suggested that bn member parties should consider eliminating ethnic restrictions on party membership as first step to the formation of single party8 however mic president seri s samy vellu who also lost his bid for reelection to the parliament to an opposition candidate rejected changs suggestion saying such an action will dilute the rights of the indian community9 some commentators have suggested that the shift in chinese and indian support to opposition party candidates reflects growing sense among malaysias influential ethnic minorities that the bn longer adequate reflects their interests others attribute the desertion of the bn by malaysias chinese and indian to economic issues such as food price inflation and rising income disparities the strengthening of opposition party power in the dewan rakyat and in state governments is also expected to restrict the power of badawi and the bn to implement changes in policy the loss of supermajority in the dewan rakyat is considered by some psychological and political blow to the bn which has ruled virtually unchallenged in malaysia since independence there is discussion that the election results may be the first sign that politics in malaysia are starting the process of transformation into twoparty nonethnic system and possibly more truly democratic process 6 jane ritikos examine losses says dr m the star march 10 2008 7 abdullah announces cabinet lineup half of administration new faces bernama march 18 2008 8 samy time not ripe for barisan to be single party the star march 17 2008 9 ibid crs4 in addition opposition control of five of malaysias 13 states may also curtail badawis power for example the new state government in penang has already announced that it will longer abide by the bns longstanding new economic policy that grants preferential treatment to malaysias bumiputera10 however past judicial tradition of broadly interpreting the federal governments power under malaysias constitution may mitigate the oppositions ability to use the state governments to exert power or influence final concern raised by the bns weak showing in the 2008 is the potential for social unrest and governmental policy change the last time the bn or its predecessors did as poorly in parliamentary election was in 1969 following the 1969 elections there were violent ethnic riots in malaysia between may and july precipitated by the may 13 incident in kuala lumpur during which approximately 200 people were killed following the riots of 1969 the bn announced series of economic reforms known as the new economic policy nep the events of 1969 are discussed in more detail below however in the weeks following the election there has been virtually violence or ethnic unrest in malaysia for usmalaysia relations the 2008 elections will have little direct or immediate impact with the possible exception of the removal of aziz as minister of international trade and industry aziz has been malaysias chief negotiator during the usmalaysia free trade agreement fta talks her departure implies loss of institutional knowledge for the malaysian negotiation team her replacement tan sri muhyiddin yassin was minister of agriculture and agrobased industry in the previous cabinet malaysias political dynamics many of the political cleavages of malaysian society which continue to have relevance to todays political dynamics find their root in malaysias colonial past malaysia inherited diverse demographic mix from the british through the importation of labor the british added ethnic chinese and indians to the malay and other indigenous populations of peninsular malaya sabah and sarawak the demographic composition of sabah and sarawak includes higher percentage of indigenous groups such as the iban together the malay and indigenous population collectively known as the bumiputeras comprise about 58 of the population compared to 24 for the chinese and 7 for the indians traditionally ethnic chinese and indians have controlled disproportionately greater share of the nations wealth than bumiputeras malaysia has complex history of intercommunal politics british plan after world war ii to create the malaysian union that incorporated all of the malayan territories except singapore would have provided for common citizenship regardless of ethnicity concerns among the malays that they could not compete with the more 10 claudia theophilus malaysia pm lessons to be learnt jazeera march 11 2008 malays and other indigenous groups are known as bumiputeras or sons of the soil crs5 commerciallyminded chinese led to the creation of umno conservative malay nationalist organization that later reformed itself into political party negotiations between the british and umno led to the creation of the federation of malaya in 1948 which included singapore and provided special rights for the bumiputeras and malaysias sultans sabah and sarawak joined the federation to form malaysia later in 1963 while singapore left the federation in 1965 at independence in 1957 there was an understanding that malays would exert dominant position in political life in malaya while ethnic chinese and indians would be given citizenship and allowed to continue their role in the economy11 this accommodation between malaysias ethnic groups has not always been tranquil between 1948 and 1960 the communist party of malaysia which was largely comprised of ethnic chinese waged guerilla war against the british this came to be known as the malayan emergency12 the internal security act isa which continues to be used to suppress groups that threaten the regime originally was put in place by the british to combat communist subversion the special branch which malaysia inherited from the british continues to act as the primary intelligence and security unit under the royal malaysian police during the emergency malays generally sided with the british against the communists whose ranks were drawn largely from the chinese community by the mid1950s the insurrection had collapsed added to this history of intercommunal strife were the riots of may to july 1969 in which reportedly 196 were killed most of those killed were ethnic chinese rioting began on may 13 three days after the alliance party predecessor to the bn failed to win twothirds of the seats in the dewan rakyat and lost control of selangor and perak much like the results of the 2008 elections one of the main losers in the 1969 elections was mca which lost 14 of its 27 seats in the dewan rakyat because of the rioting elections to be held in sabah and sarawak were suspended and state of emergency was declared13 partly in response to the 1969 riots the new economic policy nep was instituted in 1971 nep provided preferential treatment for the bumiputera majority via kind of quota system in order to increase their share of the economic wealth of the country the new development policy ndp replaced the nep in 1990 the ndp retained nep goals such as 30 bumiputera control of corporate assets prime 11 barbara

mahathirs subsequent vision 2020 policy had similar elements but was more inclusive and attempted to do more to foster national ethnic unity14 the bn appears to be relying on an expanding economy to be able to disproportionately favor bumiputeras while not undermining its economic appeal to malaysias chinese and indian population in this way malaysias social harmony and support for the bn may be linked to economic growth for this reason periods of economic stagnation could carry the prospect of eroding the delicate balance between ethnic groups in malaysia and undermining support for the bn internal politics malaysia is constitutional monarchy but of an unusual kind whose structure includes 13 states and three federal territories every five years the nine hereditary sultans elect one from among their group to be the yang di pertuan agong traditional title equating to king the agong exercises limited authority and acts on the advice of the prime minister parliament and the cabinet the prime minister is the head of the federal government which has 25 ministries out of total of 13 states four are ruled by state governors appointed by the federal government in the nine other states the hereditary sultan fulfills this function each state has state legislature the lower house of malaysias parliament the dewan rakyat has 222 members elected for terms not to exceed five years the upper house the dewan negara has 70 members 44 members appointed by the king and 26 elected members with two from each state malaysia is an ambiguous mixed15 or semi16 democracy that has both democratic and authoritarian elements the constitution is largely democratic and provides for regular elections that are responsive to the electorate the government is based on parliamentary system and the judiciary is designed to be independent despite this democratic structure authoritarian control limits the ability of the opposition to defeat the ruling coalition at the polls17 prime minister badawi heads the united malays national organization umno the key party in the bn the bn also includes the malaysian chinese association mca the malaysian indian congress mic the parti gerakan rakyat malaysia malaysian peoples movement party or gerakan and number of smaller political parties the opposition is led by the panmalaysian islamic party parti islam semalaysia or pas the peoples justice party parti keadilan rakyat or pkr and the democratic action party dap in 1999 pas dap pkr and malaysian peoples party parti rakyat malaysia or prm formed an opposition alliance known

for the 2008 elections dap pas and the pkr formed an alliance called the barisan rakyat peoples front with number of smaller parties umno is the most influential party in malaysia today and represents the interests of the mostly sunni malays the malaysian administration under both mahathir and badawi has promoted moderate form of islam islam hadhari see below under secular polity while opposing the rise of islamic extremists whose policies are more closely associated with pas18 the ruling bn under mahathirs leadership used the power of the state including the isa to thwart political gains by pas which advocates more conservative view of islam pass influence is traditionally found in the northeast states of kelantan and terengganu19 the transition from mahathir to badawi was consolidated in the march 21 2004 elections that expanded the ruling bns hold on parliament from 77 to 90 of the seats the bn also increased its share of votes from 57 to 6420 following the 2004 elections the governments coalition controlled 11 of 12 state governments the election was viewed by observers as vote of confidence by malaysians in badawis relatively moderate form of islamic practice as opposed to the hardline approach of pas21 the pas which offered more islamist agenda lost voter confidence including in its area of traditional support in northeast peninsular malaya22 the political transition from mahathir to badawi led to an improvement of us malaysian relations some think badawi who was first elected to parliament in 1978 is attempting to strike balance between providing continuity of leadership to produce stability and meeting expectations for more open and consultative style of government badawi pledged to work with the bn to realize the policy goals articulated in vision 202023 it is thought that badawis political legitimacy will at least in part be dependent on his ability to deliver sound economic growth and to counter the perceived rise of islamic extremism in malaysia24 badawis respected 18 for more detailed discussion of these dynamics see william case deep insecurity and political stability inside mahathirs malaysia in bruce vaughn ed the unraveling

extremism however badawis government has been beset by division within umno in part these are based on differences between former prime minister mahathir muhammad and prime minister badawi more recently now exminister aziz has supposedly used her leadership of the wanita umno umnos main womens organization in an attempt to influence government and party policies it is thought that party divisions led badawi to call for the early general elections of 2008 in hopes of securing fresh mandate and reinforcing his position within his party26 the outcome of the elections was clearly contrary to his hopes islam hadhari under badawis leadership malaysia has been developing concept islam hadhari that seeks to promote moderate or progressive view of islamic civilization27 badawi has stated that we are responsible for ensuring that the culture of extremism and violent acts in the name of islam does not happen in malaysia28 some observers believe that islam hadhari could promote view of islam that encourages and emphasizes development social justice and tolerance29 increasing attention appears to be focused on the role that moderate islamic ideology and moderate islamic states can play in countering the forces of islamic extremism within the region and beyond however some analysts are concerned about what they see as an increasing islamisation trend in malaysia and that more conservative form of islam is emerging in malaysia despite government efforts through islam hadhari to pave the way for the development of malaysia as bastion of islamic moderation30

years than it was in the 1990s malaysia was founding member of asean in 1967 and in the 1990s was strong advocate for expanding asean to include burma laos and vietnam more recently malaysia has

malaysia and other asean states towards china have undergone significant shift over the past two decades36 relations with china were once characterized by much suspicion more recently malaysia has viewed china as both major competitor and major trading partner there are some indications that malaysia has attempted to maintain the value of its currency the ringit in line with the value of chinas currency the renminbi to protect its competitive position in key commodity markets malaysia normalized relations with china in 1974 but has maintained close economic and trade relations with taiwan

of china was malaysias 8th largest trading partner in 2007 in recent years issues of economic competition and cooperation have been more of concern to asean states than security concerns37 china

among the top issues between the two nations are differences over malaysian policies towards illegal indonesian workers and maritime dispute off borneo which has implications for control of valuable

factors including ethnic tensions economic and trade interdependency and common security concerns51 singapore is largely chinese citystate with large malay minority malaysia is largely malay nation with large chinese minority economic conditions force singapore to rely on malaysia for many resources including water and labor at the same time malaysia relies on singapore for capital investments

affairs george yeo the results of the 2008 elections should not affect bilateral relations52 malaysias economy and foreign trade malaysia is relatively mature industrialized nation whose economy

living standards and reduce income and wealth inequality between the nations various ethnic groups in particular there is concern about the income and wealth differential between the bumiputera and the ethnic chinese and indian of malaysia for the period 2006 to 2010 the malaysian government has established set of objectives to achieve its overall economic goals as part of its ninth malaysia

general but occasionally differ on specific issues both nations support the general concept of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation also both are actively pursuing trade and investment

relations for the united states the proposed allasian free trade area is rival model to its proposed ftaap malaysia is one of the five members of asean that have ratified the new asean charter78 one of the main outcomes of the november summit in singapore was the signing of new charter on november 20 2007 to be officially adopted the new charter must be ratified by all 10 members of asean even before the charter was signed the philippines indicated that it was unlikely to ratify the charter unless burma myanmar upheld the documents provisions on democracy and human rights among its key provisions the new charter commits the organization to its transformation into regional economic community similar to the european union by 2015 included in its provisions are collective commitment to the creation of an asean community in which there is free flow of goods services and investment facilitated movement of business persons professionals talents and labour and freer flow of capital however the charter also contains an asean minus x provision that effectively allows any asean member to opt out of economic commitments if it so chooses it is unclear at this time how the creation of

united states as neocolonial power strongly under the influence of coterie of zionist jews80 however mahathirs strong expression of sympathy and support following the attacks on september 11 2001 apparently led to thawing of previously cool relationship that culminated with an official state visit to the white house by mahathir in may 200281 the more cordial relationship between malaysia and the united states has seemingly continued into the badawi administration however there are aspects of usmalaysia relations that periodically raise tensions between the two nations in particular

and syria and iran were similarly threatened unless they changed their governments89 malaysias opposition to the iraq war and the continued us presence in iraq continued after badawi became prime minister in speech at the oxford centre for islamic studies in january 2004 badawi said the world must never forget that iraq was illegally invaded the world was told before the fact that the invasion was necessary because of an imminent threat posed by weapons of mass destruction we know today that this reason was baseless90 during an umno party meeting in september 2004 badawi reportedly said that western countries had fueled international terrorism through the invasion of iraq and their proisrael stance on the conflict between israel and the palestinians91 later on that same month in his speech before the united nations general assembly badawi stated malaysia is convinced that the fight against terrorism cannot succeed through force of arms alone92 he went on to denounce the
