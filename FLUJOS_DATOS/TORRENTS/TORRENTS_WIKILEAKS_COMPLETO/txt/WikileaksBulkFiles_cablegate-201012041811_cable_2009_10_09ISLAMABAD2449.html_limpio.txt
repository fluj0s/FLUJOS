patterson reasons 14 abc and d 1 s summary the pakistani army has for just the second time approved deployment of us special operation elements to support pakistani military operations the first deployment with socfwdpak elements embedded with the frontier corps in xxxxxxxxxxxx occurred in september reftel previously the pakistani military leadership adamantly opposed letting us embed our special operations personnel with their military forces the developments of the past two months thus appear to represent sea change in their thinking end summary 2 s pakistan army general headquarters ghq informed odrp that it approved request from the armys 11 corps commander lt general masood aslam for us socfwdpak personnel to deploy to xxxxxxxxxxxx south waziristan and xxxxxxxxxxxx north waziristan in the fata in order to provide intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr support and general operational advice to the 11 corps xxxxxxxxxxxx the 11 corps had informally approached odrp about our providing such support approximately one week ago odrp responded positively 3 s socfwdpak support to 11 corps would be at the xxxxxxxxxxxx and would include live downlink of unmanned aerial vehicle uav full motion video socfwdpaks initial conops envision deployment of six personnel each to xxxxxxxxxxxx in order to finalize our planning and obtain formal goahead from centcom odrp has requested additional information on the timing and purpose of the 11 corps planned military operations from brigadier general amjad shabbir the armys director general of military operations dgmo 4 s this is just the second time that ghq has approved deployment of us special operations elements to support pakistani military operations in september 2009 four socfwdpak personnel who were embedded with the frontier corps fc at xxxxxxxxxxxx in the fata provided isr for an fc operation reftel this support was highly successful enabling the fc to execute precise and effective artillery strike on an enemy location 5 s in recent days the fc informally approached odrp for repeat deployment of socfwdpak personnel to xxxxxxxxxxxx socfwdpak is preparing conop while the fc obtains approval from ghq 6 s comment us special operation elements have been in pakistan for more than year but were largely limited to training role the pakistani army leadership previously adamantly opposed letting us embed us special operations forces sof with their military forces to support their operations the recent approval by ghq almost certainly with the personal consent of chief of army staff general kayani for socfwdpak deployments to xxxxxxxxxxxx appears to represent sea change in pakistani thinking patient relationshipbuilding with the military is the key factor that has brought us to this point the pakistanis are increasingly confident that we do not have ulterior motives in assisting their operations in addition the direct recipients of socfwdpak training appear to have recognized the potential benefits of bringing us sof personnel into the field with them for operational advice and other support in addition the success of the initial deployment to xxxxxxxxxxxx likely helped catalyze the followup requests for new and repeat support 7 s comment continued these deployments are highly politically sensitive because of widelyheld concerns among the public about pakistani sovereignty and opposition to allowing foreign military forces to operate in any fashion on pakistani soil should these developments andor related matters receive any coverage in the pakistani or us media the pakistani military will likely stop making requests for such assistance end comment islamabad 00002449 002 of 002 patterson
