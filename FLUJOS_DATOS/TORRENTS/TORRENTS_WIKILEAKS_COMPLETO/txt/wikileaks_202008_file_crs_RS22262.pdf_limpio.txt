artiﬁcially manipulated by reducing reﬁnery capacity or by any other form of market manipulation or pricegouging practices the 110th congress enacted the energy independence and security act of 2007 with provision authorizing the ftc to promulgate rule concerning market manipulation also in the 110th congress the house has passed hr 1252 which would deﬁne price gouging as excessively unconscionable or unreasonably increased prices during presidentially declared energy emergencies incorporates the ftc act directs ftc enforcement and provides for civil and criminal penalties several similar measures are pending in the senate commerce committee and hr 6074 to make oilproducing and exporting cartels illegal under us antitrust laws this report which may be updated to further reﬂect congressional action attempts to provide the antitrust context for the prohibited practices notes prior congressional action concerning vertical divestiture in the petroleum industry and provides information on the state divorcement statuteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22262 order code rs22262 updated may 28 2008 price gouging the antitrust laws and vertical integration in the petroleum industry how they are related janice rubin legislative attorney american law division summary the antitrust laws and statutes to prohibit price gouging each aim to serve the same end realization of lower or reasonable prices fo r consumers but they do so from different perspectives antitrust law operates on the premise that vigorous and unfettered marketplace competition will yiel d the most advantageous result for consumers statutes concerning price gouging by contrast are direct consumer protection measures generally making reference to competition statutes to limit the extent of vertical integra tion in the petroleum industry common ownership of different stages of production marketing or retailing have been proposed at the federal level and exist at the state level but contrary to the expectations of proponents the price of gasoline in those states that prohibit refiners from operating retail gasoline stations is generally higher than in states without similar prohibitions although the potential for anticompetitive actions by vertically integrated entities has been noted by among others the federal trade commission ftc it also states in 2005 report that the vast majority of the ftcs investig ations into the petroleum i ndustry have revealed market factors to be the primary drivers of both price increases and price spikes the energy policy act of 2005 required an ft c investigation to determin if the price of gasoline is being artificially manipulated by reducing refinery capacity or by any other form of market manipulation or pri cegouging practices the 110th congress enacted the energy independence and security act of 2007 w ith provision authorizing the ftc to promulgate rule concerning mark et manipulation also in the 110th congress the house has passed hr 1252 which would fine price gouging as excessively unconscionable or unreasonably increased prices during presidentially declared energy emergencies incorporates the ftc act directs ftc enforcement and provides for civil and criminal penalties several similar measures are pending in the senate commerce committee and hr 60 74 to make oilpr oducing and exporting cartels illegal under us antitr ust laws this report whic h may be updated to further reflect congressional action atte mpts to provide the antitrust context for the prohibited practices notes prior congressional action concerning vertical divestiture in the petroleum industry and provides informa tion on the state di vorcement statuteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22262crs2 1 section 3 of the sherman act 15 usc 3 is virtually identical to section 1 except that it specifically makes the prohibitions contained in sec tion 1 applicable to the district of columbia 2 in us v grinnell 384 us 563 1966 the c ourt noted that the offense of monopoly under section 2 of the sherman act has two elemen ts 1 the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and 2 the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as consequence of superior product business acumen or historic accident at 57071 emphasis added see also crs report rs20241 monopoly and monopolization fundamental but separate concepts in us antitrust law and crs report rl33708 the distinction between monopoly and monopolization in antitrust law both by janice rubin 3 united states v colgate co 250 us 300 307 1919 emphasis added 4 combinations such as mergers joint ventures and various vertical agreements hold the promise of increasing firms efficiency and enabling it to compete more effectively accordingly such combinations are judged under rule of reason an inquiry into market power continuedthe primary purpose of the antitrust laws is to foster free and unfettered competition on the assumption that such competition will produce the best result for consumers the lowest and most reasonable prices to that end section 1 of the sherman act 15 usc 1 prohibits contracts or cons piracies in restraint of trade1 that is section 1 forbids two or more persons or entities from eg agreeing to limit output or set prices section 2 of the sherman act 15 usc 2 prohibits monopolization or ttempted monopolization either of which can be violated by indivi dual persons or entities although the provision also prohibits agreements to monopolize sec tion 2 is frequently used in conjunction with charge pursuant to the socalled antimerg er provision of the clayton act section 7 of the clayton act 15 usc 18 that having been said it is important to emphasize that the prohibition against monopolization is not violated by the mere possession of monopoly power or some predetermined share of the market us antitrust law does not include nofault monopoly statute and there is bright line that once crossed exposes an otherwise lawful monopolist to antitrust sanctions2 in addition the courts have acknowledged the right of an individual businessman to do business or not to do business with w homever he likes and on whatever conditions he deems acceptable in the absence of any purpose to create or maintain monopoly the sherman act does not restrict the long recognized righ t of trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business freely to exerci his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal and of course he may announce in advance the circumstances under which he will refuse to sell3 finally the role of vertical integration common ownership of different stages of production marketing or reta iling is ambiguous vertical integration without more does not at least at the federal level automatically lead to conclusion of antitrust law violation although to be sure there may be some anticompetitiv effects just as there may be lawful monopoly power that if misused by the monopolist to extend or maintain his monopoly becomes unlawful as violati on of the antitrust law prohibition against monopolization in restraint of trade there is general prohibition in us law on the ownership of all stages of production by single firm4 but lawful vertical integration mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22262crs3 4 continued and market structure

price gouging by adam vann further the supreme court has ruled that the divisions of single firm are not legally capable of the kind of conspiracy prohibited by the antitrust laws nothing in the literal meaning of those terms unilateral concerted excludes coordinated conduct among officers or employees of the same company but it is perfectly plain that an internal agreemen t to implement single unitary firms policies does not raise the antitrust dangers that 1 was designed to police the officers of single firm are not separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests so agreements among them do not suddenly bring together economic power that was previously pursuing divergent goals coordination within firm is as likely to result from an effort to compete as fro m an effort to stifle competition in the marketplace such coordination may be necessary if business enterprise is to compete effectively copperweld supra note 4 at 769 7 s 2387 94th cong sec 2b 8 major producers major refiners and m ajor marketers were defined in section 101give rise to anticompetitive practices that would be challengeable as violations of antitrust prohibitions5 in the petroleum industry for example any single entity may engage in any or all of the stages explor ation or production of crude oil transporta tion of crude oil to refineries operation of crude il refineries transportation or storage of refined product distribution and marketing at the local wholesale or retail level or retail sales vertical integration does not without more therefore violat the prohibition against monopolization nor does price increase attributable to ve rtical integration constitute violation of the antitrust laws unless it is shown that the increase is the result of collusion between the vertically integrated firm and another firm or portion thereof6 there were unsuccessful attempts in the mid1970s precipitated by the oil embargo of 1973 and the operation of opec to mandate divestiture in the petroleum industry s 2387 94th congress for example asserted that in order to facilitate the creation and maintenance of competition in the petroleu m industry s 2387 would require the most expeditious and equitable separa tion and divestment of assets and interests of vertically integrated major petroleum companies7 the legislation woul d have prohibited major producers from owning or controlling any interest in any refinery asset major refiners or major marketers from being involved in pr oduction or transporta tion and petroleum transporters from being involved in any other segment of the industry8 refiners would have been able to continue to own retail marketing facilities but to operate only thosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22262crs4 9 section 103 10

was argued both that s 2387 would increase competition at each level of the indus try increase refining capacity by reducing barriers to entry into that sector and place restraints on the pricing power of the opec cartel10 and that vertical integration was not the cause of the spiralin g cost of petroleum products to the american consumers11 would lead to reduced efficiencies in the petroleum industry would have effect on the pricing polic ies of opec and would lead to higherpriced petroleum products12 the bill was reported favorably by the senate antitrust subcommittee and the full judiciary committee but not voted on by the senate divorcement statutes however do exist at the state level there are several states that currently prohibit oil refiners from operating retail service stations they mandate operation of such stations onl by independent operators ie persons neither employed by nor under contract to the refiner13 according to the ftc report cited at note 5 the rationale for the state statutes was the concern that an integrated refinerretailer might set wholesale prices to i ndependent jobbers and gasoline stations at rate higher than its ow n internal transfer price thus enabling the refinerretailer to sell gasoline to consumers at prices lower than those charged by its competitors some argued that this might persuade consumers to abandon independent gas stations and in the long run reduce overall retail competition as independent gas stations w ere driven out of business14 statutes in divorcement states are mo re correctly characterized as consumer protection measures than antitrust statutes as they 1 may be pl aced in states unfair trade practices provisions or similar location15 2 do not recognize any justification forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22262crs5 16 the statutes do however generally recognize existing refinerrun stations and grandfather them if they existed prior to specific date the simplest of the state divorcement statutes appears to be delawares which states manufacturer of petroleum products shall open major brand secondary brand or unbranded retail ga soline outlet or service station in the state that would be operated by company personnel subsidiary company or commissioned agent that statute also recognizes the possibility that it may be necessary or desirable for manufacturers to operate retail service stations in times of emergency or similar special circumstances 6 c 2905ab virginia and puerto rico so make provision for temporary refiner operation of retail service stations

gasoline prices those increases were not passed on by retailers to gasoline consumersexceptions16 and 3 unlike the federal antitrust monopolization prohibition are fault provisions that require competitive injury as prerequisite to violation the ftc report supra note 5 sets out both the potential competitive advantages and the possible misuses of vertical integration but also notes that at least nine studies have concluded that retail gasoline prices tend to be lower if one company owns both refining and retailing operations than if they are owned separately17 at the same time the report acknowledges studies that have come to different conclusion one study found on the basis of its examination of th longterm lease of several independent stations by branded refinerwholesaler with an accompanying name change on the stations from the independent to the brand na that retail gasoline prices in the area where the leasingname change occurred did rise slightly18 another found increased wholesale prices following the merger between refiner and refinermarketer19 that study did not however as did subsequent one look at the effect on retail gasoline prices to consumers of mergers20 just as existing state divor cement statutes are generally not found in the states antimonopoly or antitrust provisions state pri cegouging provisions too are generally considered to be
