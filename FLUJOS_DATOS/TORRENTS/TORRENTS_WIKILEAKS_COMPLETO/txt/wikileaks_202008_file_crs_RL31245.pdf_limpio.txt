such information is detrimental to the national security if an inventor files patent application for an invention the commissioner of patents believes should not be made public the commissioner may place secrecy order on the patent and may establish conditions for granting patent or may withhold grant of patent as long as the national interest requires it54 in addition to criminal penalties cited previously in the case of an unauthorized disclosure or foreign filing of the patent information the patent office will deem the invention to be abandoned which means forfeiture by the applicant his successors or assigns of all claims against the united states based on the invention55 the government has had less success trying to enjoin the media from disclosing classified information most famously the government failed to enjoin publication of the pentagon papers by newspaper even though the information was clearly classified and had been stolen by someone with access to it56 in that case the supreme court set very high standards for imposing prior restraint on the press yet in another case the government was able to enjoin newspaper from printing information about the design of

information for example can be restricted regardless of source59 information related to the national defense is protected even though harm to the national security is intended or is likely to be caused through its disclosure however nonmilitary information with the potential to cause serious damage to the national security is only protected from willful disclosure with the specific intent to harm the national interest60 or with the knowledge that such harm could occur61 the new provision would have penalized the disclosure of any material designated as classified for any reason related to national security regardless of whether the violator intended that the information be delivered to and used by foreign agents it would be the first law to penalize disclosure of information to nonforeign entities solely because it is classified without more specific definition of the type of information covered62 constitutional issues the first amendment to the us constitution provides congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press despite this absolute language the supreme court has held that the government may regulate the content of constitutionally protected speech in order to promote compelling interest if it chooses the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest63 the constitutionality of section 304 therefore if enacted and challenged in court will depend upon whether the government can demonstrate that the statute promotes compelling interest and does so by the least restrictive means

national security from external threat is without doubt compelling government interest64 particularly during time of war or heightened risk of hostilities it has long been accepted that the government has compelling need to suppress certain types of speech65 speech likely to incite immediate violence for example may be suppressed66 speech that would give military advantage to foreign enemy is also susceptible to government regulation67 where first amendment rights are implicated it is the governments burden to show that its interest is sufficiently compelling to justify enforcement whether the government has compelling need to punish disclosures of classified information turns on whether the disclosure has the potential of causing damage to the national defense or foreign relations of the united states68 actual damage need not be proved but potential damage must be more than merely speculative and incidental69 promotion of that interest in addition to showing that the stated interest to be served by the statute is compelling the government must also show that the law actually serves that end if the accused can show that the statute serves an unrelated purpose for example to silence criticism of certain government policies or to manipulate public opinion judge might be prepared to invalidate the statute70 challenge could be brought against section 304 charging that under

certain speech such challenge might evolve in case of alleged selected release of information on the part of the government related to sensitive government programs if the government releases some positive results of secret weapons program while suppressing negative results for example person prosecuted for releasing negative information could challenge the statute by arguing that his prosecution is related to the negative content of his speech rather than to valid concerns about the damage it might cause if he can show that those who disclose sensitive information that tends to support the administrations position are not prosecuted while those who disclose truthful information that is useful to its opponents are prosecuted he might be able to persuade court that the statute as enforced is an unconstitutional restriction of speech based on impermissible contentrelated interests71 another argument along these lines would note that statute that prohibits disclosure of classified information but fails to prohibit the disclosure of sensitive but unclassified information leaves significant vulnerabilities calling into question the relationship between the laws means and ends also defendant might argue that the statute is underinclusive because the conduct is only punishable if perpetrated by someone with authorized access to the classified information arguably if the disclosure of the information is damaging it would be irrelevant how or by whom it was disclosed72 lastly person challenging the statute could argue that the statute does not sufficiently address circumstances in which the potential damage to the national security is outweighed by other considerations least restrictive means to survive constitutional challenge the law must be narrowly drawn to affect only the type of speech that the government has compelling need to suppress73 if the statute reaches speech that the government has sufficiently compelling need to regulate the statute will be subject to attack due to overbreadth law is overly broad if it prohibits more speech than is necessary to achieve its purpose if defendant can show that statute regulating speech is substantially overbroad he may challenge its validity on its face74 if the law is found to be substantially overbroad court will invalidate the law even if the defendants conduct falls within the ambit of conduct the government may legitimately prohibit for this reason the statute might be contested as overbroad by virtue of its reliance on the executives classification scheme if challenger were able to show

authority is able to identify or describe 2 secret shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security

discharge the governments burden hr rep 106969 at 44 2000information that it is unnecessary to keep secret he could argue that the statute is invalid as overly broad because it punishes protected speech that poses danger to the national security although information properly classified in accordance with statute or executive order carries by definition if disclosed to person not authorized to receive it the potential of causing at least identifiable harm to the national security of the united states75 it does not necessarily follow that government classification by itself will be dispositive of the issue in the context of criminal trial in other words courts may interpret the language of the proposed statute to impose on the government the burden of showing that the disclosure at issue has or had at the time of its unauthorized release the potential of harming national security76 government classification will likely serve as strong evidence to support the contention but it is unlikely the accused will be foreclosed entirely from bringing first amendment challenge to the governments assertion that potential damage to the national security is likely information may be properly classified in the technical sense that is the appropriate authority determined it met specific criteria for classification of material that could cause the requisite level of damage to the united states if it falls into the wrong hands and yet for other reasons that information could be judged to pose realistic threat for example defendant could argue that the information she is charged with releasing is already widely available in public sources and therefore has already caused any damage it was capable of causing or she may argue that the information was properly classified at the time of its creation but is now so old that foreign entity could possibly benefit from learning about it defendant might even argue that limited release unlikely to cause direct and imminent injury to the united states was necessary to avert greater harm to life and limb of innocent persons httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31245crs20 77see eg haig v agee 453 us 280 291 1981 matters intimately related to

propriety of the classification is irrelevant the fact of classification of document or documents is enough to satisfy the classification element of the offense 82see united states v dedeyan 594 f2d 36 39 4th cir 1978 83444 us 507 1980therefore one issue that is almost certain to arise if this statute is enacted is the extent to which the judiciary should defer to the judgment of the executive in determining whether an unauthorized disclosure of classified informa tion has the potential to cause harm to the national security typically courts have been unwilling to review decisions of the executive related to national security or have made strong presumption that the material at issue is potentially damaging77 in the context of criminal trial especially in case with apparent first amendment implications courts may be more willing to engage in an evaluation of the propriety of classification decision than they would in case of citizens seeking access to information under the freedom of information act foia78 the supreme court seems satisfied that national security is vital interest sufficient to justify some intrusion into activities that would otherwise be protected by the first amendment at least with respect to federal employees although the court has not held that government classification of material is sufficient to show that its release is damaging to the national security79 it has seemed to accept without much discussion the governments assertion that the material in question is damaging lower courts have interpreted 18 usc 798 which criminalizes the unauthorized release of specific kinds of classified information80 to have requirement that the government prove that the classification was proper or personally approved by the president81 it is unlikely that defendants bare assertion that information is unlikely to damage us national security will be persuasive without some convincing evidence to that effect or proof that the informati on is not closely guarded by the government82 snepp v united states83 affirmed the governments ability to enforce contractual nondisclosure agreements against employees and former employees who had had

classified documents to the media morison argued that the espionage statutes did not apply to his conduct because he could not have had the requisite intent to commit espionage the fourth circuit rejected his appeal finding the intent to sell photographs that he clearly knew to be classified sufficient to satisfy the scienter requirement under 18 usc 793 the definition of relating to the

classified study of the us involvement in vietnam majority of the justices indicated in dicta however that the newspapers as well as the former government employee who leaked the documents to the press could be prosecuted under the espionage act93 if strictly construed to mean that the government in order to prove its compelling need to suppress disclosure of classified information need only show that the proper procedures were followed in applying the classification the proposed legislation would raise concerns of overbreadth under the first amendment however for precisely this reason it may not be so strictly construed94 due process statute is unconstitutionally vague if it does not permit the ordinary person to determine with reasonable certainty whether his conduct is criminally punishable therefore statute prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of classified information must be sufficiently clear to allow reasonable person to know what conduct is prohibited where first amendment rights are implicated the concern that vague statute will have chilling effect on speech not intended to be covered may make that law particularly vulnerable to judicial invalidation95 the espionage act of 1917 has been challenged for vagueness without success there have been very few prosecutions for disclosing information related to the national defense the following elements are necessary to prove an unauthorized disclosure offense under 18 usc 793 1the information or material disclosed must be related to the national defense that is pertaining to any matters directly and reasonably connected with the defense of our nation against its enemies that would be potentially damaging to the united states or might be useful to an enemy of the united states and are closely held

certain information to foreign entity have survived challenges for vagueness but only because jury instructions properly established the elements of the crimes including the scienter requirement and definition of national defense that includes potential damage in case of unauthorized release the supreme court case relied upon for these standards is gorin v united states 101 which interpreted the predecessor statutes to 793 and 794 gorin was classic case of espionage and there was challenge based on first amendment rights the court agreed with the government that the term national defense was not vague it was satisfied that it is generic concept of broad connotations referring to the military and naval establishments and the related activities of national preparedness102 whether information was related to the national defense was question for the jury to decide103 based on its determination that the information may relate or pertain to the usefulness efficiency or availability of any of the above places instrumentalities or things for the defense of the united states of america the connection must not be strained one nor an arbitrary one the relationship must be reasonable and direct104 as long as the jury was properly instructed that information not likely to cause damage was not related to the national defense for the purpose of the statute the term was

classified under the section is ambiguous as it includes the words it is intended to define it applies to information classified pursuant to statutes and executive orders as requiring protection from unauthorized dissemination for reasons of national security clearly it applies to the national security designations under executive order 12958105 it probably applies to restricted data under title 42 the disseminatio n of which is already punishable it could be construed to apply to the unclassified information that is protected under 42 usc 216768 because such information may be regulated to prohibit unauthorized dissemination if the secretary of energy determines such dissemination could reasonably be expected to result in significant adverse effect on the common defense and security 106 section 304 also appears to apply to classified information that is not owned or controlled by the government and does not appear to make an exception for information that was properly classified but has since been declassified or should be declassified according to agency rules classified information includes information or material properly classified and clearly marked or represented or that the person knows or has reason to believe has been properly classified by appropriate authorities pursuan t to the provisions of statute or executive order as requiring protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national security whether government employee has reason to believe certain material has been properly classified may under some circumstances be difficult to establish government officials sometimes may be required to guess whether piece of information falls under an agencys classificat ion guidelines for instance if it appears in some context without proper classification markings classification guideline s are to some extent discretionary so that not all information meeting the criteria for classification will in fact be classified information that is classified in one document should be marked as classified in every document in which it appears but references to classified information may not always be properly marked or might be presented in such way that gives rise to questions about whether it should be classified in its new form documents that contain secrets may also contain unclassified information secret information may be spoken and thus carry clear classification markings to give notice to the recipient information may require classification under one agencys guidelines but remain unprotected under the guidelines of another agency these factors arguably present vagueness issues because of the danger of chilling protected speech about unclassified matter some critics contend that employees who are unsure whether information is or should be classified may keep silent rather than risk disclosing any fact they could be deemed to have had reason to believe is or has been properly classified

broad as to invite claims of vagueness107 however review of pertinent case law reveals that courts do not seem to have been overly troubled by the breadth or ambiguity of the term108 the fact that the proposed law applies only to government employees or other persons with access to classified information may help to immunize it from claims of vagueness since presumably those with access to classified information have greater understanding of the applicable classification rules109 and have agreed to abide by them110 it should probably be remembered that challenges to the statute as enforced even if successful are unlikely to render the statute unconstitutional on its face if statute can be interpreted in such way as to avoid unconstitutional results courts will interpret it that way111 government employees who clearly understand the damaging potential of information and leak it anyway will not likely succeed in an attempt to get the law declared unconstitutional based on the possible chilling effect the statute may have on hypothetical violators however due process will require that any defendant faced with criminal penalty be allowed to present credible evidence that the law is vague or that the government does not have compelling need to suppress the speech that forms the basis for the charge against him separation of powers some concern has been raised in the media with respect to the proposed legislation ie that allowing the executive branch to in effect both promulgate and enforce criminal statutes amounts to violation of the constitutional scheme for making laws because the proposed statute ratifies and enforces the executive order governing classified information without providing standards to guide the classification process it may be argued by some that the congress is delegating its lawmaking authority entirely to the executive branch it is urged that particularly where statute imposes criminal penalty on violators strong system of checks and balances is vital to ensuring fundamental liberties there is little precedent to support invalidating the proposed legislation on the basis of an alleged violation of separation of powers the

agencies may carry out functions that are executive law enforcement legislative rulemaking or judicial adjudicatory in nature 113see touby v united states 500 us 160 1990 citing lichter v united

system would be stronger if each of the branches had role in countermanding or approving the actions of the other two in practice the executive and judicial branches have each been permitted to exercise powers that are seemingly legislative in nature provided such powers are delegated by congress112 congress may delegate broad responsibilities to the president so long as it lays down an intelligible principle to guide the rulemaking authority113 opponents of the proposed legislation may argue that the statute does not contain an intelligible principle because it relies on principles established by executive order that could change without congressional influence however the supreme court has long approved delegations accompanied by very general legislative guidance114 that information must be properly classified pursuant to the provisions of statute or executive order as requiring protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national security arguably serves as sufficient guidance for delegation purposes the executive branch has long been recognized as holding especially strong sway in the realm of foreign affairs and national defense the courts have accepted that the president has the power to classify information vital to national security as part of his powers as commanderinchief115 the court has honored congress desire to give deference to the executive in matters of classification116 in light of this power and evidence that congress has approved of its use and supplemented it through various statutes it is highly unlikely that challenge based on separation of powers claim would succeed
