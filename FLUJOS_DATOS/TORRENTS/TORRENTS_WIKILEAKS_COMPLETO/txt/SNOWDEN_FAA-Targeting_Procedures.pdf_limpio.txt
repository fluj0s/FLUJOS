believed to be located outside the united states foreigrmess determination ii the posttargeting analysis done by nsa to ensure that the targeting of such person does not intentionally target person lmown at the time of acquisition to be located in the united states and does not result in the intentional acquisition of any communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of acquisition to be located in the united states iii the documentation ofnsas foreignness detennination iv compliance and oversight and v depmiures from these procedures i u determination of whether the acquisition targets non united states persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states s nsa detennines whether person is nonunited states person reasonably believed to be outside the united states in light of the totality of the circumstances based on the infonnation available with respect to that person including information conceming the conmmnications facility or facilities used by that person s nsa analysts examine the following three categories of information as appropriate under the circumstances to make the above determination 1 they examine the lead information they have received regarding the potential target or the facility that has generated interest in conducting surveillance to deteni1ine what that lead infmmation discloses about the persons location 2 they conduct research in nsa databases available reports and collateral infonnation ie infonnation to which nsa has access but did not originate such as reports from other agencies and publicly available information to determine whether nsa knows the location of the person or knows infmmation that would provide evidence conceming that location and 3 they conduct technical analyses of the facility or facilities to determine or verify information about the persons location nsa may use information from any one or combination of these categories of information in evaluating the totality of the circumstances to detem1ine that the potential target is located outside the united states tssi in addition in those cases where nsa seeks to acquire conununications about the target that are not to or from the target nsa will either employ an internet protocol filter to ensure that the person fiom whom it seeks to obtain foreign intelligence infom1ation is located derived from nsacssm 152 dated 20070108 declassify on 20320108 top secretcomintnoliorn20320108 top secretcomintnoforn20320108 overseas or it will target internet links that terminate in foreign country in either event nsa will direct surveillance at party to the communication reasonably believed to be outside the united states s lead information s vhen nsa proposes to direct surveillance at target it does so because nsa has already leamed something about the target or the facility or facilities the target uses to communicate accordingly nsa will examine the lead information to detennine what it reveals about the physical location of the target including the location of the facility or facilities being used by the potential target s the following are examples of the types of lead information that nsa may examine has the target stated that he is located outside the united states for example has nsa or another intemgence agency collected statement or statements made by the target indicating that he is located outside the united states b has human intelligence source or other source of lead infom1ation indicated that the target is located outside the united states c does the lead information provided by an intelligence or law enforcement agency of the united states govemment or an intelligence or law enforcement service of foreign government indicate that the target is located outside the united states d was the lead inforn1ation about the target found on hard drive or other medium that was seized in foreign country viith whom has the target had direct contact and what do we know about the location of such persons for example if lead infom1ation indicates the target is in direct contact with several members of foreignbased teltorist organization or foreign based political organization who themselves are located overseas that may suggest depending on the totality of the circumstances that the target is also located overseas s information nsa has about the targets location andor facility or facilities used by the target s nsa may also review information in its databases including repositories of information collected by nsa and by other intelligence agencies as well as publicly available information to detem1ine if the persons location or information providing evidence about the persons location is already known the nsa databases that would be used for this pmpose contain infonnation culled from signals intelligence human intelligence law enforcement infonnation and other sources for example nsa databases may include report produced by the central intelligence agency cia with the fact that known terrorist is using telephone with particular number or detailed information on worldwide telephony numbering plans for wire and wireless telephone systems top secretc011intnoforn20320108 2 top secretcomintnoforn20320108 s nsa technical analysis of the facility s nsa may also apply technical analysis concerning the facility from which it intends to acquire foreign intelligence infonnation to assist it i11 maldng determinations conceming the location of the person at whom nsa intends to direct surveillance for example nsa may examine the following types of information s for telephone numbers identify the country code of the telephone number and detennine what it indicates about the persons location b review conm1ercially available and nsa telephone numbering databases for indications of the type of telephone being used eg landline wireless mobile satellite etc information that may provide an understanding of the location of the target s for electronic conm1unications accountsaddressesidentifiers review nsa content repositories and intemet communications data repositories which contain among other things intemet communications metadata for previous internet activity this infonnation may contain network layer eg lntemet protocol addresses or machine identifier eg media access control addresses infotmation which nsa compares to information contained in nsas communication netvrork databases and connnercially available intemet protocol address registration infonnation in order to determine the location of the target s assessment ofthc nonunited states person status ofthe target s in many cases the infonnation that nsa examines in order to determine whether target is reasonably believed to be located outside the united states may also bear upon the nonunited states person status of that target for example lead infonnation provided by an intelligence or law enforcement service of foreign govemment may indicate not only that the target is located in foreign country but that the target is citizen of that or another foreign country similarly information contained in nsa databases including reposito1ies of info1111ation collected by nsa and by other intelligence agencies may indicate that the target is nonunited states person s furthermore in order to prevent the inadvertent targeting of united states person nsa maintains records of telephone numbers and electronic communications accountsaddresses identifiers that nsa has reason to believe are being used by united states persons prior to targeting particular telephone number or electronic conununications accountaddressidentifier will be compared against those records in order to ascertain whether nsa has reason to believe that telephone number or electronic conmmnications accountaddressidentifier is being used by united states person top secretcomintnoforn20320108 3 top secretcomintnoforn20320108 s in the absence of specific information regarding whether target is united states person person reasonably believed to be located outside the united states or whose location is not known will be presumed to be nonunited states person unless such person can be positively identified as united states person or the nature or circumstances of the persons communications give rise to reasonable belief that such person is united states person s assessment of the foreign intelligence purpose of the targeting s in assessing whether the target possesses andor is likely to conmmnicate foreign intelligence information conceming foreign power or foreign territory nsa considers among other things the following factors with respect to telephone communications infonnation indicates that the telephone number has been used to communicate directly with another telephone number reasonably believed by the us intelligence community to be used by an individual associated with foreign power or foreign tenitory infonnation indicates that user of the telephone number has conm1unicated directly with an individual reasonably believed by the us h1telligence conmmnity to be associated with foreign power or foreign territory h1fom1ation indicates that the telephone number is listed in the telephone directory of telephone used by an individual associated with foreign power or foreign territory information indicates that the telephone number has been transmitted during telephone call or other communication with an individual reasonably believed by the us h1telligence community to be associated with foreign power or foreign territory publicly available sources ofinf01n1ation eg telephone listings match the telephone number to an individual reasonably believed by the us h1telligence community to be associated with foreign power or foreign tenitory h1fonnation contained in vmious nsamaintained lmowledge databases containing foreign intelligence infommtion acquired by any lawful means such as electronic surveillance physical search or the use of pen register and trap or trace device or other infonnation reveals that the telephone number has been reviously used by an individual associated with foreign power or foreign territory or 1 tssinf the nsa knowledge databases that would be used to satisfy this factor contain fused intelligence information conceming international terrorism culled from signals intelligence human intelligence law enforcement information and other sources the information compiled in these databases is inforn1ation that assists the signals intelligence system in effecting collection on intelligence targets for example report produced by the cia may include the fact that known tenorist is using telephone with particular number nsa would include that information in its knowle4ge databases top secretcomintnoforn20320108 4 top secretcomintnoforn20320108 information made available to nsa analysts as result of processing telephony mctadata records acquired by any lawful means such as electronk surveillance physical search or the use of pen register or trap and trace device or other information reveals that the telephone number is used by an individual associated with foreign power or foreign territory b with respect to internet communications information indicates that the electronic communications accountaddressidentifier has been used to communicate directly with an electronic conummications accountaddressidentifier reasonably believed by the us h1telligence community to be used by an individual associated with foreign power or foreign territory infom1ation indicates that user of the electronic communications accountaddress identifier has conmmnicated directly with an individual reasonably believed to be associated with foreign power or foreign territory infonnation indicates that the electronic conmmnications accountaddressidentifier is included in the buddy list or address book of an electronic conununications accountaddressidentifier reasonably believed by the us intelligence conununity to be used by an individual associated with foreign power or foreign tenitmy h1fom1ation indicates that the electronic communications accountaddressidentifier has been transmitted during telephone call or other communication with an individual reasonably believed by the us h1telligence community to be associated with foreign power or foreign tenitory public h1temet postings match the electronic c01mnunications accountaddress identifier to an individual reasonably believed by the us h1telligence community to be associated with foreign power or foreign tenitmy h1formation contained in various nsamaintained knowledge databases of foreign intelligence information acquired by any lawful means such as electronic surveillance physical search the use of pen register or trap and trace device or other information reveals that electronic communications accountaddressidentifier has been previously used by an individual associated with foreign power or foreign territory information made available to nsa analysts as result of processing metadata records acquired by any lawful means such as electronic surveillance physical search or the use of pen register or trap and trace device or other information reveals that the electronic communications accountaddressidentifier is used by an individual associated with foreign power or foreigu tcnitory or h1fom1ation indicates that intemet protocol ranges andor specific electronic identifiers or signatures eg specific types of cryptology or steganography are used almost exclusively by individuals associated with foreign power or foreign territory top secretcomintnoforn20320108 5 top secretcomintnoforn20320108 or are extensively used by individuals associated with foreign power or foreign territory ii s posttargeting analysis by nsa ssi after person has been targeted for acquisition by nsa nsa will conduct post targeting analysis such analysis is designed to detect those occasions when person who when targeted was reasonably believed to be located outside the united states has since entered the united states and wm enable nsa to take steps to prevent the intentional acquisition of any communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of acquisition to be located in the united states or the intentional targeting of person who is inside the united states such analysis may include for telephone numbers routinely comparing telephone numbers tasked pursuant to these procedures against information that has been incidentally collected from the global system for mobiles gsm home location registers hlr these registers receive updates whenever gsm phone moves into new service area analysis of this hlr information provides primary indicator of foreign user of mobile telephone ente1ing the united states nsa analysts may analyze content for indications that foreign target has entered or intends to enter the united states such content analysis will be conducted according to analytic and intelligence requirements and primities for electronic communications accountsaddressesidentifiers routinely checking all electronic communications accountsaddressesidentifiers tasked pursuant to these procedures against available databases that contain internet communications data including metadata to detemrine if an electromc commumcations accountaddressidentifier was accessed fiom overseas such databases contain communications contact information and summaries of communications activity from nsa signals intelligence collection the foreign access determination is made based on comparing the intemet protocol address associated with the account activity to other information nsa possesses about geographical areas serviced by particular intemet protocol addresses if the ip address associated with the target activity is identified as usbased network gateway eg hotmail server or private intemet protocol address then nsa analysts will be required to perfom1 additional research to detennine if the access was in foreign country using additional crite1ia such as machine identifier or case notation nsa circuit identifier of commumcations linlc known to be foreign such databases nonnally maintain information about such activity for 12month peliod this data will be used in an attempt to rule out false positives fiom usbased network gateways if the account access is detem1ined to be from usbased machine further analytic checks will be performed using content collection to detennine if the target has moved into the u1rited states top secretcomintnoforn20320108 6 top secretcomintnoforn20320108 routinely comparing electronic communications accountsaddressesidentifiers tasked pursuant to these procedures against list of electronic connnunications accounts addressesidentifiers already identified by nsa as being accessed from inside the united states tlus will help ensure that target has been recogruzed to be located in the united states nsa analysts may analyze content for indications that target has entered or intends to enter the united states such content analysis will be conducted according to analytic and intelligence requirements and p1imities s ifnsa determines that target has entered the united states it will follow the procedures set fmih in section iv of this document including the tennination of the acquisition from the target without delay in cases where nsa cannot resolve an apparent conflict between infonnation indicating that the target has entered the united states and information indicating that the target remains located outside the united states nsa will presume that the target has entered the united states and will tenninate the acquisition from that target if at later time nsa determines that the target is in fact located outside the united states nsa may reilutiate the acquisition in accordance with these procedures s ifnsa determines that target who at the time of targeting was believed to be nonunited states person was in fact u11ited states person it will follow the procedures set fmih in section iv of this document including the termination of the acquisition from the target without delay iii u documentation s analysts who request tasking will document in the tasking database citation or citations to the infonnation that led them to reasonably believe that targeted person is located outside the united states before tasking is approved the database entry for that tasking will be reviewed in order to verify that the database entry contains the necessary citations s citation is reference that identifies the source of the information such as rep01i number or connnunications intercept identifier which nsa vill maintain the citation will enable those responsible for conducting oversight to locate and review the information that led nsa analysts to conclude that target is reasonably believed to be located outside the united states s analysts also will identify the foreign power or foreign territory about which they expect to obtain foreign intel1igence information pursuant to the proposed targeting iv u oversight and compliance s nsas sigr1als intelligence directorate sid oversight and compliance with nsas office of general counsel ogc will develop and deliver training regarding the applicable procedures to ensure intelligence persom1cl responsible for approving the targeting of persons under these procedures as well as
