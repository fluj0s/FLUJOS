parm knnp mnuc pk subject us removal of pakistan research reactor fuel on hold classified by anne w patterson for reasons 14 b d 1 s xxxxxxxxxxxx told poloff on may 26 that the recent spate of media attention on pakistans nuclear security has led the gop to delay an important nonproliferation effort the removal of usorigin highlyenriched uranium spent fuel from pakistani nuclear research reactor the gop agreed in principle to the fuel removal in 2007 but has been slow in scheduling visit by us technical experts to discuss logistical and other issues in recent months the strategic plans division and ministry of foreign affairs both indicated progress on the matter and proposed visit for late may was under review however according to xxxxxxxxxxxx recent gop interagency review of the program concluded that the sensational international and local media coverage of the security of pakistans nuclear weapons made it impossible to proceed at this time if the local media got word of the fuel removal they certainly would portray it as the united states taking pakistans nuclear weapons he argued the visit will have to be delayed for 34 months or until the political climate makes it more conducive to hosting us visit he stated 2 s comment as noted in previous post reporting the gop is extremely sensitive to media focus on pakistans nuclear program in sign of their growing defensiveness the foreign office spokesman took significant time out of his may 21 press conference to address nuclear security stating categorically there is simply question of our strategic assets falling into the wrong hands to question about reported offers of us help with nuclear security he responded we do not need this assistance with the postponement of the nuclear fuel removal it is clear that the negative media attention has begun to hamper us efforts to improve pakistans nuclear security and nonproliferation practices end comment patterson
