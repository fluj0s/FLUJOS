council junt coordinación política with representative from each of the political parties to coor dinate policies differences from us congress mexicos congress is strikingly different from the us congress in several regards 1 shared leadership in the mexican congress leadership is shared among the parties with chairmanships accorded to all parties roughly proportiona to the share of seats in the chamber and with major parties participating in the directive table 2 reelection growing out of the mexican revolutions slogan effective suffrage re election representatives in the mexican congress may not be immediately reelected although they may run for office in the other chamber or run again after an intervening term critics argue that this reelection provision undermines the principle of accountab ility and the development of expertise in subject matter others see the principle of reelection as hardwon victory and are reluctant to change the system 3 division of committ ee chairmanships between chambers under political accord in the mexican congress the parties have agreed that the same party may not control the chairmanship of the same commission or committee in both chambers taken together these mechanisms create series of checks and balances and enhance the requirements for consensusbu ilding to enact legislation results of the july 2000 election mexicos 58th legislature 20002003 is the product of the ju ly 2000 ections which ended the 71year control of the presidency by the institutional revolutionary party pri and continued th trend toward dispersion of power in the two chambers of the congress in the period leading up to the election several major election reforms were adopted in the 1990s that established an independent and wide ly respected federal electoral institute ife provided for the direct election of the mayor of the mexico city federal district guaranteed equal access to the media and placed controls on campaign spending in the july 1997 congressional ections while the pri remained the single largest party it lost its longheld majority in the chamber of deputies it lost the twothirds majority in the senate and it lost the allimportant race for mayor of mexico city in the july 2000 electi ons these tendencies continued president on july 2 2000 vicente fox of the alliance for change representing the

but not the largest delegation the pri with 3674 of the vot has 60 senators the largest delegation while the prdalliance for mexico with 1885 of the vote has only 17 senators the pri has the largest delegation because of the intricacies of the senate election process1 results of the july 2003 ch amber of deputies election mexico held nationwide congressional elections on july 6 2003 although only the chamber of deputies was rene wed electors voted for 500 deputies who serve threeyear terms with 300 deputies elected by plurality in singlemember districts and 200 deputies elected by proportional represen tation in five 40member dist ricts the senate is elected for sixyear terms under complicated form ula and there are staggered terms official results demonstrate that president foxs conservative national action party pan performed rather poorly while the othe r major parties made significant advances public opinion polls and exit polls showed that much of the population was either apathetic or was critical of the fact that the president had failed to deliver his promised economic improvements and fi nal results showed that 58 of the eligible voters abstained from voting higher percentage than the last three presidential elections results reported by the federal electoral institute ife showed that the previous longruling pri captured the lead position in the chamber of deputies race with 3805 of the valid vote including all the votes won by the alliance for all the coalition between the pri and the pvem in eleven states the pri won 160 of the 300 single member districts and it won 64 of the proporti onal representation seats with the result that it increased its delegation in the 500 seat chamber from 208 deputies to 224 deputies 448 of all deputies this gives it very strong position in the chamber since it will be entitled to elect the president of the chambe r it is only 27 votes shy of majority and it is in good position to make alliances with the pvem with which it ran in coalition in 11 states and with the other leftist parties with which it has been associated to somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21561crs4 2 results are from the website of the

victory is generally viewed as strengthening the presidential prospects for pri president roberto madrazo who is credited with holding the party toge ther against various divisive tendencies table 1

single member districts just over half as many as the pri won and it obtained 71 proportional re presentation seats the pan won direct vote seats in 22 states but failed to secure victories in 10 states nearly third of the total the pan will be going into the 2006 presidential race with weak legislative base and with recognition that fox himself did not emerge from the mainstream of the party while much jockeying will occur in the next few years santiago creel foxs minister of the impor tant government ministry and francisco barrios foxs former anticorruption czar nd new leader of the pan delegation in the chamber are often mentioned as possible presidential candidate s in the 2006 contest the prd came in third with 1823 of th valid vote but because it was not in coalition as it was in 2000 its delegation will increase significantly from 54 to 95 19 of all deputies the prd won 55 deputies in single member districts and it won 40 deputies through proportional representation it elected deputies in single member districts in only 8 states and fa iled to win seats in 24 states three fourths of the total as result of the local victory in the strong hold of mexico city see below the popular mayor andrés manuel lópez ob rador is being viewed as an attractive and promising candidate but the national resu lts for the prd suggest the difficulty of moving from local victory to national victory the pvem which was in alliance with the pri in eleven states came in distant fourth with 415 of the valid vote on its own and presumably similar portion of the 1402 won by the alliance for all with the result that its congre ssional delegation will have 17 deputies 34 of ll deputies the same number as it had in the previous legislature the pvem won 3 deputies in si ngle member districts and it won 14 deputies through proportiona l representation the pt came in fifth with 248 of the valid vote giving it delegation of 6 deputies all won through pr oportional

and accordingly failed to gain representation in the new chamber of deputies and failed to maintain their registry as political party in the past many of president foxs pr ograms have been blocked by an opposition dominated congress and many observers wo rry that he could become lame duck president and it could become even more difficult with the strengthened opposition in congress to obtain approval of major legislation including tax and fiscal reform and proposed energy reform that would permit great er private participation in the hydrocarbon and electricity sectors shortly after the announcement of the preliminary results president fox called for cooperation among the parties for the good of the country since the electorate had again chosen to deny majo rity to any party or coalition and since the announcement of the final results he has been meeting with major party leaders results of the july 2003 local elections state and local elections were held on the same date in ten states including the mexico city federal district while some states elected representatives for the state legislatures and local officials governorship s were in contention in the northern states

the statur of andrés manuel lópez obrador the popular chief of government or mayor of mexico city and the presumed prd presidential candidate in 2006 although the prds weak results in the national
