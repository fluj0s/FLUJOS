changes related to new provisions enacted in the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 and which are related to foster care and medicaid section 6036 of pl 109171 generally prohibited state from receiving federal medicaid reimbursement for individuals who do not provide satisfactory documentary evidence of citizenship or nationality section 405c of pl 109432 specifically exempts foster children both title ive eligible and those who are not eligible from the medicaid documentation requirement this change is made effective as if it was included in the deficit reduction act pl 109171 which was enacted in february 2006 pl 109432 also amended title ive to require states to have in effect procedures for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of each child in foster care whether or not the state claims title ive support for the child 12 finally pl 109432 also amended section 1123a of the social security act to specifically require that state compliance with this new federal requirement be checked as part of periodic conformity reviews eg the child and family services review these changes are to be effective as of june 20 2007 6 months after the enactment of pl
