trade issues policy challenges and opportunities facing the 109th congress second session summary the second session of the 109th congress is expected to face an extensive trade agenda consisting of wide range of issues in some respects these issues are distinct each with its own policy and economic implications in other respects the issues are interrelated they have emerged from common sets of domestic political foreign policy and economic factors and affect or are affected by the concerns of members of congress of other policymakers and of many interest groups these issues and how policymakers deal with them will define overall us trade policy during the first session the 109th congress dealt with number of critical trade issues the bush administration requested and received twoyear extension of its trade promotion authority the congress also debated us participation in the world trade organization wto as it considered but did not pass congressional resolution to withdraw from the wto in addition the administration sent and the congress passed legislation to implement free trade agreement with five central american countries plus the dominican republic the drcafta and passed implementing legislation for free trade agreement with bahrain furthermore the 109th congress repealed two trade programs that had been declared illegal by the wto during the second session the 109th congress may be called on to debate more free trade agreements trade relations with china and tariff preferences for developing countries among other issues the congress might also continue to monitor the doha development agenda negotiations proceeding in the wto each issue or set of trade issues bears its own implications as members of congress weigh the merits and disadvantages in most cases the 109th congress will be considering and debating each issue separately however the trade issues as whole have implications for wider debate on us trade policy as the 109th congress addresses these issues its decisions will have implications for key questions that help define us trade policy in the longterm this report will generally cover the trade issues as they unfold however it will not track legislation per the report will be updated as events warrant contents placing trade issues in context 2 economic factors 2 political factors 4 trade issues 6 trade promotion authority tpa 6

congress second session policy challenges and opportunities the 109th congress during its first session acted on several major trade issues the congress passed implementing legislation for the highly controversial dominican republiccentral america free trade agreement cafta and implementing legislation for the us bahrain fta both of which president bush signed into law it passed legislation to comport with two world trade organization rulings repeal the socalled byrd amendment that redistributed revenues from antidumping and countervailing duty orders to eligible domestic companies and eliminate the us cotton subsidies program the congress acceded to president bushs request that his trade promotion authority tpa be extended to july 1 2007 and the congress did not pass resolution that would call for the withdrawal of the united states from the world trade organization wto thus agreeing to us participation at least for another five years other congressional actions during the first session may help shape the trade agenda during the second session for example the senate passed legislation to grant ukraine permanent normal trade relations pntr status and the senate also passed legislation amending customs regulations in order to suspend new shipper bonding privileges for three years the house passed the united states trade rights enforcement act that would among other things allow us producers to bring countervailing duty cvd actions against nonmarket economies such as china the second session of the 109th congress is expected to face range of other trade issues some which may require consideration of legislation others involve congressional oversight responsibilities these matters include bills to implement new ftas and oversight of the round of negotiations in the wto in some respects these issues are distinct each with its own policy and economic implications but they are also interrelated they have emerged from common sets of domestic political and economic factors and are driven by the concerns of members of congress of other policymakers and of many interest groups these issues and how policymakers deal with them all help to define us trade policy crs2 this report discusses the spectrum of trade issues that the 109th congress will likely confront in the second session and analyzes how these issues are interrelated it discusses the political economic and other factors that help to determine how trade policy is debated and implemented this report will generally follow the trade issues as they unfold and will be updated accordingly however it will not track legislation per readers are advised to refer to other crs products cited throughout the report for more information on the specific issues and related legislation placing trade issues in context number of economic factors influence us trade policy domestic economic conditions growing trade deficits the impact of trade exports and imports on various states regions and industries the importance of trade to the us economy and the geographical distribution of us exports and imports among other factors it is also influenced by political factors such as the role and concerns of congress in trade policy the role and agenda of the president and the different perspectives that the two branches bring to the trade debate and foreign policy considerations these factors influence the climate in which the issues emerge and are debated by the congress economic factors domestic economic conditions can influence the trade policy agenda poor economic growth or recession that is coupled with escalating unemployment often causes policymakers to direct their attention to trade for example the structural adjustments that the steel industry had been experiencing led to presidential measures to restrict steel imports in 20021 rapidly growing us trade deficits also generate interest in foreign trade and reassessments of trade policies economists assert that trade deficits are themselves not the results of trade policy but are the products of broader economic conditions nevertheless large trade deficits have caused the congress in many cases to give priority to trade on its agenda especially when us trade deficits with one or more trading partners are increasing rapidly large deficits are often perceived as an indication that the trade relationship is unbalanced or unfair table 1 below shows us trade in goods and services from 19962005 1 see crs report rl31748 the american steel industry changing profile by stephen cooney crs3 table 1 us trade in goods and services 19962005 billions of dollars us us us us us us year year exports imports balances exports imports balances 1996 8509 9537 1029 2001 10067 13693 3627 1997

bureau of the census in 2005 the us trade deficit in goods and services hit record 7258 billion 175 increase over the previous record of 6176 billion in 2004 during the 10 year 19962005 period the us trade deficit increased over 600 from 1029 billion to 7258 billion most economists attribute the deficits especially the broader current account deficits to macroeconomic factors including relative real economic growth rates of the united states and its major trading partners real exchange rates and savings and investment balances in the united states and other countries2 trade policy and trade policy tools have little effect on trade balances especially in the long run however they affect the composition of trade but trade deficits by definition translate into more us firms and workers being hit by import competition thereby increasing the pressure for protection related to us trade deficits is the value of the us dollar in terms of other major currencies over time the us dollar has fluctuated in value recently the dollar has been appreciating against major currencies despite recordbreaking us current account deficits3 stronger dollar makes us domestic goods more expensive compared to imports exacerbating us trade imbalances while consumers benefit from lower import prices importsensitive manufacturers must make adjustments to match the competition these adjustments might include using laborsaving technology andor moving some production offshore and may lead to protectionist trade policy actions along with the growing us trade deficits and the value of the us dollar the increasing importance of foreign trade in the us economy plays role in setting the congressional trade agenda it creates more winners and losers from trade thus increasing the potential salience of the trade issues in 1960 the ratio of exports plus imports of goods and services to us gross domestic product gdp measure 2 see crs report rl31032 the us trade deficit causes consequences and cures by craig k elwell 3 st louis federal reserve bank international economic trends february 2006 p 1 crs4 of openness was 95 by 2005 the ratio increased to 2664 as the united states has become more integrated with the rest of the world economy larger range of economic activities is affected by trade and raises policy issues for example advances in telecommunications technology now allow some services to be imported or outsourced from india and other countries creating competition for some us domestic providers however these same advances also lower costs to consumers of those services the geographical distribution of us trade has shifted in particular the role of advanced developed countries has declined while the role of less developed countries has expanded in 1990 639 of us exports went to the industrialized countries while 351 went to developing countries by 2005 the share of us exports accounted for by developing countries had increased to 470 similarly in 1990 588 of us imports came from industrialized countries and 409 from developing countries in 2005 549 of us imports came from developing countries5 the rise of the newly industrializing economies of east asia hong kong singapore south korea taiwan and the emergence of mexico as significant us trading partner account for part of this surge however much of the increase in developing countries share of us trade derives from china between 19902005 chinas share of us imports grew from 31 to 146 and its share of us exports rose from 12 to 47 shifts in trade patterns have coincided with rising concerns about the ability of us workers to compete with countries with low wages and the impact of globalization on us employment wages and living standards the relative share of the united states in world trade has declined over the years us exports accounted for 157 of world exports in 1960 when japan and europe were still recovering from the devastation of world war ii and 90 in 2004 the decline can be attributed to among other things the emergence in the international trading system china and other developing countries as they have opened up their economies to the rest of the world it can also be attributed to the emergence market economies in the former communist states in central and eastern europe and the former soviet union6 political factors congressional concerns and responsibilities in us trade and trade policy are extensive the constitution assigns trade responsibility to the congress article i section 8 states in part that the congress shall have the authority to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises and regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states for most of us history this responsibility largely meant setting tariffs on imports into the united states 4 crs calculations based on data in office of the president council of economic advisers economic report of the president 2005 february 2006 p 280281 5 calculations based on data collected by us department of commerce bureau of the census 6 crs calculations based on data in imf direction of trade statistics various issues crs5 with the enactment of the reciprocal trade agreements act rtaa of 1934 the congress delegated for limited periods of time the authority to the president to negotiate trade agreements to reduce tariffs reciprocally it also delegated to the president the authority to reduce tariffs by proclamation within certain parameters the rtaa was congressional and executive branch reaction to the growing political burden on the congress from tariff administration to the political reality that it was easier for congress to raise tariffs than lower tariffs given the political imperative of constituent interests and to the largely adverse economic results of the smoothawley tariff act of 19307 over time trade negotiations have become more complex as trade negotiations have moved beyond tariffs to nontariff trade barriers investment labor environment and other issues they have moved from the bilateral frameworks under the original rtaa to the multilateral negotiations under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and its successor organization the world trade organization wto in 1974 the trade negotiating authority was granted in the form of expedited or fasttrack congressional consideration limited debate and amendments of implementing legislation for proposed agreements while delegating negotiating authority to the president the congress maintains much control over trade policy it does so by placing time limits on the authority thus requiring the president to return to congress to request its renewal the congress establishes negotiating objectives that must be adhered to in any agreement eligible to receive expedited fasttrack treatment the congress requires that the executive branch notify the congress when it intends to enter trade agreement negotiations and when it intends to sign trade agreements it also requires the executive branch to consult the congress during the negotiations the congress most recently granted the authority in 2002 initially until july 1 2005 but was extended until july 1 2007 as provided by law upon the presidents request and after the congress did not pass resolution disapproving the request an overall concern of members of congress is that the president remains mindful of congresss constitutional authority over trade in addition members want to make sure the administration consults the congress as its pursues negotiations in the bilateral and multilateral fora and conducts other aspects of us trade policy members are also concerned that us trade policy not unduly harm their constituents some want to make sure that the united states will preserve its ability to protect us industries from dumped imports and other unfair foreign trade practices and that foreign countries allow us exports to compete fairly members also want to ensure the united states holds its trade partners accountable for adhering to trade agreement obligations each presidential administration conducts trade policy based on its own priorities and strategy during the bush administrations first term the united states pursued an activist trade agenda it took the lead with the european union eu and other trade powers in launching new round of multilateral negotiations 7 for more discussion see destler im american trade politics system under stress institute for international economics and the twentieth century fund 1986 p 936 crs6 in the wto pursued negotiations with individual countries and groups of trade partners to establish bilateral and regional free trade agreements ftas and used other initiatives to forge closer economic ties that could lead to free trade agreements the bush administrations priorities in its second term appear to include completing fta negotiations launching negotiations with other trading partners completing of doha development agenda dda round of negotiations in the wto and ensuring us trade partners compliance with their obligations under bilateral and multilateral agreements in order for us trade policy to be implemented successfully the legislative and executive branches must work in tandem as with many policy issues conflicts on trade matters may arise between some members of congress and the administration because of positions taken by their respective political parties however the congress and the president bring different institutional perspectives that can place the two branches in conflict over trade matters regardless of their party affiliation in general members of congress are most concerned for the interests of their respective constituencies workers firms agriculture and industries and the impact of trade on them the president as national leader must weigh the positions of various groups against other national objectives such as national security and foreign policy concerns and broad economic gains in making trade policy trade issues the 109th congess has already faced some trade issues and will likely confront more requiring consideration and debate during the second session how congress addresses these issues could have longterm implications for us trade policy trade promotion authority tpa the presidents trade promotion authority tpa that is the authority to negotiate trade agreements that receive expedited set deadlines limited debate and amendments congressional consideration will expire on july 1 2007 the expiration date has become virtual deadline for us negotiations on multilateral regional and bilateral trade agreements that require congressional approval the deadline constrains the presidential and congressional trade agendas especially regarding trade negotiations the tpa statute stipulates that agreements entered into by july 1 2007 would be eligible for expedited congressional consideration if all other conditions under the authority are met however the statute also requires that the president notify the congress of his intention of entering into signing an agreement at least 90 calendar days prior to doing so therefore any us agreement would have to be concluded by april 2 2007 in order to meet the tpa criteria while the congress could choose to renew the authority briefly as was done in 1993 to cover the completion of the uruguay round agreements it is by means certain that the 110th congress would choose to do so also congressional debate on the issue would likely be divisive if the debate over the original extension of tpa in 2002 is an indicator crs7 the world trade organization since its founding in 1995 the wto has embodied the international trade system it provides the basic set of principles and rules by which its 149 members conduct trade among themselves and also provides mechanism for those members to settle disputes over adherence to the rules the wto is evolving the membership is now negotiating expansion and revision of its rules in the doha development agenda dda round and countries are negotiating their entry into the wto as new members for some members of congress and for some interest groups the wto is controversial they view the organizations rules as impinging on us sovereignty especially when wto trading partners are able to challenge us trade remedy laws for being contrary to wto rules and principles on the other hand others assert that the wto provides stability and predictability to the international trading system by ensuring that member countries trade regimes meet basic standards and by providing forum to encourage other countries to remove trade barriers during its first session the 109th congress had the opportunity to weigh in on the issue of us participation in the wto as it does every five years under us law the congress did not pass resolution that would have called for the withdrawal of the united states from the world trade organization wto thus agreeing to us participation at least for another five years8 the doha development agenda negotiations in november 2001 the united states and the other members of the wto launched what has become known as the doha development agenda dda round of negotiations the failure early on to reach agreement on some basic ground rules such as the modalities for negotiations on agriculture made the end of 2005 deadline unachievable the negotiations have continued with an emphasis on agriculture nonagriculture market access nama and services trade ministers from the 149 members met in december 2005 in hong kong for the biannual ministerial meeting and recommitted their countries to completing the round of negotiations by the end of 2006 keeping in mind the april 2007 deadline on trade promotion authority tpa within which the bush administration is operating9 although the congress has direct involvement in the negotiations legislation establishing the trade promotion authority tpa requires the executive branch to consult continually with the congress during trade negotiations the congress could also conduct oversight hearings on the progress of the negotiations the dda covers broad range of issues that have been of particular interest to members including agricultural subsidies and market access trade remedy laws such as antidumping laws and intellectual property rights protection 8 for more information see crs report rl32700 seeking withdrawal of the congressional approval of the wto agreement background legislative proposals and practical consequences 9 for more information on the dda negotiations see crs report rl32060 world trade organization negotiations the doha development agenda by ian fergusson crs8 if and when agreements are completed in the wto implementing legislation would have to be submitted to the congress and would be subject to congressional approval under the trade promotion authority the congress would consider the implementing legislation for the agreements on an expedited basis us compliance with wto decisions the wto has ruled against the united states in several cases brought to the dispute settlement body dsb against us trade actions most of which involve us trade remedy laws in some cases the wto has determined that us implementation of its trade remedy laws does not comply with wto rules in some cases compliance requires just change in administrative regulation or practice in some other cases the determination was that the us law itself violated us wto obligations and requires an act of congress for the united states to come into compliance compliance with wto rulings has generated debate especially when the program in question has broad congressional support on the one hand the program may benefit critical constituencies and be politically popular on the other hand failure to comply subjects the us to possible wtoauthorized sanctions and might encourage noncompliance by trading partners in cases where they lose the 109th congress passed legislation that addressed two outstanding adverse decisions against the united states in the first the congress repealed the socalled byrd amendment the continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdsoa of 2000 title x of pl 106387 the law requires the treasury department to distribute revenues collected from antidumping ad and countervailing duty cvd orders to firms that had been successful petitioners in the ad and cvd cases in 2002 the wto had ruled against the united states in challenge brought by 11 wto members of the 11 the eu canada and japan eventually imposed tariff sanctions authorized by the wto against selected us exports because the united states had failed to repeal the law by an established deadline after much congressional debate provision to repeal the byrd amendment was included in the conference report accompanying s 1932 the deficit reduction act of 2002 it passed the house on december 19 2005 and the senate on december 21 2005 because the house version did not include some language language unrelated to the repeal the house had to vote again on the senate version which it did on february 2 2006 however under the provision the operation of the byrd amendment program continues until september 30 2007 the eu while acknowledging the repeal has raised concerns about the delay of its effect it is not clear whether us trading partners will continue sanctions against us exports10 the same conference report also included the elimination of the us step 2 cotton subsidies programs that the wto had ruled illegal in march 2005 appellate body ruling the ruling came as the result of case filed by brazil it is not clear at this point whether the congressional action addresses all aspects of the wto ruling11 10 for more information see crs report rl33045 the continued subsidy and dumping offset act the byrd amendment by vivian jones 11 for more information see crs report rs22187 us agricultural response to wto decision on cotton decision by randy schnepf crs9 bilateral and regional trade negotiations and agreements following the consideration and approval by 109th congress of two free trade agreements the drcafta and the usbahrain fta during the first session the bush administration will likely ask for consideration of several new bilateral and regional free trade agreements during the second session any fta would be subject to congressional passage of implementing legislation furthermore under the law granting trade promotion authority the executive branch must consult with the congress as trade agreement negotiations proceed members of congress will likely monitor negotiations mindful of the potential economic impact ftas may have on their constituents and the united states as whole the congressional debate on drcafta was highly contentious with differences falling along party lines principally over the degree to which the agreement protects labor rights in the drcafta partner countries the senate passed it 5445 and the house passed the implementing bill 217215 on june 30 and july 28 2005 respectively president bush signed the legislation into law pl 109 53 on august 2 200512 legislation implementing the usbahrain fta was far less contentious and passed easily in the house 32795 on december 7 2005 and in the senate unanimous consent on december 13 2005 president bush signed the bill into law on january 11 2006 pl 109169 the fta with bahrain is part of larger bush administration initiative to create middle east free trade area mefta by 2013 the united states had already concluded an fta with morocco that entered into force on january 1 2006 the united states and oman signed an fta on january 19 2006 and the president is expected to send implementing legislation to congress sometime in 2006 negotiations with the united arab emirates uae continue13 on january 6 2006 president bush announced to congress his intention to sign an fta with peru the negotiations with peru had been part of negotiations with ecuador colombia and bolivia on regional usandean fta but the negotiations with colombia and ecuador have bogged down and bolivias continued participation is in doubt following recent presidential elections14 the united states is conducting fta negotiations with panama thailand and the members of the southern african customs union sacu in addition the united states and south korea announced on february 2 2006 their intention to begin fta negotiations debates over implementing legislation on completed ftas and oversight of negotiations on new ftas in the 109th congress will likely generate critical policy 12 for more information on the drcafta see crs report rl31870 the dominican republiccentral americaunited states free trade agreement caftadr by jf hornbeck 13 for more information on the mefta see crs report rl32638the middle east free trade area progress report by mary jane bolle 14 for more information see crs report rl32770 andeanus free trade agreement by m angeles villarreal crs10 questions for example some members of congress have questioned the criteria that the bush administration uses to choose fta partner countries they have argued that many of the recently completed ftas are with countries with relatively small economies that do not offer significant new commercial opportunities to us exporters and investors the bush administration has countered that these ftas are stepping stones in building regional free trade areas that will offer greater opportunities to the united states while encouraging economic growth and development in those regions the administration also contends that ftas assist the united states in defending its foreign policy and national security interests by strengthening ties with countries that have cooperated with the united states on the war on terrorism and the wars in afghanistan and iraq trade negotiations also raise concerns about the potential impact of pending agreements on the us economy as whole and on specific sectors particularly importsensitive sectors such as some agricultural products and textiles economists have argued that ftas can create new trade boosting economic efficiency positive contribution to the economy but they can also divert trade from more efficient to less efficient producers by giving preferential treatment to the imports of the latter negative contribution to the world economic welfare members of congress must weigh the political and economic gains of achieving increased access to foreign markets in exchange for greater foreign access to us markets trade enforcementtrade organization during the first session and continuing into the second session of the 109th congress members have expressed great concern regarding the lack of compliance by us trading partners with bilateral agreements with the united states and multilateral agreements in the wto while much of this concern derives from trade problems with china they are also fed by longstanding issues with other major trading partners including canada japan and the eu on july 27 2005 the house passed hr 3283 the united states trade rights enforcement act largely chinafocused bill discussed further in the section on uschina economic relations other bills have been introduced that would among other things augment us government trade enforcement responsibilities and capabilities congressional leadership on trade policy in both political parties have indicated that trade enforcement will be priority for the remainder of the 109th congress issues pertaining to us imports the 109th congress will probably confront spate of issues that relate to access of imports to us markets the issues pertain to treatment of imports from current and former communist countries and to tariff preferences the united states grants to certain developing countries permanent normal trade status number of former communist and some nominally communist states remain subject to the socalled jacksonvanik amendment of the trade act of 1974 as amended the amendment requires that the normal trade status ntr also called mostfavored nation mfn status of these countries depends on fulfilling specified freedom of emigration conditions and crs11 therefore must be renewed annually number of countries including russia kazakhstan and ukraine that were part of the former soviet union and other communist states such vietnam are in this situation legislation must be enacted for these countries to attain permanent normal trade status pntr all of these countries have conditional ntr under jacksonvanik tariffs on their exports to the united states are lower than would be the case if they did not have it therefore not having pntr has had immediate practical impact on their trade with the united states however all four countries as well as others are seeking accession to the world trade organization wto under wto rules the united states would have to grant them unconditional mfn or pntr upon their accession if it does not then the united states would have to invoke the wto provision of nonapplicability that is it would declare that the wto rules and other obligations would not apply in its trade relations with the other country therefore the united states would not benefit from their accession to the wto the debate on whether to grant these countries pntr will possibly include political foreign policy as well as foreign trade matters for example issues may arise over russian president putins moves to centralize political power in the kremlin by eliminating direct elections for regional governors and by putting political pressure on the domestic press and over his policies toward chechnya the us business community could raise concerns about the business climate in russia in the wake of the arrest of yukos oil chairman mikhail khodorkovsky and the forced sale of yukos assets concerns might also be raised regarding commitments in ukraine and vietnam towards economic reforms such as protection of intellectual property rights15 tariff preferences the united states grants unilateral trade preferences to groups of developing countries to encourage economic development by extending duty free treatment to their exports of eligible products to the united states the most geographically comprehensive program the generalized system of preferences gsp is due to expire on december 31 200616 the more geographically targeted andean trade preferences act atpa also expires on that date legislation to reauthorize these programs may be introduced during the 109th congress and congress might consider issues regarding the duration of the authorization conditions of country and product eligibility and the impact of these programs on the us economy the 109th congress might also monitor the implementation of other trade preference programs such as the caribbean basin initiative cbi and the african growth and opportunity act agoa that provide more favorable 15 for more information on these issues see crs report rs21123 permanent normal trade relations pntr status for russia and usrussian economic ties and crs issue brief ib98033 the vietnamus normalization process by mark manyin 16 for more information on gsp see crs report 97389generalized system of preferences by william h cooper crs12 preferences to those regions than is the case under gsp17 some members have proposed extending additional trade preferences to other poor developing countries trade remedy laws us trade remedy laws are designed to alleviate the adverse impact on us industries from some imports countervailing duty cvd statutes are used to alleviate the impact of imports that benefit by foreign government subsidies antidumping duty ad laws attempt to counter the effects of imports that are dumped sold at less than fair value the escape clause also called section 201 for the provision of the trade act of 1974 authorizes measures to restrict imports that are sold fairly but at such rapid rates as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to domestic producers of like products there are also us trade remedy laws such as section 301 of the trade act of 1974 designed to address foreign barriers to us exports and provisions to deal with the lack of foreign protection of ipr special 301 some members of congress have questioned the effectiveness of these laws andor the executive branchs effectiveness in implementing the laws they have proposed changes that would strengthen the protection of domestic producers18 others have proposed that us cvd laws be amended to apply to nonmarket economies such as china major us trading partners have challenged in some cases successfully the legality of us trade remedy laws in the wto for example the byrd amendment discussed under the wto issues and the us 1916 antidumping act which was been repealed by the 108th congress were challenged successfully they have also challenged how the united states has implemented its trade remedy laws arguing that the procedures the united states uses to make determinations in ad and cvd cases do not conform to rules under wto agreements many us trading partners have claimed that us trade remedy laws are protectionist and are seeking tighter rules on the use of trade remedy laws in the doha development agenda round negotiations in the wto however many in the congress have expressed opposition to trade agreements that would weaken us trade remedy laws us trade remedy laws could be the subject of oversight hearings and also legislation congress will probably closely monitor trade agreements that include changes in us trade remedy laws outsourcing for many years us multinational firms have disaggregated their production processes to allow them to take advantage of lower labor costs and other attributes in foreign countries at first they would import some parts to be assembled as final products in the united states this was followed by investment in whole production facilities abroad for reexport back to the united states or to third markets recent reports indicate that us multinationals are subcontracting or outsourcing the actual design of computer hardware software and other 17 for more information on agoa see crs report rl31772 us trade and investment relationship with subsaharan africa the african growth and opportunity act and beyond by danielle l langton 18 for more information see crs report rl32371 trade remedies primer by vivian c jones crs13 electronics products to offshore firms19 this trend may raise important policy issues for the 109th congress as members consider the impact on constituent firms and workers and well as the impact on the us economy as whole20 for example should the us government support programs to keep jobs in the united states by discouraging outsourcing by us firms export controlsforeign policy sanctions under the export administration act eaa the congress has delegated to the president the authority to control us exports of socalled dualuse goods and technologies for example highspeed computers that can be used for both military and civilian purposes among other things the authority permits the president to establish licensing mechanism to ensure that dualuse goods and technologies are not exported to recipients who would use them to threaten us national security the authority also allows restriction on exports that are in short supply the last eaa reauthorization expired in august 2001 the export control regime has been maintained under the international emergency economic powers act ieepa which permits the president to control economic activities in response to declared emergency the congress might consider legislation to reauthorize the eaa in the past the debate of export control authority has centered around how restrictive us controls should be many in the business community especially those who export high technology goods and services while understanding the need for controls have argued that controls that are unnecessarily restrictive impeded their ability to compete with foreign firms in third markets particularly when those firms do not face the same limits others argue on the other hand export controls should be sufficiently effective to ensure that dualuse technology and goods not get into the hands of those who wish harm to the united states21 the 108th congress passed and the president signed the burmese freedom and democracy act

states works closely with these trading partners in the wto and other multilateral institutions however trade disputes arise because of the size and importance of the relationships these disputes raise concerns with the congress and are often the subject of oversight hearings if not legislation such has already been the case during the 109th congress the european union the economic relationship between the united states and the european union eu is the largest in the world the modern useuropean economic relationship has evolved since world war ii broadening as the six member european community expanded into the present 25member european union the ties have also become more complex and interdependent covering growing number and type of trade and financial activities in 2005 4951 billion flowed between the united states and the eu in merchandise trade the eu as unit is the largest merchandise trading partner of the united states in 2005 the eu accounted for 1863 billion of total us exports or 206 and for 2826 billion of total us imports or 185 for us trade deficit of 1224 billion useu disputes have become increasingly complex the issues in question are longer just border trade issues tariffs and other customs regulations but also crs15 differences over competition policy and government regulations disputes that impinge on the sovereign right of nations to run their economies in their national interests several issues in the relationship are simmering and could erupt into full blown disputes in the next two years the european union is party to the case in the wto over the failure of the united states to comply with the adverse wto ruling on the byrd amendment the eu will have to decide whether the us congresss repeal the byrd amendment discussed earlier is adequate or to maintain tariff sanctions on us exports another perennial issue has been over alleged government subsidies for boeing and airbus industrie by their home governments the united states had threatened to take the eu to the wto over what it claims are wtoillegal subsidies by the eu governments of new large commercial airliner by airbus industrie the eu counterclaims that the us company boeing the only other producer of large commercial airliners is subsidized by the us government through defense and space contracts and through other assistance having failed to work out their differences in bilateral discussions the two parties independently filed complaints with the wto in march 2005 the wto created two panels one to study us charges of illegal subsidies to airbus and the second to study eu charges against boeing the cases are to be argued this year but final decisions are not expected until sometime in 2007 another issue thought to have been resolved has reemerged in october 2004 the congress repealed the foreign sales corporation fscextraterritorial income eti program that provided an export tax subsidy for certain firms the repeal was in response to wto ruling that the program conflicted with wto rules on subsidies before the repeal the eu had imposed tariff sanctions on selected us exports because the united states had failed to repeal the program before set deadline but lifted the sanctions after the congress passed the repeal subsequently the eu challenged certain provisions of the new law that allowed for phaseout of the subsidies and the wto upheld the challenge the united states filed an appeal and on february 13 2006 the wto appellate body ruled against the united states22 the eu has threatened to reimpose the tariffsanctions23 on february 7 2006 the wto dispute settlement body issued preliminary decision that ruled in favor of the united states and other countries that challenged the eu ban on imports of bioengineered food products final decision is expected later in the year canada canada is the largest singlecountry us trading partner it is the largest market for us exports and largest source of us

uscanada trade given the importance of the sector to both economies and has drawn great deal of congressional attention two issues in particular are longrunning and very divisive the first pertains to the shipment of canadian cattle into the united states in 2003 the united states banned all canadian beef imports because of the discovery of case of mad cow disease subsequently the bush administration allowed some types of beef products to be imported but has still maintained tight restrictions on most beef imports including live cattle us and canadian agriculture officials had been discussing ways to establish procedures to reopen the us border to live canadian beef trade in processed or packaged beef has already resumed on january 5 2005 the us department of agriculture issued rule to go into effect on march 7 2005 that would permit additional beef imports from canada including live cattle younger than 30 months us cattlemen opposed the rule and the ranchers cattlemen action legal fund brought case which led to ruling by the us district court judge suspending the implementation of the rule in addition on march 3 2005 the senate passed joint resolution to block the implementation of the rule24 however us meatpackers supported the rule and sought its implementation on july 18 2005 the united states began to import live cattle from canada second issue concerns imports of softwood lumber from canada us lumber producers claim that low stumpage fees that provincial governments charge for lumber harvested from public lands and other practices constitute illegal government subsidies to the canadian lumber industry after fiveyear uscanadian lumber agreement that imposed tariffs on canadian softwood lumber expired in 2001 the us lumber industry filed series of countervailing duty and antidumping cases alleging the threat of material injury the department of commerce and the us international trade commission determined that injury andor threats of injury existed from dumping and subsidies canada has challenged the actions in the nafta dispute settlement mechanism and the dispute settlement mechanism in the wto canada is awaiting wto panel decision on obtaining compensation from the united states on measures the wto determined to be illegal25 canada has prevailed in nafta dispute settlement proceedings upholding canadian claims that us actions

trade and economic relationship prospects and challenges by ian f fergusson crs17 mexico mexico is the second largest singlecountry export market for us exports having surpassed japan and the third largest source of us imports in 2005 the united states incurred trade deficit of 501 billion with mexico bilateral trade had increased rapidly even before the north american free trade agreement nafta went into effect on january 1 1994 several disputes have disturbed what on the whole has been harmonious trade relationship on january 1 2002 the mexican congress enacted 20 tax on soft drinks made with high fructose syrup the us exports highfructose corn syrup and soft drinks that contain such syrup the tax was in retaliation over disagreement on how much mexican sugar should be allowed to enter the united states under nafta the united states claims that the tax violates mexicos obligations in the wto dispute resolution panel requested by the united states determined that the tax violated wto rules and mexico has appealed the decision in 2005 another longstanding issue concerns the right of mexican trucks to transport goods throughout the united states under nafta mexican trucks were to obtain that right in 2000 but the clinton administration suspended that concession to mexico alleging safety problems with mexican trucks mexico has been pressing the united states for full compliance with this provision in june 2004 the us supreme court ruled that mexican trucks could operate in the united states the two countries are now engaged in negotiations to resolve safety concerns26 china chinas relationship with the united states is the most dynamic and contentious at this time bilateral trade has soared total uschina trade has increased from 50 billion in 1980 to 2853 billion in 2005 the us trade deficit of 2016 billion with china in 2005 is the largest us bilateral trade deficit far exceeding the second largest with japan at 825 billion deficit with japan china is the second largest source of us imports and the 11th largest export market china has become the second largest next to japan foreign holder of us treasury securities thus helping to finance the increasing us national debt on november 10 2005 the united states and china came to an agreement that restricts chinas exports of wearing apparel and textiles to the united states the agreement was in response to surges in us imports of textile and apparel after the multilateral quotas on these products expired on january 1 2005 the agreement was also in lieu us unilateral safeguard actions on these products from china which threatened more extensive restrictions27 the huge trade deficit has generated concerns about the effects of rapidly growing imports on us importsensitive industries and workers some interest groups representing labor and certain industries for example have focused on chinas exchange rate regime that pegs the yuan to basket of currencies including us dollar us critics of chinas policy charge that china deliberately undervalues the yuandollar exchange rate to underprice its exports and place them at unfair 26 for more information on usmexico economic ties

from nonmarket economies including china and increase monitoring chinas compliance with wto obligations and its commitments to the united states on intellectual property rights ipr protection among other things companion bill s 1421 collins was introduced in the senate number of bills have been introduced that would target chinas exchange rate policies for example the senate is expected to vote during the second session of the 109th congress on s 295 schumer that would impose 275 tariff surcharges on imports from china if china does not revalue its currency to market levels on november 16 2005 the senate had agreed per unanimous consent to consider the bill later than march 31 200628 japan the usjapan economic relationship is very strong and mutually advantageous the two economies are highly integrated via trade in goods and services they are large markets for each others exports and important sources of imports more importantly japan and the united states are closely connected via capital flows japan is the largest foreign source of financing of the us national debt it will likely remain so for the foreseeable future as us national debt mounts and the stock of us domestic savings remains insufficient to finance it japan is also significant source of foreign private portfolio and direct investment in the united states and the united states is the origin of much of the foreign investment in japan the united states has consistently run merchandise trade deficits with japan after declining in 2003 the deficit has been rising reaching 825 billion in 2005 the largest us trade deficit with japan in 2005 the us exports to japan amounted to 554 billion and us imports amounted to 1381 billion in the 1980s and the 1990s the usjapan economic relationship was often source of sharp friction due to widespread japanese trade barriers and the growing competition posed by japanese industries in autos for example the tone has softened considerably nevertheless bilateral trade disputes do arise japan is party to the complaint against the united states in the wto regarding the byrd amendment and japan imposed tariff sanctions against selected us exports japan first imposed the ban on imports of us beef in december 2003 due to concerns over case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse also know as mad cow disease in washington state japan lifted the ban on imports of beef from cattle 20 months or younger on december 12 2005 but reimposed it on january 20 2006 when japanese meat inspectors discovered prohibited spinal bone material in shipment some members of congress raised concerns over the japanese original 28 for more information on uschina trade issues see crs issue brief ib91121 china us trade issues by wayne m morrison crs19 ban and the reimposed ban even proposing legislation to retaliate against japanese imports if the ban were not lifted 29 the wider trade debate the range of trade issues that the 109th congress will likely face is very broad and diverse each issue or set of issues bears its own implications as members of congress weigh the merits and disadvantages in most cases the 109th congress will be considering and debating each issue separately however the cumulative effect of each debate may have wider implications for us trade policy as the 109th congress addresses these issues its decisions may define us trade policy in the long term free trade or protectionism the history of us trade policy since the 1930s is one of movement toward trade liberalization lowering of tariffs and other trade barriers and working in concert with other major trading powers to create multilateral rules to promote freer trade at the same time us trade policymakers have taken measures to restrict trade by crafting laws that make it easier for domestic us industries to obtain relief from dumped and subsidized imports and from surges in fairlytraded imports while this debate over the direction of us trade policy is sometimes framed as free trade or protectionism the terms of the debate are more subtle more open trade or more restricted trade the outcome of the trade issues before the 109th congress will influence in which direction us trade policy proceeds the rise of developing countries developing countries have emerged as significant players in us trade and world trade as result of globalization this trend presents the united states with challenges for example how should the united states respond to the increasing competition from less expensive labor in the developing countries should labor rights be included in trade agreements these questions cut across the debates on each of the us ftas with developing countries the doha development agenda negotiations in the wto discussions and congressional proposals on trade remedy laws the issue of outsourcing and the anticipated surge in textile and wearing apparel imports among other issues broader question that might be considered is whether on balance the united states will consider trade with developing countries as race to the bottom or as winwin proposition for both sides labor environment and trade the issues of workers rights and environmental protection become significant points of debate in congressional consideration of many trade matters more 29 for more information on usjapan economic ties see crs report rl32649 usjapan economic relations significance prospects and policy crs20 precisely the question is to what extent should workers rights environmental protection and other concerns be part of trade agreements or other trade policy initiatives the congress included workers rights and environmental policy as principal negotiating objectives in the legislation granting trade promotion authority some members of congress have argued that trade agreements should ensure that trade partners treatment of workers rights meet internationally accepted core labor standards or otherwise face trade sanctions others contend that trade agreements should only ensure that countries adequately enforce their own trade laws similar division of thought exists regarding trade agreements and environmental protection this underlying debate will likely emerge in congressional consideration of dr cafta and other trade agreements involving developing country trading partners it may also arise if and when congress considers renewal of the presidents trade promotion authority and reviews us participation in the wto the outcome of these debates might determine in which direction us trade policy is moving on these issues shaping the international trade system the trade issues that the 109th congress faces and how the congress deals with them could have an impact on the international trading system the international system is becoming larger and more complex lying at the foundation of the system is the wto over the years the rules the wto and its predecessor the gatt administers have expanded from tariffs to such nontariff barriers as government procurement practices sanitary and phytosanitary measures and ipr protection an objective of the doha development agenda is to broaden the rules coverage even more the 107th congress helped set the agenda for the dda round and us negotiating positions during the round when it granted the president trade promotion authority and established negotiating objectives the 109th congress through oversight and the administrations mandatory consultations can continue to influence the agenda the wto is also expanding its membership as of february 2006 the wto has 149 members with 29 more countries at various stages of attaining membership or accession congress does not vote on whether country can join the wto through oversight it can influence the us position on negotiating countrys entry the congress could have more direct impact when it considers pntr for those countries such as russia ukraine and vietnam whose ntr status is still conditioned under the jacksonvanik amendment along with the wto the international trading system is populated by web of regional and bilateral free trade areas based on ftas in some cases these areas are interlinked while in others they are distinct ftas have become significant and expanding part of the international trading system international trade observers and policymakers are divided on whether the two tracks of the international trading system the multilateral the wto and bilateralregional ftas are mutually reinforcing or in conflict the bush administration firmly bases its trade policy strategy on the two prongs being reinforcing former ustr zoellick has argued that the ftas he negotiated are crs21 cutting edge agreements that carry an importance beyond the size of newly opened markets because they set high enforceable standards in newer areas of importance to america such as services intellectual property transparency and anti corruption and ecommerce30 on the other hand others contend that ftas undermine the wto and its principles because they promote discriminatory treatment in trade by limiting preferential treatment to the participants in the fta some critics have also asserted that bilateral and regional ftas create conglomeration of tariffreduction schedules and rules of origin that are in conflict with one another and create confusion in the trading system undermining trade efficiency31 in between these two groups are policymakers and observers who assert that ftas and the wto are not necessarily incompatible but oppose the emphasis that bilateral and regional ftas have been given by the bush administration they argue that the administration needs to devote the limited available staff and other resources to wto negotiations where they claim it can promote us trade policy goals more effectively32 30 zoellick robert b remember seattle mixed signals are bad for trade the wall street journal october 5 2004 31 for example sutherland
