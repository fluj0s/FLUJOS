different proposals and scenarios although the constitution is silent on various aspects of the voting process the constitution seems to anticipate that stat would be primarily responsible for establishing election procedur federal authority to also regulate federal elections however is specifically provided for in the constitution there are two main provisions at issue article i 4 cl 1 which provides congress the authority to set the times places and manner of congre ssional elections and article ii 1 cl 4 which provides that cong ress may designate the time for the choosing of presidential electors congress power is at its most broad in the case of house elections which have historically always been decided by system of popular voting congressional power over senate elections while lmost as broad as it is for house elections contains one exception that congress may not regulate the places of chusing senators the power of congress to regulate presiden tial elections is not however as clearly established as the power over house and nate elections as noted above the text of the constitution provides the congress only the limited power to designate the time of the choosing of presidential electors the case law on this issue is however ambiguous and congresss regulato ry authority over presidential elections seems to be more extensive than might app ear based on the text of article ii 1 cl 4 the constitution does not grant the congress general legislative authority to regulate the manner and procedures used for elections at the state and local level the congress however does have author ity under the civil war amendments the 19th 24th and the 26th amendments to prevent discr imination in access to voting and has exercised that power extensively over state and local elections as well as federal elections the congress also has expansive authority to spend money for the general welfare and allocation of such grant m onies could be

national standards for the administration of voter registration balloting tabulating or reporting election results this report focuses on the constitutional authority and limitations that are relevant congress standardizing these and other procedures policy evaluation of these and other proposals however is beyond the scope of this report in evaluating any such proposals an initial question to be asked is which elections will be affected traditionally all voting whether federal state or local occurs in local precinct polling places and st ate or local authorities have significant role in regulating such voting congress however also has authority to regulate elections and that authority may vary pending on whether the election is for the presidency the house the senate or for st ate or local offices further there may be variation in whether partic ular aspect of an election such as balloting procedures is amenable to congressiona l regulation consequently th authority for congress to establish standardized electi on procedures would appear to require an evaluation of variety of different proposals and scenarios various proposals have been made regarding standardizing election procedures including establishing uniform procedur for registration of voters standardizing mailin and absentee balloting establishing uniform closing time for polls establishing multiple day

httpwwwlocgovcrsconanart0142htmrelevant constitutional provisions the authority of congress to legislate re garding these various issues in different types of elections would appear to derive principally from two constitutional provisions article i 4 cl 1 the times places and manner of hol ding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature therof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations except as to the places of chusing senators article ii 1 cl 4 the congress may determine the time of c husing the presidential electors and the day on which they shall give their votes which day shall be the same throughout the united states house elections although the constitution is silent on various aspects of the voting process the constitution seems to anticipate that stat would be primar ily responsible for establishing election procedures for c ongressional elections federal authority to regulate congressional elections is specifically provi ded for in the constitution this power is at its most broad in the case of house elections whic h have historically always been decided by system of popular voting1 as noted above article i 4 cl 1 states that the congress may determine the times places and manner for such elections the supreme court and lower courts have inte rpreted the above language to mean that congress has extensive power to regulate most elements of congressional election for instance the supreme court has noted that the right to vote for members of congress is derived from the constitution and that congress therefore may legislate broadly under this provision to protect the integrity of this right2 the court has stated that the authority to regulate the times places nd manner of federal elections embraces the authority to provide complete code for congressional elections not only as to times and places but in relation to notices registration

returns in short to enact the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved congress has general supervisory power over the whole subject 3 consequently it would appear that the congress would have broad authority to implement the various proposals listed above as regards house elections senate elections unlike house elections senate elections were until ratification of the 17th amendment decided not by popular vote but by vote of the state legislatures this helps explain why congressiona l power over senate elections while almost as broad as it is for house elections contains one exception that congress may not regulate the places of chusing senators as or iginally drafted this language would have limited the authority of the congress to designate where state legislatures would meet for such votes this deference to the prerogatives of state legislatures would appear to be obsolete now that all senate elec tions are decided by popular vote however nothing in the 17th amendment explicitly re pealed this restriction and the meaning of the clause could apply to congressional regulation of establishment of the sites for popular voting arguably if congress attempted to establish legislation regulating where states must establish polling sites for senate elections such legislation might run afoul of this provision on the other hand for practi cal purposes most states if subjected to federal regulation for house elections tablishing the location of polling place would be likely to follow such directions for senate elections occurring at the same time if other reason than administrative convenience presidential elections the power of congress to regulate presidential elections is not as clearly established as the power over house and sena elections first the text of the constitution provides more limited power to congress in these situations whereashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30747crs4 4 us const art ii 1 cl 2 provides that each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct number of electors equal to the whole

4 cl 1 allows regulation of the time place and manner of congressional elections article ii 1 cl 4 provides onl that congress may determine the time of choosing presidential electors further despite modern state practice providing for popular voting for electors the appointment of presidential elect ors was historically and remains today power of the state legislatures4 consequently principles of federalism might incline the supreme court to find the appointment of presidential electors less amenable to federal regu lation the exception to this would be congressional authority under th civil war amendments 13th 14th and 15th these powers are addressed in the following section on regulating state and local elections the case law on this issue is ambi guous although congress regulatory authority over presidential elections does seem to be more extensive than it might appear based on the text of the constituti on for instance the court has allowed congressional regulation of political committees which seek to influence presidential elections arguing that such legislation is justified by the need to preserve the integrity of such elections in burroughs v united states 5 the supreme court reasoned that while presidential electors are not officer s or agents of the federal government they exercise federal functions under nd discharge duties in virtue of authority conferred by the constitution of the united states the president is vested with the executive power of the nation the importance of his election and the vital character of its relationship to and effect upon the welfare and safety of the whole people cannot be too strongly stated to say that congress is without power to pass appropriate legislation to safeguard such an election from the improper use of money to influence the result is to deny to the nation in vital particular the power of self protec tion congress undoubtedly possesses that power as it possesses every other power essential to preserve the departments and institutions of the general government from impairment or destruction whether threatened by force or by corruption6 question arises however whether burroughs which involves the regulation of third parties to elections can be distinguished from the regulation of states directly regarding their administration of presidential elections in burroughs the court distinguished the legislation under consid eration regulation of political committees from legislation more directly dealing with state appointment of electors noting that the congressional act under review seeks to preserve the purity of presidential and vice presidential elections neither in purpose nor in effect does it interfere with the power of state to appoint electors or the manner in which their appointment shall be made it deals w ith political committees organized for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30747crs5 7 290 us 543544 8 42 usc 1973gg et seq 9 acorn v edgar 56 f3d 791 7th cir

justice black wrote it is the prerogative of congress to oversee the conduct of presidential and continuedpurpose of influencing elections in two or more states and with branches or subsidiaries of national committees and excludes from its operation state or local committees its operation therefore is confined to situations which if not beyond the power of the state to deal w ith at all are beyond its power to deal with adequately it in sense invades any exclusive state power7 under this language proce dures within the province of states such as the allocation of electors by state would appear to fall outside of the doctrine established in burroughs although the court was not asked to evaluate whether congress had the power to establish the manner in which the presidential electors were appointed the language above would appear to indicate that the court in burroughs had not intended its decision to ex tend congress authority to regulate presidential elections so that it was coextensive with the power to regulate congressional elections surprisingly however three united states courts of appeal relying on burroughs reached precisely the opposite result in upholding the validity of congressional regulation of re gistration procedures for federal elections under the national voter registration ac t of 1993 motor voter act8 three federal circuits appeared to find that the congress had the same authority to regulate presidential elections as it did hous and senate elections9 however of the three opinions two made only passing references to the issue and only the seventh circuit discussed it at any length in acorn v edgar chief judge posner of the seventh circuit wrote that article i 4 providing authority over congressional elections makes reference to the election of the president which is by the electoral college rather than by the voters at the general electi on general elections for president were not contemplated in 1787 but these turn out not to be serious omission so far as teasing out the modern meaning of article i 4 is concerned article ii provides congressional authority over the time of choosing electors article ii 1 has been interpreted to grant congress power over presidential elections coextensive with that which article i 4 grants it over congressional elections burroughs v united states 290 us 534 199510 it should be noted that the federal re gistration standards developed under motor voter could probably have been decide d under congress power over congressional elections so that the reasoning of these cases would not appear essential to their holdings these broad holdings however do stand as some of the few modern interpretations of ar ticle ii 1 cl 4 and burroughs 11 those cases interpretationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30747crs6 11 continued vicepresidential elections and to set the qualif ications for voters for electors for those offices it cannot be seriously contended th at congress has less power over the conduct of presidential elections than it has over congressional elections 400 us 112 124 1970upholding federal statute lowering minimum age for voters although justice black wrote the opinion of the court other justic joined this portion of his opinion as the other justices instead focused on congress power under the 14th amendment 12 in fact careful reading of burroughs reveals that the opinion is not even an interpretation of article ii 1 at all as presumed in the acorn case and by justice black in oregon v mitchell but rather an interpre tation albeit uncited of article i 8 cl 18 the necessary and proper clause see quoted text accompanying note 6 13 us const amend x iii prohib iting slavery amend xiv due process and equal protection and amend xv

of this issue may ultimately be important to any determination of whether proposals to standardize election pr ocedures could be specifically applied to presidential elections where congressi onal and presidential election procedures are likely to overlap such as requirements for absentee balloting uniform closing times multiple day elections number and accessability of polling stations etc regulation of congressional elections may be for practical purposes sufficient however where the issue at hand is unique to presidential elections eg allocation of electors based on popular vote the resolu tion of this issue ma become essential state and local elections congress does not have genera l legislative authority to regulate the manner and procedures used for elections at the stat and local level the congress however does have extensive authority under the civil war amendments13 the 19th amendment14 the 24th amendment15 and the 26th amendment16 to prevent discrimination in access to voting and it s exercised that power extensively over state and local as well as federal elections17 thus to the extent that national ballot standards could be established as means to avoid disenfranchi sement regulation of state and local elections could be established such power does however have limits for instance the fourteenth amendment provides that states shall not deprive citizens of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deprive them of equa l protection of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30747crs7 18 384 us 641 1966 19 521 us 507 1997 20 42 usc 2000bb et seq 21 494 us 872 1990neutral generally applicable laws may be applied to religious practices even if the law is not supported by compelling governmental interest 22 121 s ct 525 2000 laws and section 5 of that amendment pr ovides that the congress has the power to legislate to enforce its provisions thus in katzenbach v morgan 18 the court held that 5 of the fourteenth amendment aut horized congress not just to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment as defined by the courts but to help define its scope in katzenbach the court upheld portion of the voting rights act of 1965 which barred the application of englis h literacy requirements to persons who had reached sixth grade in puerto rican school taught in spanish in flores v city of boerne19 however the court limited the reach of this authority in flores the court struck down the relig ious freedom restoration act rfra20 as beyond the authority of congress under 5 of the fourteenth amendment rfra passed in respons to the 1990 supreme court case of oregon v smith 21 was an attempt by the congress to reinstate the compelling governmental interest test which had been used to challenge the application of generally applicable laws to religious institutions the flores case arose when the city of boerne denied church building permit to expand because the church was in designated histor ical district the church challenged this action asserting that the city had not demonstrated compelling interest in applying its zoning legislation to the church as required by rfra in striking down rfra the suprem court held that there must be congruence and proportionality between the injury to be remedied and the law adopted to that end rfra focused on one area of alleged harm to religion but rather broadly inhibited the application of all types of state and local regulations to religious institutions since the court found pattern of the use of neutral laws of general applicability to disguise religi ous bigotry and animus against religion it found rfra to be an overbroad respons to relatively nonexistent problem similarly it might be difficult to justify an overall regulation of state and local elections based on the fourteenth amendmen t absent strong showing of systemic disenfranchisement of voters rather flores would seem to dictate that the congress would need to establish narrow proposals s howing that particular voting procedures threatened constitutional rights and that the legislation was congruent and proportional response to such threat for instance the question has been rais ed as to whether the recent case of bush v gore22 which found equal protec tion concerns regarding the disparate treatment of voters would support cong ressional legislation to sta ndardize voting technologies and procedures close examination of th at case however would seem to indicate that the supreme court did not intend to si gnificantly extend the application of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30747crs8 23 see university of alabama v garret148 l ed 2d 866 2000equal protection clause and consequently the court may not be amenable to the expansion of congressional authority in this area in bush v gore dispute arose regarding among other things how to count punchcard election ballots where the paper chads had not been fully dislodged the supreme court held that the failure of the florida supreme court to set standards for evaluating these ballots violat ed the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment on its face this would appear to make it more likely that congress could pass legislation under 5 of the 14th amendment to avoid these or similar problems under the previously discussed case law such laws would be valid if congress could establish that disparity in the use of voting technologies and procedures has historically resulted in violations of the equal protection clause23 in fact it would be likely that congress could establish record of disparity in the application of voting t echnologies and procedures as states have historically delegated authority over electi ons to lesser subdivisions ch as elector districts these subdivisions in turn choose votin g methods and proce dures appropriate to their size density and budget with only ge neral guidance from the state legislatures thus significant variations in voting t echnologies and procedur probably do occur in most states there is language in bush v gore however which would make it unlikely that such variations would be found to be violation of the equal protection clause in essence this language appears to limit the holding in bush v gore to only those election procedures that are unde r the control of judicial officer the recount process in its features scribed here is inc onsistent with the minimum procedures necessary to protect the fundamental right of each voter in the special instance of statewide recount under the authority of single state judicial officer our consideration is limited to the present circumstance for the problem of qual protection in election processes generally presents many complexities the question before the court is not whether local entities in the exercise of their expertise may develop different systems for implementing elec tions instead we are presented with situation where state court with the power to assure uniformity has ordered statewide recount with minima l procedural safeguards when court orders statewide remedy there must be at least some assurance that the rudimentary requirement s of equal treatment nd fundamental fairness be satisfied based on the above language disparity in voting procedures is only likely to rise to the level of constitutional violation when such dispar ate procedures are under the authority of single judicial officer such as during recount it is not clear that the congress could establish history of voting discrimination in these circumstances nor is it likely that the court would find significant intrusions on state or local election district authority to set tec hnology or procedure standards to be proportionate and congruent to such viola tions as have existed consequently it would appear that the impact of the case of bush v gore on the issue of congressional authority over elections would be minimalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30747crs9 24 us const art i 8 cl
