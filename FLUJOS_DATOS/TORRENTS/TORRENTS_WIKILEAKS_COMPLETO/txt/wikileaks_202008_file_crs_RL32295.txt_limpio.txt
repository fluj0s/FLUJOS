the face of longterm care indiana summary demographic challenges posed by the growing elderly population and demands for greater public commitment to home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities of all ages have drawn the attention of federal and state policymakers for some time spending on longterm care by both the public and private sectors is significant in 2001 spending for longterm care services for persons of all ages represented 122 of all personal health care spending in 2001almost 152 billion of 124 trillion federal and state governments accounted for almost twothirds of all spending by far the primary payor for longterm care is the federalstate medicaid program which paid for almost half of all longterm care spending in 2001 many states have devoted significant efforts to respond to the desire for home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities and their families nevertheless financing of nursing home care chiefly by medicaid still dominates most states spending for longterm care today to assist congress in understanding issues that states face in providing longterm care services the congressional research service crs undertook study of 10 states in 2002 this report one in series of 10 state reports presents background and analysis about longterm care in indiana indiana is the 14th largest state in the country with 61 million people in 2000 about 124 of its population is aged 65 and older the states oldest population grew quite rapidly during the 1990s those aged 85 and older grew by 276 from 19902000 by 2025 persons aged 65 and older will represent close to one out of five persons slightly higher than the us average indiana is one of few states that house most of its longterm care programs for the frail elderly younger adults with disabilities and persons with developmental disabilities within the same administrative unit indiana makes heavy use of institutional services to serve the first two populations in fy2001 11 billion or more than 27 of all medicaid spending was for care in institutions nursing home spending accounted for almost twothirds of medicaid longterm care spending services in intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded accounted for 23 and home and communitybased services accounted for almost 15 slowmoving waiting lists for home and communitybased services have been problem for the state and quality of care issues caused the state to revamp its primary program for persons with developmental disabilities the state replaced its former program and

acknowledgments crs wishes to acknowledge the generous time and contributions of the many state officials and stakeholders who provided information on longterm care services in indiana without their generous time and invaluable experience and insight this report would not be possible we would particularly like to thank officials from the indiana family and social services administration we would also like to thank the advocates and providers who offered valuable perspectives on the longterm care system in indiana the authors gratefully acknowledge the excellent assistance of rashelle butts in the production of this report preface demographic challenges posed by the growing elderly population and demands for greater public commitment to home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities have drawn the attention of federal and state policymakers for some time spending on longterm care by both the public and private sectors is significant in 2001 spending for longterm care services for persons of all ages represented 122 of all personal health care spending almost 152 billion of 124 trillion federal and state governments accounted for almost twothirds of all spending by far the primary payor for longterm care is the federalstate medicaid program which paid for almost half of all us longterm care spending in 2001 federal and state medicaid spending for longterm care in fy2001 was about 75 billion representing over onethird of all medicaid spending over 70 of medicaid longterm care spending was for institutions nursing homes and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded icfsmr many believe that the current federal financing system paid through medicaid is structurally biased in favor of institutional care state governments face significant challenges in refocusing care systems given the structure of current federal financing many states have devoted significant efforts to change their longterm care systems to expand home and communitybased services for persons with disabilities and their families nevertheless financing of nursing home care primarily through the medicaid program still dominates most states spending on longterm care today while some advocates maintain that the federal government should play larger role in providing support for home and communitybased care congress has not yet decided whether or how to change current federal policy one possibility is that congress may continue an incremental approach to longterm care without major federal policy involvement leaving to state governments the responsibility for developing strategies that support home and communitybased care within existing federal funding constraints and program rules to help congress review various policy alternatives and to assist policymakers understand issues that states face in development of longterm care services the congressional research service crs undertook study of 10 states in 2002 the research was undertaken to look at state policies on longterm care as well as trends in both institutional and home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities the elderly persons with mental retardation and other adults with disabilities the research included review of state documents and data on long term care as well as national data sources on spending crs interviewed state officials responsible for longterm care wide range of stakeholders and in some cases members or staff of state legislatures the 10 states included in the study are arizona florida illinois indiana louisiana maine oklahoma oregon pennsylvania and texas states were chosen according to number of variables including geographic distribution demographic trends and approaches to financing administration and delivery of longterm care services this report presents background and analysis about longterm care in indiana crs review of 10 states home and communitybased services states seek to change the face of longterm care indiana introduction federal legislative perspective states choosing to modify their programs for the social security amendments of 1965 which created the medicaid program required states to longterm care face provide skilled nursing facility services under their significant challenges state medicaid plans and gave nursing home care the financing of nursing home same level of priority as hospital and physician care has dominated longterm services care spending for decades the federal financing section 1902 state plan for medical assistance must provide for inclusion of some institutional and structure that created some noninstitutional care and services and effective incentives to support july 1 1967 provide for inclusion of at least 1 institutional care reaches inpatient hospital services 2 outpatient hospital back to 1965 number of services 3 other laboratory and xray services 4 converging factors have skilled nursing home services other than services in supported reliance on nursing an institution for tuberculosis or mental diseases for home spending prior to individuals 21 years of age or older 5 physicians services pl 8997 july 30 1965 enactment of medicaid homes for the aged and other public institutions were financed by combination of direct payments made by individuals with their social security old age assistance oaa benefits and vendor payments made by states with federal matching payments on behalf of individuals the kerrmills medical assistance to the aged maa program enacted in 1960 predecessor to medicaid allowed states to provide medical services including skilled nursing home services to persons who were not eligible for oaa cash payments thereby expanding the eligible population1 in 1965 when kerrmills was transformed into the federalstate medicaid program congress created an entitlement to skilled nursing facility care under the expanded program the social security amendments of 1965 required that states provide skilled nursing facility services and gave nursing home care the same level of priority as hospital and physician services amendments in 1967 allowed states 1 crs report 83181 nursing home legislation issues and policies by maureen baltay archived report available from crs upon request crs2 to provide care in intermediate care facilities icfs for persons who did not need skilled nursing home care but needed more than room and board in 1987 congress eliminated the distinction between skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities effective in 1990 as result of these various amendments people eligible under the states medicaid plan are entitled to nursing home facility care that is if person meets the states income and asset requirements as well as the states functional eligibility requirements for entry into nursing home he or she is entitled to the benefit these early legislative developments were the basis for the beginnings of the modern day nursing home industry significant growth in the number of nursing homes occurred during the 1960s from 1960 to 1970 the number of homes more than doubled from 9582 to almost 23000 and the number of beds more than tripled from 331000 to more than one million2 in 2003 since its inception medicaid has been the predominant there were about 16400 payor for nursing home care in 1970 over 1 billion was nursing homes with 18 spent on nursing home care through medicaid and million beds3 medicare federal and state medicaid payments accounted for almost all of this spending 87 medicaid spending for nursing home care grew by 50 in during the latter part of the threeyear period beginning in 1967 the 1960s and the 1970s nursing home care attracted in fy2001 medicaid spent 531 billion on institutional great deal of congressional care for nursing homes and care in intermediate care oversight as result of facilities for the mentally retarded concern about increasing federal expenditures and pattern of instances of fraud and abuse that was becoming evident between 1969 and 1976 the subcommittee on longterm care of the senate special committee on aging held 30 hearings on problems in the nursing home industry4 home care services received some congressional attention in the authorizing statute home health care services were one of the optional services that states could provide under the 1965 law three years later in 1968 congress amended the law to require states to provide home health care services to persons entitled to skilled nursing facility care as part of their state medicaid plans effective in 1970 during the 1970s the department of health education and welfare now department of health and human services dhhs devoted attention to alternatives to nursing home care through variety of federal research and demonstration efforts these efforts were undertaken not only to find ways to offset the high costs of 2 us congress senate special committee on aging

succeeding years crs3 nursing facility care but also to respond to the desires of persons with disabilities to remain in their homes and in community settings rather than in institutions however it was not until 1981 that congress took significant legislative action to expand home and communitybased services through medicaid when it authorized the medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased waiver program under that authority known then as the section 2176 waiver program the secretary of dhhs may waive certain medicaid state plan requirements to allow states to cover wide range of home and communitybased services to persons who otherwise meet the states eligibility requirements for institutional care the waiver provision was designed to alter the emphasis in the medicaid program on institutional care services under the section 1915c waiver include case management personal care homemaker home health aide adult day care habilitation environmental modifications among many others5 these services are covered as an option of states and under the law persons are not entitled to these services as they are to nursing facility care moreover states are allowed to set cost caps and limits on the numbers and types of persons to be served under their wavier programs notwithstanding wide use of the section 1915c waiver authority by states over the last two decades total spending for medicaid home and communitybased services waivers is significantly less than institutional care about 144 billion in 2001 compared to 531 billion for nursing facility care services and care for persons with mental retardation in intermediate care facilities icfsmr despite this disparity in spending in many states the section 1915c waiver program is the primary source of financial support for wide range of home and communitybased services and funding has been increasing steadily federal and state medicaid support for the waiver programs increased by over 807 from fy1990 to fy2001 in constant 2001 dollars the home and communitybased waiver program has been significant source of support to care for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities as states have closed large state institutions for these persons over the last two decades nationally in fy2001 almost 75 of section 1915c waiver funding was devoted to providing services to these individuals states administer their longterm care programs against this backdrop of federal legislative initiatives first the entitlement to nursing home care and requirement to provide home health services to persons entitled to nursing home care and second the option to provide wide range of home and communitybased services 5 states may waive the following medicaid requirements 1 statewideness states may cover services in only portion of the state rather than in all geographic jurisdictions 2 comparability of services states may cover stateselected groups of persons rather than all persons otherwise eligible and 3 financial eligibility requirements states may use more liberal income requirements for persons needing home and communitybased waiver services than would otherwise apply to persons

indiana has an innovative home and community services system for those adults with disabilities who are able to access it funding comes from medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased services waiver and generous nonmeanstested statefunded program the state spends large proportion of its medicaid long term care funds on institutional care demographic trends indiana is the 14th largest state in the country with 61 million people in 2000 the population increased by 97 or about half million people from 19902000 about 124 of its population is aged 65 and older 752831 people in 2000 the states oldest population is growing quite rapidly those aged 85 and older grew by 276 from 19902000 persons aged 85 and over with two or more limitations in activities of daily living adls in indiana are estimated to increase 228 by 2010 to reach over 11000 people the number of persons aged 18 to 64 with the same level of disability is estimated to increase by 37 reaching 15340 or 258 of all adults with limitations in two or more adls in 2010 growth in the number of adults of all ages with disabilities will place pressure on public and private longterm care resources administration of longterm care programs indiana is one of the few states to house most of its home and communitybased services programs for the frail elderly younger adults with disabilities and persons with developmental disabilities within the same administrative unit the family and social services administration fssa within that larger unit these long term care functions are spread across two bureaus and one office within fssa indianas department of health regulates nursing homes the state has single point of entry for these programs and an innovative electronicallybased assessment and case management system trends in institutional care in 2000 indiana had 572 nursing facilities with 56990 beds with relatively low occupancy rate of 748 the number of beds per 1000 persons age 65 and older is 757 much higher than the national rate of 527 the states ratio for persons age 85 and over is also much higher than the national rate the relatively low occupancy rates combined with the high ratio of nursing home beds crs6 to older persons implies that the state has much excess capacity in its nursing home industry residential care for persons with developmental disabilities has shifted to care in smaller settings over the period from 19902000 in indiana persons with developmental disabilities living in large institutions with 16 or more residents declined from 53 of all such persons living in group residences in 1990 to 32 in 2000 while the proportion residing in homes with six persons or fewer persons grew from about onethird in 1990 to 44 in 2000 trends in home and communitybased care the state uses combination of medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased services waivers and large totally statefunded program to provide home and community services to persons with disabilities through the inhome services program the state funded program community and home options to institutional care for the elderly and disabled choice funded at 343 million in state fiscal year sfy 2002 has more generous financial eligibility standards than used under medicaid and very flexible services in 1992 indiana started its medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded waiver icfmr waiver to provide home and community services for persons with mental retardation this program was replaced with the developmental disabilities waiver in 2001 as result of some serious quality problems uncovered by federal audit the state also has two other section 1915c waiver programs to help persons with developmental disabilities remain at home longterm care spending in fy2001 11 billion or 274 of all medicaid spending in indiana was for care in institutions nursing homes and intermediate care facilities for persons with mental retardation icfsmr nursing home spending accounted for almost three quarters of medicaid institutional spending and almost twothirds of medicaid longterm care spending in the same year home and communitybased services accounted for almost 15 of all medicaid spending spending for medicaid home and communitybased services increased by over 958 from fy1990 to fy2001 while spending for institutional care increased at slower pace by 38 over the same period in constant 2001 dollars issues in financing and delivery of longterm care waiting lists for home and communitybased services have been persistent problem in indiana the statefunded choice program had waiting list of over 8500 persons in sfy2002 decrease crs7 from almost 12000 persons in sfy2001 some state interviewees said that the number of persons on the waiting list may not be good indication of who needs services because some people join the list before they really need care other interviewees said that the top three ways of getting off the list are in order 1 to die 2 go into nursing home or 3 to receive services generally after wait of 35 to 4 years indiana has had quality problems in its section 1915c home and communitybased services waivers for persons with developmental disabilities as result the state implemented new quality assurance mechanisms including use of routine independent audits demographic trends indiana is

of the homes level of quality indiana has implemented the senior security plan to address the problems residents face when their facilities close the plan involves senior care teams that assist medicaid eligible residents of closing nursing facilities to find another facility or to transition to home or community settings the state plans to use former residents medicaid funding to pay for their services under the medicaid aged and disabled waiver the state expected to fund up to 1000 of the states 10000 unused medicaid aged and disabled waiver slots in this way in sfy2002 according to state officials indiana did not have the expected number of persons leaving nursing facilities and therefore did not obtain the funding for most of the unused slots as result the waiver was amended in october 2002 to decrease the maximum number of waiver slots to 6000 indiana is addressing excess nursing home capacity in number of ways the state received nursing facility transition grant of 770000 in 2001 from the us department of health and human services dhhs to move persons from nursing homes into the community and to divert persons who live in the community and are at risk of nursing home placement from these facilities8 use of grant funds allows area agencies on aging and nursing home ombudsmen to identify nursing home residents with relatively low care needs and inform them about opportunities to move into the community using waiver funding in addition the state has established nursing home occupancy standard to address excess capacity the state has stipulated that if any nursing facility has less than 75 occupancy level then its medicaid reimbursement amount would be reduced some homes have decertified beds as result of this rule 8

monthly medicaid expenditure under this waiver in sfy2002 was 644 the state has had dhhs approval for many more slots than persons served for number of years state funding constraints have not allowed the state to serve persons up to the approved slot level10 at the same time its statefunded home and communitybased program described below has had an extensive waiting list the traumatic brain injury waiver targets persons who have suffered brain injuries the waiver had 200 slots in 2002 the number of slots has increased dramatically since 2000 when the state had only 100 slots the number of persons served has also increased rather dramatically from 25 persons in sfy2000 to 146 persons in sfy2002 wide range of services is available including case management therapies companion

each resident his or her own room with lockable door bathroom and food preparation area the average monthly medicaid expenditure under this waiver in sfy2002 was 1177 state programs there are number of pathways that establish medicaid eligibility for home and communitybased longterm care services these include coverage of persons whose income is 300 of the federal ssi payment level 1656 month in 2003 as allowed under the section 1915c waiver program despite the availability of this more liberal standard many people may need community care but cannot meet medicaids income limits or resource tests many of these persons cannot establish eligibility until they spenddown almost all of their resources and income and by that time may be in danger of entering an institution one of the issues many states have confronted is how to serve these people indiana has addressed this issue in part through its community and home options to institutional care for elderly and individuals with disabilities choice program which is totally statefunded there are income and asset tests under the choice program but persons with incomes at or above 150 of the federal poverty level are required to contribute toward the costs of services based on sliding fee scale persons with incomes at or above 351 of poverty are required to pay the full cost of services choice beneficiaries must have longterm disability or be age 60 or older and unable to perform two of 14 adls or instrumental activities of daily living iadls12 this standard is more liberal than the functional eligibility standard for the medicaid section 1915caged and disabled waiver the program provides all the services provided by the aged and disabled waiver in addition to other authorized services that person may need to remain at home examples of these services include language translation and pest control services the program was funded at 343 million in sfy2002 many persons served by the choice program are of advanced age of

into nursing home or 3 receive services generally after wait of 35 to 4 years however some interviewees said that the number of persons on the waiting list may not be good indication of need for services because some people join the list before they really need care 11 bureau of aging and in home services annual report 2001 indianapolis in 2001 12 iadls refer to activities necessary for

communitybased services first the state is converting some choice beneficiaries to the medicaid aged and disabled waiver to take advantage of the federal medicaid matching funds the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms has allowed this as long as the additional federal funds are devoted to the waiver in addition the state had plans to close 30year old statefunded room and board assistance program to new participants because the state is encouraging providers to become assisted living facilities and participate in the medicaid assisted living facility waiver the state had plans to use the programs state funding to draw down federal medicaid matching funds medicaid policy affecting consumers of longterm care two aspects of medicaid policy in indiana affect consumers of longterm care the first is the states initiative to participate in longterm care partnership program the second relates to the definition of disability for adults under age 65 longterm care partnership program with funding from the robert wood johnson foundation indiana established the indiana long term care insurance program iltcip in 1993 the longterm care partnership program was initiated by the robert wood johnson rwj foundation in 1988 the purpose of the program is to encourage the purchase of longterm care insurance and to blend public financing medicaid with private insurance indiana is one of four states that implemented the program with funding from rwj the other states are california connecticut and new york under the program persons who purchase certified private long term care insurance policy may qualify for medicaid once they exhaust their insurance benefits in return for purchasing insurance coverage they may qualify for medicaid assistance without being required to meet medicaid assets tests and thereby protect some of their assets the amount of assets protection is dependent upon the amount of insurance coverage purchased applicants must however meet medicaid income and categorical eligibility requirements age or disability criteria in indiana insurance purchasers can receive dollar for dollar protection of their assets or protection of all of their assets depending upon the amount of longterm care insurance benefits they purchase purchasers can choose between nursing home only policies and those that cover home community and facility services all policies include inflation protection in indiana as of april 2003 22285 insurance policies were in effect seven persons had qualified for medicaid thirteen insurance companies participate in the program13 definition of disability before 2001 people under 65 could not qualify for medicaid on the basis of their disabilities if their disabilities could improve with proper medical treatment in september 2000 the indiana court of appeals ordered the state to stop denying disability benefits on this basis in june 2001 the indiana supreme court declined to hear the states appeal of the court of appeals decision14 13 data collected by crs summer 2003 14 petricia day v indiana ind ct app 49a020001cv30 sept 29 2000 crs15 the state supreme courts decision extended medicaid coverage to those whose disability is expected to last four years if left untreated15 the previous standard had required that person have permanent untreatable disability therefore for example people with conditions such as cancer or kidney failure could not obtain medicaid coverage16 the state had originally estimated the cost of compliance with the decision to be 850 million that figure declined to 130 million because just 3665 of 17559 persons who were contacted and expected to be eligible for medicaid actually applied and were found eligible for the program the state contacted people who were denied coverage between december 20 1993 and december 2001 indianas longterm care services for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities services to persons with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities in the united states changed dramatically over the last half of the 20th century as result of number of converging factors these include the advocacy efforts of families and organized constituency groups various changes to the social security law that provided payments to individuals through ssi and social security disability insurance ssdi and to service providers through the medicaid program and significant litigation brought on behalf of persons with mental retardation17 trends in institutional care the early history of services to persons with developmental disabilities and mental retardation is characterized by the development of large state institutions or training schools begun during the latter part of the 19th century and continuing through the first part of the 20th century between 1920 and 1967 institutions quadrupled in size and peaked at almost 200000 individuals nationwide in 165 free standing stateoperated mental retardation institutional facilities18 today some states are still faced with the legacy of large stateoperated institutions indiana like many other states has eliminated some of its large state

their 2000 census the nationwide trend in care for persons with developmental disabilities has been to provide care in smaller communitybased facilities in indiana persons living in large institutions

with developmental disabilities dd waiver the support services waiver and the autism waiver serving total of 4161 persons in sfy2002 in order to be eligible for waiver services persons must meet the level of care requirements provided in an icfmr the state was relatively slow to set up its first waiver for persons with developmental disabilities it was not until 1992 that indiana began its intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded waiver icfmr waiver 11 years after enactment of the federal law use of the waiver program has affected the type of care for persons with developmental disabilities in that care has been shifted to small communitybased settings the icfmr waiver was replaced with the dd waiver in 2001 the replacement occurred because of serious quality problems that routine cms regional office audit uncovered the regional audit found that the state had failed to insure safe environment in the communitybased waiver settings and that case management and quality assurance systems were inadequate interviewees indicated that safety problems occurred because three icfsmr with 40 beds each closed and the state was forced to find placements for the residents quickly and therefore placed residents in communitybased waiver settings that turned out to be unsafe the state reacted to the waiver audit in number of ways it moved administration of the waiver from baihs to the bureau of developmental disabilities services bdds in 2001 in addition the dd waiver was modified to give the state more flexibility to pay for beneficiary participation in community activities vocational skills training and transportation to community activities to improve the quality of services the state has also applied for targeted case management waiver to provide intensive case management to some persons and began requiring 18 months of training for case managers persons with developmental disabilities can choose between area agency on aging aaa case managers and service coordinators from the bdds field offices for intake activities they can choose between aaa case managers and private case managers for on going case management activities to address quality the state hired electronic data systems inc eds to audit at least 10 of developmental disability service providers annually this system was expanded to the aged and disabled waiver in 2002 the average monthly medicaid waiver expenditure in sfy2002 was 367719 the support services waiver which began in april 2002 is designed to help persons remain in their own homes by providing such services

issues raised in state reports collected for this project and interviews with state officials and key stakeholders conducted during the site visit to indiana in the summer of 2002 institutional bias most interviewees indicated their belief that the state has an institutional bias toward care in nursing facilities for frail older persons and younger adults with disabilities in response the state has taken several steps to increase use of home and communitybased services the state has expanded the number of slots in several medicaid section 1915c waivers in addition in 2002 governor obannons administration received systems change grant from the department of health and human services to create the governors commission on home and community based care to increase opportunities for persons with disabilities to live in the community methods to be examined include increased housing and transportation options initiation of projects to allow persons to direct their own care and ways to train and retain caregivers crs25 labor issues most interviewees agreed that all longterm care providers face labor shortage that is affecting quality of care some people do not receive services in the community and continuity of care is affected in nursing homes the shortage involves licensed nurses in addition to paraprofessional workers the labor shortage appears to be worse in rural areas labor shortage of different sort occurs among state and local officials as in other states programs have grown in scope without concomitant increases in funding for the staff needed to administer them consumer direction the state has established pilot programs under the state funded choice program to test consumerdirected personal assistance services but the programs faltered because only few area agencies on aging participated interviewees attributed this reluctance to confusion about who is considered the employer of the personal assistant and how taxes should be withheld23 in 2001 the legislature enacted provision to provide choice and waiver beneficiaries the opportunity to recruit hire pay supervise and dismiss personal services attendant housing and transportation interviewees view lack of affordable housing and convenient transportation as major barriers to assist persons with disabilities to remain in the community housing issues include 1 ablebodied people occupying accessible housing that is designed for persons with disabilities and 2 the choice program limiting its home adaptations to one home with 5000 lifetime limit transportation problems are exemplified by the situation in indianapolis where accessible buses cover only part of the city or some routes operate only once day making going to work difficult if not impossible for persons with disabilities quality assurance issues indiana has had quality problems in its section 1915c home and communitybased services waivers for persons with developmental disabilities as result the state replaced its former waiver with new one and implemented new quality assurance mechanisms including use of routine independent audits licensure standards for assisted living facilities have been source of controversy draft regulations were controversial because they would have required discharge of residents if they had certain medical conditions or needed regular assistance with two or more adls at the time of the site visit summer 2002 the department of health was rewriting regulations to require facilities that provide services themselves to obtain licensure but this would not be necessary if the facilities hired an agency to deliver services in the facility waiting lists the statefunded choice program had waiting list of 8577 people in sfy2002 decrease from 11922 in sfy200124 some interviewees said that the number of persons on the waiting list may not be good indication of who needs services because some people join the list before they really need care other 23 for further
