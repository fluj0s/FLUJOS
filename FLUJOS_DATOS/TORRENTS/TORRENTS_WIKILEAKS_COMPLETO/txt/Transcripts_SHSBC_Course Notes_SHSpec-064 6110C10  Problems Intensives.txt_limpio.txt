6110c10 shspec64 problems intensives supposing that dianetics and scientology did everything they were supposed to do what would your problem have been before you came into it your own personal problem that is the approach you should use on pe course give all the firsts of scientology and dianetics give very broad complete description then ask what is the problem that would make you come into scientology this is assuming that everything that was said about scientology was true you restimulate their ptp of long duration then ask what is your problem the problem is now staring them in the face and in some percentage they will for the first time recognize the source of some discomfort then give them some data about processing and get them into the hgc that should be the first lecture on pe course because it gives stable datum conditional but desirable stable datum on certain number you will produce startling change theres new addition to pc assessment sheet it gets you list of things you take the bestreading and run list of processes on it reassess the list of thinks and repeat the process it gets the prior confusion and handles it with ruds problems processes and sec check on the personnel in the prior confusion the first list asks for times the pcs life changed ask when the changes occurred each of them will be handled with the problem that existed just prior as well as the prior confusion the change was solution get the changes of lifestyle also the when doesnt have to be very precise now get the bestreading change and ask what problem did you have immediately before that change get him to state the problem not just fact it should have question mystery about it how why or what then just run the problems rud process until flat eg when the somatic that got going quiets down it gets at the ptp of long duration which gives hidden standards run it by the ta after it is flat ask what was the confusion in your life just before that then assess the people in that confusion the idea of listing and asking for another person in the confusion will put the pc back in the confusion and stop him from skidding forward and youll wind up with list of personnel you sec check the list this requires some acumen to mock up the sec check its really glorified ow and you could just run ow except that it has some danger since its running against terminal which hasnt been assessed so its better to sec check if terminal is not on goals line running it can beef up case unless run on sec check the sec check neednt be awfully extensive though doing it very thoroughly will give better result you continue the process with the next bestreading change etc when all is done we could say that the person was release and has hidden standards and would do auditing commands this fully supplants routine 1a as way to handle problems the reason you are handling hidden standards is not because the individual has his attention stuck someplace nor because the pc vias your auditing commands through it though these things are true you are running it because to the pc its an oracle hes not really analytically checking his eyesight every session to see if auditing is making it better his eyesight somatic knows and thats the only data there is observation and experience have bearing on his knowingness its more than ptp of long duration of specialized sort its pretty vicious proposition the pc does it every command or every session if he does it every command it knows and he doesnt so he has to consult it to find out he does it in life all the time too unbeknownst to you he judges goodness and badness truth and falsity by whether he gets somatic which comes from some circuit or other criminal knows right from wrong because circuit is restimulated or not therefore the cops are crazy because the little green light in his skull lit up when he was about to commit his crime hes baffled when hes arrested he knows nobody can tell right from wrong or he knows by the way he feels whether hes doing right or wrong the way people get that way is thus 1 they are thetan as themselves 2 they get so invalidated or invalidate others so much that they get overwhelmed with their own inval and they pick up valence 3 somatic overwhelm while being the valence he got hell of somatic an impact is easily substituted for knowingness it can also seem to be punishment for some unknown crime so hes got terrible problem what has he done to be punished for it he doesnt know he just feels guilty anyway impact seems like knowingness ones own knowingness as valence is in validated so hes got an impact knowingness which he keeps around which is part of an engram on his goalsterminal chain the engram presents problem because it is not reachable because its in the middle of the goalsterminal chain since the pcs own knowingness has been invalidated he can only go on being validated in his knowingness as circuit but he has to be careful because it knows more than he does superstitious peoples who have very little and have been knocked around badly have catalogs of superstitions which are sort of third dynamic circuits this moves out into secondary state the circuit is now audible it dictates to him gives him orders aloud this is the final result of valence which has been overwhelmed by somatic which has been overwhelmed by another thinkingness etc see fig 4 it is not an endless number of valences but there can be nearly endless number of hidden standards real hidden standard is something the pc consults with each command or each session consults is the clue the hidden standards key in because of problems of magnitude or because of prior confusion the usual course of human events is the individual went through lot of trouble and lot of confusion he couldnt quite figure any part of it out and it left him hung with problem which he up and solved by changing his life in some way he may get the idea when theres change there must have been problem before there isnt always problem otherdetermined changes dont necessarily have problems before them but they wont assess on the meter he solves the problem with hidden standard where does circuit come from theyre different from valences valence answers the question of who to be or how to be right with beingness circuit answers the question without changing beingness how do you know when youre right circuit furnishes information valence furnishes beingness circuit can step up from furnishing information to furnishing orders and then it can step up to furnishing orders below the level of consciousness always expressed faintly at least in somatics most people live in haunted houses they think there are other thetans in their bodies because of the commands of circuits circuit can be set up easily and isnt bad thing unless its out of his control forgotten as to authorship etc controlling the fellow with him taking responsibility for it thetan can do anything circuit can do and more the basic of circuit trouble is setting something up and taking responsibility and leaving it on automatic if hes done this he has some godawful problem just before he did it just before he has the problem he was in fantastic confusion and before the confusion he had fantastic numbers of withholds from the people in the confusion those conditions must all be present to get circuit trouble and you have to pay attention to all of them to unravel the circuits to get into that state hed have to have been pretty active and to have started withholding everything from everybody he was in contact with about everything or about something special hes not free to communicate things start going wrong since his comm is messed up life got very confused eventually became an awful problem then he solved the problem if he had enough overts and withholds hed blow which brought about change the change is now the tag you can use to get back to all the stuff behind it figure 4 dwindling spiral of circuit formation 1 the thetan being as himself 2 he gets invalidatedoverwhelmed as himself 3 he picks up valence 4 the valence gets overwhelmed by somatic 5 the valences knowingness is invalidated 6 the pc as the valence sets up circuit to use the impact knowingness of the somatic as senior source of knowledge so he can go on being validated in his knowingness the circuit now does the observing and knowing 7 the circuit becomes audible 8 the circuit gives orders 9 the circuit gives orders below the level of consciousness always expressed at least faintly in somatics the point of change is withdrawal so is the original ow both key in circuits cf page 47 where lrh points out that circuits are substitute for confront and gives more data about what circuits are used for the whole story is repetitive outofcommunication with periscope that looks for him and tells him thats the hidden standard seen as circuit experience must not approach this person and since auditing is an experience he never allows it to approach you are trying to audit the person not the via thus case gain is slow at best the problems intensive hits all this and knocks the circuits out of the road it can be done with imprecise auditing and it starts with pc assessment which is less accusative to the new pc than sec check assessment he gets familiar with sec checks on gradient dealing with specific people interesting areas to him it makes practically any level of case processable and can be done by the most selfconscious auditor
