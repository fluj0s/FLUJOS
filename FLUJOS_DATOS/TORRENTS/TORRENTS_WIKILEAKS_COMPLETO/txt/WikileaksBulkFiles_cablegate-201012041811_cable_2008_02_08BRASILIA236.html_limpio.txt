defense jobim ref brasilia 93 b brasilia 175 1 c ambassador sobel met with brazilian minister of defense nelson jobim feb 13 to discuss jobims upcoming visit to washington regional security and progress on defense cooperation jobim agreed with ambassador sobels outline of possible areas for discussion during his march visit to washington including further discussion of defense cooperation agreement he also signaled that brazil would be open to discussions regarding negotiation of general security of military information agreement gsomia and status of forces agreement sofa similar to that concluded with france chief of ministry staff murilo marques barboza said that gsomia had been discussed in the past but had broken down over arrangements for inspections of brazilian facilities this probably reflects brazilian sensitivities over allowing us access to military facilities even with reciprocal access to those in the us jobim and barboza indicated openness to renewing dialogue on gsomia but in order to complete such an agreement the inspections will need clearer characterization as reciprocal visits jobim also expressed interest in technology transfers particularly as they could apply to brazilian plans to modernize its military ambassador sobel acknowledged that we were aware of brazilian interest in us submarine technology and were preparing what we hoped would be constructive response 2 c in separate meeting with mod chief of staff barboza datt was told that the mods response to the us was aimed at reaching consensus with the usg that could gain president lulas support as deliverable for jobims visit to washington circumventing mre obstruction this was the tactic that led to completion of the sofa with france earlier this year barboza indicated that the french sofa used language that did not provoke constitutional onjections as previous proposals for usbrazil sofas have he counselled observing the reaction of brazils congress to the french sofa and completing the dca before working on usbrazil version barboza also expressed caution on the possible gsomia noting that other information sharing arrangment to which brazil is party would involve visits he did however leave the door open to exploration of formula that could work for both sides 3 c jobim told ambassador sobel that the brazilian government shared the ambassadors concern about the possibility of venezuela exporting instability he believed that president chavez has been saber rattling to distract from internal problems brazil supports creation of south american defense council to bring chavez into the mainstream of the continent and provide reassurance that there is security threat jobim believed that isolating venezuela would lead to further posturing from chavez and greater risk of spreading instability among neighboring countries 4 c embassy comment however impractical the suggestion may seem it follows the traditional brazilian policy of trying to be everyones friend by attempting to incorporate chavez idea for defense cooperation into supposed containment strategy sobel
