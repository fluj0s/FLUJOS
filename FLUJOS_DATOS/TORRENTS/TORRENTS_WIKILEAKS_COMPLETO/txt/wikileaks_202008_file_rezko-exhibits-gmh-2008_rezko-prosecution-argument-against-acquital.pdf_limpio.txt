us 12 126 sct 403 163 led2d 14 2005 iii argument evidence in support of money laundering counts rezko first moves to vacate his money laundering convictions on counts 23 and 24 in short rezko citing two recent supreme court cases argues that the charged moneylaundering transactions did not involve the movement of the proceeds of the mail fraud and bthere was insufficient evidence of concealment to sustain the convictions for the reasons setforth below rezkos motion to vacate counts 23 and 24 should be denied 1 factual background counts 23 and 24 charged rezko with money laundering in violation of title 18 united states code section 1956a1bi each money laundering count charged rezko withcausing financial transaction specifically the movement of two 125000 checks that involvedcase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 3 of 374the proceeds of the mail fraud scheme charged in counts 1 and 2 of the indictment counts 1 and 2 of the indictment involved mailings in furtherance of the glencoe capital glencoeaspect of the charged fraud scheme as the evidence demonstrated at trial glencoe hired shellypekin to act as finder in glencoes attempt to obtain money from trs in exchange forlevines assistance in obtaining money for glenco from trs pekin agreed to share portion of his finders fee with levine levines acceptance of this kickback which was not disclosed tothe trs board despite levines position on the board was an honest services fraud scheme in approximately the summer of 2003 levine at rezkos request agreed to share portion of the potential finders fee from glen coe with dick mell rezko however later informed levine the fraud money was not to go to mell rather according to rezko he wouldlater provide another name to levine to obtain the money in august 2003 the trs board voted to allocate 50 million to glencoe levine did not disclose his financial interest in the glencoe allocation at the time of the glencoe vote oncetrs voted to allocate money to glencoe the fraud scheme was effectively complete as levinehad violated his honest services in exchange for money once glencoe obtained an allocation from trs pekin was in line to obtain 375000 from the fraud scheme through his finders fee agr eement with glencoe pekin obtained the first of the fraud funds in september 2003 and later received more of the fraud funds in january 2004and march 2004 in approximately january 2004 rezko informed levine that joseph aramandawas to receive 250000 of the fraud funds levine passed aramandas name to pekin so pekin could meet aramanda and arrange to get aramanda the money pekin and aramanda met to conceal the movement of the fraud money sham consulting contract between pekincase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 4 of 375and aramanda was produced levine pekin and steve loren testified about the sham consulting contract in particular levine aske d loren to produce the sham consulting contract loren after repeatedly rebuffing levine ultimately agreed to produce the sham consultingcontract loren was so concerned about the sham consulting contract that he had it erased from his law firms computers pekin and aramanda met and signed the sham consulting contract the sham consulting contract envisioned fo rwardlooking relationship between pekin and aramanda and was meant to hide the fact that aramanda was getting money for doing absolutelynothing in relation to the glencoetrs deal which in fact had occurred months earlier pekintestified he did not expect aramanda to provide any services under the sham consulting contractand could not see how aramanda who had cont acts in the financial world would be able to help pekin with consulting by march 2004 pekin had over 250000 in money from glencoe based on the fraud scheme shortly after signing the sham consulting contract in march 2004 pekin providedaramanda with 125000 check from the fraud money count 23 the next payment of thefraud money was not due until july 2004 aramanda requested the money earlier than pekinexpected and pekin refused to provide the money to aramanda ultimately rezko pressuredlevine to have pekin get another 125000 to aram anda immediately thereafter in april 2004 pekin wrote aramanda another 125000 check and provided the check to aramanda count 24 pekin never again heard from aramanda after providing the second 125000 check toaramanda 3 the government proved the money laundering transactions involved net proceeds rezko argues that the two 125000 checks to aramanda were not rezkos profitscase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 5 of 376from the fraud scheme and therefore could not have been the necessary proceeds required to convict rezko of money laundering as explained below the two 125000 checks were profitsfrom the fraud scheme and rezko was properly convicted of money laundering the jury was instructed that to find rezko guilty of money laundering it needed to find beyond reasonable doubt that among other things the property involved in the financialtransactions at issue involved the net proceeds of the mail fraud charged in counts 1 and 2 brezko knew the property involved in the financial transactions represented the net proceeds ofsome form of unlawful activity and c that rezko knew the transaction was designed in wholeor in part to conceal or disguise the nature the source the ownership or the control of the netproceeds of the mail fraud charged in counts 1 and 2 jury inst at 59 the jury was furtherinstructed that the term net proceeds is def ined as the proceeds remaining after deducting the direct business costs if any incurred in acquiring the proceeds id at 62 the jury was also instructed that the government must prove that the defendant knew that the property represented the net proceeds of some form of activity that constitutes felony under state or federal law id at 63 based on recent supreme court case united states v santos 128 sct 2020 2008 rezko argues that the money laundering convictions must be vacated because the mail fraud andmoney laundering convictions merge and there were net proceeds involved in thecharged laundering transactions in santos the transaction alleged as money laundering was an illegal lottery operators payments to his winners and runners using the receipts from his lotteryoperation id at 20282030 the specified unlawful activity sua that generated the receipts was the operation of an illegal gambling business in violation of title 18 usc 1955case 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 6 of 371 the santos opinion was plurality opinion that i nvolved the meaning of proceeds in money laundering case brought under the promotion prong of the money laundering statute wherethe sua was the operation of an illegal gambling business in violation of title 18 united statescode section 1955 it is the governments position that since santos was plurality opinion and pursuant to marks v united states 430 us 188 193 1977 the only binding aspect of santos is that proceeds as used in section 1956a1 means profits when the sua charged as the predicate offense is the operation of an illegal ga mbling business in viola tion of section 1955 the government concedes however that because santos has limited holding it does not abrogate the law of this circuit which existed prior to santos and which had applied the profits definition to suas beyond just the operation of an illegal gambling business see eg united states v malone 484 f3d 916 921 7th cir 2007 drug offense those cases remain the governing law in this circuit 7relying on the rule of lenity fourjustice plurality in santos concluded that the word proceeds in the money laundering statute means profits rather than gross receipts id the plurality reasoned that even when the term proceeds was viewed in its context throughout themoney laundering statute ambiguity remained and thus the rule of lenity applied in favor of thenarrower profits definition the plurality further supported its view by noting that absent aprofits definition the government could charge the promotion prong of the moneylaundering statute in cases like santos in which the alleged money laundering transaction was normal part of the underlying sua id in such cases the money laundering charge may be said to merge with the proceedsgenerating crime so that separate conviction for moneylaundering would be tantamount to second conviction for the same offense id in the pluralitys view profits definition of proceeds eliminated this problem because bydefinition profits consist of what remains after expenses are paid id at 9 1 in short in santos the supreme courts concern was that the money involved in the charged money laundering was simply the payment of expenses of the criminal activity and notthe movement of the net proceeds of the criminal activity the plurality was concerned that anycase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 7 of 378time payment of expenses of scheme was made the government could charge money laundering under the promotion prong of the money laundering statute while rezko argues in footnote that the term proceeds appears in both the promotion prong and concealment prong of the money laundering statute and thereforesantos must apply with equal force to both the mere fact the term is present in both prongs does not mean the pluralitys reasoning applies with equal force to both prongs again the primaryconcern of the plurality in santos was the governments overreaching to use money laundering to punish the payment of expenses of the criminal activity as promotion of the underlying illegalactivity that concern is not equally present in the concealment prong of the money launderingstatute as the jury instructions in the instant case made clear the concealment prong requiresthe government to prove rezko knew the financial transaction at issue was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature the source the ownership or the control of the proceedsof the sua jury inst at 59 the evidence necessary to meet this requirement has beendeveloped in seventh circuit cases see eg united states v esterman 324 f3d 565 570 7 th cir 2003 discussed in more detail in the next section but requiring proof that the financial transaction must at least in part be designed to conceal or disguise the nature source ownership or control of the funds under the case law dealing with the concealment prong the merepayment of money for expenses of the criminal activity will fail to meet the evidentiaryrequirements necessary to convict under concealment theory of money laundering accordingly it is not at all clear that the supreme court would as defendant blithely assumestake similar position on the definition of proceeds as it did in santos were it to solely consider concealment prong casecase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 8 of 379regardless of how the supreme court might some day interpret the definition of proceeds in the concealment prong of the money laundering statute as the plurality noted insantos interpreting proceeds to mean profits eliminates the merger problem and the issue of concern to the plurality id at 2027 at issue then is whether any rational juror having clearly been properly instructed in the instant case could find that the movement of the two125000 checks from pekin to aramanda was movement of profits that is net proceeds and notthe movement of money to pay expenses in short rezkos argument is simply sufficiency ofthe evidence argument as to whether the government proved the two 125000 checks were theprofits of the fraud scheme the evidence was overwhelming that the two 125000 checks were the profits from the fraud scheme as instructed net proceeds or profit is simply proceeds remaining after deductingdirect business expenses if any incurred in acquiring the proceeds jury inst at 62 emphasis added in the instant case there were expenses to levine pekin or rezko from the fraudscheme the 375000 to pekin was the profit from the fraud scheme again the fraud wascomplete when levine breached his honest services and trs allocated money to glencoe theschemers obtained their profit from the scheme in the form of the payments from glencoe topekin see united states v segal 495 f3d 826 838839 7 th cir 2007 finding that defendants obtaining of approximately 30 milli on through fraud was net not gross proceeds to the defendant and that defendant incurre d expenses in obtaining the fraud money and thus to him it was all net proceeds figuratively all gravy thus any movement of the375000 by pekin assuming the other elements were met was financial transactionlaundering the profits of the fraud scheme accord united states v lee 232 f3d 556 558560case 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 9 of 37107th cir 2000 finding defendant obtained funds fraudulently by lying on documents in order to secure loan and thereafter committed money laundering by using the funds that is profits topay off another loan and rejecting the defenda nts argument that his obtaining the fraudulent funds and paying off the loan were all part of one fraudulent transaction as to rezko specifically his personal profit putting aside the profit of the whole fraud scheme was the 250000 he obtained through the scheme at minimum even if oneconsiders that pekin took his expenses of 125000 out of the fraud that left profit of 250000 for rezko and levine there were othe r expenses to be deducted from rezkos profit of 250000 thus regardless of whether one focuses on the full 375000 or merelyrezkos 250000 rezkos movement of the 250000 was the movement of profits from pekinto aramanda through sham consulting contract that constituted financial transaction in netproceeds and therefore supported the money laundering convictions as the court noted in santos the money laundering statutes are to be imposed only for the removal of profits from criminal activity 128 sct at 2028 in the instant case rezkosmovement of the money from pekin to aramanda was the removal of his profits of the fraudscheme rezko while suggesting there were profits in the instant case and therefore money laundering never indicates exactly when it would be appropriate for the government tocharge money laundering crime under rezkos theory that the 250000 was not profit eventhe movement of the 250000 from aramanda to an offshore company and then to bankaccount in rezkos wifes name would not be money laundering because it would simply be themovement of the gross proceeds of the fraud scheme and not actually profits this surely wascase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 10 of 3711not the intent of the santos opinion and is certainly the type of activity meant to be criminalized by the money laundering statutes yet if rezko is correct and the 250000 is not profit itsmovement anywhere in any form of disguise or through any form of concealment would not be money laundering when taken to its logical conclusion rezkos argument fails anddemonstrates that the 375000 was the schemes profits from the beginning although there have not been numerous cases post santos united states v poulsen 2008 wl 2944680 sd ohio aug 1 2008 is instructive in poulsen the defendants were convicted of among other things money laundering under section 1956a1bi thedefendants in poulsen moved to vacate their money laundering convictions based on santos the underlying unlawful activity in poulsen was securities fraud and wire fraud that arose from the defendants obtaining investor money through fraudulent representations the poulsen court determined that the money obtained through the fraudulent representations was the proceeds orgross receipts id at 25 after obtaining the fraudulent proceeds the defendants in poulsen then wired the money to companies in which they had business interest the wiring of thefraud money was charged as money laundering id at 2526 the poulsen court found that unlike in santos the transactions that formed the basis of the defendantss money laundering convictions had nothing to do with paying their expenses id at 25 the court noted that the government did not charge the paying of marketi ng materials or outside professional services as the laundering but rather the movement of money to organizations in which the defendants hadan interest id at 2526 since the charged financial transactions with the money from the fraud was not the payment of the schemes expenses the poulsen court refused to vacate the defendantss money laundering convictionscase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 11 of 3712much like the situation in poulsen in the instant case the 375000 was the profits of rezkos fraud of which he was entitled to 250000 the movement of money from pekin toaramanda was not an expense but rather movement of rezkos profits to third party toconceal rezkos interest in the profits of his criminal activity there is theory in whichrezko was ever going to deduct expenses from hi s take of the fraud rezko had expenses accordingly the movement of the money to aram anda was financial transaction that violated the money laundering statute as poulsen makes clear the intent of santos is to combat the government from charging the payment of expenses as money laundering not as here chargingfinancial transactions in the profits from the fraud as money laundering accord united states v everett 2008 wl 3843831 at 78 d ariz aug 14 2008 upholding money laundering conviction against santos challenge where defendant took money he obtained from bankruptcy fraud and used it to purchase home court noted that the defendant essentially hadno expenses and the use of the money to purchase an asset did not convert the money into anexpense in sum viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government rational juror could have found that the movement of m oney from pekin to aramanda were transactions in net proceeds sufficient to convict rezko of money laundering 3 the government presented sufficient evidence for jury to find the financial transactions charged in counts 23 and 24 were intendedto conceal or disguise the control ownership and source of the netproceeds rezko also argues that counts 23 and 24 should be vacated because rational juror could have concluded that the movement of the money from pekin to aramanda was meant todisguise or conceal the nature location source ownership or control of the 250000 thecase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 12 of 3713evidence however was overwhelming that rezkos movement of his profits of the fraud scheme from pekin to aramanda was meant to disguise or conceal the nature source ownership orcontrol of the 250000 as noted above the jury was instructed that to convict rezko of counts 23 or 24 they needed to find beyond reasonable doubt that t he defendant knew that the transaction was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature the source the ownership or thecontrol of the net proceeds of mail fraud as charged in counts 1 and 2 jury inst at 59 asrezko notes the seventh circuit has articulated two general principles when consideringwhether financial transaction was designed in w hole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature source ownership or control of the laundered funds see united states v esterman 324 f3d 565 570 7 th cir 2003 first the financial transaction at issue should have some separation from the initial transaction that produced the fraudulent proceeds id second the financial transaction must at least in part be designed to conceal or disguise the nature sourceownership or control of the funds id as the seventh circuit noted intent to disguise or conceal may be proven by circumstantial evidence like unusual secrecy surrounding thetransactions careful structuring of transacti ons to avoid attention folding or otherwise depositing illegal profits into the bank account or receipts of legitimate business use of thirdparties to conceal the real owner or engaging in unusual financial moves culminating in atransaction id at 573 as for the first principle articulated in esterman and as noted above the mail fraud scheme led to pekin obtaining 375000 in fraudulen tly derived funds pekins obtaining of the fraudulently obtained funds through several payments from glencoe was the initial transactioncase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 13 of 3714in which the coschemers obtained their illgotten gains while rezko suggests that the first transactions that rendered the money an illgotten gain were the two transfers from pekin toaramanda this completely ignores the sequence of events that occurred before those twofinancial transactions and how the schemers fraudulently obtained the money in the firstinstance although rezko argues that pekin was entitled to the 375000 pekin only obtainedthe 375000 through the fraud scheme in which he levine and rezko participated whilepekin was entitled to the money based on his agreement with glencoe he obtained the moneyand his entitlement to it from glencoe through fraud indeed it is unclear why the moneywould suddenly become illgotten gains when it was moved from pekin to aramanda if it wasnot already illgotten gains when it initially arrived with pekin in addition as to the second general principle articulated in esterman the evidence was overwhelming that the transfer of money from pe kin to aramanda was designed at least in part to disguise or conceal the nature source ownership or control of the funds as to the control ofthe funds the testimony was clear that the 250000 was controlled by rezko levine testifiedthat he agreed to provide the 250000 to rezko levine further testified that rezko providedthe name of aramanda as the person who rezko wanted to obtain the 250000 levine thenpassed aramandas name to pekin in addition levine and pekin both testified about rezkos forceful request that the second 125000 payment to aramanda be accelerated recordedconversations played at trial confirmed rezkos role in controlling the movement of the moneyand his demand that the second 125000 payment be moved from july 2004 to april 2004 the evidence was equally overwhelming that rezko engineered the transactions with aramanda to conceal the nature of the 250000 fraud money and rezkos ownership andcase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 14 of 372rezkos citation to cuellar v united states 128 sct 1994 2008 does not assist his argument the cuellar opinion stands for the unremarkable proposition that merely hiding money during its transportation is insufficient to violate the money laundering statute rtather 15control of the fraud money again it was rezko who provided aramandas name as the person to take control of rezkos 250000 in order to conceal the fact that pekin was simplytransferring rezkos fraud profits to ar amanda rezko levine pekin and aramanda participated in obtaining and executing sham consulting contract that made it appear thataramanda and pekin had legitimate business relationship when in fact such businessrelationship existed the sham consulting contract introduced into evidence at trial made itappear that pekin and aramanda were working t ogether as consultants and that pekin would pay aramanda for his help with consulting in fact there was business relationship and thecontract was simply executed to give pekin cover to transfer rezkos 250000 to aramanda infact the transfer of the money under the consulting contract made little sense since aramanda asrezko well knew had done absolutely nothing to earn the 250000 indeed there wastestimony at trial that the consulting contract was to be specifically composed to pass mustershould the government ever look into the legitimacy of the transactions in the face of the facts rezko simply argue s that not only was there evidence that rezko had any interest in the proceeds which the payment to aramanda had the effect ofconcealing but there was also evidence presented that the purpose of the payment from pekinto aramanda was to conceal or disguise any attri bute sic of the funds def mot at 11 rezko conveniently ignores the sham consulting contract and its formation as well as all of thetestimony about rezkos ownership of the 250000 and his ability to move the money frompekin to aramanda on time frame of his choosing 2case 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 15 of 37conviction requires evidence that demonstrate the defendant intended to conceal or disguise the money id at 20022005 even assuming cuellar applied to the concealment prong of the money laundering statute as noted above the eviden ce was overwhelming both through testimony and the actual admission of sham consulting contract that rezko intended to conceal the nature source control and ownership of the 250000 3 rezko brings this argument under both rule 29 and rule 33 however even rezko acknowledges that levines testimony provided direct evidence that rezko had the requisitecriminal intent and knowledge in the charged scheme see def mot at 12 that admission dooms his rule 29 motion in this regard as courts ca nnot reassess the credibility of witnesses for purposes of considering motion for judgment of acquittal see united states v griffin 194 f3d 808 816 7th cir1999 stating that for purposes of rule 29 motions courts are not to reweigh evidence or reassess the credibility of witnesses these are jury determinations to which we defer in any event for the reasons detailed below rezko s rule 29 motion on this ground fails for the same reasons as his rule 33 motion there was more than sufficient evidence of rezkos intent and knowledge to sustain the convictions 16in short the evidence was more than sufficient when viewed in the light most favorable to the government for the jury to find that the payments from pekin to aramanda executed atrezkos request were meant to conceal and disguise the fact that the 250000 was fraud moneythat belonged to rezko accordingly the cour t should not vacate rezkos conviction on counts 23 and 24 b sufficiency of evidence of rezkos criminal intent and knowledge rezko next challenges whether there was sufficient evidence of rezkos intent and knowledge to sustain his convictions on the mailwire fraud counts counts 12 48 and 11 153 as at trial rezko argues that 1 the only evidence of rezkos intent and knowing participation in the charged scheme comes from levine and that 2 levines testimony was soincredible that it cannot be the basis of conviction that argument is wrong on both counts the government proved the elements of the offense both through levines testimony and through additional witnesses tape recordings and documents further that additional evidencecase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 16 of 3717confirms and corroborates levines testimony in many significant respects as result this is not one of those exceptional instances where it would be miscarriage of justice for the juryverdict to stand the tiii recordings are particular problem for rezko both at trial and now much of rezkos attack on levines credibility stems from his alleged willingness to lie to thegovernment to get better cooperation deal and from his alleged inability to remember what hadhappened years earlier on the tiii however levine is making statements about events that hadjust transpired and without clue that he would be charged with crime in the future tellinglyrezkos instant motion spends time addressing the many incriminating statements that levinemade about rezko on the tiii or even more significantly rezkos own statements captured ontape similarly rezkos motion also fails to address the many ways in which levines testimony was corroborated by witnesses who testified about their own direct conversations withrezko rezkos statements to witnesses like joseph cari chuck hannon michael winter andthomas beck demonstrated his intent and knowing participation in the scheme independently oflevines testimony rezko has not attacked the credibility of those witnesses in this motion andwas unable to do so successfully at trial the tiii recordings and the testimony of othe r witnesses confirms that rezko played an active role in the charged scheme in particular that evidence confirms that rezko was toldabout the scheme by levine and that he took steps to help the plan succeed such as by insertingpeople to receive finders fees who had rela tionship to the underlying trs investment and by directing thomas beck to approve the mercy hospital at the april 2004 planning boardcase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 17 of 374 levine and rezko had already agreed that rezko would direct the finders fees stemming from glencoe capital and sterling so those two companies were not discussed at the meeting 18meeting thus rezkos multiple convictions are the result of both levines testimony and completely independent evidence about rezkos knowledge and intent review of the evidenceon key aspects of the scheme confirms that levine was credible when he testified about rezkosparticipation in the scheme 1 standard club rezko learned about many aspects of the scheme from levine at the april 14 2004 standard club meeting the standard club meeti ng there as levine explained at trial levine told rezko about all the potential finders fees from companies seeking investments fromtrs and the illinois state board of investment isbi that levine had arranged and proposed to share with rezko in exchange for rezkos use of his influence levine prepared roughsummary with the names of funds and how much money rezko levine and the finder ifapplicable would get from the investment fund levines list included potential trsinvestments involving llr stockwell jer inve stment mortgage holdings imh and capri capital potential isbi investment in healthpoint and the mercy hospital kickback from jacobkiferbaum 4 levine calculated that levine and rezko would each receive 39 million from the fees that levine expected would be paid by the various investment firms and mercy levines testimony about that meeting was extensively corroborated from the rest of the evidence at trial in part it was corroborated by all the actions that rezko took that furthered thescheme with respect to those payments levines testimony was also corroborated by thecase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 18 of 375 levines understanding of the conversation in the calls is provided in brackets 19recordings of his phone calls at the time in those calls levine described the standard club meeting the agreement between rezko and levine and the specifics of the companies involvedin the scheme levine went into the most detail about the scheme when he talked with robertweinstein as weinstein was longtime friend and associate who was going to play criticalrole in the scheme by receiving levines share of the finders fees and bribes thus on april 15 call 25 levine told weinstein that he had great meeting last night with rezko 5 where i got everything all ah laid out and um full steam ahead and were fair and equitable where everybody participates levine and rezko would share thefinders fees and ah full steam ahead and whatever i want on april 17 call 196 levine told weinstein how much money levine expected to make from his corrupt deals with rezko 39 million that the fees would be routed to weinstein first and that weinstein would then share the fees with levine levine ah and um ah chuckles ive got ah assuming that everything falls into place and that this and id id say that its pretty goodah ah shot of that ah of that that it will because ah tonys finewith all of it and its just question of of ah and i will havecontrol i i think i think its all doable weinstein i think thatum ah taking 2 year payment plan

its like they they can come to weinsteins company and every month they can just distribute half to you levine would get half ofthe fees that levine arranged to send to weinsteins company levine oh oh yeah this this is this isweinstein its fine but you you cause you know where this stuff islevine well what ive done is um ah um you know first of all of course this is this is all very important to steve loren because iguarantee his interests ah you know and all that and it can expandthem ah ah too i made um ah i told tony about ah ah the factthat i told him about stuff that he knew nothing about and that icould of succeeded without him but of course only for limitedperiod of time ah you know it was i think probably impressedthe hell out of him and ah and he t its its like find us whateveryou can ah and just and just do it make it happen stuart theseare all things of course that were all put together already tonysaid to on the ah on the mortgage thing imh he said he saidwell what do you what do you what do you need to do to proceed i said um your permission fuckin loved that weinstein mm hm but you know what its much better to belevine yeahweinstein up front with him because he he doesnt appear to be somebody that you have to becase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 20 of 3721levine weinstein duplicitous withlevine that thats thats exactly rightbut you know what weinstein theres things that hes asked for funds that rezkoasked levine to help even though levine would not directly profitfrom them weinstein mm hmlevine here and i said to him you know i know theres lot of people that you have to take care of weinstein mm hmlevine so i said ah ah im only uh um interested in um ah in ah uh my pursuing ah things that will be for both of our mutualinterests weinstein mm hmlevine what you bring in here and ask to do for you i is is is not my business weinstein mm hmlevine and i thought that that was an important point to makelater in the context of talking about how rezko agreed that capri capital would have to pay 2 million fee to get 220 million in trs money levine said that levine i told him rezko that thomas rosenberg then called ah ah and i said the fact of the matter is that ah theres 220 millionthere that should be worth over 2 million in fees and i said iwant you to be aware of this and ah and he said well he said youknow do whatever you want here of course then i i said that that220 i would include him rezko would share in the 2 million infees on april 21 call 328 levine talked further with weinstein about his relationship with rezko and trs and how they were making money together after discussing how some of thecase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 21 of 3722money from closing deals would go to weinstein the pair talked about rezko levine this stuff the finders fees being paid to levine nominees is just to start because ah he want ah he ah he rezko got problemmaking money with nobody knows that were makin moneyand they wanna do it weinstein he he he you know just from what you described in the thing hes smart and understands to have you as player he has he hasto share in fair and meaningful way levine well yeah but but look at it this way weinstein he he he could knock out rezko could ensure that levine was not reappointed to the trs board and i need his us and i need hispeople to get the stuff done but i brought him stuff that he didntknow existed and hes makin money weinstein its even more than that is if he if he were to knock you out and he put someone in there levine hed have money ability to do itweinstein right i mean you you you you you paid for your education you got your degree already so you know and he doesnt know if hesthere for 3 more years or 8 more you know he doesnt know whathis time frame is so right now for him to do something like thateven hes gotta say you know i could i could be stumbling aroundfor the next 2 years weinstein he rezko doesnt know how long hes gonna be therelevine abs of of course not and he wants to make as much as he can while he can those conversations confirm that rezko was told about the scheme the companies involved and his opportunity to make money in the scheme rezkos subsequent agreement toparticipate in the scheme comes not just from levines testimony but from all the evidence ofthe acts that rezko took to further the scheme both before and after the standard club meeting case 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 22 of 37232 glencoe capital rezkos actions in furtherance of the glencoe capital aspect of the scheme provide some of the strongest evidence of his criminal intent and knowledge as demonstrated by thetestimony of levine sheldon pekin elie maloof and the tiii recordings rezko directed thattwothirds of the finders fee that pekin recei ved from glencoe capital be given to joseph aramanda rezkos longtime friend and busine ss associate rezko however did not give levine aramandas name until well after glencoe capital had received its allocation from trs thus aramanda had nothing to do with helping glencoe capital receive its investments factobvious to everyone involved in the transaction levine provided the only rationale for why rezko was able to do this levine had promised that rezko could direct the fee the priorsummer and levine was willing to keep his promise to rezko in the interest of developing theirongoing criminal relationship levine and pekin both testified that levi ne gave pekin aramandas name in about february 2004 which was over 6 months after glencoe capital had received its 50 millioninvestment from trs aramanda had nothing to do with that investment pekin wanted to meet him to make sure that aramanda actually existed pekin eventually arranged to meet aramandaand made two separate payments of 125000 to aramanda aramanda never did work to justifyany payment from pekin to aramanda to conceal the nature of the transaction levine arrangedfor loren to draw up sham contract to make it appear like pekin and aramanda had alegitimate business relationship that would justify the payment of the 250000 to aramanda pekin gave the sham contract to aramanda w ho signed it pekin did not discuss or negotiate any of the terms of the contract with aramanda and aramanda did not try to negotiate any of thecase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 23 of 3724terms with pekin at trial pekin explained that an issue arose with the second 125 000 payment to aramanda in approximately late april of 2004 aramanda called pekin and said that anotherpayment was due pekin knew that he had discussed with aramanda that the second paymentwas not due until july 1 but aramanda said that he had been told that the money would be paid shortly aramanda seemed apologetic about making the request for the money in response pekin said words to the effect is christmas co ming early pekin said that the next payment was not due until july 1st and refused to make the payment early shortly after that call pekin spoke with vine levine asked why pekin was not paying aramanda and pressured pekin to make the payment levine explained at trial that he wasresponding to rezkos direction to do this on april 26 2004 call 411 levine and pekinspoke again by phone in the call levine asked pekin if he had talked to david evans aprincipal at glencoe capital about getting glencoe capital to pay pekin some of his moneyearly levine said it was critical that pekin talk to evans that day and if pekin did not talk to evans that we wont be able to do business with them rezko and aramanda anymore andthat if we dont get it finished today the payment of the remaining 125000 tonys notgonna do business anymore like that pekin then agreed that he would pay aramanda that daywithout waiting for glencoe capital to pay pekin any additional money after pekin spoke with levine pekin called aramanda and indicated that he would have check for aramanda that day aramanda agreed to come to pekins office that day to pick upthe check pekin then called levine call 43 pekin told levine that he had spoken witharamanda and that aramanda was getting the payment that day pekin and levine thencase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 24 of 3725discussed how pekin thought that the original due date for the second payment was in july pekin said that aramanda knew that the payment was now being made early because aramandacalled pekin sheepishly because he aramanda said i dont think money was due buttony asked to call in response levine indicated that the earlier request might be his faultsaying that i did tell tony it was april cause i thought it was april when the second paymentwas due within minutes of the end of call 43 levine called rezkos office two times calls45 and 412 and left message for rezko to call him later on april 26 aramanda came topekins office and pekin gave aramanda second check for 125000 thus the evidence at trial revealed that rezko controlled 250000 in profits of the scheme which was delivered at his direction to aramanda the only logical explanation for rezkos ability to control that money was that levine was working with him 3 sterling financial the evidence involving sterling financial also demonstrates rezkos criminal knowledge and intent originally rezko was going to keep share of the finders fee thatsterling financial would pay ultimately rezko decided to conceal his interest in the fee and lethis business associate michael winter receive the fee albeit through another party in anyevent the evidence from winter and tiii demonstrates again that rezko was acting in concertwith levine to help sterling financial for rezkos indirect benefit much of the evidence relating to rezkos involvement with respect to sterling financial came from winter winter originally brought sterling to levines attention after rezkointroduced winter to levine rezko had previous ly given winter detailed explanation of trs and isbi including the makeup of the various bo ards and description of who rezkos friendscase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 25 of 3726on the boards were rezko wanted winter to act as finder of funds to invest with trs and isbi winter met with rezko and daniel mahru who was rezkos business partner to discussthe finders fees for sterling they talked about splitting the fees 13 apiece but rezko said thathe should get more because he had to take care of other people including kelly winter also testified that he told rezko in the spring of 2003 that sterlings personnel wanted help with trs staff in turn levine said that rezko asked him to push sterling along and tiii recording of levine with jon bauman demonstrated that levine was pushing sterling to get through trs as result sterlings application was supposed to be presented to the trsboard at the may 2004 trs board meeting shortly before that meeting winter had conversation with rezko and chris kelly there kelly said that winter could not be named as the consultant for sterling financial becausehe shared an office with rezko and because of rezkos relationship with governor blagojevich winter suggested that he disclose the name of michael cherry to trs as the recipient of the feeand kelly and rezko agreed to this arrangement as result sterling did not disclose wintersname as the recipient of the finders fee in its application to trs again the evidence demonstrates that rezko controlled the sterling fee planned at one point to keep share of it and later wanted to hide his involvement with the deal in contrastlevine was never going to receive portion of that fee his willingness to assist sterling financial anyway is further proof that levine was working with rezko in this scheme and thus further proof of rezkos intent and knowledge 4 jer the jer aspect of the scheme provides another example of where rezkos actionscase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 26 of 3727proved his intent and knowledge there r ezko selected an individual chuck hannon to receive portion of the finders fee even though hannon had nothing to do with the underlying trs investment again the explanation for rezkos ability to insert hannon into the deal isbecause he was working with levine as with the other aspects of the scheme levinestestimony about rezkos involvement with jer is highly corroborated by other witnessesdocuments and the tiii recordings levine testified that he discussed jer with rezko for the first time at the standard club meeting and that they agreed that they would split the finders fee that jer would pay rezkoalso agreed with levine to provide the name of the consultant who would accept the fee from jer as jer was slated to get its invest ment at the may 2004 trs board meeting levine explained to rezko that there was some urgency to rezko naming the consultant on april 26 2004 call 42 levine told cari that levine had still not received the name of the consultant that jer would have to use but confirmed with cari that jer knew thatthey would have to hire consultant after that april 26 call rezko told levine that hannon would be the person who would receive the fee from jer again levines testimony about the feesplitting agreement was echoed on the tiii recordings on may 1 2004 levine spoke with weinstein call 557 about the jer fee thatlevine expected to share levine told wein stein let tell you what and what else i got you know theres commingled fund that is clos ing in in in may jer that theres 750000 fee thats going to one of tonys guys hannon and then ah ah and then half of it to contract with you later in the call levine talked about how he expected to get 700000 from cari forhelping healthpoint with isbi which money was so to go directly to weinstein levine thencase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 27 of 3728discussed the possibility with weinstein that we wont even have to mix the two contracts im gonna tell tony he keeps that one the 750000 jer money and you take the 700000 onhealthpoint hannon provided further corroboration by desc ribing his own interaction with rezko hannon confirmed that rezko directed him to talk with levine about the finders fee at that time rezko owed hannons wife fortunee massuda millions of dollars which hannon andmassuda were trying to collect from rezko hannon and rezko had previously had several discussions related to finders fees and consulting work for the state of illinois hannon toldrezko he was interested in such work and r ezko had indicated that he would have levine contact hannon about such an opportunity vine and hannon then discussed the potential finders fee and hannon said that he wanted to be involved hannon knew he would be doing nothing to earn the money from jer hannon testified that he gave updates to rezko about what was happening with him being finder and his conversations with levi ne at one point rezko told hannon that hannon would be entitled to keep 80000 of the finders fee for himself later hannon asked rezko ifhannon could have larger share of the finders fee but rezko refused hannon understood thatlevine was going to get half the fee and that rezko would decide on what happened toremainder that was left after hannon took his 80000 again rezkos control over the money demonstrates his active participation in the crime it would be inexplicable for levine to allow rezko to control what happened to the jer findersfee if levine did not believe that rezko was full participant in the scheme further as rezkoknew that hannon had nothing to do with the actual transaction rezko knew that hannon hadcase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 28 of 3729no legitimate claim to any portion of the fee rezkos refusal to give hannon any more than 80000 when he was asked demonstrates that rezko understood that hannon was not in positionto ask for anything more 5 mercy health system rezkos actions with respect to mercy health systems mercy or mercy hospital application for also confirm his knowledge and intent rezko gave the critical order tothomas beck that ensured that mercy hospital would receive its and consequently thatjacob kiferbaum would pay the bribe for the mutual benefit of rezko and levine rezkos ownwords on the tiii demonstrate why he issued the order so that he and levine could continue what we need to do eg make money through rezkos control over the planning board rezko does not appear to dispute that he was the one who stacked the planning board with five of his candidates and that he gave orde rs to the planning board via beck as to how they would vote recognizing rezkos control levine testified that he approached rezko to get his support with the mercy hospital offering share of the kickback that jacob kiferbaumwould pay levine and rezko periodically disc ussed the status of mercys application after that agreement including at the standard club meeting there levine included the mercykickback from kiferbaum among the projects that he expected would produce money for levine and rezko rezko assured levine at the meeting that rezko would use his influence to ensurethat mercy received its levine said that he learned from both rezko and beck that rezko in fact did instruct beck that the mercy hospital should be approved at the april 21 2004planning board meeting again the tiii and the testimony of other witnesses bear out levines account on aprilcase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 29 of 376 rezko suggests that levines actions on the days leading up to april 21 planning board meeting are inconsistent with rezko being aware of the kiferbaum kickback def mot at 17 this argument is misplaced for several reasons first there can be question that rezko actually issued the order that mercy hospitals be approved at that meeting rezko actually did so more than once rezko had done so prior to april 21 which is evident from the fact in levine and becks call on april 20 call 84 where beck suggests that rcy would be approved at the next meeting see transcript binder tab 17 page 1 lines 1415 r ezko then issued the order again when beck hesitated on the morning of the meeting itself fu rther levines other efforts to convince beck to move forward with the approval on april 21 as opposed to later date and to educate himselfabout the merits of mercy hospitals applicati on are hardly mutually exclusive with his belief that rezko was going to help ultimately rezko did not leave the vote to chance he directly intervened with beck to make sure that his direc tive was followed rezkos directives to the five on the planning board had always been followed in the past there was reason for rezko tobelieve anything more was necessary and in fact rezko did not have do anything further to ensure that mercy hospital received its 3019 2004 levine and beck had series of calls about the mercy application call 257 261 and 277 in the first call beck said among other things that ive got the marching ordersfrom rezko that i think you may be able to help us ah on mercy meaning that mercy would get its and our boy rezko wants us to help 6 beck also testified that rezko had in fact indicated to him that mercy should be approved beck confirmed that on the morning of the april 21 2004 planning board meetingrezko pressured beck into approving the mercy hospital suggesting that he could quit theplanning board if he did not want to approve th beck confirmed that after the meeting he went with levine to rezkos offices to di scuss the vote and that rezko indicated that he would make it up to beck on the evening of april 21 levine discussed the events of the day with weinstein and loren with weinstein call328 levine recounted the details of the mercy vote and talkedcase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 30 of 377 weinstein was an interested party becau kiferbaum was going to send the kickback payment to weinstein in the guise of phony consulting contract rezko argues that the absenceof any indication in the sham consulting contract that rezko was going to receive money issignificant def mot at 18 on the contrary it would be more surprisi ng if the sham consulting contract did spell out all the parties to the bribe 8 rezko relies on levines statement to loren in this call that rezko dont give shit to suggest that rezko did not care about the result of the mercy hospital vote def mot at 18 rezkos interpretation of that quote is flawed the actual exchange was as follows loren so what did tony think of the whole thing todaylevine he dont give shit he wanted to make sure that it got done he was grateful loren he should be royally upset that these 2 union people are are causing problems levine he he needs 5 votes he has 5 votesloren so he doesnt care transcript binder tab 22 page 16 lines 1117 in c ontext levine is indicating that rezko did not care how mercy hospital was approved rezko just wanted to make sure that it was done 31about tony and the five votes that he controlled 7 levine also described how beck threatened to resign and that none of them know that its tony and they know that tonys giving theorders later levine said that beck had one of his relatives that had been hired to preventfrom this happening tony had him do it levine also recounted that he told imad almanaseerat the critical moment that tony wants this today in call 329 levine talked to loren about the mercy vote as well again levine discussed how beck wanted to resign that nobody knows that its tony that orchestrated themercy vote that levine took beck over to r ezkos and that rezko was grateful that the mercy vote got done 8 case 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 31 of 3732finally rezko was recorded talking with levine talking about how they were running the planning board on may 18 call 1011 rez ko and levine talked about sixth planning board member dana lynn rice who they wanted to vote with the rest of rezkos voting bloc levine told rezko that levine had spoken with kelly and that levine was willing to talk to rice rezko however indicated that i rather keep it through beck rezko wanted beck to talk with rice not levine and that it should be beck communicating with the others beck should talk with the rezko voting bloc not levine rezko said that he wanted the focus of the planningboard to be on beck not levine although you and i will still do what we need to do rezkoand levine would continue to make money thr ough kickbacks at the planning board rezko explained that rice had been told to take dir ections from levine but rezko wanted levine to call rice to tell her to take direction from beck levine agreed to tell rice to follow beckslead saying that well do it the way we have been handling it in the last couple of months if rezko was merely conduit of information about what the government wanted from the planning board there was simply reason w hy anything needed to be hidden from beck rezko and levine would still do what they needed to do with respect to their efforts to profitpersonally from the planning board thus rezkos criminal role in the scheme is confirmed byhis own words ultimately the evidence of rezkos intent and knowledge came from many sources in addition to stuart levine in light of all the evidence at trial the government provided more thanenough evidence to justify the jurys verdict this is not one of the exceptional cases where amotion for new trial should be granted as result this aspect of rezkos motions should becase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 32 of 3733denied c sufficiency of the evidence on count 11 rezko moves to vacate his mail fraud conviction on count 11 on the theory that there was insufficient evidence from which any rational juror could find beyond reasonable doubtthat the charged letter at issue in count 11 was sent through the united states mails def motat 2123 in fact the trial testimony amply supported the jurys finding that the letter at issue incount 11 was mailed count 11 charged the mailing of letter from jacob kiferbaums construction company kiferbaum construction to mercy soliciting the construction contract to build hospital formercy in order to convict rezko of the mail fraud scheme charged in count 11 the jury neededto find beyond reasonable doubt that the letter fr om kiferbaum construction to mercy was sent through the united states mails the jury was instructed that in connection with whether mailing was made evidence of the habit of person or of the routine practice of an organization whether corroborated or notand regardless of the presence of eyewitnesses is relevant to prove that theconduct of the person or organization on particular occasion was in conformitywith the habit or routine practice you should consider this evidence in the samemanner that you consider all circumstantial evidence jury inst at 44 the instruction was supported by several seventh circuit cases includingunited states v keplinger 776 f2d 678 690691 7 th cir 1985 and united states v ledsma 632 f2d 670 674 7th cir 1980 in particular in keplinger the seventh circuit noted that the use of the mails may be proven by circumstantial evidence and that circumstantial proofoften consists of evidence of office practice and such testimony as to office practice is sufficient proof of mailing 776 f2d at 690 emphasis added the keplinger court rejected the defendants argument that the government had to prove that the office procedure wascase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 33 of 3734invariable and reiterated that proof of regular or usual business practice is sufficient and that it is sufficient to prove that mailing is the senders regular business practice id at 691 at trial the government presented the testimony of rhonda howard kiferbaums executive assistant at the time the kiferbaum construction letter was provided to mercy howard testified it was the routine practice of kiferbaum construction to mail letters through theunited states postal service according to ho ward kiferbaum used private couriers but only for the delivery of larger items such as brochures or blueprints while on the stand howardwas shown the kiferbaum construction letter at issue in count 11 howard testified thatalthough she did not personally type the letter the letter was standard followup letter that wasoften produced by kiferbaum construction howard testified that such letters were sent throughthe mail to prospective clients given the standard articulated in keplinger howards testimony was more than sufficient for the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the kiferbaumconstruction letter in count 11 was mailed to mercy rezkos motion suggests howards testimony was insufficient because she did not personally type the letter and the letter allegedly departed from routine practice in number ofways def mot at 21 both facts are immaterial the point of routine practice testimony isto prove circumstantially that the letter was mailed howard testified that while she did not typethe letter the letter was one that was routinely sent through the mails and it was kiferbaumconstructions practice to send such letters through the mail while the letter had certain aspectsto it that allowed howard to know she did not personally write the letter such as lack ofinitials on the letter and different way of designating carbon copy howard was clear thatthe letter was standard followup letter that was routinely sent through the mail thus whilecase 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 34 of 379rezkos reliance on united states v brooks 748 f2d 1199 7th cir 1984 is misplaced the brooks court reversed two mail fraud convi ctions as to the first count of conviction the government attempted to prove mailing had occurred because the mailed item hadbeen datestamped id at 1203 on crossexamination howev er the government witness testifying about normal business practice admitted that items r eceived from private couriers were also date stamped so that merely reviewing the datestamp could not confirm the item had been received in the mail as to the second conviction the governme nt only called witness at the company that had received the item at issue the witness could onl testify that such items were normally received through the mail but could not testify as to the practices of the sender of the item id in the instant case howards testimony was that of the sending bus iness and she was clear that it was the routine practice to mail the letter at issue in count 11 35defendant repeatedly suggests the letter deviated from normal practice howards testimony was clear that there was nothing about the letter that suggested deviation from the normal androutine business of mailing such letters 9 in sum viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government there was sufficient evidence for rational juror to find beyond reasonable doubt that the kiferbaumconstruction letter at issue in count 11 was sent through the united states mail accordinglythe court should not vacate rezkos conviction on count 11case 105cr00691 document 619 filed 09292008 page 35 of 3736iv conclusion for the reasons stated above rezkos
