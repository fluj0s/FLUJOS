our founding fathers among the infirmities of the articles of confederation was supermajority requirement for deciding such questions as coining money appropriating funds and determining the size of the army and navy as alexander hamilton declaimed in federalist 22 to give minority negative upon the majority which is always the case where more than majority is requisite to decision is in its
