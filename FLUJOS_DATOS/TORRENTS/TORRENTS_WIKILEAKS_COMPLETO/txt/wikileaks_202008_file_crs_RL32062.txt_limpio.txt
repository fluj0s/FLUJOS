2005 richard bourdon analyst in housing domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress housing issues in the 108th congress summary the major housing issue before the second session of the 108th congress was the proposed budget for the department of housing and urban development hud on december 8 2004 the president signed the consolidated appropriations act 2005 hr 4818 pl 108447 which provides 320 billion for hud this is an increase of 838 million or 27 above the fy2004 enacted level in addition under the new law huds budget is subject to an 080 acrosstheboard rescission of approximately 256 million with this reduction the increase from fy2004 to fy2005 for hud will be about 582 million or 19 budget figures discussed in this report do not reflect this rescission congress did not adopt huds controversial flexible voucher program which sought to slow spending in the section 8 program instead adding 16 billion more for the voucher program than the administrations request however to pay for this increase all other hud programs were reduced below their fy2004 appropriations levels not including the 080 rescission including the community development block grant program down 225 million home down 91 million and housing for the elderly down 27 million while the administration had proposed funding for the hope vi program the conferees appropriated 144 million the american dream downpayment act to help firsttime homebuyers requested at 200 million was funded at 50 million the administrations main focus in respect to housing has been to increase the homeownership rate for lowerincome and minority households one initiative would have allowed 150000 firsttime homebuyers year to purchase with downpayment or closing costs hr 3755 on june 3 2004 the house financial services committee passed an amended hr 3755 while the administration projected cost the congressional budget office estimated cost of 562 million over the period 20062009 see hrept 108748 the approved fy2005 hud budget did not include funding for this proposal the president also proposed an affordable housing tax credithr 839s 198 which would encourage builders to fix up for sale thousands of abandoned homes in inner cities this proposal was not approved numerous additional housing related bills were before the 108th congress hr 1102 would create

second session of the 108th congress centered around the administrations proposed fy2005 budget for the department of housing and urban development hud and the congressional response the budget included efforts by the administration to restructure and limit spending on the section 8 housing voucher program to defund the hope vi program and initiatives to increase homeownership for lowerincome households other congressional interests included 1 legislation to combat predatory lending 2 proposals to establish national affordable housing trust fund 3 concerns that landlords could raise rents rapidly on more than 100000 affordable housing units in the years ahead as hud subsidized mortgages are paid off 4 samaritan initiative to help end long term homelessness 5 legislation to create new more vigilant supervisor for governmentsponsored enterprises and 6 and omnibus tax bills that would repeal the tenyear rule in the mortgage revenue bond program for firsttime home buyers major policy issue the increasing number of renters and owners with severe affordability problems1 with mortgage rates continuing near 40year lows home sales have been robust and housing prices have increased sharply in many areas the national association of realtors reported that the median price of an existing singlefamily home increased to 188200 in october 2004 10 increase in the past 12 months and the biggest 12month jump since july 1987 many existing homeowners have benefitted from rising equity however higher housing prices are causing problems for moderate income households both wouldbe homebuyers and those who rent about 40 of renters live in singlefamily homes the 2003 report the state of the nations housing by harvards joint center for housing studies found that staggering three in ten us households have affordability problems the report found that fully 143 million households are severely costburdened spending more than 50 of their incomes on housing and another 173 million are moderately cost burdened spending 3050 of their incomes on housing some 93 million households live in overcrowded units or housing classified as physically inadequate 1 housing costs that account for more than 30 of lowincome familys adjusted income is considered an acceptable cost burden under most hud assisted programs for example most hud lowincome housing programs require participants to pay 30 of their adjusted income towards rent crs2 interestingly the joint center report found that for the first time ever more homeowners are costburdened than renters while there has been surge in lower income homeowners over the past five years many owners are having trouble paying their housing costs as property taxes and other costs increase at faster rate than expected others moderateincome owners have lost jobs or have only been able to find parttime work the percent of fha insured mortgages that were delinquent 30 days or more stood at 1222 at the end of the third quarter of 2004 very high rate before the year 2000 the delinquency rate had never been as high as 9 along with the growing affordability problems faced by homeowners and homebuyers very low income renters also face difficulties in many cases the rents they can afford to pay are not enough for landlords to cover the cost of utilities property taxes and maintenance however only about third of renters in the bottom fifth of the income distribution receive rental assistance study released in december 2004 by the us conference of mayors sodexho hunger and homelessness survey 2004 showed that the number of homelessness continued to rise in major american cities over the last year and that the lack of affordable housing was the leading cause identified by city officials others believe this shortage is reducing the chances that welfare recipients will be able to achieve economic selfsufficiency lowerincome households must often make long and expensive commutes to their jobs because they cannot afford to live near their work the lack of affordable housing also makes it difficult for employers to find help for low paying jobs as retail salespersons home health aides child care workers preschool and kindergarten teachers and many who work at hospitals nursing and retirement homes many local officials say that newly hired teachers firefighters and police officers are finding it increasingly difficult to live near their job the 2003 joint center report concluded that progress in tackling the nations housing challenges has stalled with an fy2005 hud budget increase 19 of less than the rate of inflation 35 for the most recent 12 months and cuts to most programs housing advocates fear that housing problems will only get worse hud budget for fy2004 pl 108199 on january 23 2004 the president signed the consolidated appropriations act 2004 pl 108199 which funded numerous federal agencies including hud the senate had passed this bill on december 22 2003 hr 2673 and the house on december 8 2003 the fy2004 hud budget figure of 312 billion which includes the 059 across the board rescission approved by congress was about 184 million above the fy2003 enacted level highlights included housing certificate fund provided with 193 billion significant increase from the previous year but with incremental vouchers hanf housing assistance for needy families public housing reinvestment samaritan and colonias initiatives not approved large reduction for hope vi at 149 million compared to 570 million in fy2003 home funded at 20 billion with 87 million for administrations american dream downpayment initiative crs3 near level funding for public housing capital and operating programs together at just under 63 billion homeless programs received 126 billion up about 40 million community development block grants funded at about 49 billion near level funding with fy2003 for more details on housing issues in the hud budget for fy2004 see crs report rl31804 appropriations for fy2004 va hud and independent agencies note there have since been some minor revisions in the budget figures in this report administration seeks to refocus major hud programs during the past several years the administration has sought through its hud budget proposals to change the direction of several major housing programs for variety of reasons the cost of the rental housing voucher program has increased much more rapidly than the overall inflation rate particular concern expressed by the congress in the fy2004 consolidated appropriations conference report hrept 108401 and in the administrations proposed budget for fy2005 the administration has also stated that too often hud programs address symptoms rather than focus on the root causes of lowincome households difficulties in finding affordable housing rather than increasing the hud budget which will continue to become increasingly difficult in the immediate years ahead due to large deficits the administration has stated that better approach for helping more lower income households is to make existing programs work more efficiently insuring that correct incentives are in place both for management and tenants similar to proposals in the fy2004 budget the proposed fy2005 budget sought to promote marketbased operations which would encourage public housing agencies to control costs this approach also means removing confusing and restrictive federal regulations that may prevent state and local governments from developing creative and efficient approaches to their particular concerns by getting housing program administrators focused on ways to increase the selfsufficiency of the assisted tenants and by offering them chance to accumulate financial assets through homeownership the administration asserts that lowerincome households will have better chance of moving into the social and economic mainstream and ending their need for federal rental housing assistance this would free up resources so that other needy families could be assisted supporters of this approach point to the 1996 welfare reform which sharply reduced welfare rolls critics have viewed the administrations proposals as designed to further defund hud programs and reduce the federal governments involvement in subsidized housing for lowincome people housing advocates point to the end in fy2001 of the 310 million public housing drug elimination grant program the 250 million shortfall in public housing operating funds in fy2002 and the proposal not to fund the hope vi program in the proposed budgets for fy2004 and fy2005 in addition the administrations housing voucher proposals have been viewed by some as first step in financially downsizing and weakening the program that many consider the most successful of all federal lowincome housing programs critics also note that while welfare reform moved people from welfare to work thereby improving their selfsufficiency it did not necessarily increase their incomes crs4 table 1 department of housing and urban development appropriations fy2001 to fy2005 net budget authority in billions fy2001 fy2002 fy2003 fy2004 fy2005 2848 3015 3100 3120

proposed hud budget on november 20 2004 the house and senate passed the consolidated appropriations act 2005 hrept 108792 hr 4818 the president signed pl 108447 on december 8 2004 hud funded at 3204 billion up 838 million or 27 above the enacted level in fy2004 not including rescission of 080 also included in pl 108447 the proposed flexible voucher program not approved with 16 billion more for the section 8 program 20226 billion than the requested level 18466 to pay for the increase in section 8 vouchers all other hud programs were reduced below their fy2004 appropriations levels including the community development block grant program down 225 million home down 91 million housing for the elderly down 27 million and housing opportunities for people with aids down 11 million hope vi provided with 144 million down 5 million from fy2004 rescissions call backs of previous budget authority of 232 billion including 158 billion from the housing certificate fund section 8 and 675 million from rental housing assistance accounts the american dream downpayment assistance initiative received 50 million considerably less than the administrations 200 million request the major budget issues nearly 80 of the hud budget goes to support the section 8 and public housing programs more than 254 billion of the 320 billion agency total these are the areas where the major budget and program issues occurred during the 108th congress section 8 voucher reform in both its fy2004 and fy2005 budget requests the administration proposed major reforms of the section 8 housing choice voucher program designed to reduce costs in the program and eliminate most of the current program rules and regulations in fy2004 the administration proposed to convert the section 8 voucher program into block grant to the states states opting to participate would have received fixed budget based on prior years allocations and the flexibility to run their programs outside of many of the current program rules the proposal titled housing assistance for needy families hanf was introduced in both the house hr 1841 and the senate s 947 but further action was taken hanf received strong opposition from lowincome housing advocates and pha groups who feared that hanf would erode the size of the current program and not serve the neediest families the consolidated appropriations act 2004 signed by the president on january 23 2004 also did not include this proposal crs6 the flexible voucher program fvp proposed in the presidents fy2005 budget for hud would have converted the current housing voucher program into block grant to the local public housing agencies phas rather than receiving funding based on the pervoucher costs of the program phas would have received fixed amount of money annually to spend with most of the regulations on how to spend it eliminated the administration argued that fvp would save almost 2 billion dollars in fy2005 and would provide phas with the regulatory relief that they have sought for many years fvp was vigorously opposed by lowincome housing and pha advocacy groups who argued that it did not contain sufficient protection against erosion in funding or enough protection for very low income families fvp was never introduced legislatively and was not enacted in the fy2005 appropriations bill for more details see crs report rl31930 section 8 housing choice voucher program funding and related issues and crs report rl32284 an overview of the section 8 program pha budget calculation changes in the voucher program in the hud funding bills enacted for fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005 congress made changes to the way that it provides funds to the phas who administer the section 8 voucher program prior to fy2003 phas were funded based on the total number of vouchers they were authorized to lease in year and the average cost of those vouchers in fy2003 phas were funded based on the number of vouchers they could reasonably be expected to use rather than their authorized level and their cost as reported in the most recent quarterly data they had submitted to hud this had little practical impact on phas as they were still permitted to use up to their authorized number of vouchers and still receive payment in fy2004 phas were again funded based on the number of vouchers they could reasonably be expected to use but the cost of those vouchers was fixed at the august 1 2003 level plus an inflation adjustment practically this meant that phas could use up to their authorized number of vouchers but if the cost of those vouchers went above last years cost plus inflation then the pha would not be reimbursed by hud for those increased costs phas were notified of this change in hud notice issued april 22 2004 and many were faced with new fixed budgets that were lower than the actual costs that they were incurring this led to some phas reducing rents paid to landlords freezing vouchers rather than reissuing them when families left the program and in some cases recalling vouchers from families who were searching for housing but had not yet found unit the fy2005 appropriations law continued the trend of capping pha costs under the law agencies in fy2005 are to be funded based on the average number of vouchers being used and their average costs plus inflation as of may june and july 2004 unlike previous years phas are not able to receive additional funding if they are able to increase the number of vouchers being used up to their authorized level instead their funding is capped at the number of vouchers they were using in the third quarter of fy2005 again in fy2005 if the actual costs of phas vouchers are higher than the mayjuly average plus inflation then the pha will not receive reimbursement from hud for those extra costs crs7 all of the funding changes but especially the fy2004 and fy2005 changes have led to concerns among lowincome housing advocates and pha advocacy groups that the section 8 voucher program is being eroded and slowly converted to block grant program congressional appropriators in conference reports have reiterated that the measures undertaken are designed to control rapidly rising costs in the program for more details see crs report rl31930 section 8 housing choice voucher program funding and related issues and crs report rl32284 an overview of the section 8 program public housing issues there are about 125 million units of public housing worth an estimated 90 billion in the united states many elected officials and advocacy groups view the public housing stock as national asset that provides last resort social safety net for the most disadvantaged and poorest households they believe it needs to be well maintained and protected particularly since it is so difficult and controversial to find new sites for affordable housing however the administration and others believe the current public housing program lacks the marketbased incentives that are necessary for efficient operations they point to number of big city public housing authorities that have been taken over by hud because of mismanagement and corruption furthermore critics of public housing argue that unlike portable vouchers public housing can trap families in areas of high poverty crime and little opportunity current issues involve the desire both to protect the stock of public housing and ensure that it is well managed but also to reorient the perception of the program from one of longterm even generational housing to temporary assistance the administration proposed new voluntary graduation bonuses initiative to move program participants away from dependency the approved fy2005 hud budget pl 108447 appropriated 10 million to provide bonus funding for phas that assist families moving away from dependence on housing assistance programs the future of hope vi the hope vi program created in 1992 provides grants to phas to demolish or rehabilitate severely distressed public housing and replace it with mixed income communities initially envisioned as 10year effort to replace the 100000 worst units of public housing the hope vi program has sparked both praise and criticism supporters including many members of congress from across the political spectrum point to the programs ability to transform distressed communities often attracting not only middleincome families but also new businesses schools and cultural resources critics raise concerns that hope vi developments take too long to complete cost too much eliminate many more units of public housing than they replace and displace too many residents citing several of these concerns the administration proposed new funding for hope vi in both fy2004 and fy2005 congress responded by funding hope vi in both fy2004 150 million and fy2005 144 million notable reduction from the programs fy2003 funding level 570 million and reauthorizing the program through fy2006 pl 108 186 this new law requires that the selection criteria for awarding hope vi grants consider the extent to which the plan for using hope vi funds minimizes the permanent displacement of current residents of the public housing site who wish to remain in or return to the revitalized community it also authorizes new form of crs8 hope vi grant to be used to fund the redevelopment of distressed main streets in small communities for more details see crs report rl32236 hope vi background funding and issues how best to maintain public housing it is estimated that the nations public housing units need 2022 billion in capital repairs with new needs accruing at the rate of 23 billion annually in huds fy2004 budget request the agency proposed program to allow phas to convert some public housing units to project based voucher assistance wishing to tie federal assistance more closely to individual projects rather than providing phas with lump sum annual capital grant for all their projects as is now done along with new federal loan guarantees the stream of voucher subsidies would make it more possible for phas to turn to the private sector for rehabilitation loans pledging the projectbased voucher revenues as collateral in addition in the fy2004 proposal after receiving voucher assistance for year tenant at the project could take the voucher and move elsewhere if they chose to allowing families to move to areas of lower concentrations of poverty and greater economic opportunity hud said this initiative would make public housing more like privately owned rental housing with more marketbased decisions about operations and maintenance because there are often long waiting lists to get into public housing tenants now may hesitate to leave even when the service and conditions are less than desirable the administration said that by allowing more tenants to leave with vouchers if so desired phas could longer take tenants occupancy for granted there would be incentives to operate competitively the presidents proposal was not adopted for fy2004 the conferees cited the number of phas who currently leverage private financing without the presidents proposed program highlighting baltimore chicago and philadelphia in particular some housing organizations and phas are concerned that the administrations encouragement to borrow in the private market for capital improvements is an untested experiment that could lead to serious financial difficulties for phas and the potential loss of large amounts of the nations lowcost housing stock the administration proposed in its fy2005 budget submission new freedom to house public housing reform demonstration program that would grant up to 50 phas the ability to combine the use of capital and operating funds to set locally determined rent structures and to free themselves from many of the administratively burdensome requirements of federal reporting the phas in the demonstration would be compared with 50 other phas serving as control group there would be rewards for superior performance for those participating in the demonstration neither the house senate nor the final version of the fy2005 hud funding bill included the freedom to house demonstration crs9 national affordable housing trust fund housing trust funds are public accounts established by legislation or resolution to receive specific revenues which can only be spent on housing the most important feature of housing trust fund is that it receives ongoing revenue from dedicated sources of funding such as taxes or fees according to the housing trust fund project more than 300 housing trust funds have been established by cities counties and states estimates of how much these trust funds are now spending for affordable housing are sketchy some say more than 500 million year although large majority of the spending is likely being made by small number of the largest trust funds while housing trust funds use about three dozen sources of revenue real estate transfer fees and direct appropriations are the primary source of funds hr 1102 and s 1411 similar but not identical bills were introduced in the th 108 congress to establish national affordable housing trust the trust fund in the treasury of the united states hr 1102 had 214 mostly democratic cosponsors the goal of both bills would be to produce rehabilitate and preserve at least 1500000 affordable housing units over the next 10 years creating tens of thousands of jobs that supporters say could not be exported or be outsourced the national trust would be financed by using profits generated by federal housing programs to fund additional housing activities without supplanting existing housing appropriations the fund would focus on the production of rental housing for families with the greatest need in mixed income settings and in areas where families could gain access to the greatest economic opportunities hr 1102 most of the grants made by the trust fund to state and local governments would be required to be used for rental housing for extremely low income families not less than 45 of grant amounts and for minimum wage income families not less than 30 of amounts up to 25 of the funds could be used for rental housing and homeownership assistance for families with incomes up to 80 of the greater of the median family income of the local area or of the state source of funds under hr 1102 the trust fund would be established and an amount would have been appropriated annually to the trust fund equal to the amount in the fha mutual mortgage insurance mmi fund that exceeds the legally required 2 capital ratio the economic value of the fund divided by the amount of insurance in force each year and the amount in the government national mortgage association that exceeds the funds necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of the agency as determined by the hud secretary distribution of funds of the total amount of funding available each year 40 would go to states and 60 to participating local jurisdictions pjs each state would receive at least 10 of the total annual funds designated for states formula would be established by the secretary for allocating assistance to states and pjs based on comparison of the relative needs of eligible recipients and would include the following factors crs10 the percentage of families living in substandard housing paying more than 50 of their annual income for housing costs and having an income at or below the poverty line the cost of developing or carrying out rehabilitation of housing and counties that have extremely low vacancy rates or extremely old housing in order to receive its annual trust fund allocation an eligible state or pj would have to make matching contribution from certain designated nonfederal sources in general eligible states or pjs would receive an allocation equal to four times their matching contribution only funds from the following sources could be used for the matching requirement 50 of funds from low income housing tax credits 50 of funds from mortgage revenue bonds and taxexempt bonds 50 of grants under the community development block grant and the home program 50 of projectbased housing voucher assistance 50 of funds from the rural housing assistance program federal state or local amounts from the temporary assistance for needy families program and general state revenue any state or local government revenue not derived from federal sources including any state tax revenue there would be 50 reduction in the matching requirement for recipients in fiscal distress and 100 reduction for those in severe fiscal distress use of trust fund assistance by recipients once eligible recipients states and participating local jurisdictions received funds they would in turn distribute grants to eligible entities or subrecipients these could include any public or private nonprofit or forprofit entity unit of general local government regional planning entity or any other entity engaged in the development rehabilitation or preservation of affordable housing as determined by the secretary the hud secretary would establish dollar limits per unit for grant amounts that could be used for eligible activities grant assistance could be provided in the form of capital grants noninterest bearing or lowinterest loans or advances deferred payment loans guarantees and other forms approved by the secretary appropriations would be authorized for section 8 projectbased vouchers for units assisted under this act for families that would otherwise pay rents that exceeded 30 of their adjusted income s 1411 with 22 cosponsors this bill is similar to hr 1102 however under s 1411 the trust fund would be financed by the amount in the fha mutual mortgage insurance mmi fund that is above what is necessary to maintain 3 capital ratio see above source of funds for hr 1102 for details under s 1411 75 of the grants would have to be used for the development of affordable housing for rent by extremely lowincome families and 25 would have to be used for rental crs11 housing or for homeownership for lowincome families threequarters of money from the trust fund would be given as matching grants to states and local governments through formula based on the need for housing with similar matching requirements by state or local governments from nonfederal resources as in hr 1102 the remainder would be awarded by hud through national competition to nonprofit intermediaries assisted housing would have to remain affordable for 40 years issues and concerns the administration does not support national trust fund for the construction of projectbased assistance they point to the very high national rental vacancy rate of 101 reported by the census bureau in the third quarter of 2004 just short of the highest level since the census bureau began tracking it in 1960 the highest was 104 in the 1st quarter of 2004 housing advocacy groups say however that most of these units are out of the price range of lowincome households even with vouchers or are not in areas that can be reached by public transportation the administration also cites the existing 47 billion year fy20005 lowincome housing tax credit program that provides financial support for an estimated 100000 new and rehabilitated units year trust fund advocates respond that the tax credit program is targeted at renters with incomes of 5060 of the local area median while trust fund units would generally be directed at households with extremely low incomes those with incomes at or below 30 of the local area median the administration also points to several other hud programs including the home program that has supported the construction or rehabilitation of more than 334000 affordable rental units since 1992 the hope vi public housing program is also being used to fund construction and rehabilitation of rental housing although as noted above the administration did not request funding for this program for fy2004 nor for fy2005 again however critics argue that very few of the rental units constructed or rehabilitated under these other federal programs have been targeted at extremely lowincome households potential loss of hudsubsidized rental housing in january 2004 the general accounting office gao2 completed study for the house committee on financial services multifamily housing more accessible hud data could help efforts to preserve housing for lowincome tenants gao 0420 it found that over 101000 households in buildings with hud subsidized mortgages are at risk of paying higher rents or being displaced over the next ten years as these loans mature and landlords have the option of leaving the program since there are requirements to protect the tenants these vulnerable rentrestricted units are generally affordable to households with incomes of 80 of the local area median or less and are specific units under the section 202 section 221d3 bmir below market interest rate and section 236 programs that do not receive rental assistance owners are not required to notify tenants when propertys mortgage is about to mature whether property owners will continue to serve lowincome renters depends on number of factors including the goals of the owners the condition of 2 the general accounting office was renamed the government accountability office effective july 2004 crs12 the property and incomes in the neighborhood for example units in areas undergoing gentrification are particularly vulnerable the gao report found that number of state and local housing agencies could offer tools and incentives to keep properties affordable after mortgage maturity but that about threequarters of those who responded to the gao survey do not track the maturity dates of hud mortgages on july 20 2004 the housing and community opportunity subcommittee of the financial services committee head hearing on the gao report number of housing organizations testified on various proposals that could be used to encourage the preservation of these units including tax incentives to owners if they kept the properties affordable to low income tenants several bills were introduced in the 108th congress to prevent the loss of privately owned low and moderateincome rental units with expiring federal subsidies hr 3485 the affordable housing preservation tax relief act of 2003 would have authorized states to allocate preservation tax credits to owners of affordable housing properties who are willing to sell those properties to new owners committed to preserving them for lowincome use s 2692 the affordable housing preservation act of 2004 would have established program of matching grants to states and localities to help preserve affordable housing grants would be awarded based on number of factors including the number of affordable units at risk in particular area and the difficulty residents would have in finding adequate available and decent housing if displaced similar bill hr 445 the housing preservation matching grant act of 2003 would have authorized the secretary of hud to make grants to states to supplement assistance for the preservation of housing for lowincome families hr 4679 the displacement preservation act of 2004 would have authorized the use of 675 million in unspent housing funds to help preserve section 236 and section 221d3 projects the presidents fy2005 hud budget called for the rescission of the 675 million the house appropriations committee report july 22 2004 said that the committee recommends this rescission with reservations because these funds will need to be restored in future years to fund these contracts while the committee has adopted this rescission proposed in the budget in order to avoid significant cuts in departmental programs the committee believes it is imprudent for the department to propose additional rescissions from funding required to fulfill existing longterm contracts in the future the fy2005 hud budget approved by congress pl 108447 contained the 675 million rescission increasing homeownership for lower income households the national homeownership rate stood at 690 at the end of the 3rd quarter of 2004 near the record high of 692 reached at the end of the 2nd quarter of 2004 despite major gains in recent years table 2 below shows that homeownership rates crs13 for lower income and minority households remain significantly lower than the rate for whites there are number of reasons for these lower rates minorities have lower incomes than whites and larger percentage live in central cities both of which make it more difficult to find desirable home to purchase many larger cities have thousands of decrepit boardedup homes in distressed neighborhoods but the purchase and rehabilitation of individual units is rarely an option for lower income buyers without the help of community development corporation or some similar organization see table 3 for differences in homeownership rates by area for variety of reasons many lower income households have poor credit records which makes obtaining mortgage more difficult more expensive or impossible table 2 homeownership rates by household category household type annual 1994 3rd quarter 2004 white nonhispanic 698 761 black 424 484 hispanic 403 487 households with family 785 840 incomes greater than or equal to the median family income households with family 481 527 incomes less than the median family income source table prepared by the congressional research service crs based on data from the us census bureau while discrimination in mortgage lending and in the sale of homes has been reduced over the past decade it is still considered to play significant factor in the lower rate of homeownership for minorities the main homeownership tax incentives the mortgage and property tax deductions provide substantial housing assistance to uppermiddle and high income homeowners but are of little use to those in the bottom half of the income distribution housing analysts have long pointed out that change from the current tax deduction to tax credit would help put lower income homebuyers on more level playing field since under progressive tax rate structure tax deduction favors those with higher incomes the administration has made increasing homeownership for lower income groups the centerpiece of its housing policy in testimony before the house committee on financial services subcommittee on housing and community opportunity on april 8 2003 then hud secretary martinez stated that homeownership offers minorities the best opportunity to accumulate wealth that can later be used for education to start business or to take advantage of other opportunities that may not be available to those without financial assets others crs14 believe that increased homeownership can help economically distressed neighborhoods to stabilize and revitalize themselves the administration has proposed number of homeownership initiatives over the past several years including the american dream downpayment initiative singlefamily affordable housing tax credit and for fy2005 new zero downpayment program and fha subprime loan product these are summarized below administrations homeownership proposals american dream downpayment program on december 16 2003 the president signed pl 108186 s 811 the american dream downpayment act that authorizes the downpayment assistance program the hud secretary may award grants to state and local governments to assist lowincome families who are first time homebuyers with incomes at or below 80 of the local area median income funds will be allocated to jurisdictions based on the percentage of the national total of lowincome households residing in rental housing in the participating jurisdiction the law authorizes 200 million for each fiscal year from 2004 through 2007 up to 20 of the grant funds may be used to provide assistance to the firsttime homebuyers for home repairs downpayment assistance to families is limited to not more than the greater of either 6 of the purchase price of the home or 10000 the consolidated appropriations act 2004 provided 87 million for this program the administration estimated that grants would average 7500 per homebuyer thus 87 million would assist about 11600 buyers per year an interim rule was published in the federal register on march 30 2004 at pp1675816761 the approved fy2005 budget pl 108447 provides 50 million for the program considerably less than the 200 million requested by the administration zero downpayment program hr 3755 the fy2005 hud budget request contained new zero downpayment program for firsttime buyers who could purchase singlefamily homes without any funds since settlement costs could be rolled into the mortgage for example buyer purchasing 100000 house with 3000 of settlement costs could obtain 103000 mortgage the administration estimates that 150000 buyers year could benefit from this program about 40 of them minorities the 50 higher mortgage insurance premium for buyers would produce 180 million in net offsetting receipts for hud it would make money for hud the house financial services subcommittee on housing and community opportunity held hearings on the bill on march 24 2004 there was general support for the proposal but also concerns and cautions expressed discussed below in homeownership policy issues on may 5 2004 the subcommittee passed an amended hr 3755 adding number of consumer protections and safeguards for huds federal housing administrations fha mortgage insurance program prepurchase counseling would be crs15 required by buyers and they would have the option of receiving foreclosure prevention counseling there would be limit on the amount hud could charge for the mortgage insurance premium and the number of loans could not exceed 30 of all loans insured by the fha in the previous year the program would be ended if more than 35 of the mortgages are foreclosed in the preceding 12 months otherwise the program would sunset end on september 30 2011 the consolidated appropriations act 2005 did not provide funding for this proposed program new fha subprime loan product new fha mortgage insurance product was also proposed to help families that due to poor credit records must often rely on highcost subprime loans or who are unable to borrow at all existing homeowners could use the program to maintain their home and others to purchase new home it would reward creditrisk borrowers who make timely mortgage payments and is expected to help 60000 families year selfhelp homeownership opportunity shop the administration proposed to expand the shop program setaside within the community development block grant program by reaching out to faithbased or other organizations to help more low income families become homeowners under shop grants are made to national and regional nonprofit organizations such as habitat for humanity homebuyers must contribute significant amounts of volunteer labor to the construction or rehabilitation of the property the consolidated appropriations act provided 27 million for fy2004 the fy2005 budget requested 65 million and was expected to help produce 5200 new homes nationwide the consolidated appropriations act of fy2005 provides 25 million housing counseling counseling helps families learn about the process of buying home and how to avoid predatory lending practices it also helps homeowners avoid foreclosure during periods of financial stress 40 million was provided for counseling in fy2004 as setaside within the home program the fy2005 budget requested 45 million for separate housing counseling program the conferees provided 42 million but not as separate account singlefamily affordable housing tax credit the administration has proposed homeownership tax credit to stimulate the production of homes that are affordable to lower income households and to help revitalize distressed communities introduced as hr 839s 198 it is modeled after the popular low income housing tax credit for rental housing at the end of the 108th congress the bills had more than 300 cosponsors the ownership tax credits would provide tax credits to be taken by homebuilders developer or investor partnership over five years to encourage the rehabilitation of existing properties including abandoned housing in central cities or new construction of about 40000 affordable singlefamily homes year in urban or rural areas credits would be allocated to state housing credit agencies on the basis of population 180 per capita in the first year and indexed to crs16 inflation thereafter state agencies would award firstyear credits to singlefamily housing units in project located in census tract with median income equal to 80 or less of the area median income the present value of credits determined on the date of qualifying sale could not be more than 50 of the cost of constructing new home or rehabilitating an existing property the homeownership credit was projected to cost 25 billion over 20052009 homeownership policy issues an increasing number of housing advocacy organizations and analysts are expressing concern that the administrations focus on homeownership is unbalanced3 and while housing industry analysts deny there is housing bubble growing number of analysts outside of the industry say that home purchases are risky today particularly for lower income families who will be least able to adjust to likely price corrections4 critics say that huds policy should have more emphasis on maintaining or increasing the choice of housing available including rental housing the fdic outlook spring 2004 federal deposit insurance corporation cautioned lenders that highly leveraged homeowners those who have purchased in recent years with very small downpayments with subprime and adjustablerate mortgages may become stretched too much if interest rates start to rise and local home prices decline homeownership may not be the best wealthbuilding strategy says woody widrow project director of the texas individual development account network being renter and owning business or saving money to send your kids to college may be better strategy5 some also argue that without cautious and thoughtful homeownership program that avoids concentrations of lowerincome homebuyers in lowerincome neighborhoods potential benefits to buyers will be minimized for example several recent studies have found that homeownership has positive effects on childrens development however the positive effects of homeownership on children are weakened in distressed neighborhoods especially those that are residentially unstable and poor thus helping lowincome families purchase homes in good neighborhoods is likely to have the best effects on children6 harm can be done to both lowerincome buyers and the neighborhoods where the homes are frequently purchased if there are high default rates some applaud hud and others in the housing industry for giving more attention to increasing the financial literacy of lowerincome households but others would like more efforts to improve the credit record scores fico of these households before they buy first home low scores result in higher mortgage rates being charged 3 the crisis in americas housing confronting myths and promoting balanced housing policy

homeownership for the poor in distressed neighborhoods does this make sense housing policy debate vol 13 2002 crs17 prepurchase counseling has greatly increased in recent years and has been shown to be helpful as noted above the consolidated appropriations act 2005 provides 42 million for huds major housing counseling program up from 40 million in the previous year almost all financial advisors recommend that households have at least three months and preferably six months of liquid assets available to cover potential financial setbacks lower income households are most vulnerable to financial setbacks many are households who have never been able to accumulate any savings who may have poor health and be without health insurance and have little or financial knowledge about budgets mortgages and home repair contracts they may be especially vulnerable to layoffs and variety of financial and housingrelated scams some observers are uneasy with the administrations proposed zero downpayment program initiative while most who testified on the zero downpayment initiative hr 3755 before the house financial services subcommittee on housing and community development on march 24 2004 were supportive national association of realtors national association of homebuilders others raised the issue of the huge disparity between the resources the government expends to underwrite homeownership and that spent for renters low income housing coalition the national multi housing council pointed out that more than half the working families with critical housing needs are owners not renters raising questions about whether the promotion of homeownership for all households is an appropriate national goal table 3 homeownership rates by area 3rd quarter 2004 area 3rd quarter 2004 us 69 in central cities 532 suburbs 759 outside metropolitan areas 757 northeast 644 midwest 738 south 700 west 647 source table prepared by the congressional research service crs based on data from the us census bureau the mortgage bankers of america reported that 114 of all loans were in foreclosure at the end of the third quarter of 2004 high but not record other homeowners who are seriously behind in their mortgage payments are sometimes able to avoid or defer foreclosure by filing for bankruptcy huds largest homeownership program its federal housing administration fha mortgage crs18 insurance program helps about 700000 firsttime buyers each year however as noted above this program continues to operate with very high delinquency rates 1222 of borrowers at least 30 days past due in the third quarter of 2004 before the year 2000 this rate was never above 9 the senate appropriations committee wrote in its fy2003 report that in some cases and in certain neighborhoods fha has been misused to underwrite bad loans that lead to defaults and foreclosed homes contributing to neighborhood decline and destabilization and directed hud to report to the appropriate congressional committees on further actions that can be taken to protect homebuyers and communities experiencing high rates of defaults and foreclosures on fhainsured loans part of the reason for high fha foreclosure rates has been traced to poor and even fraudulent appraisers assigning high values to homes that cannot be justified november 2004 report by the government accountability report singlefamily housing huds riskbased oversight of appraisers could be enhanced concluded that hud is doing better at monitoring these appraisal firms but that it needs to do better increased homebuyer training may help to protect lowincome and minority homebuyers from another significant problem predatory lending research has shown that lowerincome and minority buyers are more likely to receive subprime mortgages with higher interest rates and higher fees often higher than can be justified by standard underwriting guidelines7 predatory lending has hurt lowerincome and minority homeowners most often stripping away home equity accumulated over lifetime when foreclosures are concentrated in certain areas as fhainsured homes often are they can pull property values down and do other damage to these neighborhoods these and other factors work against lowerincome homebuyers accumulating wealth the administrations proposed fha subprime loan product is seen as an attempt to address some of these issues other 108th congress homeowner proposals in addition to the administrations proposals variety of homeownership proposals were pending in the 108th congress hearings were held and none were reported out of committee s 875 would amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to allow an income tax credit to promote homeownership and community development very similar to the administrations hr 839s 198 hr 1913 would amend the internal revenue code to allow first time homebuyers credit for the purchase of principal residences in rural areas equal to the lesser of 10 of the home purchase price or 5000 hr 133s 846 would amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to allow deduction for premiums on mortgage insurance hr 1132 the home at last tax credit act of 2003 would provide tax credit to promote homeownership among lowincome individuals state housing finance agencies would receive annual tax credits based on the states population qualified lenders would 7 risk or race racial disparities and the subprime refinance market report of the center for community change congressional record may 1 2002 pp s363031 crs19 use the tax credits to provide belowmarket rate mortgages to homebuyers who in general have incomes of 80 or less of the local area median and who attend prepurchase homeownership counseling this is similar to the existing mortgage revenue bond program s 1175 the firsttime homebuyers tax credit act of 2003 would provide refundable credit the treasury writes check to the homebuyer if the credit is more than the firsttime buyer owes in taxes equal to 10 of the purchase price up to 6000 for joint return 3000 for single to be used for both closing costs and the downpayment the credit could be used in the year of the purchase by transferring the tax credit to the mortgage lender predatory lending predatory lending involves home mortgages mortgage refinancing home equity loans and home repair loans with unjustifiably high interest rates excessive fees balloon payments prepayment penalties and the imposition of other unreasonable and sometimes fraudulent terms by many accounts these loans have grown rapidly in minority neighborhoods in the past half dozen years frequently targeted to the elderly often stripping away wealth that may have taken owners decades or lifetime to accumulate congress has held series of hearings on predatory lending the most recent on march 30 2004 by the house subcommittees on financial institutions and consumer credit and housing and community opportunity the focus was on the nature of subprime lending and its overlap with predatory lending as one member said not all subprime lending is predatory but too much of it is despite the many hearings and the bills that have been introduced over the last few years industry consumer groups hud and other interested parties have not been able to reach consensus on what legislation is necessary to address predatory lending some financial organizations argue that more rigorous enforcement of existing federal laws would be sufficient number of government agencies justice department the federal trade commission the federal reserve hud along with the government sponsored enterprises fannie mae and freddie mac have become involved in addressing various aspects of the predatory lending issue and thus some industry groups say that additional legislation may not be necessary on the other hand some consumer groups believe there should be more education initiatives to increase financial literacy one consumer advocacy group said that predatory lending is so hard to fight because so many people are making so much money and that only comprehensive legislation can stem the problem the neighborhood reinvestment corporation nrc argues that predatory lending threatens to undo the work of many nonprofits that have worked with lenders and local governments to improve distressed neighborhoods they have worked with freddie mac to develop loan product for families that now have predatory loans the mortgage lending industry acknowledges that small number of lenders on the fringe give their industry black mark and say they are working to address the worst abuses however they caution about an overreaction with excessive regulations that could increase the costs of borrowing and make it more difficult for those with crs20 impaired credit records to get needed loans industry groups are concerned that states are passing their own predatory lending laws including california north carolina and georgia and that some are so severe that reasonable federal preemptive legislation is now desired number of bills designed to combat predatory lending were introduced in the 108th congress representative ney chair of the financial services subcommittee on housing and community opportunity introduced hr 833 bill to combat unfair and deceptive practices in the highcost mortgage market and preempt the growing number of state and local predatory lending laws hr 1663 the predatory mortgage lending practices reduction act also proposed to curtail abuses among subprime lenders and encourage efforts to resolve complaints by consumers these bills are summarized below hr 833 would have amended the truth in lending act to combat unfair and deceptive practices in the highcost mortgage market establish consumer mortgage protection board and establish licensing and minimum standards for mortgage brokers consumer protections in the bill included prohibiting single premium credit insurance prohibiting loans made without regard to the borrowers ability to repay them limiting prepayment penalties to four years rather than their current fiveyear period prohibiting refinancing during the first 12 months of the loan unless it benefits the borrower and prohibiting lenders from profiting from foreclosure by only allowing them to recoup costs the bill also included number of new disclosure requirements lenders must disclose that loan has balloon payment and that borrower is not required to have such feature in their loan lenders must report borrowers favorable loan activity to credit bureaus at least quarterly and borrowers with high cost loans must receive free copy of their credit report upon request since this bill would have preempted more stringent state and local laws the lending industry would have received protection from laws they believe raise the costs of lending and encumber the national mortgage lending market the legislation would also have barred certain frivolous lawsuits that raise the cost of lending some consumer groups opposed the bill because it would have eliminated what they view as more consumerfriendly state and local laws they claimed that this proposal would have done little to curb the worst abusivelending practices another predatory lending bill hr 1663 would have required the hud secretary to establish by regulation standards and procedures for mortgage lenders crs21 and brokers persons providing mortgage lending services or mortgage brokerage services in connection with subprime federallyrelated mortgage would have been required to be tested and certified in variety of areas including the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act the home ownership and equity protection act of 1994 and the real estate settlement procedures act creditor would have been required to make good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaint concerning improper or questionable lending practices within 60 days there would have been prohibitions against charges by lenders that were not previously disclosed to borrowers and on arbitration clauses imposed by lenders on consumers without their consent hr 1663 would also have provided grants to community development corporations to provide predatory lending education to borrowers and potential borrowers real estate settlement procedures act the major purpose of the real estate settlement procedures act of 1974 respa8 is to encourage homebuyers or homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to shop around for the best prices for settlement services also referred to as closing costs many contend that this act has failed in its purpose over the decades with many homeowners or homebuyers being overcharged or forced to buy unneeded services on july 29 2002 the administration proposed rule that would have made major changes in respa regulations to simplify and improve the process of obtaining home mortgage9 homebuyers would have the option of getting guaranteed package price including all of the required settlement services before committing funds to any lender so that they might compare this one price with others from other settlement service providers number of lenders already offer this as closing costsoption rolling the settlement costs into higher mortgage rate the analogy for the oneprice proposal is similar to walmart and target and handful of other large chain stores opening up superstore and because of its large purchasing power buying soap by the trainload and efficient operations it can lower prices and outcompete local department stores hardware stores food stores and other businesses who cannot find niche markets or adapt in other ways former hud secretary martinez said that these reforms could save americans up to 8 billion year an estimated 700 of savings per homebuyer or those refinancing mortgage but national organizations representing mortgage brokers and real estate agents that benefit financially from the lack of competition among settlement providers objected strongly some feared that under huds proposed respa rule half dozen large national lenders and real estate firms could come to dominate the settlement service business senator shelby chair of the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee said at respa hearing that the change would be significantly damaging to small businesses and representative manzullo chair of the small business committee spoke against this proposal 8 12 us c sec 2601 et seq 9 federal register july 29 2002 pp 4913449174 crs22 saying that it could bankrupt thousands of small businesses across the country10 supporters of the proposed reforms including the consumer federation of america and the national association of consumer advocates argue that under the current system it is very difficult for homebuyers to avoid being overcharged and cheated often the settlement process is scam with madeup and overlapping categories of charges that must be paid because to delay or cancel home purchase at the last minute would have even more serious financial consequences however even these consumer organizations were wary of what the final rule would contain in december 3 2003 letter to the office of management and budget omb number of consumer groups expressed concerns although for different reasons than industry groups including that they did not want the rule to facilitate predatory lending or to preempt state consumer protection laws hud has expressed frustration over the past two years at the lack of support with its respa reform proposal during congressional oversight hearings in late december 2003 hud sent final respa rule to omb for review omb had 90 days to decide whether to go forward or not if omb had signed off on it it would have then been published in the federal register and according to some reports the reforms would have been phased in over six to 12 month period however on march 22 2004 huds then acting secretary alphonso jackson withdrew the final rule he said he planned to revise the rule if necessary and repropose the rule after briefing members of congress and meeting with affected consumer and industry groups efforts to reform respa have been going on for more than 20 years and few expect genuine reforms any time soon the mortgage revenue bond program for firsttime homebuyers and the proposed repeal of the tenyear rule the housing bond and credit modernization and fairness act of 2003 hr 284s 595 with about 420 bipartisan cosponsors would have modified several provisions in the existing mortgage revenue bond mrb program for firsttime homebuyers the mrb program is provision in the tax code that provides reduced rate mortgages to firsttime homebuyers with incomes up to 115 of the local area median many states also use their programs to provide help with downpayments and closing costs states raise funds for the program by selling taxexempt bonds investors who buy these bonds do not have to pay federal income tax on the interest income they earn so they are willing to lend to states at lower interest rates at an annual cost of 12 billion in lost tax revenue to the us treasury the program serves an estimated 100000 buyers who receive reducedrate mortgages each year at cost that averages about 12000 per buyer it is not clear how many of these buyers might have been able to purchase home without the discounted mortgage 10 current respa proposal doomed housing affairs letter apr 11 2003 crs23 hr 284s 595 would have repealed the tenyear rule an obscure provision now said to be preventing tens of thousands of qualified lowerincome firsttime buyers each year from getting an affordable mrbfinanced mortgage the rule11 enacted before the mrb program was made permanent in 1993 requires states to use the mortgage payments received from homeowners to pay off the bond once the bond has been outstanding for 10 years rather than using or recycling these mortgage payments to make other loans to other firsttime buyers when homeowners sell their home and pay off their mortgage or refinance their loan these funds must also be used to pay down the bond principal the 1988 tenyear rule started having an impact in 1998 repealing the rule would allow recycling of funds and thus allow larger volume of taxexempt bonds to remain outstanding for longer period of time this change is supported by the national council of state housing agencies and the national governors association the joint committee on taxation has estimated that the repeal would cost 770 million over five years and 24 billion over 10 years those who oppose the repeal of the tenyear rule maintain that the purpose of the rule was to reduce the advantage that the mrb program has over other bond users competing for the states limited bond authority it is noteworthy that only mrbs are subject to the rule not bonds for rental housing airport construction sewage treatment facilities or various other private activity bond categories the mrb program has always had significant advantage over many other categories the uniqueness of the home mortgage program means that as homeowners make their monthly payments the money can be used to make more home loans in effect bond authority used to finance mortgages can be stretched beyond the initial amount other uses of bond authority such as for water treatment plant do not have this ability revenue from the water treatment plant would go directly to pay off the bond without any recycling opportunity thus even with the tenyear rule the mrb program maintains relative advantage over other bond programs an omnibus tax bill s 1637 which passed the senate on may 11 2004 contained provision to repeal the tenyear rule but the equivalent tax bill in the house hr 2896 did not contain this provision repeal of the tenyear rule was dropped from working families tax bill hr 1308 signed into law pl 108311 fannie mae and freddie mac government sponsored enterprises gses fannie mae freddie mac were in the spotlight during much of 2004 for questionable accounting and business practices in december 2004 securities and exchange commission audit concluded that fannie mae had overstated its income by least 9 billion leading to the resignation of its top officer and the dismissal of two other highranking administrators there now appears to be consensus on the need for more stringent regulation of the gses house financial services chairman oxley has scheduled hearings in january 2005 and andrew gray spokesman for senate banking 11 pl 100647 crs24 committee chairman shelby said recently congress puts new regulator on the fast track washington post december 20 2004 senator shelby believes that now more than ever its time to act representative richard baker chair of the house financial services governmentsponsored enterprises subcommittee has long been critic of fannie mae and freddie mac arguing that they have not been sufficiently accountable to the public he has also argued that huds office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo has been ineffective in its watchdog role of the gses hr 2575 the secondary mortgage market enterprises regulatory improvement act with 20 republican cosponsors would have abolished ofheo and created new office of housing finance supervision within the treasury to oversee fannie mae and freddie mac this new entity would establish the duties and authorities for the director provide for the public disclosure of information riskbased capital tests for enterprises and for required minimum and critical capital levels the proposed legislation included provisions for prompt corrective actions and for the enforcement of actions additional bills were introduced in 2004 that would have abolished ofheo and established new regulatory framework for the gses hr 2803 s 1508 and s 1656 in addition on april 1 2004 the senate banking committee reported legislation sponsored by chairman shelby which would have established an independent regulatory agency to replace ofheo and certain practices of the federal housing finance board one controversial part of the bill was provision that would have provided the new regulator with the power of receivership over fannie mae and freddie mac if either were to get into serious financial trouble the regulator could take over the gses and sell their assets supporters of this provision believe this would help convince investors that the government does not guarantee the debts of the gses the current belief that the government would come to the aid of the gses believing they are too big for the government to allow them to fail allows the gses to borrow funds in the capital markets at lower interest rates than their competitors housing advocacy groups oppose this provision since they think it could mean gses would have less funds to support affordable housing goals set each year by hud for sidebyside comparison of gse regulation proposals including chairman shelbys draft bill that was offered as substitute for s 1508 during the markup and passed largely along party lines on april 4 2004 see crs report rl32069 improving the effectiveness of gse oversight legislative proposals of particular interest to housing advocacy groups the shelby proposal contained requirement that fannie mae and freddie mac spend 25 of their pretax profits on capital grants to support production and preservation of low income housing another 25 would go into loan loss reserve fund to allow the gses to take greater risk in their lending to serve lower income people five percent of fannie mae and freddie macs pretax earnings for last year would have been about 1 billion the bill would have also significantly increased the gse affordable housing goals december 2003 report by the federal reserve the gse implicit subsidy and value of government ambiguity concluded that fannie mae and freddie mac provide very little help to homebuyers reducing mortgage rates by only seven basis crs25 points 1 equals 100 basis points not enough to substantially increase the homeownership rate according to the author economist wayne passmore most of the advantage the gses have in borrowing funds at lower rates in financial markets which occurs because investors incorrectly believe that the gses have implicit government backing benefits shareholders in these companies the gses dispute the findings and the chief economist of the national association of homebuilders david seiders says the results are very questionable and are in conflict with other studies samaritan
