medalia specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32599bunker busters sources of confusion in the robust nuclear earth penetrator debate summary the robust nuclear earth penetrator rnep often calle d bunker buster is at present the subject of cost and feas ibility study to determine if either of two nuclear bombs the b61 and the b83 could be modified mainly by adding heavy pointed case so as to be able to penetrate perhaps 10 meters into earth or rock this penetration would increase th weapons ability by factor of 20 to 50 to destroy hardened and deeply buried facilities the department of defense has expressed concern that potential us adversaries ar using such facilities because the 1991 and 2003 wars in iraq demonstrated that us precision conventional weapons can readily destroy facilities that are above the surface or buried at shallow depth if the study shows rnep to be feasible and afford able and if the president and congress approve rnep could move from study to development and pe rhaps deployment the rnep debate has received much ttention and spawned much confusion this report examines sources of confusion in this debate part of the difficulty in analyzing this debate is that the rnep st udy raises large and complex issues should the united states improve its ability to destroy buried targets or are there offsetting reasons not to what would be the target s for rnep and by what measures should its military effectiveness be judged how reliable are estimates of collateral damage resulting from rnep urban myths have grown up around rnep some commentators seem to combine several true statements into an erroneous one cong ress lifted the ban on rd on sub5kiloton nuclear weapons at the administrations request and nuclear earth penetrators could destroy some harden ed and deeply buried targets but it is incorrect to assume that sub5kiloton bunke r busters could destroy such targets they could not because they have insufficient expl osive force similarly kernel of truth may become transmuted through misundersta nding of science or policy or through logical but unwarranted inference into one not supported by the facts the debate involves some cl aims that are irrefutabl because they cannot be proven one way or the other for example supporters claim rnep is just study while critics fear that it will lead to development deployment and perhaps testing and use if the study finds rnep feasible and affordable the administration might press to deploy the weapon on the ot her hand the study could raise doubts about rnep and there are reasons to ques tion whether congress would approve it terminology adds to confusion protag onists debate whethe r rnep will lower the nuclear threshold and make nuclear use more likely the threshold may be seen as criteria that must be met for the pres ident to order nuclear weapon use rnep would arguably not lower this threshold because it would not change these criteria it could make nuclear use less likely if it deters actions that meet this threshold if it does not it could make such use more likely because rnep like other nuclear weapons would expand the circumstances in which these weapons might be used this report will be upda ted from time to timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32599contents c m p l i c t d i s s u s 2 f c t s m t h s n d

military topics clouds debate on these larger issues one source of confusion is simply that i ssues linked to rnep are complicated here are some examples 1 should the united states improve its ability to destroy buried targets according to report by the department of defense dod and department of energy doe the intelligence community ic suspects with reasonable certainty that there are over 10000 potential hdbts hard and deeply buried targets worldwide and their numbers will increase over the next 10 years5 rneps proponents claim that we must be able to hold these targets at risk in order to deter or if necessary defeat an enemy we may be selfdeterred from using cold war weapons the argument goes because their yield is so high they would kill an unacceptable number of civilians6 an earth penetrator of given yield would have the same effect on buried target as weapon with much higher yield detonated on the earths rface as result earth penetration greatly reduces the yield needed to destroy buried target or with higher yield could destroy buried facilities that we could not r each even with our highest yield weapons critics respond that we could use nonnuclear weapons and

target nations could thwart earth penetrators by digging deeper dispersi ng wmd stockpiles or moving leaders to undisclosed locations some critics doubt that we would use nuclear weapons at all while others fear that reduced collateraldamage weapons would make it more likely that we would use nuclear weapons critics use both arguments against rnep regarding selfdeterrenc candidate rnep weapons are the b61 and b83 bombs weapons of substantial yield so selfdeterrence may still apply critics state that development of rnep would undermine the us position that other nations should not acquire nuclear weapons8 2 what are the targets of an epw some call these weapons bunker busters but that shorthand term migh t convey the notion of world war ii style bunker is the target single ch amber buried just below the earths surface or an extensive tunnel complex inside mountain or something else are many of these facilities likely to be vulnerable to an epw 3 how would an epw affect buried targets the effects of nuclear weapon detonated in the air are easy to vi sualize everyone has seen the pictures ground shock is harder to visualize nd that may contribute to confusion over epws in trying to understand the effects and effectiveness of epws it would help to know the shape of the underg round volume within which an epw of specified yield can destroy buried targ et of specified characteristics how ground shock attenuates with distance or in different media and how an increase in yield translates into an increase in ability to destroy hdbts regarding earth penetration it would help to know if any foreseeable technical advances would enable substantially deeper penetrati on than is possible at present and consequences of deeper penetration for military effectiveness and collateral damage 4 what is military effectiveness for an epw in an attack on an hdbt must the target be destroyed or is it suffi cient to disable it and if the latter for how long in an attack on facility housin g chemical or biological agents is it enough to collapse the facility or must the weapon physically destroy these agents is it sufficient to destroy 75 pe rcent of the bioagent in facility 95 percent 5 what requirements must be met to achieve military effectiveness for the weapon these include yield accuracy depth of penetration and speed and angle of impact for the target facility they are more complicated how might likely variations in the geology above the facility affect how the shock wave would propagate how deeply is the facility buried how extensive is it how is it laid out where in the facility are the key assets that must be destroyed might they be dispersed throughout the facility does it have features to increase its hardness such as heavy springs or blast doors are there countermeasures such as granite boulders above the facility or decoy facilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32599crs4 9 see h kruger radiationneutralization of stored biological wa

on the basis of intelligence do the intelligence misses at the macro level in iran iraq north korea and libya and the failure to dete ct indian preparations for nuclear tests in 1998 reduce our confidence in intelligence at the micro level rnep modified bomb would be delivered by airc raft if the target nation got wind of the impending attack it might have time to clear key facilities of their most important assets such as leaders or wm d or to launch missiles could we be confident of our ability to deny warning to the enemy 6 how would epws affect the ability of us m ilitary personnel to carry out battle damage assessment or bda bda is important to military operations in order to determine whether target was destroyed or if it still poses threat and must be attacked ag ain clearly the army would not send soldiers into tunnel complex that had been struck by nuclear weapon and would probably be reluctant to send tr oops into complex used for production or storage of chemical or biological weapons whet her struck by nuclear or conventional epw because of the high risk however other methods may be available for bda existing sensors carri ed by airplanes or implanted in the ground might detect signs of activity coming from complex as related matter if the united states proceeds with rnep and decides that it must do bda of facilities thus attacked should new b da sensor technologies be developed in parallel with rnep development 7 perspective can affect judgments on weapon effectiveness in studies calculating the effectiveness of nuclear weapons to destroy bioagents physicist hans kruger of livermore and physi cist michael may and mathematician zachary haldeman of stanford used physicistfriendly scenarios they assumed target large area on or near the surface holding many barrels containing anthrax in aqueous solution that was vulnerable to nuclear attack and that permitted ready calculation of th effects of gamma rays neutrons and neutroninduced gammas on the target material9 the calculation was that these effects were reliably lethal to aqueous anthrax to perhaps 10 to 50 meters for 10kiloton kt weapon but jonathan cker an expert on biological weapons with the center for nonproliferation studi raised problems with the scenario10 aqueous anthrax he said would not be stored for long time because after several months the spores clump together and become much less useful militarily nation that could manufacture aqueous anthrax would therefore probably not have huge quantities sitting in warehouse waiting to be attacked but might manufacture it close to the time of use on the other hand nation that had the more advanced technology to produce dry powdered anthrax which could be stored for longer periods would need far less of the material and could easily disperse it it is thus important to have experts from several disciplines crossexamine such scenarios 8 how reliable are estimates of collateral damage b61 or b83

national nuclear security administration us nuclear continuedunderground as would be the case for rnep would cause very large amount of fallout calculation cited in the deba is that this fallout could kill many thousands of civilians11 yet there is the risk of numbers game key uncertainties affect collateral damage estimates everything from wind and rain to depth of detonation type of rock or soil population distribution ability of the population to move rapidly away from the contaminated area and how many people live near the target the number of fatalities for an attack might vary by large factor depending on something as simple as which way the wind blows related issue is whether nuclear ea rth penetrator could be designed that would reduce the radioactivity of the fallout perhaps by reducing the amount of fissile material used or adding neutr onabsorbing material to the heavy case around the nuclear explosive 9 would collateraldamage estimate s affect decision to use rnep rnep if used could cause massive colla teral damage yet some would argue president who felt rnep was the only way to stop an imminent threat to the united states might decide to use that weapon regardless of collateral damage facts myths and morphs uncle remus said that its not what you dont know that gets you in trouble its what you knows for sure that aint so many urban myths have grown up around the epw issue leading to misunderstandings uncertainties and contradictions some of these myths seem to flow from the mixing together of four true statements 1 the administrati on sought successfully in the fy2004 budget cycle to have congress lift the ban on rd on lowyield sub5kiloton nuclear weapons 2 nuclear earth penetrators could be used to destroy some hardened and deeply buried targets 3 some in dod and doe have suggested using nuclear weapons to destroy chemical and biological agents 4 it is desirable to minimize collateral damage and for attacking hdbts lowyield earth penetrator will produce less fallout than surfaceburst weapon of yield high enough to have equivalent effectiveness combining statements 1 and 4 one could conclude that rnep would be low yield weapon and that fallout from it will be totally containe d underground this is not the case john gordon then administr ator of the national nuclear security administration nnsa said in 2002 that th emphasis is on more standard yield system called an enhanced penetrator theres desi gn work going on lowyield nuclear weapons12 in june 2004 nnsa administrator linton brooks said it became part of the conventional wisdom that there were administration plans to develop new low yield weapons there are such plans13 further there is nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32599crs6 13 continued weapons policies and programs address

lowyield nucl ear earth penetrator could be contained combining statements 2 and 3 one could arrive at the idea that nuclear earth penetrators could destroy biological w eapons housed in hdbt however the intervening earth and rock would shie ld hdbts from neutrons and gamma rays produced by the detonation that would be thal to bioagent combining statements 1 and 2 one may conclude that sub5kt epws coul d destroy hdbts but much more yield would be needed combining statements 1 through 4 one may arrive at the idea that rnep is lowyield weapon that can destroy bioagent in hdbts with collateral damage many erroneous statements have ente red the debate where did they come from one possible explanation is that ke rnel of truth becomes transmuted through misunderstanding of science or policy or through logical but unwarranted inference or extrapolation morph chain here are five examples each chain ends with an asserti on made in the debate then looks backward to start with kernel of truth then posits logic train leading from the fact to the assertion penetration matters penetrati on matters not yield the key is to make nonnuclear pe netrators burrow deeper into the earth nonnuclear bunker busters can be as effective as nuclear weapons in destroying hdbts flaws yield matters there are severe limits on depth of penetration increasing depth of penetration of nuclear weapon buys

penetrators could destroy chemical or biol ogical agents in hdbts chemical and biological agents in hdbts are intended targets of rnep flaws chemical and biological agents are not targets of rnep rnep could not destroy such agents buried deep underground this last point merits emphasis becau it is frequently misunderstood the official in the office of th secretary of defense res ponsible for developing in collaboration with other agencies the hdbtdefeat mission area which includes rnep as an option stated that the goals for rneps effects have always been to defeat functions and operati ons protected by hard and deeply buried complexes16 the specific neutralization of any wmd agen t chemical biolog ical radiological or nuclear has never been part of these objectives because under some attack scenarios it could not be expected to be fully accomplished the rnep concept has been intended solely to be among options to defeat hdbts and their operations not to destroy wmd agents they may contain collapsing buried facility likely would prevent enemy operators from using any wmd in that facility but might not destroy wmd agents themselves the difference could be conseque ntial for example under certain circumstances wmd might escape such as chemical or biolog ical agent seeping to the surface through fissures created in the ground by the weapon s explosion as another example if large underground complex were targeted but the attack did not collapse specific chamber containing wmd perhaps because it was buried deeper than expected or hardened more than expected or because attack planners chose an incorrect aim point operators in other parts of the complex might be able to access the chamber and retrieve the wmd accordingly attack planners when targeting facility must address intelligence uncertaintie s about details of the fac ility that could result in an attack that was less than fully successful irrefutable claims couple of irrefutable claims are

abraham has said about rnep we are doing the research on that nothing more and would require congressional endor sement to move to an engineering level18 critics see the rnep study as leading down more dangerous path expressing concern that it will lead to development and deployment of new generation of nuc lear weapons and perhaps to nuclear testing and nuclear use19 critics might ask why spend 71 million or so on fouryear study if favorable outcome does not lead to development of the weapon and why spend perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars deve loping the weapon without planning to deploy it supporters might respond that the study could find that rnep would be less effective or more costly than anticip ated potential adve rsaries might counter rnep in various ways as discussed in complicated issues above nor is there any assurance that congress w ould approve its developmen t while the house and senate defeated amendments to the fy 2005 defense authorization bill

lautenberg asked how can we credibly ask north korea and iran to stop their own nuclear programs while at the same time we develop mini nukes and bunker busters23 an open question is the strength of the link between deterren ce and proliferation on the one hand and rnep and aci on the othe r regarding proliferation most may find it hard to imagine countries going nuclear on grounds that the united states is continuing rnep which is at present just cost and feasibility study on modifying an existing warhead into second epw yet most may find it equally hard to imagine north korea iran pakistan or india giving up its nuclear program because we stop rnep developing nuclear pr ogram takes decades and vast sums of money india conducted nuclear test in 1974 and north korea has been working on its nuclear programs since at least the 1960s nations make this investment for reasons of their own security it is also possible that the us debate may be imputing to other nations the intense detail of analys is typical of the united states even though other nations may simply not make such calculations confusing terminology nd competing story lines threshold vs use critics claim that rnep will lower the nuclear threshold and make it more likely that nuclear wea pons will be used yet it is important to differentiate between threshol d and use the nuclear thre shold may be seen

allies with nuclear weapons biol ogicalagent attack on the united states or positive intelligence that an attack by terrorists or rogue state was imminent the existence of rnep would not lower the

expanding the envelope of circumstances in which nucl ear weapons could be used what would be the point of building it pointillism vs c onnectthedots pointillism was style of painting in which the artist used dots or points of di ffering colors to form an image the administration has presented decisions on lowyield rd aci rnep and nuclear test readiness as four separa dots as administrator brooks put it in regard to the lowyield ban aci rnep and the possibility of us preemptive attacks to head off wmd attacks some concluded these sepa rate things were part of an overall strategy that we were emphasizing nuclear preemption in us military doctrine i assume you all understand this is nonsense24 instead the administration and other rnep supporters used the following arguments 1 the lowyield ban barred rd that could lead to production of s ub5kiloton nuclear weapon because this wording could be read as covering rd on weapons even above 5 kilotons it had chilling effect on scientific inquiry25 2 nnsa intends to use aci funds to investigate new ideas not necessarily new weapons26 it will also be very helpful in training the new weapons designers27 3 regarding rnep the current inventory of nuclear weapons inventor only has limited capability for holding hardened underground facilities at risk the countrys only nuclear earth penetrating weapon the b 61 mod 11 cannot survive delivery into certain types of terrain in which such facilities may be located28 4 our current nuclear test readiness posture is unacceptable as secretary abraham said if some day in the future it were determined that we had uncertainty it would take us minimum of 3 years to conduct test to determine wh ether or not the stockpile wa s reliable that is too long29 in contrast these

underground nuclear tests these tests will release radioactive fallout that will threaten citizens much as the atmos pheric tests of the 1950s and early 1960s did these weapons will make nuclear use more likely by lowering the nuclear threshold each element of the above proposition c ould be questioned nonetheless it is more compelling story line to say the dots are connected than to say they are not and as the preceding statements show the administration has not connected the dots to form its own story unlike pointillism separate dots do not form an image connected dots do as result one could argue that the cr itics story line appears more credible the critics story line also links to the deepest public fears in the nuclear arena nuclearweapon use and radio active fallout it gains added traction because public trust on things nuclear was shattered by the government decades ago downplaying concerns over fallout the b itter residue from that breach of trust persists to this day in part
