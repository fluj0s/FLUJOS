oversight of go vernment management the federal workforce and the district of columbia of the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs hearing job classification dhs will establish definitions for small number of broad pay bands typically 45 within occupational clusters grading criteria will be developed for these broad pay bands that will specify the type and range of difficulty and responsibility qualifications competencies or other characteristics of the work encompassed by the band allowing us to describe range of work james and sanders same written response performance evaluations opm or opm and dhs will treat performance evaluations for dhs employees under 5 usc chapter 97 as personnel actions for purposes of enforcing the ban against prohibited personnel practices under 5 usc 2302 sanders written responsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32261crs4 issue views passfail system for rating performancemy personal professional judgment is that we do not want to use passfail anywhere beyond the entry level the training level and the school level james oral response annual pay adjustments dhs will have the following type of annual pay adjustment features marketbased pay which will be based on market survey approach locality rate supplements which will be based on the cost of labor at different localities or geographic areas and performance based pay increases which will be based on individual performance the dhs compensation plan will also offer special rate supplement which will provide higher pay level for subcategories of employees within an occupational cluster if warranted by current or anticipated recruitment or retention needs james written response locality pay dhs will have greater flexibility in setting locality rate supplements based on labor market conditions and other fact ors dhs may provide for different locality rate supplement percentages for different occupational categories and different band levels james written response homeland security compensation committee hsccthe hscc will be an advisory body to the secretary for making annual recommendations regarding strategic pay decisions such as budget allocation for market and locality adjustments and aggregate review of performance ratings and performance payouts the hscc will also recommend process improvements or policy changes to improve program effectiveness the secretary or designee will make final decisions we appreciate the suggestion to publish internally the overall results of performance management decisions and will consider doing so james written responsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32261crs5 issue views performance appraisal of managerseach managers goals will be based on his or her managers goals thus creating line of sight cascade that starts with the secretary and his direct reports and is repeated through the chain creating subsets of goals that all point to the departments mission objectives with this cascade comes responsibility and accountability for managers to not only set appropriate goals but to actually nurture their employees to achieve success because employees goals will be tied directly to their managers goals the managers success is tied to how well employees perform and finally managers will also be assessed on their management skills including their ability to justify and stand behind pay decisions employee climate surveys and use of 360 degree performance appraisal systems are being seriously considered to ensure that employees have voice in providing feedback on how well their leaders are leading james written response house subcommittee on the federal workforce and agency organization of the committee on government reform hearing communication of core competencieswe are not considering amending the regulations to provide that core competencies be communicated in writing during the meetandconfer process the participating labor organizations agreed that performance expectations including core competencies need not be in writing performance expectations including those that may affect an employees retention in the job must be communicated to the employee prior to holding the employee accountable for them james written response performance management systemwe will emphasize greater role for departmental leaders in ensuring mission and individual goal alignment and holding individual employees accountable for results and ensuring that compensation decisions are driven by performance employees along with their supervisor will work together to align their individual goals with the larger goals of the department by setting specific milestones and creating direct line of sight between individual jobs and missionachievement there will be clear picture of what is expected during the performance cycle james written responsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32261crs6 issue views mathematical formula for performance payoutsthere are four variables performance rating pay pool and the dollars in the pay pool and the ratings distribution let us fo cus on those people who meet expectations exceed expectations and who are outstanding each of those performance ratings has point value that point value is established at higher headquarters through oversight of the compensation committee the funding in that pay pool is also established at higher headquarters with oversight from the compensation committee you simply take the rating multiply it times the point value and divide the points into the dollars and you get your share of the pool the regulations absolutely positively bar and prohibit forced distri butions of ratings you cant bust the budget because the pool is finite you simply divide the available dollars in the pool amongst the employees based on their rating and the amount in the pool the amount of the departments payroll that will go to performance pay is set by the secretary on the advice and input of the compensation committee four members of which are from the departments two major unions they will determine how much of the departments annual appropriations increase in payroll goes to performance the national market adjustments and local market adjustments secretary reserves the right to make final decisions they will decide how that is divided up by location and occupation and how much goes into the performance pay pool and later there is enough in the performance pay pool to make sure that fully successful employees get shares that are worth something those who exceed expectations get shares that are worth more and those that are outstanding get even more sanders oral responses an employee who receives an unacceptable performance ratingif the employee is at the minimum level of pay he or she is unacceptable and everybody else in the pay range goes up because they get acrossthe board increases the regulations require management to take action in 90 days either the employees performance improves and they move back up into the range with everyone else or the department either demotes or removes the employee sanders oral responsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32261crs7 issue views 6 us
