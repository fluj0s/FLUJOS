threaten chinas economic growth as we ll as have negative conseque nces for the us and global economy this report will be upda ted as circumstances warrant economic conditions in china are of cons iderable concern to us policymakers given the potential impact of chinas ec onomy on the global and us economy the recent large inflow of financial capital into china commonly referred to as hot money has led some economists to warn that such flows may have destabilizing effect on chinas economy in an oped column in the financial times two china experts wrote of hot moneys ensuing money creation is fueling rising inflation systemic overinvestment and an overe xtended banking system1 there are also indications that hot money flows have played role in th recent rise and fall of chinas stock and real estate markets other economists have expressed concerns that efforts by the chinese government to control hot money inflows could have significant negative consequences for the us and global economy in the form of slower growth greater inflation or both defining hot money there is formal definition of hot m oney but the term is most commonly used in financial markets to refer to the flow of funds or capital from one country to another in order to earn shortterm profit on interest rate differences andor anticipated exchange rate shifts these speculative capital flows are called hot money because they can move very quickly in and out of markets potentially leading to market instability many economists maintain that the rapid outflow of hot money first from thailand and

contributing factor to the onset and severity of the east as ian financial crisis of 1997 estimates of chinas hot money flows because hot moneyflows quickly and is poorly monitored ther is welldefined direct method for estimating the amount of hot money flowing into country during period of time in addition once an estimate is made the amount of hot money may suddenly rise or fall depending on the econo mic conditions driving the flow of funds one common way of approximating the flow of hot money is to subtract nations trade surplus or deficit and its net flow of foreign direct investment fdi from the change in the nations foreign reserves for the first half of 2008 chinas foreign reserves increased by 2806 billion2 over the same time period chinas accumu lated trade surplus was 990 billion and its fdi inflow was 520 billion3 using the method describe d above china received an inflow of 1296 billion in hot mone during the first half of 20084 according to the former director of chinas national bureau of statistics li deshui chinas research institutes estimate that about 500 billion in hot money has accumulated in china5 however zhang ming an economist at the chinese academy of social sciences reportedly estimated that 175 tr illion in hot money coul d have accumulated over the last five years6 some chinese experts reportedly pr edict that the amount of hot money in china will rise to 650 billion by the end of 20087 some western analysts think the chinese figures underestimate the amount of hot money in china because they do not take into account changes in chinas monetary policies such as the raising of reserve requirements and the creation of chinas sovereign wealth fund the china investment corporation taking into account these other factors us financial analyst brad setser estimates that china received over 400 billion in hot money flows between april 2007 and march 20088 causes of chinas inflow of hot money while there may be some uncertainty bout the precise amount of hot money flowing into china there appears to be general agreement as to why speculators are moving their capital into china analysts point to two key factors 1 the relative interesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22921crs3 9 chinas currency is officially called the renminbi or peoples currency it is often referred to as the yuan which is actually its unit of denomination 10

2008 in chineserates in china and the united states and 2 expectations of the future appreciation in the value of chinas currency the renminbi rmb9 over the last year interest rates in china and the united states have been moving in opposite directions the us federal re serve lowered the fede ral funds rate nine times over the last year from high of 525 in june 2007 to its current low of 20010 over the same time period the peoples ba nk of china raised its benchmark oneyear interest rate on depos its from 252 to 41411 the reversal in the relative interest rates of the two nations has created an incentive fo r investors to move their deposits from the united states to china in order to earn higher rate of return12 in addition to the attraction of the interest rate difference speculators are moving hot money into china because of the ge neral expectation that the rmb will continue appreciate in value against the us dollar and other currencies on july 21 2005 china announced it was dropping its fixed exchange ra policy for managed float policy that would allow the value of the rmb to fluctuate within specified range on daily basis13 since then through july 15 2008 the rmb s appreciated in value by 216 most analysts expect the chinese government to continue the rmbs appreciation the combined effects of the interest rate differences and the expected appreciation of the rmb provide strong incentive for hot money flows into china li yang financial researcher at chinas academy for social sciences calculated that hot money speculators can obtain profit rates of over 10 per year with little investment risk14 in theory despite its recent capital market liberalizations chin still maintains some restrictions over foreign exchange and international capital flows providing it with various instruments to prevent the inflow of the unwanted hot money15 however sources report that speculators are using vari ous methods to circumvent chinese laws and regulations according to deutsche bank survey of 200 companies and 60 high income individuals over half of the hot m oney coming into china is being done in the form of overreported or false fo reign direct investment fdi16 an additional 11 of the hot money is generated by underreporting the value of im ports and another 10 comes from the overvaluing exports the deutsche ba nk study also reported that 5 of the hot money enters china via underground money exchangers dixia qianzhuang httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22921crs4 17 hot money how the hell does it get into china china

current transfers emigrant remittances gifts and donations may be another major source of hot money17 according to some analysts us econo mic policies and the slow us economy may be exacerbating chinas hot money problem creating catch22 situation for beijing18 years of large federal deficits and comparatively low us interest rates have contributed to the weakening of the us do llar against many currencies including the rmb and the outflow of hot money fro m the united states one chinese official indicated that he thought the us subprime crisis was also fueling hot money flows19 impact of hot money on chinas economy the main concern in china over the influx of hot money has been that it may add to chinas inflationary pressures in july 2008 the government reported that the consumer price index had risen by 79 over the firs t half of 2008 over th same period in 2007 due largely to food prices which was much higher than the governments target ceiling of 48 and the producer price index rose by 76 high inflation is serious issue for the government because of concerns that rapid inflation could produce protests and political instability20 at the same time the government needs rapid growth to help employ the 27 million new job seekers each year under chinese law most foreign exchange entering the country must be converted into rmb the large flow of hot money is causing sharp rise in chinas money supply resulting in inflation the chinese government has attemp ted to sterilize the foreign exchange by selling bonds to soak up the rmb put into circulation but this has resulted in higher interest rates that attract even more hot money china has attempted to nullify the inflationary impact of hot money by other means such as the imposition of lending quotas on banks increasing the ratio of reserves commerc ial banks are required to maintain it was raised to 175 in june 2008 compared to 90 in ja nuary 2007 raising interest rates instituting government controls to limit investment in overheated sectors such as real estate and the steel industry and im posing price controls on certain products mainly food and energy big cern by some chinese analysts is that hot money may be creating bubbles in its stock and real estate markets although recent evidence suggests that the hot money is being largely depos ited into bank accounts21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22921crs5 22 interest rate differentials being the other major incentive 23 qian wang chinas policy options for d ealing with capital infloweconomic research note jpmorgan chase bank hong kong may 16 2008 24 rising costs such as increased wages in china and an appreciating rmb are already prompting foreign manufactures to relocate to lower cost countries such

accounts china daily june 19 2008 27 chinas overseas direct investment totaled about 91 billion cumulative at the end of 2006chinas options for dealing with hot money flows if the chinese government determines it is necessary to take action it has number of options on how to slow down the flow of hot money however each option has potentially negative side effects appreciate or depreciate the rmb an increase in the value of the rmb would arguably be an effective option for controlling inflationary pressures caused by hot money sharp appreciation in the rmb visavis the dollar either by sharp revaluation or quickening the pace of appreciation under its managed float regime would eliminate one of the two main incentives driving the speculators22 the move would probably lower the price of imports i ncluding raw materials and possibly slow the growth in foreign exchange reserves other analysts have suggested that china depreciate the rmb move that would undermine the speculators but could prompt congress to pass currency legislation including sanctions against china23 some chinese officials contend that although stronger rmb might reduce inflationary pressures it would also likely raise the price of chinas exports and diminish chinas attractiveness as destination for fdi leading to widespread layoffs factory closings and slower economic growth24 while export growth over the first six months of 2008 has been strong up 22 over the same period in 2007 there is concern that rising costs in china and economic weakne ss in the united states could greatly slow chinas export growth and reduce the domestic value of its foreign exchange reserves regulate the flow of capital another option for slowing the inflow of hot money is to tighten restrictions on the flow of foreign capital into china trend contrary to recent us efforts to persuade china to liberalize its financial markets during his first speech as vice premier on may 9 2008 wang qish an spoke of reinforcing supervision over crosscountry capital flow25 there have also been reports that china is tightening its supervision of bank accounts held by nonresi dents to curb the influx of hot money26 in addition china could attempt to further promote the outflow of capital to reduce the inflationary impact of hot money using some of its foreign exchange reserves27 however many policymakers including thos in the united states are concerned over the potential impact of widescale and potentially government directed chinese investment in strategic econo mic sectors such as oil and gas high technology etc httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22921crs6 28 this may already be occurring over the first five months of 2008 according to us trade statistics us imports from china increased by only 44 compared to an 117 increase in 2007 while us exports to china grew by 228 over the same period in 2007 29 according to us bureau of labor statistics prices of us imports from china increased by 48 from june 2007 to june 2008 the largest 12month increase for the china index since data was first reported in 2003 30 china was the 2nd largest foreign holder of these securities 507 billion as of may 2008 31 because of its currency policy chinas ability to use monetary policy to effectively control inflation is hampered raising interest rates would attract more hot money the use of administrative controls currency sterilization and price controls may help control inflation in the shortrun but they may cause long term economic distortions that damage the economy 32 according to the international monetary fund china was the single most important contributor to world economic growth in 2007 and thus chinese economic slowdown could have global implications implications for sinous relations some us analysts contend that the large levels of hot mone pouring into china will force china to accelerate the appreciation of the rmb relative to the us dollar and make the government enact other reforms to make the currency more flexible this they maintain could in the short run help boost us exports to china and reduce imports from china thus improving the us bilateral trade balance with china28 others warn that appreciating the rmb would also make us imports from china more expensive which could add to inflationary pr essures in the united states29 in addition china might reduce its purchases of us treasury securities use d to help fund the federal deficit which could push up us interest rates30 another concern is that chinese efforts to fight hot moneyinflation could lead to slowdown in chinas economic growth31 this could have numerous implications for the us and global economies over the past few years china has been one of the fastest growing economies which has made it major market for us exports in 2007 china surpassed japan to become the 3rd largest us export market and thus chinese slowdown could reduce its demand for us goods and services32 additionally inflationary problems or an economic slowdow n could cause chinese officials to delay economic reforms particularly to its financial system and currency policy the issues concerning the potential dang ers of hot money flows to china reinforces the us argument and has been acknowledged by the chinese government as long term goal that china needs to do more to implement policies to encourage domestic demand and ssen its dependence on exporting and fixed investment for its economic growth some us analysts contend that adopting free floating exchange rate is the best way to stop hot money inflows and to provide the government with the monetary tools it needs to control inflation however chinese offici als contend that such move at this time would shock the econom especially the export sector and thus would be too risky although they contend that fully convertible currency is long range goal the hot money issue is further indicator of the growing economic integration between the united states and china
