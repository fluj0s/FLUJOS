apparent in the credit markets in august 2007 although initially thought to be limited to subprime mortgages increasing defaults on prime mortgages caused losses that rippled through the financial system the effects have been particularly severe because us mortgagebacked securities mbs had previously been viewed as low risk investments beginning in early 2008 mu ltiple failures in large financial institutions prompted casebycase government interventions to address these failures dissatisfaction with these ad hoc responses was cited by the treasury in proposing broader response focusing on government purchase of troubled mortgagerelated assets hoping to stem uncertainty and fear by removing these assets from the financial system in early october 2008 congress passed and the president signed the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 eesa division of hr 1424pl 110343 creating the troubled assets relief program tarp in the 111 th congress the tarp reform and accountability act of 2009 hr 384 would enact significant changes eesa allows treasury to buy up to 700 billion in troubled assets from financial institutions the scope of the program depends in part on the definition of troubled assets the original threepage proposal defined trouble assets as mortgagerelat ed assets both residential and commercial as passed eesa includes second definition which includes any asset that treasury in consultation with the federal reserve believes would contribute to financial stability eesa also allows treasury to insure assets rather than purchase them taxpayers are to be at least partially protected from losses through the provision of equity or debt considerations and through insurance premiums tarp limits the executive compensation of participating institutions tarp allows for direct aid to homeowners through pr ovisions promoting mortgage restructuring and extending tax relief for homeowners who have mortgage debt forgiven following enactment of eesa the treasury has purchased or committed to purchase approximately 350 billion of assets although none of these have been through the asset purchase auctions or insurance programs through the voluntary capital purchase program cpp 250 billion of the tarp funding has been committed fo r capital injections into financial institutions through government purchases of preferred shar through the consumer lending facility up to 20 billion in tarp funding will be used to absorb any losses on 200 billion federal reserve credit facility intended to assist the credit markets in accommodating the credit needs of consumers and small businesses the treasury has also undertaken several caseby case interventions including aig citigroup general motorsgmac and chrysler in the 111th congress hr 384 was introduced by chairman barney frank on january 9 2009 and passed the house with four amendments on january 21 2009 this bill would amend the eesa in several ways including stricter conditions on institutions receiving tarp funds requirements and limitations for homeowners assistance and specific authorization for and conditions on financial assistance for automobile manufacturers this report briefly introduces aspects of the current financial instability following this it outlines the eesa legislation the steps that treasury has taken to implement eesa and current legislation amending the eesa finally the report concludes with more indepth analysis of the current financial instability including potential cau ses of financial instability in general

economic stabilization act eesa1 became law on october 3 2008 intended to restore stability to the us financial system the act created troubled assets relief program tarp2 tarp included two primary programs troubled asset purchase program and troubled asset insurance program this report briefly introduces characteristics of current financial instability it also outlines the eesa legislation the steps that treasury has taken to implement eesa and legislation in the 111 th congress amending eesa next the report provides an indepth analysis of financial instab ility including potential causes of instability in general and how it may spill over into the broader economy finally the report assesses the causes of this period of financial instability this report will be updated as warranted by market and legislative events starting in the 1980s nonbank lenders have originated increasing shares of us mortgages these nonbank lenders obtained their own funds through the conversion of mortgages into marketable securities securitization rather than by accepting consumer deposits as in the traditional banking model3 in most cases once mortgage was made the entity that originated the loan sold it to another institution which then pooled large number of these loans together from this pool of loans the institution then issued securities whose returns were based on the payments made on the underlying mortgages in the pool for variety of market and regulatory reasons these mortgagebacked securities mbs became widely held by most financial institutions in the united states and by many inst itutions worldwide in addition to the securities directly backed by mortgages financial institutions created numerous other complex securities and derivatives based on the initial mbs these secondary products such as collateralized debt obligations cdo and credit default swaps cds were also very widely held by financial institutions although not by retail investors in 2006 and 2007 the rates of default and nonpayment by mortgage holders increased significantly this in turn ultimately caused the securities and derivatives based on these mortgages to lose value in some cases securities thought to be low risk were completely wiped out these losses have rippled through the financial system causing problems for institutions in number of unexpected ways as well as stress to the general financial system the failures of large financial institutions including bear stearns indymac fannie mae freddie mac lehman brothers and aig were part of this turmoil 4 due largely to the uncertainty about what future mortgage default rates will be what institutions are exposed to mortgagerelated assets and whether more institutions may fail unexpectedly financial markets have nearly frozen at various points in time since august 2007 difficulties for individual financial institutions and for financial systems as whole can often usefully be distinguished as problems of liquidity or of capital adequacy 5 firm suffering from 1 division of hr 1424pl 110343 crs report rs22722 securitization and federal regulation of mortgages for safety and soundness by edward v murphy 2 crs report

liabilities but is unable to liquidate these assets fast enough to meet shortterm obligations firm suffering from capital adequacy problems has an inadequate buffer between its assets and its liabilities if its asset values fall or liability values rise unexpectedly the firm may be unable to meet its liabilities even if its assets can be liquidated quickly insolvency could result the classical prescription for addressing liquidity problems is for lender of last resort such as the federal reserve to lend freely but at high enough interest rates so that institutions do not take too many risks capital adequacy problems particularly when widespread can be more difficult to address in past crises steps have included directly bolstering firms capital 6 and sweeping insolvent or near insolvent firms out of the system7 g22g145g142g561g22g155g152g158g139g149g142g141g561g3g156g156g142g157g156g561g20g142g149g146g142g143g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561

proposed broad program of financial intervention to stabilize markets the treasury plan called for government purchases of up to 700 billion in mortgagerelated securities in the hope that by partially purging the system of these troubled assets normal functioning of the financial markets could be restored the idea of broad asset purchases as in the original treasury plan is only one of number of methods that could be used to address the uncertainties regarding mortgagerelated assets among the other concepts put forward have been federal guarantee program to insure mortgagerelated assets thus eliminating much of the uncertainty surrounding these securities direct capital injections by the treasury into financial institutions thus shoring up their capitalization and direct support for homeowners thus decreasing mortgage default rates and increasing the value of mortgagerelated securities after various legislative proposals and drafts were circulated and negotiations between congress and the administration were conducted the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 eesa was brought to vote in the house as substitute amendment to hr 3997 this amendment failed in the house on vote of 205228 on september 29 2008 another version of eesa which included the original eesa plus several other provisions not in the first bill8 was continued reserves response by marc labonte for more discussion on the question of liquidity vs capital adequacy 6 one example of this was the reconstruction finance corporation rfc depressionera program to stabilize the financial sector in the hoover administration rfc primarily lent funds to banks but in the roosevelt administration the rfc began purchasing preferred stock in banks 7 one example of this was the resolution

financial institution established and regulated under federal or state law but excluding any foreign governmental entity these assets are defined by the statute as residential or commercial mortgages including securities based on or related to such mortgages in addition to the mortgagerelated assets that were the focus of the program the secretary is authorized to purchase any other financial instrument that is necessary to promote financial market stability congress must be notified of the secretarys determination to purchase non mortgage related assets but the secretary does not need congress approval to do so the secretary is to take steps to prevent unjust enrichment of financial institutions selling assets to the government in particular preventing the sale of troubled assets at price higher than what the seller initially paid for the asset section 113 directs the secretary to use market mechanisms such as auctions to purchase assets when possible

create an insurance program providing federal guarantees for troubled assets this insurance program is to be funded by premiums paid by financial institutions for the federal guarantee with specific provision for the tarp insurance fund to borrow from the us treasury under the statute the guarantees may be up to 100 of the value of the asset and the premiums may be risk based but the secretary is not required to implement either of these provisions g21g146g163g142g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g156g561 under sections 115 and 102 the total size of the insurance and asset purchase program combined is not to exceed 700 billion at any given time which does allow the program to buy and sell assets then use the sales proceeds to purchase other assets authority to purchase or insure 250 billion is effective on the date of enactment with an additional 100 billion in authority effective upon submission of presidential certification the final 350 billion in

value after the government conservatorship announced in september 2008 capital gains or losses from the sale or exchange of preferred stock of fannie mae and freddie mac will be treated as ordinary income or loss by applicable financial institutions which include banks mutual savings banks cooperative banks and savings and loan associations among others the basic rationale behind this tax relief is that it will reduce the need of the bank to obtain additional capital from the fdic or investors this should also prevent some community banks from becoming insolvent 18 normally in the case of corporations capital losses are allowed only to the extent of capital gains although the losses may be carried back three years or carried forward for five years this provision allows these financial institutions to use the losses incurred in the government takeover of fannie mae and freddie mac to reduce their tax liability this year year with few capital gains rather than carry the losses to past tax years or forward to future tax years 19 g6g158g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561 section 120 authorizes tarp asset purchases until the end of 2009 upon

transmittal of such determination in writing to the appropriate committees of congress shortly after passage treasury announced its plans to implement the program which has been coordinated by neel kashkari the interim assi stant secretary for the office of financial stability mr kashkari created teams within treasury to administer tarp including hiring asset managers to administer asset purchases proposing rules for asset insurance and injecting capital into institutions through preferred stock purchases although treasury has subsequently announced that it will focus on capital purchases the following section begins with the treasury actions relating to the troubled asset purchase and insurance programs specifically described in the eesa and then moving to the various

conditions prior to fully implementing the troubled asset purchase program in section 101 of the eesa the first definition of troubled assets part eligible for the tarp program is any residential or commercial mortgages and any securities obligations or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages that in each case was originated or issued on or before march 14 2008 the purchase of which the secretary determines promotes financial market stability to purchase these assets treasury must publish the mechanisms for purchasing assets pricing and valuation models the process of choosing asset managers and the method of identifying troubled assets for purchase some steps were completed for the purchase of complex mortgagerelated securities treasury selected bank of

pricewaterhousecoopers llp and ernst young to provide accounting assistance for the program treasury also began the process of hiring asset managers should treasury implement the troubled asset purchase program institutions would have to conform to program requirements in order to participate participating institutions must sell or commit to sell to treasury warrants for nonvoting common or preferred stock or voting stock if treasury agrees not to vote in addition to providing warrants participating institutions must agree to limits on executive compensation on november 12 the secretary of the treasury indicated that in treasurys assessment purchasing troubled assets was not the most effective way to use tarp funds20 the secretary did indicate that the treasury would be continuing to examine whether asset purchases might be useful in the future it is unclear to what degree the infrastructure discussed above to provide for asset purchases will be retained or whether it would need to be reconstituted if future decision were made to purchase troubled assets 20 us department of treasury remarks by secretary henry m paulson jr on financial rescue package and economic update press

treasury began the notice and comment rulemaking procedure for the insurance program on october 14 2008 rather than providing specific insurance plan treasurys notice asked questions to guide the creation of the troubled asset insurance program should the insurance program include both whole loans and complex securities should the program differ by which particular asset is troubled and if so how is that to be measured how could home equity lines of credit heloc and other junior liens be addressed in an insurance program comments on these and similar questions were due to treasury by october 28 2008 given the focus on capital purchase discussed below it was unclear how quickly the treasury would act to create the insurance program and how expansive the program would be section 102 of pl 110343 clearly requires that an insurance program be created but sets timelines on its operation requiring only that report on the insurance program be filed within 90 days after enactment on december 31 2008 treasury released the congressionally mandated report on the insurance program this report indicated that it had established an asset guarantee program as required under the eesa and the program would provide guarantees for assets held by systemically significant financial institutions that face high risk of losing market confidence due in large part to portfolio of distressed or illiquid assets the report continues that the program will be applied with extreme discretion in order to improve market confidence in the systemically significant institution and in financial markets broadly it is not anticipated that the program will be made widely available 21 on january 16 2009 part of the assistance to citigroup was formally assigned to the asset guarantee program prior to the january 16 2009 citigroup assistance of 5 billion there had been guarantees issued under the eesa insurance program however treasury had indicated in november 2008 that it might use this program for 306 billion pool of assets that treasury guaranteed as part of its initial intervention into citigroup discussed further below

policymakers had urged this approach from the beginning authority to purchase the preferred shares of banks comes under part b of the definition of troubled asset which gives treasury broad discretion in consultation with the federal reserve on october 14 2008 treasury announced its ongoing fo cus would be to inject capital directly into financial institutions through the purchase of preferred stock rather than purchasing the troubled assets that had previously been the focus of the program this announcement came after european authorities announced that they were taking steps to inject capital into their banks treasury also announced that nine large banks were participating in the initial preferred share purchase which amounted to 125 billion treasury indicated that an additional 125 billion was being reserved for preferred share purchases from smaller banks as of january 16 2009 total 21 from the us treasury website section 102 congressional report available at

the treasury announced on november 10 2008 that financial support under tarp would be provided to aig which had previously received support exclusively from the federal reserve originally listed under the capital purchase program the treasury subsequently announced the systemically significant failing institutions program ssfip and included the aig intervention under this program the tarp portion of the aig restructuring consisted of the purchase of 40 billion in preferred shares which will pay 10 dividend 23 while the ssfip has only been used for aig to this date treasury indicates that it may be used in the future on casebycase basis according to the treasury future designation of systemically significant failing institution status is to be determined based on the following criteria24 1 the extent to which the failure of an institution could threaten the viability of its creditors and counterparties because of their direct exposures to the institution 2 the number and size of financial institutions that are seen by investors or counterparties as similarly situated to the failing institution or that would otherwise be likely to experience indirect contagion effects from the failure of the institution 3 whether the institution is sufficiently important to the nations financial and economic system that disorderly failure would with high probability cause major disruptions to credit markets or payments and settlement systems seriously destabilize key asset prices significantly increase uncertainty or losses of confidence thereby materially weakening overall economic performance or 22 figures taken from the treasurys tarp transactions report for the period ending jan 16 2009 available at httpwwwtreasgovpressreleases reports012209cpptablets01pdf 23 additional

nations financial and economic system that loss of confidence in the firms financial position could potentially cause major disruptions to credit markets or payments and settlement systems destabilize asset prices significantly increase uncertainty or lead to similar losses of confidence or financial market stability that could materially weaken overall economic performance and 5 the extent to

share purchase the treasury fdic and federal reserve agreed to guarantee 306 billion pool of citigroup assets the guarantee is in place for 10 years for residential assets and five years for

eesa authorized flexible program to respond to financial instability treasury has announced that it will implement tarp using combination of the activities authorized by the act as the previous discussion has shown tarp programs can help banks by removing bad assets or injecting capital tarp programs can also be used to insure bad assets or to directly assist mortgage borrowers the following section analyzes the tarp program by first discussing potential sources of financial turmoil in general and then discussing some characteristics of the recent turmoil that might be addressed by various tarp initiatives financial markets serve as intermediaries between savers and borrowers if they are running effectively funds from investors are allocated to borrowers according to their willingness and ability to repay the loans adjusted for risk over the course of lifetime most people will have extended periods of being borrower and of being saver financial markets help young people pay for college and buy their first home and financial markets help when it comes time to retire however if financial markets are disrupted then both savers and borrowers will be frustrated at times market imperfections might cause financial markets to underprice risk which might cause assets to become overpriced bubbles 31 at other times market imperfections might also cause 31 crs report

economic activity and possibly trigger recessions the difficulty for policymakers is to identify market practices that might tend to over price or underprice risk financial markets are subject to number of imperfections some of which are described below in each case private firms can attempt to address the problem through contract mechanisms and policymakers can attempt to address the problem through regulation or other tools because private contract is such flexible device financ ial markets are constantly evolving the evolution of financial instruments and markets can make it difficult for policymakers to identify monitor and neutralize potential weaknesses some important imperfections are detailed below g5g152g151g143g146g141g142g151g140g142g561g138g151g141g561g157g145g142g561g5g155g142g141g146g157g561g5g162g140g149g142g561 financial intermediaries often practice fractional reserve lending that is they keep some fraction of their total assets available for contingencies and use the rest for lending because of this fractional reserve system financial intermediaries are often in position in which they could not immediately respond to all partners if everyone demanded their funds or other assets at the same time even if the firms assets are much greater than liabilities the firm is solvent the firm might not be able to exchange those assets to satisfy immediate costs the firm is illiquid unfortunately prudence and risk move in opposite directions the smaller the amount of reserves the intermediary keeps on hand the greater the potential for profit but the greater the risk that the firm will be caught without adequate funds if conditions change leverage thus works in both directions to compensate for exposure to intermediaries with inadequate reserves people may ask business partners to post bond the required bond generally declines the more confident people are as result periods of investor confidence and investor pessimism can become selffulfilling confidence tends to expand available credit which tends to bid up prices which tends to make the projects more likely to succeed for while lack of confidence tends to dry up credit which makes it harder for people to conduct economic activities which makes it harder for projects to succeed the vulnerability of the credit cycle to bouts of overconfidence or panic may be an inherent market failure one role of regulator is to monitor reserve assets of financial intermediaries to make sure the latter do not become overextended during times of confidence in hindsight it appears that many financial firms became overextended during 20022005 some have called for trying to adjust reserve requirements leverage and similar characteristics to lean against the wind in this view regulations should increase capital requirements during boom times and lower them in periods of contraction in the current situation which is discussed in more detail below banks have experienced both liquidity problems and capital adequacy solvency problems the complexity of mbs has contributed to the difficulty in exchanging these assets which makes mbs less liquid for anyone who holds them or who might buy them in addition default rates on mortgage loans have increased significantly higher than expected loan losses reduce bank capital these effects are continued labonte

difficult to borrow funds which means they are less liquid the asset purchase and asset insurance portions of tarp more directly address liquidity issues32 whereas the preferred stock purchase plan more directly addresses solvency issues g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561g3g156g162g150g150g142g157g155g146g142g156g561 it is often the case in financial contracts that one party has more information than another it may be the case that there is group of assets only some of which are defective if the seller can identify the defective assets but the buyer cannot then there is said to be market for lemons and the value of all of the assets will be discounted by potential buyers private firms can try to solve the problem through guarantees and similar contract terms in addition there may be role for government inspectors or mandatory disclosures regulation of ratings agencies could arguably fall under this category if large pool of assets emerges where the assets are unrated because some unknown portion of them are thought to be defective it may minimize total costs to have an institution with long time horizon such as government acquire the assets and sort quality assets from troubled assets at later date for financial institutions asymmetric information problems can also be factor when designing rescue plans for example if the originator of loans tends to keep some but sell others on the secondary market then there may be an information problem the originators may tend to keep the good loans in their own portfolios and pass along the bad loans to others similarly if policymakers offer to acquire assets firms may try to keep the good assets and sell the bad assets in the current situation the complexity of mbs may have created lemons problem some policymakers are concerned that program to buy assets from banks will allow banks to overcharge the government for their assets in this view once the government establishes price for the assets only firms who know that their assets are worth less than the price will participate to prevent the lemons problems some have suggested an auction process to ensure that assets are priced correctly 33 if auctions correctly price assets this program might help remove illiquid assets from bank balance sheets however it could be argued that correctly pricing troubled assets is not the only policy goal treasury may wish to use the lemons problem with the express purpose of removing the most troubled assets from the bank balance sheets furthermore paying more than the current assessed price might also address the policy goal of recapitalizing banks another information problem is what is known as the winners curse in winners curse some of the potential bidders have more information than others unsophisticated bidders try to free ride on the information provided by the more sophisticated people watch the smart people bid and copy them the problem in this is that the smart people will know when to stop bidding unfortunately the winners will continue bidding for while unaware that the sophisticated have stopped participating as result assets become overpriced and could become subject to crashes some believe that the process of creating mbs securitization was subject to winners 32 the impact of the asset insurance and asset purchase programs on solvency depends greatly on the premiums charged for the insurance and the prices paid for the assets 33 crs report rl34707 auction basics background for assessing proposed treasury purchases of mortgage backed securities by d andrew austin

the incentive to take fewer risks prior to an agreement but the agreement itself creates an incentive for them to take more risks against the interests of their contracting party for example insurance often causes moral hazard so insurance companies often insist that people pay deductibles install smoke alarms do not live in flood plain and the like if policymakers rescue some firms then the perception of safety net may encourage other firms to take on more risk similarly if firms approach insolvency with only low probability of survival they might take extremely large risks in the current situation some are concerned that the tarp program could cause moral hazard once financial institutions know that the government will spend large sums to remove bad assets or inject additional capital they may be willing to take additional risks eesa attempts to deal with moral hazard in part by limiting the compen sation that the executives of participating financial institutions can receive one of the limits specifically prohibits executive compensation that is linked to excessive risk taking during the period that treasury holds debt or equity interest in the financial institution section 11b2a g16g142g157g160g152g155g148g561g7g161g157g142g155g151g138g149g146g157g146g142g156g561 in some instances firms can compete in one arena but be network partners in another for example sports teams compete on the field and for players and coaches but sports team must have other sports teams in order to have marketable entertainment product similarly financial institutions compete in many areas but also must cooperate to clear checks exchange securities and manage risk trading exchange cannot operate without multiple parties furthermore the greater the number of people that participate the more liquid the market will be which in turn increases the value of participating in the ex change these network externalities can cause coordination problems when the interests of participants conflict one role for policymakers may be to help resolve network externalities in the present circumstances the coordination of trading complex derivatives is arguably one concern of policymakers when considering financial market intervention tarp may help address this problem by allowing treasury to consider removing complex derivatives that may pose systemic risks

in the interest of any single firm or group of firms to pay all the costs of resolving problems in these instances it may be the role of policymakers to help coordinate solutions to collective action problems the role may be as simple as making information available or gathering parties to facilitate negotiations or the role may be to provide investment in the infrastructure of the markets themselves in the present circumstances both the federal reserve and treasury have been active in attempting to find acquisition partners for troubled financial institutions believed to pose systemic

although the prior section addressed financial market problems in general terms this section discusses problems specific to the current episode of financial turmoil the initial spark for the financial turmoil is generally agreed to be the increase in defaults among subprime mortgage borrowers and the loss of liquidity of securities backed by mortgage loans since august 2007 financial firms have suffered repeated problems in disposing of toxic assets rolling over their own debt identifying the relative financial health of potential trading partners and recapitalizing their balance sheets 35 the primary tools of the federal reserve address liquidity but financial firms are also experiencing capital adequacy problems for fannie mae and freddie mac the federal housing finance agency fhfa formerly ofheo and treasury helped with both liquidity and capital adequacy for institutions the government deems essential 36 some argue that the apparent inconsistency between aid for bear stearns aid for lehman brothers and then the subsequent rescue of aig increased rather than decreased uncertainty at any rate credit markets suffered near collapse in the days after the lehman brothers and aig episodes

investors expect high default rates by borrowers then prices might adjust to compensate for increased losses therefore high default rates by themselves do not necessarily lead to financial market turmoil as long as prices reflect the elevated risk the rapid rate of increase in defaults on subprime mortgages however was unexpected by many investors in global mortgagebacked securities markets 37 during the early stages of the mortgage market turmoil some believed that it was largely subprime problem caused by predatory practices of unregulated lenders38 others argued that there were more general problems in mortgage markets both prime and subprime that had encouraged the use of nontraditional mortgage products to speculate on house price appreciation39 if the only problem was wrong estimates of default rates then financial markets might be expected to restore stability once higher risk levels are incorporated in prices unfortunately this has not as yet occurred perhaps in part because there are characteristics of housing markets that tend to reinforce downward price pressures which also tend to increase default rates 40 34 crs report rl34420 bear stearns crisis and rescue

the view that unexpectedly high default rates were not confined to the subprime market first defaults are concentrated in formerly rapidly appreciating regions second the default rate on prime adjustablerate mortgages arms has increased more rapidly than the default rate on subprime arms at the same time subprime fixedrate mortgages are performing better than they had before the housing boom suggesting that there are issues related to arms figure 1 constructs an index base equals 2001 of the default rates on arms for fixedrate mortgages subprime mortgages and fha mortgages market participants who might have expected default rates to continue would have missed by greater margin on prime arms than on subprime arms note that the absolute level of default rates is much higher on subprime loans than on prime loans however because higher interest rates for riskier loans compensate partially for default risk the relative change in given default rate compared to its history is arguably more important to an investor than the absolute default rate if so then figure 1 and figure 2 show that investors in mbs did not just experience subprime problem they experienced an arm

inquen cy sur vey prices for mbs have been affected by changing views of housing markets early in the turmoil many observers believed that problem loans were largely subprime phenomenon however falling house prices in california florida and several other formerly booming states have exacerbated default rates among all categories of borrowers in those regions one contributing factor is that mortgage debts exceed the market value of some borrowers homes therefore some of these borrowers are increasingly tempted to walk away from their mortgages as result some investors consider wider class of mbs tainted and these assets are harder to sell at any price when mortgage problems were considered only subprime problem few thought that fannie mae or freddie mac had great deal of exposure to problem loans 41 subsequently problems in the broader market have shown that fannie mae and freddie mac had more problem loans than originally thought because housing markets and financial markets are linked many have expressed skepticism that financial markets will recover before housing markets stabilize 41 see for example allen fishbein director of housing and credit policy consumer

beginning of what originally became known as the subprime crisis liquidity refers to the ability to sell an asset quickly without suffering significant price reductioncash is typically the most liquid asset firm is liquid if it has significant portion of its assets in liquid form or can easily access debt markets to acquire liquid assets as needed firm is solvent if the value of its assets is greater than the value of its liabilities an insolvent firm can be in trouble even if all of its assets are perfectly liquid such as in cash when mortgagerelated securities held by investment banks and other financial firms suffered higher than expected default rates the mbs lost their liquidity in part because potential buyers were uncertain as to which securities contained the loans that were unlikely to perform complex accounting rules which allowed certain assets to be held offbalance sheet made the uncertainty worse and many mortgagerelated securities became illiquid policymakers attempted to restore liquidity to mbs markets over the past year the federal reserve increased liquidity to markets in general by lowering interest rates it provided liquidity to targeted financial firms by expanding the list of institutions that could directly access the discount window and by providing regular liquidity auctions 42 the federal reserve also attempted to increase the liquidity of mortgagerelated assets by adding them to the list of collateral that it would accept for loans the government tried to increase the liquidity of mortgages by increasing the conforming loan limit the maximum size loan that the gses may purchase despite these efforts financial markets continue to experience significant turmoil

problems relatively small drop in the market value of firms assets can cause significant capital reduction if the firm is highly leveraged leverage refers to the ratio of firms equity capital to its other assets the greater this ratio the more vulnerable the firm is to falling asset prices if firm is leveraged 101 and it has 100 in assets then it has 10 in equity capital and 90 in liabilities in this case 5 drop in the value of the firms assets would reduce assets to 95 results from 5 loss because assets equal liabilities plus owners equity and liabilities have not changed the 5 loss comes out of equity capital the firms equity would drop from 10 to 5 still solvent in this example if the firm had been leveraged 251 instead of 101 then the firm would start with 100 in assets 96 in liabilities and 4 in owners equity the same 5 drop in asset values would completely wipe out owners equity and cause the firm to be insolvent 1 equity key principle of financial markets is that highly leveraged firms can become insolvent for relatively small decreases in asset values therefore the damage to the financial system from nonperforming loans can be several times the increase in default rates 43 policymakers have encouraged the financial sector to attempt to rebuild equity capital early in the financial crisis hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds invested in some troubled us financial firms investment banks may prove more difficult to recapitalize than commercial banks regulation does not specify minimum capital standards for investment banks their leverage ratio is largely limited by the confidence or lack thereof that financial markets have in 42 crs report rl34427 financial turmoil federal reserve policy responses by marc labonte 43 crs report rl34412

their liquidity drying up if at the same time that they lose liquidity they happen to be undercapitalized or near insolvent then they may not survive number of factors contributed to the increase in leverage in recent years and the process of reducing leverage may be difficult one factor that contributed to the increase in leverage during 20022005 was low interest rates across the globe which made it very easy to use shortterm debt to finance risky activities 44 another factor was the increased use of structured finance securitization which allowed banks and other loan originators to move assets off of their balance sheets even though they were still exposed to some risk if the loans failed to perform as expected45 third factor contributing to leverage was the use of complex financial derivatives which had the potential to reduce financial risks but also had the potential to increase financial risk g22g152g152g561g5g152g150g153g149g142g161g561g157g152g561g8g138g146g149g501g561 complex financial derivatives have been characterized by some observers as financial weapons of mass destruction financial derivative is contract in which two or more parties agree to payment if referenced financial instrument chan ges price or otherwise satisfies conditions set in the contract46 examples of financial derivatives include interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps that help firms that are exposed to interest rate risk or exchange rate risk hedge against unexpected market events the contracts are typically tradable which has benefits for the market as whole as well as for the two firms entering into the contract the ability to trade the derivatives grants the two parties more liquid asset the ability to trade the derivatives also provides information to the market as whole because the observed price of the contracts is clue to market expectations about the future move ments of interest rates exchange rates etc cost to this increased liquidity is that linkages among firms through the derivative contracts can become very complex and it may become difficult for parties to assess whether their counterparties can actually honor all of their derivative contracts 47 the complexity of derivatives contracts has made policymakers uncertain as to the repercussions of allowing major participant in financial derivatives markets to fail one worry is that there would be long period of uncertainty during the unwinding of the derivatives contracts that could potentially freeze global financial markets in two previous episodes policymakers chose to facilitate the unwinding of the derivatives contracts during the russian debt crisis the federal reserve facilitated the unwinding of long term capital management ltcm although the federal reserve did not directly provide funding 48 for bear stearns the federal reserve helped arrange an acquisition by jp morgan and the federal reserve also helped provide the financing49 one interpretation of the

g22g158g155g150g152g146g149g561 troubles in financial markets do not always spill over into other economic sectors such as industrial production agriculture services or other parts of the broader economy because the current turmoil has lasted more than year wh ile national unemployment had remained relatively low by historical standards although rising and economic growth remained positive although low for much of that time some have questioned whether there is evidence that the current financial turmoil has had significant real effects third quarter 2008 growth has been preliminarily assessed by the commerce department as negative although the fall in house prices could directly reduce consumer spending by making home owners feel poorer socalled wealth effect most economists consider the prim ary way that financial market turmoil affects the broader economy to be by making it more difficult to get loans which restricts business investment and consumer purchases of durable g oods the evidence of such effects is thought to be largely in financial market spreads the difference between the interest rate on less risky debt such as us treasuries and the rates paid by banks firms and consumers interest rate spreads remained elevated after august 2007 even in the interbank market where banks lend to each other treasurys initial draft for the tarp program was developed the weekend following the large spike in interest rate spreads on september 14 2008 interest rates can be an indicator of financial market spillovers the rates at which market participants borrow is typically above the rate that the us government borrows although not all governments enjoy low borrowing costs the difference between market rates and the us government rate for debt of similar maturity called spread can be an indicator of the degree of confidence that market participants have in each other among other factors wide spread can be an indicator of lack of confidence whereas narrow spreads can be an indicator that markets do not demand high risk premium figure 3 shows the spread between commercial paper one form of shortterm private loan used mostly by large highquality corporations and shortterm treasury securities in figure 3 the spread remains relatively narrow from september 2003 until august 2007 which is considered the beginning of the liquidity crunch the spread on commercial paper spiked in august 2007 remained volatile during the next year and then spiked again in september 2008 the financial market interventions between august 2007 and september 2008 apparently failed to restore market confidence as result private borrowers continued to pay high interest rates even as interest rates on us treasury debt declined the spike in september of 2008

by mortgage equity withdrawal to access households perceived incr ease in wealth now that house prices have stopped rising nationally and are falling significan tly in some areas mortgage equity withdrawal has longer been contributing much to consumer spending in some cases lenders have been seeking to cancel or reduce lines of credit they had extended on homes although falling house prices could possibly have negative wealth effect few people fully tapped their home equity so the reduction in the lines of credit is not widely expected to have large effect furthermore according to the mortgage bankers association national delinquency survey 97 of home owners are not in the foreclosure process and ggregate consumer spending levels did not decline for the first year of financial turmoil although consumer spending growth was below trend whether due to rising unemployment wealth effect from falling house prices the stock market declines in the fall of 2008 or other factors

than working directly through consumer spending financial market turmoil is generally considered to affect the broader economy by reducing the availability of credit to firms and consumers rising default rates and falling asset prices reduce the value of the assets on bank balance sheets as discussed above banks are leveraged so that fall in the value of their assets can significantly damage their capital falling house prices have the potential to cause mortgage lenders both liquidity and solvency problems in response banks may become hesitant to part with cash and may therefore choose to tighten their lending standards low risk borrowers may be able to qualify for loans possibly even at low interest rates but many higher risk loans might not be granted at any interest rate it is possible to observe low interest rates in these circumstances with relatively little actual lending taking place the evidence in the current market is consistent with tightening lending standards and reduced credit availability the survey of bank lending managers showed tightening lending standards since the beginning of the financial market turmoil reductions in the federal reserves policy interest rate have not as yet been followed by loosening lending standards spreads between treasury rates and consumer loans such as mortgage rates initially remained elevated so that the reduction in the feds rate provided little relief to borrowers facing an increase in their mortgage rate the tarp program can strengthen bank balance sheets in several ways under tarp treasury can directly inject capital into the bank balance sheet though the preferred share stock purchase program this creates larger cushion between banks current standing and insolvency tarp also enables the treasury to remove troubled assets from bank balance sheets this increases the institutions liquidity but does less for bank solvency tarp can also allow financial institutions to insure their troubled assets which would make those assets more liquid but may also do little for bank solvency tarp permits direct assistance to homeowners which would presumably be aimed at reducing default rates reducing default rates by fully paying loans could in theory simultaneously remove the stigma of mortgagerelated assets increase their price and their liquidity and restore some bank capital

tight lending standards tend to reinforce delinquencies and foreclosures some borrowers may have taken out large mortgages when credit was easy and rates were low with the intent of refinancing their loans before maturity tightening lending standards reduce their ability to refinance on favorable terms and make it less likely that they can keep their house not only do tight lending markets reduce the ability of current residents to pay their loans but strict lending standards also make it less likely that third party can be found to purchase the house as result foreclosures can add to the unsold inventory of homes which tends to drive down prices and further depress bank balance sheets some fear that this process can become selfreinforcing because rising delinquencies might also result in tight lending conditions

definition of troubled asset under the tarp statute grants treasury the discretion to implement any of these options individually or in combination although treasurys original proposal focused on
