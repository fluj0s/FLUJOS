free trade agreement fta it provides an overview of the current status of the negotiati ons review of the 2008 talks an examination of leading issues that have arisen during the negotiations review of us interests in the proposed agreement summary of the potential effects of fta on bilateral trade and an overview of the legislative procedures to be followed if the prop osed fta is presented to congress for approval the proposed usmalaysia fta is of interest to congress because 1 it requires congressional approval 2 it would continue the past trend toward greater trade liberalization and globalization 3 it may include controversial prov isions and 4 it could affect trade flows for certain sensitive goods and industries in the united states since the us trade representative announced on march 8 2006 the bush administrations intent to negotiate free trade agreement with malaysia eight rounds of negotiations have been held proposed ninth round of talks scheduled for november 2008 were postponed until after president barack obamas inauguration once it became apparent that several outstanding issues remained unresolved since the postponement malaysia has suspended the bilateral negotiations possibly in response to us support for israels military operations in gaza efforts in 2008 to complete the fta negotiations by the end of the bush administation were unsuccessful there is general agreement that one major sticking point is malaysias government procurement policies which give preferential treatment for certain types of malaysianowned companies other key outstanding provisions of the possible fta as of the end of 2008 were intellectual property rights protection protection of malaysias agricultural and automotive industry and trade in services areas of particular interest to us exporters include reduction of malaysian trade barriers to automobiles and certain agricultural products provisions for the enforcement of intellectual property rights and broader access to malaysias service sectors such as financial services telecommunications and professional services both nations could potentially see economic benefits from the proposed fta but there will be both winners and losers in both nations as well as in other nations not part of the bilateral agreement overall bilateral trade flows would pr obably rise possibly at the expense of some domestic and foreign manufacturers and their workers in 2007 the united states was malaysias largest trading partner while malaysia was the united states tenth largest trading partner the united states was malaysias top export market and its second largest supplier of imports in 2007 in addition the united states may also accrue some political benefits from the proposed fta an fta with malaysia would strengthen us ties with moderate democratic muslim nation it would also support us efforts to be view ed as more engaged in southeast asia this report will be updated as circumstances warrant

successful on the world market malaysia has long protected its automobile manufacturing industry from foreign competition using high tariffs and nontariff trade barriers government policies also distinguish between national cars ie made by domestic producers such as proton and perodua and nonnational cars which include most vehicles manufactured in malaysia by nonmalaysian owned firms the firms making national cars for example receive 50 rebates on their excise taxes bumiputera also are favored in receiving permits to import or distribute motor vehicles the government has however begun to dismantle some of its protections in order to meet its commitments to the wto and the asean free trade agreement in january 2004 the government completely eliminated local content requirements that were inconsistent with its obligations under the wto but government policies particularly its excise taxes on automobiles continue to block open trade in the automotive sector malaysia imposes 30

fishermen and other groups as well as from opposition political parties in some cases opponents to usmalaysia fta from both nations have formed coalitions84 with respect to labor interests the aflcio opposes additional ftas unless they contain meaningful protections for workers rights and environmental standards its position is that the bush administration launched or concluded bilateral free trade agreements that include enforceable protections for core workers rights and move backwards from previous accords on workers rights and contain many of the same flawed rules that have worsened our trade deficit under the north american free trade agreement nafta 85 labor organizations also are interested in ensuring that labor laws in the bilateral trading partner country are brought up to international labor organization ilo standards and that dispute settlement or enforcement mechanism is included in agreements that would preclude partner countries from reversing labor gains or weakening labor laws following congressional approval and implementation of their respective ftas 86 during the presidential campaign barack obama expressed some support for the labor unions concerns about the labor provisions of the negotiated ftas with colombia and south korea labor conditions in malaysia have been the subjec t of some international criticism according to malaysian law workers are afforded variety of rights and most workers have the right to engage in trade union activity however according to the latest us state department country report on malaysia only 95 of the labor force was represented by trade unions 87 in addition malaysian trade union officials report extended delays of up to four years in obtaining legal recognition of their union specific area of international concern has been the working conditions of malaysias estimated 25 million immigrant workersmost from indonesiawho reportedly face abuse and exploitation by employers and recruitment agencies 88 there has also been organized opposition to usmalaysia fta from malaysians on january 11 2007 an antifta campaign in northern malaysia resulted in petitions with over 20000 farmer and

economic and social impact of the proposed fta was conducted90 opposition to an fta also may arise from various special interest groups for example public citizen nonprofit consumer advocacy organization in the united states maintains that the fta with central america is based on the same failed neoliberal nafta model which has caused the race to the bottom in labor and environmental standards and promotes privatization and deregulation of key public services 91 in malaysia people concerned about the cost of pharmaceutical drugs especially treatment for hivaids are opposed to possible provisions in the fta that they believe will raise the cost of prescription drugs in malaysia92 another possible issue complicating the negotiations could be us relations with israel malaysia currently does not have diplomatic relations with israel and requires export licenses for all goods sent to israel us law currently contains several provisions designed to undermine official boycotts and trade embargoes aimed at israel 93 as previously mentioned us support for israels military operations in gaza have given rise to boycott of us products and calls to suspend the fta negotiations during recent congressional consideration of other proposed ftas opposition concerns have been addressed either in the implementing legislation or by securing various commitments in writing from the administration for example in congressional consideration of the dominican republiccentral americaunited states free trade agreement drcafta the bush administration assuaged opposition from labor sugar and textile interests by promising certain actions to ameliorate adverse effects of the proposed fta in letter the administration promised to allocate 40 million of fy2006 foreign operations appropriations for labor and environmental enforcement capacity building assistance and to continue to request this level of funding in budgets for fiscal years 2007 through 200 9 the bush administration also stated that it would not allow the drcafta to interfere wi th the operation of the sugar program through fy2007 as the program is defined in the farm security and rural investment

statute requires the president to notify congress of his intention to enter into the agreement at least 90 calendar days before entering into the trade agreement since the presidents trade promotion authority expired on july 1 2007 and the president did not notify the congress by the april 2 2007 deadline the usmalaysia fta became ineligible to be considered under the 2002 tpa as result there are several possible scenarios under which proposed fta with malaysia might be considered by congress first if congress were to extend renew or revise trade promotion authority then the usmalaysia fta might be considered under the provisions of new tpa law second congress could choose to pass legislation providing temporary or limited tpa for the proposed usmalaysia fta this approach was used when congress considered the uruguay round agreements third congress coul d consider the proposed usmalaysia fta without tpa as it did with the usjordan fta however consideration of the proposed fta with malaysia without tpa would potentially allow congress to amend the implementing bill in ways that could modify the terms of the trade agreement in the meantime while negotiations with malaysia on the proposed fta are incomplete the legislative policy options include consultations with the executive branch holding oversight hearings on pertinent us trade policy and relations with malaysia and other nations and working with interest groups that either support or oppose the proposed agreement pl 107210 section 2104 provides for close consultations wi th the executive branch during and following the negotiations such consultations could lead to changes in the draft agreement before it is signed 101 for more detailed information about trade promotion authority see crs report rl33743 trade
