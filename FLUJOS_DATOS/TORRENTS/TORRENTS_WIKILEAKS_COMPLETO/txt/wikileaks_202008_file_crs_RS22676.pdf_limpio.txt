disabilities act ada carol toland american law division november 7 2008 abstract the americans with disabilities act ada 42 usc 12101 et seq is broad nondiscrimination statute that includes prohibition of discrimination in public transportation to prevent such discrimination the ada imposes several aﬃrmative obligations on transportation providers including requirement that providers oﬀer separate paratransit service or accessible origintodestination service for eligible individuals with disabilities under the statute the level of such service must be comparable to the level of service oﬀered on ﬁxed route systems to individuals without disabilities department of transportation regulations implement this comparable standard with speciﬁc requirements regarding the scope and manner of paratransit service regarding the time taken by providers to respond to individuals requests for paratransit service recent case law suggests that providers legal obligation under the ada and accompanying regulations is to avoid discriminatory patterns or practices of

the services programs or activities of public entity or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity1 in the context of public transportation the statute requires transportation entities to offer supplemental paratransit service for people with disabilities the statute provides it shall be considered discrimination for public entity which operates fixed route system to fail to provide paratransit servi ces that are sufficient to provide to such individuals level of service 1 which is comparable to the level of designated public transportation services provided to individuals without disabilities using such system or 2 in the case of response time which is comparab to the extent practicable to the level of designated public transportation services provided to individuals without disabilities using such system 2 all public entities operating fixedroute system are subject to the adas complementary paratransit requirements the ada defines fixedroute system as system of providing designated public transportation on which vehicle is operated along prescribed route according to fixed schedule3 public entity is any state or local government any department or instrumentality of state or local government the national railroad passenger corporation and certain commuter authorities4 also the subcontractors of such public entities are subject to these obligations even if the subcontractors are private entities5 g18g138g155g138g157g155g138g151g156g146g157g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 the department of transportation first promulgated regulations to implement the adas public transportation provisions on september 6 19916 under these regulations each public entity operating fixed route system excluding commuter bus commuter rail and intercity rail systems must provide comparable paratransi t service for individuals with disabilities7 paratransit service generally defined is responsive accessible origintodestination transportation service that is an alternative to fixedroute system it is important to note that paratransit requirements do not authorize public entities to supercede the adas other nondiscrimination provisions althou gh the regulations obligate entities to offer paratransit service the regulations also forbid entities from requiring their customers with disabilities to utilize the paratransit services instead of the services available to the general public 1 42 usc 12132 2008 2 42 usc 12143a 2008 3 42 usc 121413 2008 4 42 usc 121311 2008 5 ada regulations allow

disability deny to any individual with disability the opportunity to use the entitys transportation service for the general public if the individual is capable of using that service8 furthermore entities shall not require that individuals with disabilities sit in specific seats9 or be accompanied by an attendant10

paratransit service it merely requires entities to offer level of service that is comparable to the level of service offered to the general public 11 the ada therefore required the department of transportation to develop minimum service criteria to determine the level of services sufficient to be comparable with services offered to individuals without disabilities12 note that the regulations do not prohibit public entities from offering paratransit services that exceed these minimum service requirements13 g7g149g146g144g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561 the regulations require entities to provide paratransit service to all paratransiteligible individuals14 including nonresident visitors who present documentation that they are ada paratransit eligible15 an individual is paratransiteligible if he or she is an individual with disability who meets the requirements for one of three categories the first eligibility category includes individuals who are unable as result of physical or mental impairment to board and ride accessible fixedroute transit systems16 department commentary accompanying the final rule shows that the department intended this first category to especially target individuals who are unable to navigate the system17 the second eligibility category includes individuals who are able to use accessible vehicles but whose fixedroute system lacks accessible vehicles18 finally the third eligibility category includes individuals who have specific impairmentrelated conditions which prevents such individual from traveling to boarding location or from disembarking location on such system 19 the regulations also require entities to provide paratransit service to one individual accompanying each paratransiteligible individual20 this accompanyingindividual allowance does not address assistance by personal care attendants rather it enables individuals with 8 49 cfr 375b 2008 9 49 cfr 375c 2008 10 49 cfr 375e 2008 11 42 usc 12143a

regulation regarding minimum service times implements the adas comparable requirement in straightforward manner it provides that public entities must offer paratransit services for the same time frame for which they offer fixedroute transportation service to the general public 22 g8g138g155g142g156g561 the regulations allow entities to charge higher fare to paratransit riders than they charge to general riders however the fare charged to paratransit riders cannot exceed twice the amount charged to an individual for similar trip on the general fixedroute transportation service 23 likewise the entity cannot charge premiums above this amount unless the premium is charged for services that exceed the minimum service requirements mandated by the regulations24

25 for bus systems this requirement refers to threequarters of mile on either side of the fixedroute corridor and includes small areas not inside any of the corridors but which are surrounded by corridors26 for rail systems this requirement refers to threequartermile radius surrounding each rail station27

intentionally left ambiguous whether origintodestination service means doortodoor or curbtocurb service preferring to leave that specific operational decision to locallevel decisionmakers 29 however in later guidance documents the department has clarified that it would be inappropriate for an entity to establish an inflexible policy that refuses to provide service to eligible passengers beyond the curb in all circumstances30 21 49 cfr 37123f1i 2008 2249 cfr 37131e 2008 2349 cfr 37131c 2008 24 for more information about charging premiums for paratransit service see

multiple regulations govern entities obligati ons regarding the time it takes to respond to an individuals request for paratransit service one responsetime regulation the nextday service requirement provides brightline rule it requires transportation entities to provide paratransit services for the day after paratransiteligible person has requested them31 that regulation further states that although entities can negotiate pickup times they cannot move the requested time by more than one hour32 second department of transportation regulation which governs capacity constraints seems to allow for flexibility in the nextday service provision requirement it provides an exclusive list of ways in which entities cannot limit the availability of complementary paratransit service thereby suggesting that other manners of limiting the service are acceptable specifically this capacity constraints regulation prohibits limiting paratransit service in any of the following ways 1 restrictions on the number of trips an individual will be provided 2 waiting lists for access to th service or 3 any operational pattern or practice that significantly limits the availability of service to ada paratransit eligible persons 33 this regulation also provides examples of discriminatory patterns or practices including substantial numbers of significantly untimely pickups for initial or return trips b substantial numbers of trip denials or missed trips and c substantial numbers of trips with excessive trip lengths 34 at least one court has interpreted the departments multiple regulations regarding paratransit response times as being somewhat in tension35 in anderson v rochestergenesee regional transportation authority the second circuitrelying on department of transportation commentary accompanying these regulations an agency opinion letter addressed to the court and opinion letters issued by the federal transit administrations office of civil rightsinterpreted the nextday service requirement 49 cfr 37131b as imposing an affirmative obligation on public entities to plan design and implement paratransit service that meets 100 of demand and accounts for fluctuations in demand over time 36 additionally it interpreted the more flexible capacity constraints regulation as functioning to give entities practical flexibility when situations arise for which advance planning is difficult37 therefore the court held that transportation provider cannot be held liable for failing to meet 100 of demand for paratransit services unless the failure results in denying number of paratransiteligible riders sufficient to constitute pattern or practice 38 in anderson plaintiffs argued that the rochester genesee regional transportation authority rgrta public entity for purposes of the ada violated the ada when it denied them and other disabled riders paratransit services scheduled day or more in advance39 rgrta admitted denying rides requested day or more in advance by paratransiteligible riders but claimed that it 31 49 cfr 37131b 2008 32 id 33 49 cfr 37131f 2008 34 49 cfr 37131f3i 2008 35 see anderson v rochestergenesee

capacity40 the court held that rgrta had violated the ada because rgrta s organizational records showed that rgrta had anticipated an increased demand for paratransit services and yet failed to plan or change its operations in order to meet that demand similarly in martin v metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority plaintiffs sued the metropolitan atlanta mass transit authority marta alleging in part that marta discriminated against riders with disabilities by failing to provide adequate paratransit service 41 the martin court held that the plaintiffs had substantial likelihood on the success of the merits for their paratransit claim because operational patterns and practices in marta s paratransit service had significantly limited the availability of service to paratransit eligible persons in violation of the ada42 according to the court martas tr oubling practices included changing ready times without properly notifying riders and charging riders for paratransit service even when the driver arrived more than thirty minutes after the scheduled ready time in sum the available case law interpreting the paratransit response time regulations appears to suggest that under the nextday service requirement entities must plan to meet 100 of demand for nextday service to paratransit riders however the case law also suggests that under the capacity constraints regulation entities can be held liable for failing to provide nextday service only if such failure results in one of the three situationswaiting lists restricting rides for an individual person or

waiving the obligation in cases where providing such service would impose an undue financial burden on an entity43 the regulations delineate 10 factors for the federal transit administration to consider when determining whether an entity is entitled to an undue burden waiver44 these include 1 effects on current fixed route service 2 average number of per capita trips made by the general population as compared with the average number of per capita trips made by paratransit riders 3 reductions in other services 4 increases in fares 5 resources available to implement complementary
