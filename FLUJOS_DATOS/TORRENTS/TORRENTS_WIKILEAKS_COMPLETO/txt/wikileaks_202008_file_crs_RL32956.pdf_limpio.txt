watershedgreat lakes water withdrawals legal and policy issues introduction1 the great lakes basin is the worlds largest system of fresh water and the lakes themselves store nearly onefifth of the wo rlds surface freshwater because less than 1 of great lakes water on average is renewed annually many are concerned with potential threats to their water levels and quality including environmental and climatic changes and most particularly an increase in the overall demand for the withdrawal of great lakes water withdrawal means the taking of water from surface or groundwater by any means w ithdrawal that transfers water from the great lakes basin into anot her watershed or from the wa tershed of one of the great lakes into that of another is generally called diversion 2 when the withdrawn water is lost or otherwise not returned to the great lakes basin due to evaporation incorporation into products or other processes consumptive use has occurred while the effects of such activities on the great lakes individually and cumulatively are not completely unde rstood lower lake levels could cause significant environmental social and economic harms some observers assert that the pressure to divert great lakes water to regions across the united states and throughout th world is growing communities are looking to the great lakes as feasible water supply because of concerns with population growth persistent drought and contaminated or ex hausted well water some view the communities lying just outside the great lakes basin as presenting the largest demand for great lakes water in the near future though the possibility of exporting water under trade agreements also has raised concern these potential threats have prompted reevaluation of the frameworks that regulate the use withdrawal and diversion of water from the great lakes basin and for some call for new basinwide wate r conservation standard on july 19 2004 the council of great lakes governors cglg nonpartisan

two canadian provinces ontario and quebec the basin comprises the great lakes connecting channels tributaries and groundwater that drain through the area up to the trois rivières québec see figure 1 the great lakes watershed is the largest system of fresh surface water in the world nd covers approximate ly 300000 square miles the great lakes themselves contain an estimated 5500 cubic mile s or six quadrillion gallons of water this constitutes near ly 90 of the surface freshwater supplies of the united states and 20 of the rface freshwater supplies of the world3 since the great lakes cover wide area physical ch aracteristics such as topography soils and climate also vary considerably water levels and flows the water levels of the great lakes are affected by number of factors including precipitation evaporation groundw ater surface water runoff diversions into and out of the system and regulation some of these factors are controlled by the seasons which can bring varying levels of precipitation and runoff to the lakes for example levels are high in the spring nd summer when runoff is high and rapid but low in the winter when little or runoff occurs as system the great

the tourism and fishing industries in the great lakes are estimated to be worth about 4 billion each and navigation through the great lakes is responsible for more than 180 million tons of shipping annually th great lakes basin also generated approximately 15 of the us gross domestic product for 20068 ninety percent of the water withdrawals from the great lakes basin are from the lakes themselves with the remaining 10 coming from tributaries and groundwater sources water is withdrawn from the great lakes to support number of purposes including municipal needs irrigation industries power plants and livestock several studies conducted dur ing the mid1990s estimated that from 55 to 57 billion gallons per day 8588 cfs of water is withdrawn includes diversions from the great lakes9 most of the water withdrawn however returns to the basin only small percentage roughly 5 is actually consumed eg evaporation incorporated into products or crops from th great lakes and therefore lost from the basin10 the percentage of water consumed varies with the type of use for example approximately 95 of the wa ter withdrawn from the great lakes is for hydroelectric power eg driving turbines and cooling reactors however less than 1 of that water is consumed11 public water supply followed by industrial use and irrigation are the highest consumptive uses in the great lakes basin12 reports indicate that 33 of the total consumptive use of wate r from the basin is in canada and 67 is in the united states with per capita consumptive use pproximately equal13

climatic variations15 geologic processes16 variations in precipitation evaporation and runoff population growth and changes in land use ie farm to urban yet many contend the greatest threat to water vels in the great lakes would be through excessive consumptive withdrawals without accompanying conservation17 such withdrawals may come as result of growing domestic and international demand for great lakes water according to most studies proposals to withdraw great lakes water are most likely to come from growing communities st raddling the boundary of or just outside the great lakes basin the demand for great lakes water from these communities is thought likely to increase due to population growth climatic changes eg persistent drought and cont aminated or exhausted water supplies for

to areas in southwest and southeast united states19 some are also concerned with the idea of exporting great lakes water in bulk to waterthirsty areas around the world th at are similarly suffering from poor water quality and exhausted water s upplies while most believe that the prospect of exporting great lakes water in bulk by ta nker or other means has largely vanished in recent years because of public outcr political reaction and high cost20 some are becoming increasingly alarmed due to the development of free trade agreements since the extent to which water can be traded and protected under such trade agreements remains unresolved many fear that great lakes water could be traded like any other commodity see later discussi on indeed the export of water appears to becoming more

pipes to maintain recreational and other activities some contend that changes in scenic areas and the envir onment would lower tourism and recreation24 lower water levels may have some positive impacts such as lowering the potential for flooding and increasing the ar ea of beaches in some regions of the basin25 most experts believe that there is still much to be learned regarding the effects of water withdrawals climate change and consumptive uses on the great lakes moreover trying to determine the individual impact of single factor may be difficult to quantify since one or more may have measurable impact or may be subject to various interpretations accord ingly many have b ecome concerned with the cumulative effects of these factors on the great lakes the lack of certainty in predicting future water levels in conjunction with the cumulative impact that many of the above factors may have on lake leve ls has made many to regard precautionary approach as the most appropriate standard for considering water withdrawals26 legal and policy frameworks the withdrawal of water from the great lakes has concerned the united states and canada since the 1800s because the great lakes basin borders two countries several states and provinces and various tribal territori lawmakers have generally pursued multijurisdictional regional and cooperative appr oaches for the protection of the lakes accordingly the withdrawal of great lakes water is governed by number of federal state and provincial laws international agreements and tribal water rights the following analysis focuses on the us federal laws and policies that regulate the withdrawal of water from the great lakes as well as the institutional bodies that play ro in overseeing such regulation the early years an early attempt to resolve boundary wa ter disputes between the united states and canada resulted in the creation of the boundary waters treaty of 1909 bwt and the formation of the international joint commission ijc representative body of us and canadian officials blished to resolve situations unique to boundary waters the bwt defines boundary waters as those lakes and rivers alonghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32956crs9 27 the specific exclusion of tributary waters from the treaty could be significant for example lake michigan being wholly insi the united states does not appear to be part of the boundary waters under this definiti on but rather would be considered tributary waters article ii of the treaty nonetheless appears to allow the other party to have the right to seek legal remedies for any resulting injury from the diversion of tributary waters 28 james p hill great lakes commentary the new politics of great lakes water diversion canadami chigan interface 1999 t

including tributaries the great lakes charter however is not gally binding and represents kind of gentlemens agreement between the governors of the great lakes states and the provinces of ontario and quebec30 congressional involvement congress endorsed some of the prohibitive concepts from the great lakes charter by including section in the water resources development act of 1986 wrda 1986 that prohibits the diversion of water outside the great lakes basin unless such diversion is approved by th governors of all great lakes states31 still the prohibitions in wrda 1986 as well as the charter lacked mechanisms to legally bind canada and to address the growing concern over the possibility of trading great lakes water internationally this issue came to the forefront in 1998 when the ontario government granted permit to th canadianbased nova group to ship up to 600 million liters 159 million gallons of wa ter annually for five years from lake superior to asia this amount of water was insufficient to trigger the consultation and approval process of the charter but it did prompt lawmakers to reexamine existing great lakes water management pr inciples and conservation measures in response one of the first steps the united states and cana da took to address concerns about removals of water from the great lakes was to request the ijc to examine and report on the consumption dive rsion and withdrawal of waters from the great lakes basin as well as on the current laws and policies that affect the sustainability of the water resources in the basin in its report the ijc recommended that the united states and canada notify each other of any proposals for major new or increased consumptive uses of water nd that they develop and strengthen the standards set forth in the great lakes charter32 the canadian diversion proposal also sparked active dialogue in the 105th and 106th congresses initially in october 1998 the h ouse passed hres 566 which called on the president and the senate to work to prevent the sale or diversion of great lakes water in mass quantities until procedures were established that would guarantee that any such sale was approved by the united

withdraw 100000 gallonsperday gpd or greater average in any 30 day period or divert any amount of water is required to register the withdrawal or diversion with the originating state the compact prohibits all new or increased diversions from the great lakes unless the proposed diversion is an intrabasin transfer39 or moves water to one of the following locations straddling communities means any incorporated city town or the equivalent thereof wholly within any county that lies partly or completely within the basin whose corporate boundary existing as of the effective date of this compact is partly within the basin or partly within two great lakes watersheds httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32956crs13 40 see eg 49 of the compact requiring only ne w or increased w ithdrawals of 100000 gpd or greater in straddling communities to meet the exception standard 41 the compact also allows new or increased withdrawals consumptive uses and diversions of basin water within the state of illinois pursuant to the supreme court decree in wisconsin v illinois 388 us 426 1967 amended by 449 us 48 1980 but requires the state to seek formal input from ontario nd quebec if it wishes to modify the decreecommunities within straddling county means any incorporated city town or the equivalent thereof that is located outside the basin but wholly within county that lie s partly within the basin and that is not straddling community in addition to meeting the criteria listed in the exception standard in certain circumstances40 each of the above categories has more precise qualifications and requirements for example straddling community that intends to transfer water must ensure that the water is 1 used solely for public water supply purposes within the straddling community and 2 returned with limited exceptions either naturally or after use to the source watershed proposal to transfer water to community within straddling county must demonstrate that ther is reasonable water supply alternative within the basin in which the community is located and that the proposal will not endanger the integrity of the basins ecosystem straddling county proposals and some intrabasin transfer proposals must be approve d by all members of the council with respect to the regulation of new or increased withdrawals and consumptive uses each state will have the flexibility to determine thres hold levels based on volume location the nature of use and othe r factors if party does not establish its own review threshold within 10 years of th effective date of the compact it would be required to manage and regulate all new or increased withdrawal proposals of 100000 gpd or greater average in any 90da period for consumptive use proposals of 5 million gpd or greater the originating state must provide all other states and the provinces period of 90 days to comment on the proposal proposals for new or increased withdrawals and consumptive use must meet the decisionmaking standard41 for some water withdrawal proposals regional review is required under the compact regional review means the collective review by the agreements regional body members of the council and the premiers of ontario and quebec see below pursuant to the compact the fo llowing water transfers require regional review diversions to straddling communities that result in new or increased consumptive use of 5 million gpd or greaterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32956crs14 42 in some cases withdrawal proposal cannot be approved by the originating party if it is inconsistent with its applicable standard thus in practice the findings of the regional body may significantly affect the progress of wit hdrawal proposal 43 compact at 451f 44 compact at 422 45 compact at 423 intrabasin diversions that result in new or increased consumptive use of 5 million gpd or greater and diversions to straddling county proposals for exceptions subject to regi onal review must be submitted by the originating party and where applicable to the council for concurrent review regional review is to be completed within 90 days after receiving notice of the proposal although regional review would involve the canadian provinces in the oversight of these three types of propos als the compact does not require actual approval by the regional body see agreem ent discussion thus the canadian provinces could not technically prevent these types of diversions from occurring under the compact though the regional review process may provide some limitations42 majority of the regional body may also request review of regionally significant or pot entially precedent setting proposal43 moreover the compact states that it is the parties in tention to submit proposals to the regional body for review which might incl ude more than those required the compact calls on the signatory states to develop and implement water conservation and efficiency programs that collectively will ensure improvement of the waters and water dependent natural resources of the basin protect the integrity of the basin ecosystem and retain and restore the quantity of surface water and groundwater in the basin within two ears of the enactment of the compact each party is required to devel op its own water conservation and efficiency goals and objectives that are consistent with basinwide objectives each party is also expected to develop and implement water conservation and effici ency program that can be either mandatory or voluntary44 even though programs ar required to reflect basin wide objectives some might question why they are nonbinding one potential reason would be to allow parties flexibility to create programs that match their needs and geography every five years the council in coopera tion with the provinces will review and modify basinwide objectives based on new technologies new patterns of water use changing demands and threats and cumulative impact assessment see below for description45 the compact requires the great lakes stat in cooperation with the provinces to conduct periodic assessment of th cumulative impacts of withdrawals diversions and consumptive uses the assessment is to be conducted every five years or each time the incremental basin water losses reach an average of 50 million gallons per day over any 90day period in excess of the quantity at the time of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32956crs15 46 compact at 4151most recent assessment whichever comes first the assessment is expected to form the basis for reviewing the standard of review and decision and the regulations implemented by the council and parties the assessm ent will use current and appropriate guidelines for c onducting such review cons ider the effects of climate change and other significant threats to basin waters and consider adaptive management principles and approaches46 the appropriate and current guidelines for conducting the assessment are not defined in the compact and is unclear if they are expected to be consistent among parties the compact also establishes procedures whereby the public and tribes may comment on the proposals nothing in the compact is intended to affect the application of the boundary waters treaty of 1909 the great lakesst lawrence river basin sustainable water resources agreement the final agreement is brokenup into ven chapters and basically mirrors the requirements threshold leve ls and standards scribed in the compact under the agreement review of proposal to deter mine its consistency w ith the standard will be conducted by stateprovincial regional body regional review under the agreement is required for the same three types of proposals that require regional review in the final compact instead of voting process the agreement requires that the regional body declare whether proposal is consistent with the standard through public declaration of finding in the event that some of the members of the regional body do not be lieve the proposal is consiste nt with the standard the declaration of finding is to present the different points of view and indicate each partys position the state or province where proposal originates must consider the declaration of finding before it makes decision on the proposal the agreement is intended to be nonbinding yet serve as guiding document for water management and withdrawal procedures issues each version of the compact and agreem ent generated much debate earlier versions received thousands of comments from the public some of which applauded the efforts made

water outside the basin provided they use containers that are 57 gallons or smaller57 critics argue that the apparent loophole will open the door to more bulk water withdrawals and challenges under nafta because it allows great lakes water to be treated as product or commodity58 bottled water companies contend that their withdrawals in the great lakes region are not unprecedente d and would

failed to do so expressly 1a norman j singer statutes and statutory construction 239 at 462 6th ed 2000diversions as problematic61 relatedly others conte nd that the standard does not adequately protect the environment some suggest for example that the cumulative impact terminology is an ineffective way to decide when to stop water project because it is vague and will be assessed only every five years62 on the other hand others argue that consistent basinwide standards will lead to effective water management and provisions that lower cumulative adverse impacts will help improve the environment63 critics also contend that the compact would substantially increase the likelihood of long term lowvolume wa ter diversions from the great lakes because it imposes limits on the total volume of water that may be removed or the durati on of such withdrawals64 others counter by saying that environmental limits to water withdrawals have not been studied and that determining how much water is too much to remove from the great lakes should be an adaptive process based on monitoring and periodic evaluations the compact addresses this issue indirectly by sta ting that proposal will comply with the standard if it results in significant individual or cumulative adverse impacts to the quality and quantity of the natural resources of the basin further the impacts of water level decreases are tempered by provision in the standard that requires water withdrawn to be returned to the source wa tershed less an allowance for consumptive use legal although many of the legal concerns rais ed in earlier drafts were addressed by the final compact some questions remain for example there appears to be some ambiguity related to the compacts potential effect on the governors veto authority under wrda 1 986 as amended currently each great lakes state retains the power to unilaterally veto and essentially prevent the diversion or export of great lakes water outside the basin the compact does not indicate what its effect would be on wrda which may complicate courts interpretation of the related yet fundamentally different provisions some might argu that approval of the compact would implicitly repeal the governors veto power65 congress may also explicitly repeal the wrda veto authority upon approval of the compact it obtained the force of law under the us

some role in overseeing the international provinc ialstate agreement its gally nonbinding nature under international law would appear to limit congresss direct role on the other hand the compact has achieved full force and effect after the great lakes states approved it and congress consented to it the following paragraphs outline some of the basic legal concepts for compacts including the

may grant advance consent by authorizing all compact s which subsequently may be established in particular field75 in addition to expressing consent eg joint resolution congress may also implicitly
