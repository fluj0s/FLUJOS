nuclear explosions it was opened for signature in 1996 as of march 2008 178 nations had signed it and 144 had ratified to enter into force 44 specified nations must ratify it 35 have done so the senate rejected the treat in 1999 the bush administration opposes it the united states has observed nuclear test moratorium since 1992 there have been many calls worldwide fo r the united states and others to ratify the treaty many claim that it would pr omote nuclear nonproliferation some see it as step toward nuclear disarmament several measures have been introduced in congress regarding the treaty it might become an issue in the presidential election the us debate involves arguments on many issues to r each judgment on the treaty should it come up for ratifica tion vote in the future senators may wish to balance answers to severa l questions in net assessm ent of risks and benefits can the united states maintain deterrence without testing the treatys supporters hold that us programs can ma intain existing tested weapons without further testing pointing to 12 annual assessments that thes weapons remain safe and reliable and claim that these weapons meet any deterrent needs opponents maintain that there can be confidence in existing warheads because many minor modifications will change them from tested versions so testing is needed to restore and maintain confidence they see terrence as dynamic requiring new weapons to counter new threats and assert that these weapons must be tested are monitoring and verifica tion capability sufficient monitoring refers to technical capability verification to its ad equacy to maintain security supporters hold that advances in monitoring make it hard for an evader to conduct undetected tests they claim that any such tests would be too small to affect the strategic balance opponents see many opportunities fo r evasion and believe that clandestine tests by others could put the united states at seri ous disadvantage how might the treaty affect nuc lear nonproliferation and disarmament supporters claim that the treaty makes t echnical contributions to nonproliferation such as limiting wea pons programs some supporters believe that nonproliferation requires progress toward nucl ear disarmament with the treaty key step opponents believe that strong nuc lear deterrent is essen tial for nonproliferation that nonproliferation and disarmament are unrelat ed and that this nation has taken many nonproliferation and disarmamen t actions that the international community ignores this report

144 of them had ratified2 to enter into force 44 nations with nuclear reactors must ratify it so far 35 of them have ratified and another 7 have signed the united states signed the treaty in september 1996 the senate rejected it in october 1999 nuclear test bans have long histor see appendix there has been strong international support for test ban treaties us opinion s been divided most us presidents have sought agreements to limit testing the eisenhower administration devoted great but unsuccessful effort to negotiating treaty the kennedy administration sought ctbt when th at proved nonnegotiable it achieved the limited test ban treaty ltbt in 1963 which bans nuclear tests in the atmosphere under water and in space the nixon ad ministration negotiate d the threshold test ban treaty ttbt with the soviet union in 1974 which limits underground tests to yield of 150 kilotons3 the ford administration negotiated the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty pnet in 1976 whic h extended the 150kiloton limit to peaceful nuclear explosions the carter administr ation did not pursue entry into force of these two treaties but sought ctbt par tly because of strong opposition within the administration treaty was concluded the reagan ad ministration rejected the ttbt and pnet because of verification c oncerns but in 1987 began to negotiate new verification protocols the george hw bush administration concluded negotiation of these protocol s the senate approved the two treaties in 1990 and they entered into force in that year president bush also signed into law provision implementing ninemonth moratorium on nuclear testing starting in october 1992 president clinton extended the moratorium he had initially thought to pursue test ban treaty of limited duration and permitting low explosive yield but in 1995 he opted for ctbt of zero yield and unlimited duration the george w bush administration has continued the morato rium but has not pursued the

and us scientists have made progress in maintaining nuclear weapons wit hout testing both topics were of concern in the 1999 debate others hold that monitoring capability is insufficient and that new

campaign5 several bills and resolutions in the 110th congress call for ratification of the ctbt6 opinions on the treaty refl ect contending views on how to obtain security the role of nuclear weapons nuc lear nonproliferation and its relationship if any to nuclear disarmament and in ternational relations gene rally 1 some opponents would revoke the us signature of the tr eaty and resume testin g to maintain us nuclear weapons weapons expertise and th credibility of the nuclear deterrent and to develop new weapons 2 some supporters and opponents prefer to maintain the moratorium because of concern for politi cal and internationa l ramifications but would test if necessary to fix warhead problem 3 some supporters favor the treaty on grounds that it has significant va lue for nonproliferation and can help the united states monitor nuclear testing by other nations 4 others favor the ctbt as step toward abolition of nuclear w eapons while many pe ople of all stripes favor abolition of nuclear weapons as an u ltimate goal those in the fourth group see abolition as realistic if longterm possibility and believe that the ctbt is critical step toward reaching that goal these views are on continuum with overlaps and shades of gray between positions still others feel the treaty would make little difference in restraining weapons devel opment because techni cal advances enable such development without testing or that it would make little difference in countering nuclear proliferation as sta ndalone measure while the united states has observed nuclear test moratorium since 1992 few appear to hold it as their preferred position instead the treatys s upporters accept the moratorium as better than return to testing and oppone nts accept it as better than

three aspect s of how the treaty might affect us security that were prominent in the 1999 debate the ctbt and deterrence monitoring and verification nd implications for nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament in the public deba since 1999 ctbt s upporters have written extensively on all aspects of the treaty while opponents have written much less to provide balance crs has obtained ma ny comments from people representing all perspectives as result this report cont ains substantial amount of new material can the united states maintain deterrence under the ctbt during the cold war the united states and soviet union engaged in an arms competiti on often called an arms race or actionreaction cycle this compe tition was dynamic the united states built submarines carrying ballistic missiles the soviet union followed suit the soviet union built deeply buried bunkers for its leaders the united states built very high yield weapons to destroy them scores of such examples could be listed despite this effort us and soviet nuclear strategies and programs resulted in rough parity between the two sides and the cold war passed into history with nuclear or conventional war between them while deterrence has had many permutations over the years most in the united states supported it during the cold war for want of better alternative to be sure some argued that the united states should s eek superiority while others held that minimum deterrent sufficed others reluct antly supported deterrence as an interim measure arguing that while it purports to reduce the risk of nuclear war that very outcome could be expected if low probability per year is aggregated over many years despite these differing views c ongress supported the forces to implement deterrent strategy over many decades th capability to deter the soviet union was by far the most stressing case so it was seen as more than sufficient to deter other threats7 in that environment nuclear testin g served many purposes nuclear tests were mainly conducted for weapons development but also for safety weapons physics stockpile confidence and certifica tion of modifications tests also served to maintain skills in weapons science engineering and manufacturing and to demonstrate the credibility of the us deterrent with the end of the cold war and the soviet union the comfort of dealing for four decades with

this changed situation there re mains wide but not universal agreement in the united states on the need to maintain nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future lawrence korb and max bergmann of the center for american progress wrote to maintain an effective deterrent the united states must continue to possess conventional and nuclear forces capable of quickly and decisively destroying these regimes referring to extreme regime s such as iran and north korea9 sidney drell and james goodby in an arms cont rol association repor t estimate that us strategic force of some 500 operati onally deployed warheads would be more than adequate for deterrence this for ce level would be enough to provide degree of flexibility in fluid security envir onment responsive force of 400 to 500 warheads would supplement this force10 the administrations nuclear posture review of 2001 stated that with the end of the cold war us nuclear forces still require the capability to hold at risk wide range of target types this capability is key to the role of nuclear forces in suppor ting an effective deterre nce strategy relative to broad spectrum of potential opponent s under variety of contingencies11 at issue though is what is needed fo r deterrence the aim of deterrence has always been to make an adversary fear it will suffer unacceptable consequences if it takes certain actions many believe that the ussoviet deterrent relationship worked during the cold war because threat s were credible and each side understood the consequences of attacking the other in the postcold war post911 world many questions arise who is to be deterred by what threats what weapons are needed to make them credible is deterrence dy namic with constant weapons development needed to respond to changing threats or is modest number of nuclear weapons of existing designs together with us c onventional forces and economic might more than sufficient are existing nuclear weapons sufficient to deter north korea or are new ones needed that could destroy unde rground bunkers where leaders might hide or is the nation so irrational that it is be yond deterrence or is north korean nuclear attack wildly implausible is satisfactory outcome possible through diplomacy what capabilities are needed to deter iran or to roll back its nuclear program do nuclear forces have any relevance to terring terrorists or their state

skilled personnel supporting us nuc lear weapons this question is considered first because th capabilities are the bedrock on which nuclear weapons rest can existing weapons be maintained without testing this is necessary criterion for deterrence under the ctbt as it would take many years to develop and deploy new weapons does deterrence require new wea pons that incorporate new military capabilities and is testing required to develop them do us weapons need more featur for safety and security and is testing required to add them such features might deter terrorist attempts to seize

implication of ctbt of unlimite d duration is that over time we would gradually lose our pool of knowledgeable people with experience in nuclear weapons design and testing consider what would occur if the united states halted nuclear testing for 30 years we would then be dependent on the judgment of personnel with personal experience either in designing or testing nuclear weapons in place of learning curve we would experience an extended unlearning curve20 such uncertainties cast doubt for some nators on the ctbt senator olympia snowe said there are ssp methods that are yet to be proven

it has attracted and maintained scientists and engineers and provided new worldclass tools for understanding nuc lear weapon performance and advancing weapon science but i have three salient concerns first us nuclear weapon pit production was st opped in 1989 leading quickly to halt in weapons production the capability to produce nuclear weapons has atrophied since then second we have not conducted underground nuclear tests since 1992 and we are running risks regarding the safety relia bility and performance of the stockpile third periodic surveillance of the aging stockpile has revealed the necessity to initiate life extension programs to re furbish several warhead types this process introduces new materials and components into the warheads which introduces the possibility of birth defects that raise risks37 supporters claim that safeguard c the basic capability to resume nuclear test activities has been met as nnsa reduced the time needed to conduct nuclear test from 36plus months to 24 months38 opponents respond that without nuclear testing the capability to test declines as skills atrophy proce dures become outdated and equipment falls into disuse safeguards d

maintaining the nuclear deterrent wa s crucial opponents held that without testing it would be impossible to do so as former secretary of defense james schlesinger testified in the absence of sting confidence in the reliability of the stockpile will inevitably ineluctably decline39 they questioned whether the united states could in 1999 if ever rely on ssp to maintain weapons the treatys

that unless we felt that we could maintain credible nuclear deterrent and also safe and reliable stockpile41 since 1999 support has continued for this nation to mainta in nuclear weapons as long as it retains them there are thr ee main approaches for so doing supporters of the reliable replacement warhead rrw program and supporters of the life extension program lep each argue that their approach will reduce the likelihood of testing while the other will increase it in contrast others believe that neither rrw nor lep can provide sufficient confidence in the safety and reliability of current

confidence without nuclear testing however the fy2008 c onsolidated appropriations act pl 110161 eliminated rrw funds leaving its prospect s unclear an issue for any future ctbt debate is which approach rrw or lep is less likely to require nuclear testing in the long term43 nnsa claims that rrw will make the need for testing unlikely because of steps to increase confidence for example rrw designers used high margins basically building in more performance than is needed to make material deterioration or design or manufacturing defects less likely to degrade warhead performance below the minimum required they argued that they could do so because the design was unconstrained by technologie s and design choices made decades ago they view added margin as the single most important goal of the design another basis for confidence is that the design stayed close to past experience lawrence livermore national laboratory which designed the nuclear components of wr1 states that components very similar to those of the wr1 were nuclear tested in the past for this and other reasons there is direct nuc lear test proof that the wr1 design will perform properly44 nnsa and its labs have expressed cerns that over the long term minor changes to current warheads through repeat ed leps will introduce defects and make it harder to maintain reliability possibly requiring nuclear testing they argue that leps replace defective or deteriorated components with replicas as thomas dagostino said the w76 lep and the life extension approach is an exact rebuild of what weve had in the cold war stoc kpile we try to mimic the manufacturing processes exactly the wa it was done 30 years ago45 the concern is that components and manufacturing processes cannot be replicated precisely pushing the warhead beyond the design envelope validated by nuclear testing46 this problem could result in defects in lifeextended warheads that could cause them to fail lep supporters question whether rrw will provide high confidence as steven fetter of the university of maryland said like most other warheads rrw will have or could be expected to have birth defects or reliability problems that would be discovered and corrected soon af ter the warhead was deployed one can say whether the unreliabilities introduced by these birth defects would be greater or smaller than the unreliabilities that would

in this view the united stat must conduct nuclear tests regardless of political concerns because only sting can maintain confidence52 this section has discussed three views rrw is less likely to require testing than lep lep is less likely to require testing than rrw and the united states can have confidence in neither rrw nor lep without testing one could argue fourth view that both rrw and lep are unlikely to need testing this view could lead to mixed leprrw force as henry obrien of lawrence livermore national laboratory stated our best approach fo r small stockpile and complex would be to retain couple of the better current w eapon types ie those with relatively higher margins more advanced safety and secu rity technologies and more sustainable materials and replace the rest with small number of rrw types53 does deterrence require new warheads that must be tested ctbt opponents argue that the ability to maintain existing weapons without testing through lep even if it can be done misses the point deterrence as they see it requires continuing to hold at risk assets that enemy leaders prize however they argue current nuclear warheads have many limitations current warheads which were designed during the cold war were given high yield to destroy hard targets like soviet missile silos but that yield in this view could cause the united states to refrain from using these weapons out of concern for inflicting massive civilian casualties in the target area and beyond as 2006 defense science board study stated weapons that are not seen as useable and effective by potential adversaries cannot be an effective reliable deterrent54 current warheads if exploded near the earths surface would leave much residual radiation that would contaminate large areas and kill

new weapons that could only be developed with nuclear testing the threat reduction advisory committee an expert panel advising dod stated that one reason to test would be to support certification prior to qua ntity production of new nuc lear weapons should the decision be made that new weapon design requiring testing is the only option to achieve needed capability it provided examples of

suicide teams seeking to gain access to warhead in order to detonate it in place65 the prompt response adding physical security has been costly added usedenial features could reduce the burden on guard forces surety features it is argued would nhance deterrence though in different way than during the cold war one form of nuclear attack would be for suicide terrorists to seize us nuclear weapon and detonate it in pl ace another would be for terrorists to seize us nuclear wea pon dismantle it and use its fissile material to build weapon it is difficult at best to deter terrorists by threatening to use nuclear weapons to destroy city or trai ning camp in response to terrorist nuclear attack they might view us nuclear use as desirable if it turned many nations against the united states instead it is hoped enha nced surety features would deter attack by creating an unacceptable consequence na mely high probability of failure in addition if such attacks were to occur enhanced surety might defeat them weapon designers and nnsa argue that the wr1 design shows that surety features can be added without testing nd see rrw as essential to obtaining them livermore states that the relaxation of we ight constraints for wr1 for example has allowed design that incorporates revolu tionary advances in safety and security without nuclear testing66 in contrast according to nnsa testimony major enhancements in security are not readily available through system retrofits via the lep approach67 ctbt supporters dismiss enhanced surety as an argument for testing they see current weapons as safe enough as show n by 12 assessments and the absence of accidental us nuclear detonations they see goal of as much surety as possible as recipe for unending generations of w eapons to

treaty provide adequate protection against cheating monitoring and verification have been cen tral to the debate and negotiations on nuclear test bans for halfcentury68 while the terms are often used interchangeably there is difference monitoring involve s looking for indicators that nuclear test has taken place it is dynamic contest between hiders and seekers with ctbt supporters showing that monitoring capability is improving and treaty opponents raising doubts about that capability and cla iming that evasion cap ability is improving verification literally truth making involves deciding whether nation is in compliance with its treaty obligations at issue is not perfect verification but effective verification in 1988 paul nitze offered wi delyused definition by effective verification we mean that we want to be sure that if the other side moves beyond the limits of the treaty in an militarily significant way we would be able to detect such violation in time to re spond effectively and thereby deny the other side the benefit of the violation69 thus monitoring is technical activity that provides data while ve rification uses the data to form judgments on compliance it is for this reason that the ctbt establishes an international monitoring system and leaves it to individual nations to determin whether nation has violated the treaty monitoring capability the military value of clandestine tests and effective verification are linked if as hypotheti cal example tests above 01 kiloton had significant military value and the threshold of detection was 10 kilotons the ctbt could not be effectively veri fied but it could be if the numbers were reversed thus ctbt opponents claim the threshold for detec tion is high and that for military valuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34394crs20

however members and staff received extensive classified briefings from scientists from the national laboratories and from the intelligence community70 since 1999 scientists have made many advances in

reports rebut claims of progress in monitoring nevertheless ctbt opponents have devel oped many arguments so any future debate on monitoring is likely to be less lopsided than one might infer from the imbalance in writing what does the treaty ban article i of the ctbt sets out the treatys basic obligation each state party undertakes not to carry out any nuclear w eapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion the treaty does not define nuclear explosion yet it is physically possible to conduct tiny nuclear explosi ons that cannot be detected without cooperative measures for example th united states c onducted several dozen hydronuclear tests many releasing fission energy equivalent to less than gram of high explosive during the 1958 1961 nuclear test moratorium73 as discussed later some see the prospect of undetected tests of very low yield as concern as result point of contention in the 1999 debate wa s whether the treaty barred very low yield tests some ctbt critics argued

paragraph explains terms and concepts relevant to the question of what is nuclear explosion fissile material is one whose atoms split fission when struck by neutron regardless of its speed uranium235 and plutonium are the fissile materials used in atomic bombs each nuclear fission releases tiny amount of energy as well as two or three neutrons selfsustaining nuclear chain reaction occurs if the number of neutrons produced by fission equals the number of neutr ons that escape the material or are absorbed within it without causing further fissions c riticality is the point at which this chain reaction occurs critical mass is the amount of fissile material just enough to support criticality the amount of material for cr itical mass depends on many factors such as shape density impurities that absorb neutrons and use of material to reflect neutrons back into the fissile material nuclear reactor is an example of critical chain reaction it releases energy in controlled manner in contrast chain reaction in which the number of neutrons generated increases over time is said to be supercritical an atomic bomb exemplifies supercritical chain reaction releasing vast amount of energy in tiny fraction of second the energy released is expr essed as yield it is typically measured in kilotons where one kiloton equals the ener gy released by the explosion of 1000 tons of tnt modern nuclear weapons typically have yields in the range of tens to hundreds of kilotons in contrast several types of expe riments producing little to nuclear yield have been conducted over the years hydronucl ear experiments were conducted during the 19581961 nuclear test moratorium they initially used less than critical mass of fissile material as the amount of this material was stepped up toward criticality from one experiment to the next some of these expe riments resulted in the release of tiny amounts of energy from fission even as little as gram of tnt equivalent or less hydrodynamic experiments implode pit the first stage or trigger of nuclear weapon in order to examine how the pit behaves these experiment s use nonfissile material as surrogate for fissile material so they cannot become cr itical subcritical experiments examine how plutonium behaves when subjected to spike in pressure such as when struck by an explosivedriven metal plate the plutonium is configured in way such as by its shape and quantity that it cannot go criticalby the treaty74 in this view then russia might conduct militarily us eful lowyield nuclear tests and still consider itself as observing the ctbt administration officials responded that all parties understood the treaty was zero yield under secretary of state john holum said that the treaty does ban any nuclear test explosion or any other nuclear explosion and in the negotiating record it is very clear that that means there cannot be any critical yield from nuclear event you can do things that do not go critical you cannot do things that do75 76 ambassador stephen ledogar who retired from the fo reign service in 1997 and was the chief negotiator for the ctbt under presidents reagan bush and clinton elaborated as the name suggests the treaty imposes comprehensive ban on all nuclear explosions of any size in any place i have heard some critics of the treaty seek to cast doubt on whether russia in the negotiating and signing of the treaty committed itself under treaty law to truly comprehensive prohibition of any nuclear explosion including an explosion or experiment or event of even the slightest nuclear yield in other word s did russia agree that hydronuclear experiments which do produce nuclear yiel d although usually very very slight would be banned and that hydrodynami c explosions which have yield because they do

unresolved in 2007 letter the state department stated the department of state is not aware of any international agreement on what zero yield means during the negotiation of the treaty the p5 reached an understanding that subcritical nuclear xperiments would not be prohibited under the treaty the united states also made clear that in its view supercritical nuclear explosivedriven device test s would be prohibited under the treaty however there was agreement among the p5 that criticality would be the basis for determining which activities would be permitted under the ctbt and which activities would not be permitted therefore it is left to the individual state party to decide for itself whether st that produced more than zero yield would violate the treaty78 how capable is the ctbt monitoring regime monitoring systems and methods because of concerns that states parties to the ctbt could cheat and thereby change the strategic balance the ability to monitor the treaty has always been an integral part of the debate over the treaty monitoring has always been more diffi cult for underground nuclear tests than for tests in other environments radioactive particles in the atmosphere fallout are readily detectable in trace amounts sound waves in the oceans travel great distances tests in space can be detected by national technical means it is for this reason that the

ts the claim of low detection threshold for nonevasi ve underground tests seismic technology seismology has been used for decades to detect and differentiate between eart hquakes and explosions though it is very difficult for seismology to differentiate between conventional and wyield nuclear explosions earthquakes and explosions generate many types of seismic waves that propagate through the earth various techniques ar used to obtain more information from these waves for example seismic rrays are typically groups of 5 to 30 seismometers spread out over several square kilometers linked to central point89 because of the distance between seismometers seismic waves from an event arriveat each seismometer at slightly different times these differences can be used to calculate the direction from which the waves arrived this technique has been in use for decades other techniques also help extract in formation some seismic waves are teleseismic detected even at distances over 9000 km 90 for example an ims station in south america tected seismic waves from the 2006 north korean nuclear test91 some teleseismic waves travel along the earths surface while others travel through the interior of the latter some are shear waves an earthquake generates them strongly as the two sides of fault slide pa st each other others are pressure waves an explosion generates them strongly as the pressure of an explosion radiates outward the appearance of shear and pr essure waves on seismogram differs giving clue whether an event is an ear thquake or explosion another difference is that the first waves from an explosi on arrive suddenly while those from an earthquake build up over short time mo re recently regional seismic waves have come into use to differentiate between ear thquakes and explosions these waves are generally observed at distances of up to 2000 km they can often be detected even when teleseismic waves from an event cannot be the direction from which seismic waves from an event arrive at multiple seismic stations around the world can be us ed to determine the approximate location of the event the magnitude of seismic waves can also be used to calculate the

decoupling as method of evading seismic detection it dates from the late 1950s94 this technique involves setting off blast in an underground cavity large enough to absorb the force of the blast elastically thus muffling the resultin g seismic signal critics point to 1966 decoupling experiment conducted in salt dome in mississippi in which 038 kiloton explosion generated seismic signal that appeared to be from an explosion oneseventieth as large95 larry turnbull of the central intelligence agency said in judging whether this evasion scenario is credible both the feasibility of constructing large cavity and of containing the debris from the nuclear explosions must be examined construction of large cavities in both hard rock and salt is feasible with costs that woul d be relatively small compared to effort to produce the material for nuclear vice containing both particulate and gaseous debris is feasible in salt and more difficult though not impossible in hard rock therefore we judge that the cavity decoupling evasion scenario to be credible and should be factored into any underground ctb monitoring96 ctbt supporters respond that while decoupling works for very low yield explosions it is much harder for larger ones the national academy of sciences nas report raised ten difficulties in c onducting decoupled test such as constructing cavity clandestinely predicting the signals from the test ensuring that the yield of the device is not greater than planned and containi ng radionuclides it finds accepting the possibility of cavity d ecoupled test we

former assistant director for nuclear and weapons c ontrol arms control and disarmament agency and robert barker former assistant to the secretary of defense for atomic energy reject the claim that the earth and rock removed to create cavity would be an indicator of decoupling in india where the very test site used had been closely observed such activity was detected prior to nuclear test98 ctbt

excavation could be used to create large cavities in salt domes in particular according to the state department iran presents particular challenges from seismic detection perspec tive irans vast numbers of salt domes offer an effective decoupling environment making detection par ticularly difficult in the absence of closein sensors100 supporters of the treaty point to numer ous advances in seismological capability that would help monitor the ctbt foremost is the ongoing rollout of the ims many of its seismic and othe r stations around the globe pr ovide data to idc in real time as the ims is an international system many of its stations are in areas that the united states could not access such as in iran further it is important that the seismic stations will contribut regional as well as telese ismic data because regional data is of particular value in detecting lowyield tests and decoupling one source states regional waves enhance the ab ility to detect cavity decoupling because higher frequency waves are more observabl at regional distances and decoupling is smaller at higher frequencies co mpared to tele seismic waves 101 regional stations have proven more valuable than was expected according to uk seismologists when the ims was negotiated the rationale for auxiliary seismic stations those that provide data only when interrogated not on continuous basis to the international data center was that these stations would improve the ability of the ims to locate seismic events and to more finely characterize the seismic source with the ongoing deployment of the ims seismologists have discovered that the auxiliary stations are of partic ular value for identifying the source of seismic signal as an earthquake or explos ion because they pick up certain seismic waves that can be used in identification in addition it has turned out that having many seismic stations such as thos in individual national or university networks complements the ims stations and increases the availability of data102httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34394crs28 102 continued personal communication october 11 2007 103 paul richards and wonyoung kim seismic signature nature physics

ures in addition to characteristics of seismic waves help di fferentiate between earthquakes and explosions finding that the epicenter of an event is more than 10 km deep rules out an explosion as does finding the epicenter at sea in the absence of hydroacoustic waves indicative of an explosion other characteristic s specific to local geology aid determining whether an event is an earthquake or explosion the ctbto preparatory commission states that ims stations around the world detected the north korean nuclear test of 2006 and ims was able to locate the test to well under 1000 square km as another indicator the seismic record shows clear difference between that explosion and an earlier earthquake according to seismolo gists paul richards and wonyoung kim the seismogram of 9 october 2006 the north korean test has three important features first it shows an impul sive onset of compressional waves characteristic of an explosion second peaks indicative of shear waves in the earths crust which would be typical of an earthquake are very weak and third shortperiod rayleigh waves ar apparent they are known to be excited only by sources at depth not mu ch more than about 3 or 4 km which is much shallower than typical earthquakes103 critics point to evasive tactics and weaknesses in seismic monitoring that open prospects for clandestine testing yield can be calculated from the magnitude of seismic waves yet many factors affect the intensity of seismic signals in addition to the yield of nuclear device the nas report states regional waves are dependent on local properties of the eart hs crust and uppermos t mantle which can vary strongly from one region to another104 for example device detonated in soft rock can have ten or more times the yield as one detonated tamped fully coupled in hard rock yet the seismic signals from each can indicate the same apparent yield because soft rock transmits seismic energy much less efficiently than does hard rock105 an evader knowing this from the unclassified literature would consider this difference in selecting st site while ctbt supporters note that regional seismic signals can aid in detecting loweryield nuclear detonations opponents reply that russia and china did not permit ims stations to be located within hundreds of kilometers of their nuclear test sites at novaya zemlya and lop nor respectively the closest ims station is 1112 km from novaya zemlya and 783 km from lop nor in contrast the thr ee ims stations closest to the nevada test site nts are at dist ances of 249 380 and 417 km106 the state

better off if we had closein seismographs around lop nor and novaya zemlya if ims were allowed to install three seismographs surrounding lop nor at th distances similar to those surrounding the nts it would be much easier not onl to detect smaller events but also to identify the nature of smaller events nd to determine better location as well as the origin time107 iran has numerous salt domes many hundr ed of miles from the ims station near teheran critics argue that iran could eas ily create cavities for decoupling by using water to dissolve salt it has extensive experience in drilling for oil which is often found near salt deposits as such it is ar gued it is well equipped to excavate cavities for decoupling further much of iran is seismically active making it easier for iran to conduct test during an earthquake to mask the explosions signals others respond that hiding test in an earthquake requires holding the test in readiness possibly for years for the right earthquake to come along and it may still be possible to distinguish signals from an earthquake from those of an explosion other techniques can also reduce ismic signals from underground nuclear tests don linger senior scientific advisor advanced systems concepts office defense threat reduction agency and former director of the defense nuclear agencys nuclear effects testing progra m provided the following information108 one technique for reducing seismic signals is geologic preconditioning nuclear test in hard rock will fractur or microfracture the surrounding rock to distances of several hundred meters fragmenting it and changing the shock propagation and attenuation characteristics as result test conducted underground in hard rock geology region in which previous nuclear test was conducted will in effect be conducted in fragmented rock which absorbs much more energy than undisturbed rock weakening the seismic signal this attenuation was observed in experiments using 100 tons of chemical explosive conducted by the us departments of defensedefense nuclear agency now the defense threat reduction agency in series of tests in kazakhstan during the closing of the former soviet nuclear test site in 1993 to 2002 moreover the russian test site at novaya zemlya which is comprised mainly of similar hard rock has similar regions of preconditioned hard rock created by previous tests that could be used to muffle seismic signals of clandestine tests this is proven technology clearly understood by the testing community second technique to reduce seismic si gnals radiation spectrum tuning is to reduce the radiation coupling of the nuclear device to the ground the amount of energy that nuclear device deposits into the surrounding geology is very sensitive to specifics of its radia tion output spectrum nd strongly affects the manner in which the blast is coupled to the ground causing large changes in the ground shock and seismic signature radiation spectrum is entirely different than yield for given test cavity 10kiloton weapon with energy concentrated in the thousandelectronvolt range will produce significantly lower seismic signal than 10kiloton weapon with elec tromagnetic energy concentrated in the tensofmillionelectronvolt range nuclear explosives have been designed with different energy spectra for example the us plowshare program of

china which have stockpile of cavities left by nuclear test explosions and possibly to india and pakistan which may have few small cavities but not to other nations opponents dismiss this argu ment because they view the prospect of russian or chinese covert testing as the greatest threat proponents in turn reply that the decoupling capability of geolog ic preconditioning would vary greatly depending on specifics of the surrounding rock and the extent of its fracturing which would be extremely difficult to determine regarding radiation spectrum tuning proponents ask if modifications to the test device that would be needed to reduce the seismic signature would interfere with th purpose of and results from the test so much as to diminish its value significantly seismic monitoring entails other arguments critics state that the ability to detect loweryield tests increases manyfold the number of seismic events that must be analyzed as possible nuclear tests supporters reply that improved seismic detection and data analysis capability rule out most such events as possible explosions and that lowyield tests are of little military signifi cance critics respond that lowyield explosions have military significance as discussed below and that it would be easier for idc to miss lowyi eld explosion among thousands of low magnitude earthquakes than to miss highe ryield explosion supporters retort that the north korean test of october 2006 was cl early detected even though it had yield of less than kiloton critics counter that it was not conducted evasively detection of radioactive gases nuclear explosions generate great variety of radioactive atoms or radionuclides some of wh ich are gases of special interest are radioactive isotopes of noble gases such as argon37 krypton85 xenon 131 and xenon133 the background level of th gases is extremely low because noble gases are chemically inert they do not bond with the rocks and soil surrounding an underground nuclear explosion as result they work their way to the surface and disperse into the atmosphe re where they may be detected thousands of miles away for example the automa ted radioxenon sample ranalyzer in use by ims concentrates and measures minute quantities of the isotopes of radioactive xenon109 once detection system has accumu lated data archive of background levels of radioactive noble gases spike above that level can indicate re lease from nuclear reactor or nuclear explosion computer models of global atmospheric conditions in the days before spike can then be worked

of the ims an ims radionuclide system at yellow knife northwest territories canada collected samples two weeks after the st that upon analysis indicated trace amount of xenon133 by comparing this amount to data in its archive analysts were able to determine that the level was elevated by examining wind currents for the preceding two weeks and data on releases from the chalk river laboratories canadian nuclear research site several thousand kilometers southeast of yellowknife analysts were able to conclude that th xenon133 was consistent with release from the location and time of the dprk event111 opponents see numerous ways to evade detection of radioactive noble gases they recognize that noble gases will reach the surface if there is effort at containment but believe cont ainment can work they point to statement by donald barr retired alamos radiochemist with over 50 years of nuclear testing and related experience deep burial of nuclear device combined with gas blocking techniques virtually eliminates the seep age of noble gases to the surface though some such gases might occasionally be tected but only at the surface above the detonation point112 burying nuclear test device at greater depth than would be typically used for containment would also delay the time when these gases would reach the surface providing more time fo r radioactive decay to reduce the amount reaching the surface certain geologies such as salt domes would more readily seal the cavity blocking the escape of these gases ctbt supporters point to expe rimental data to buttress their claim that it is very difficult to contain noble gases following an underground nuclear explosion because they rise to the surface through faults or fractures especially during periods of low barometric pressure113 opponents would note that th experiment in question used surrogate gases sulfur hexafluoride and helium3 not argon and xenon further the report stated that the decay of ar gon37 to chlorine37 will

delay inspections beyond the time ch front is due to arrive detection of radioactive particles underground nuclear explosions may vent radioactive particles fallout into the atmosphere where they may travel for thousands of miles depending on wind rain particle size and other factors fallout analysis has provided clear indication of nuclear test for many decades for example the united states learned of the first soviet nuclear test an atmospheric test in 1949 and learned much about the sign of the first soviet thermonuclear device in 1953 through collection nd analysis of these particles115 the ease of detecting fallout particles was main reason why the united states soviet union and united kingdom were able to nego tiate the ltbt in 1963 and worldwide protests against fallout were main impetus for the treaty contending views ctbt supporters assert that containment of radioactive debris from nuclear test is difficult nd many techniques are learned through trial and error geologic features such as fa ults can provide path through which debris can vent certain types of soil or rock are better for contai nment than others underground water turned to steam by an explosion generates great deal of pressure depth of burial must be adequa elaborate methods must be used to prevent debris and gases from escaping through the shaft dug for the test116 despite extensive experience with contained unde rground tests beginning in the 1950s many us underground tests through 1970 re leased radioactive material117 c t b t supporters therefore argue that it would be difficult for russia or china and much more so for firsttime testers to have high confidence that they could contain clandestine test ctbt opponent s respond that russia and china would have high confidence in their ability to contain nuclear test b ecause of their test experience opponents point to us example following the baneberry test of 1970 which vented large radioactive cloud the united states took further steps to contain underground tests and of the 386 postbane berry tests conducted at the nevada test site through 1992 only 2 resulted in accidental release of radioactivity detected outside the test site118 even nations without nuclear st experience could learn much about containment from the open literature and could make containment more likely by burying the test

insar an ea rthquake pr oduces more or less linear pattern caused by the tw sides of fault sliding past each other while an explosion produces roughly circular depression it can help find construction of decoupling cavity as gr ound above the cavity may subside slightly the wide availability of insar data would arguably make request for an osi based on this data more convincing to the ctbto executive council critics respond that insar re quires beforeandafter pict ures of the same piece of ground in order to detect slight subsidence if only an after picture is available the technique is thought to work only for nuc lear tests of 20 kilotons of yield or so level that seismic techni ques can easily locate rendering insar superfluous the state department points to other limitations nasa lawrence livermore national boratory canadian space agency and european space agency all have insar systems and should have libraries of data covering much of the world at least up to middle latitudes however in some areas where there is rugged terrain terrain shadowing will likely cause large areas to be uncovered additionally one would need to have before images that are fairly recent to do an accurate comparison if significant changes have occurred in the terrain other than those caused by the test by wind rain or other natural factors the before im age will not be useful in constructing an insar image furthermore this is comp licated by the fact that the subsidence may not occur until some time after the test perhaps years so whereas libraries do exist without specific tasking theyre unlikely to be good enough further it is particularly noteworthy that evidence of subsidence was observed by the insar technique after the north kor ean test for these and other reasons state concludes the potentia l of insar in assisting det ection of nuclear explosion is limited and cannot be consid ered useful technique in many test scenarios127 critics assert that subsidence could

procedural aspects the treaty and protocol provide for osis in which intern ational inspectors would travel to the site of suspected nuclear explosion to search for conclusive evidence of such explosion for example if the inspection team is able to drill into the cavity formed by nuclear explosion it would have conc lusive proof that test occurred and radiochemical analysis such as the ratio of different is otopes could provide its approximate date the treaty and protocol go into extensiv detail on osis specifying procedures by which the executive council would author ize the start and continuation of an inspection the timeline for an inspecti on the number of team members and equipment they may and may not use these procedures represent compromise between those who wanted highly intrus ive inspections that could be conducted quickly and those who feared that such inspections would reveal military secrets contending views much of the senate deba on osis in 1999 involved the ease of securing executive council permission for an osi according to article ii of the treaty once state party has reque sted an osi 30 of 51 members of the executive council would have to approve to order the in spection ambassador jeane kirkpatrick questioned the competence of the council to make technical decisions related to the treaty each member of the council would have one vote since the council would be based on ge ographic representation many nations on it would have little or nuclear experience further there will be technical support group chosen by the same executive council wh ich is chosen by people the overwhelming majority of whom do not themselves have any experience or competence with nuclear questions much less nuclear weapons129 she also noted bodies are very highly political bodies130 senator richard shelby said that it would be hard to obtain the 30vote supermajority n eeded for an osi to go forward131 while senator joseph biden provided an analysis

medalia questionsseems to pretty darned easy to get to 30 votes not because 30 nations love us but because it is in their naked selfinterest132 another contentious topic is how the pr ovisions of the treaty and its protocol specifying procedures for osis might aff ect the success of inspections opponents assert that many of these provisions impair the technical effectiveness of an inspection some such provisions are lis ted here along with few comments made in 2007 by the state department the protocol limits the inspection team to 40 members except when it is drilling and limits an inspection to 130 days the state department observes the ava ilability of acceptable technically qualified and trained in spectors and inspection assistants operating as cohesive team is factor affecting the adequacy of the osi timeline133 the treaty requires the team to submit progress report within 25 days of the councils approval of the osi the inspection will continue unless majority of th council votes not to do so but according to the state department there is guarantee that the executive council will consider pro gress not defined to be sufficient to justify the osi entering the continuation phase of the inspection134 the protocol permits specified inspection techniques but does not provide for the adoption of new ones this omission may become more significant as new technologies emerge the protocol permits one overflight that may last at most 12 hours and may only use field glasses pa ssive locationfinding equipment video cameras and handheld still cameras unless the state being inspected agrees to more overflight s and the use of other equipment the state department observes state party that conducts test will most likely employ all available means to evade initial detection and following approval of an osi restrict to the maximum extent the use of technologies and techni ques that might otherwise result in detection135 the inspected state has the right to make the final decision regarding any access of the inspecti on team apparently referring to areas within the area to be inspected that the inspected state deems sensitive to protect them the in spected state may shroud sensitivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34394crs37 equipment and restrict radionuclide measurements and the taking of samples to those relevant to the inspection the inspection team may gain access to sens itive fac ilities if the inspection team demonstrates credibly to the inspected state party that access to buildings and other structures is necessary to fulfil the inspection mandate opponents doubt that the inspected state would agree that any such demonstration was credible the treatys supporters recognize that the inspection provisions represent compromise between the ability to find evidence of clandestine test and the ability of inspected states to protect sensitive facilities and guard against espionage supporters observe that these provisions pr otect the united states as well as other nations they note that many provisions of the protocol facilitate inspections inspectors may inspect an ar ea of 1000 square kilometers supporters argue that this is large enough given the ability of monitoring technologies to limit the area to be inspected inspectors shall be chosen on th basis of their expertise and experience supporters note that other possible criteria such as representing regional groupings of states were not used the protocol permits many technolog ies to be used including visual observation video and still photog raphy multispectral imaging measurement of radioactivity environmental sampling passive seismological monitoring for aftershocks unless the executive council disa pproves by majority vote request to continue the inspec tion it may also use active seismic surveys and magnetic and gravitational field mapping if the council approves insp ectors may drill for samples subject to certain limitations the inspection team has the right to collect remove and analyze sample s supporters note that nuclear explosion would create many forms of evidence and that techniques for analysis of samples are highly sensitive while the executive council may rminate an inspection after 25 days supporters of the treaty see th at outcome as unlikely given that 30 of 51 members of the council d to approve the inspection and argue that the evidence needed to gain approval by supermajority would necessarily have been compelling osis technical aspects while the 1999 debate considered procedural aspects of osis it made little reference to their technical aspects yet that issue has been raised for halfcentury for exam ple in 1960 testimony witness pointed to clues of value for an osi nuclear explosion may produce very different

radi oactivity melted snow pebbles in bushes and road and fence displacement the witness point ed out difficulties as well the most conclusive evidence of nuclear test is radioactive debris obtained by drilling into the radioactive zone left by nuclear explos ion yet he calculated the radius of the radioactive zone of 17kiloton expl osion is about 60 feet and it would be necessary to drill 63 holes to have 100 pe rcent chance of finding this zone in an area 500 feet in radius136 contending views technical capability to s upport osis has improved over the years satellite imagery could reveal human activity seismologists have developed techniques to extract more information from seismic data helping to distinguish earthquakes from explosions nd more precisely locating the epicenter of an explosion radioactive isotopes of noble gases might be di scovered at the test site even if they were in such low concentration that they could not be detected at distance insar could greatly narrow the search area it may however be difficult for an osi to find the most conclusive proof of clandestine test drilling into the cavity created by an underground explosion and retrieving radioactive debr is 10kiloton test would produce cavity some 60 meters in diameter137 depending on geology and depth of burial loweryield device would produce smaller cavity the test might or might not result in crater on the earths surface such craters are caused when cavity collapses and the overburden above it collapses into the resulting void all the way up to the surface deeper burial and careful attention to the geology of the test area would reduce but not eliminate the risk of crater formation or of some signs of test appearing at the surface osis could encounter practical problems according to prediction based on an experiment xenon133 and argon37 would be detectable respectively about 50 and 80 days after the detonati on for 1kiloton explosion138 by that time an osi might be completed livermore presents another problem with detecting argon37 there is another smoking gun in lieu of drilling that is argon37 this is noble gas isotope produced by bombardment of calcium with neutrons it gets formed during an underground explosion has fairly long half life and is unique to an underground test ie the backgr ound is low to nonexistent the only problem is that it is difficult to detect and measure because you have to shield the sample from ambient background to high degree ie put the sample in leadlined chamber of some kind to do the measurements the procedure discussed in osi circles has been to take extensive air samples from surface cracks at the suspected site separate the noble gases from the air remove thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34394crs39 139 information provided by lawrence livermore national laboratory personal communication august 31 2007 noble gases ar chemically inert they include helium neon argon krypton xenon and radonradon and then measure for argon37 this would be difficult to do in the field139 ctbt advocates claim that osis by offeri ng proof of clandestine nuclear test would act as deterrent if nation f ears that it would get caught the reasoning goes it would be less likely to conduct nuclear test furt her supporters argue the deterrent effect would be magnified because evaders would not know the thresholds at which various us and international monitoring capabilities could detect various test signatures so they would have to compensate by deeper burial great efforts at containment lower yield and the like moreover it is argued evaders with little or test experience would have little confidence in their ability to predict yield or to contain nuclear explosions forcing them to take still more conservative measures to evade detection such measures it is argue d could make testing so difficult costly and risky as to be not worthwhile ctbt critics respond that car eful attention to evasion would defeat osis and would deter other nations from requesting th em if nation were not sure that it could locate test with an osi or even that test had taken place it would be reluctant to risk its credibility by requesting an osi further in this view while the us monitoring system usaeds may be ab to detect faint signatures that ims cannot the united states may be unwilling to use this evidence to make the case for an osi to avoid revealing capabilities thus an evader would not need to worry about the maximum capability of usaeds at the same time prospective evader could learn the capabilities of ims because st ates parties to the ctbt receive ims data it could for example conduct larg mining explosion and see how it registers with ims as result the treatys opponent s maintain the prospect of osis would merely force an evader to pay close attention to evasion techniques something it would do anyway perversely then the ctbts provision for osis would allow evaders to use the absence of request fo r an osi or the conduct of an unsuccessful osi as evidence that it was not evading ctbt critics challenge the validity of debating technical issues of monitoring verification and evasion on an unclassified basis robert monr oe former director of defense nuclear agency said verification cannot be usefully addressed in unclassified documents verification is twosided game on the one hand many of those around the world who are working to improve veri fication are operating in an unclassified environment and the arms control community trumpets every advance in sensor locations sensitivity networks etc on the other hand our adversaries or potential adversaries who wish to develop or improve their nuclear weapons while maintaining test deniability are work ing with highest priority to improve their evasion techniques they are working in absolute secrecy taking every precaution against being detected the onl organization the us has to counter them is the intelligence community and ev ery scrap of its information collected on evasion improvements is highly cla ssified therefore an unclassified studyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34394crs40 140 personal communication november 5 2007 141 us congress senate

improvements this could lead the unwary to conclude that we are now able to verify ctbt my own impressions based upon many decades of close involvement with nuclear weapons are exactly the opposite i believe the evaders have an easier problem to solve that they are now in comfort zone for undetected testing and that they expect their advantage to improve in the future140 on the other hand as senator j william fu lbright once said the mere fact that information has been classified does not make it n ecessarily true141 similarly the treatys supporters would note the fact that information is unclassified does not make it invalid supporters argue that advances in monitoring capability many of which are unclassified are likely to reveal clandestine testing or preparations for it having unclassified information such as from t housands of seismometers around the world publicly and promptly available increas the number of people who may find evidence of testing while technical m onitoring cannot provide information that human intelligence can on motivations plans and budgets human intelligence can be misleading because of disinformati on misinterpretation re liance on unreliable sources and incomplete information basi ng conclusions on the absence of evidence it is argued may be hazardous former secretary of defense donald rumsfeld reportedly said the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence 142 however the absence of evidence cannot be construed as evidence clearly the senate would consider classified information in any future debate on the treaty but classified details of evasion techniques would have to be balanced against classified monitoring capabilities and both would be only two of many elements of net assessment additional evasion scenarios for decades supporters of nuclear testing treaties have argued that monitoring cap ability is good enough to permit effective verification while critics have responded in part by setting forth scenarios that they maintained would defeat verification this report discussed one scenario decoupling earlier and now turns to two others testing without attribution one scenario envisions conducting one or more tests that would be detected but coul d not be attributed robert barker former assistant to the secretary of defense for atomic energy postulates scenario that involves conducting test in remote ocean area long after identifiable national vessels had left the scene the testing nation would expect the international monitoring system to detect the test and announce the yield and by virtue of its participation in the monitoring community the testing nation would have access to any debris collected for its own an alysis of performance it would be impossible to positively attribute the test to nation if the testing nation took care to ensure that materials were not used in the test such that debris could behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34394crs41 143 personal communication april 28

close proximity to the bomb so that the debris might look israeli or indian or even us143 the national academy of sciences study stated attribution is likely to be more problem atic for an underwater or atmospheric test since nation with nuclear explosiv could detonate it on ship or plane and the effects on the surrounding media would be more ephemeral though such test would likely be detected nd located it might be attributed only with difficulty to the nation responsible to confidently evade attribution tester would need to believe that the united st ates working with other nations did not have the capability to track ships and planes in the vicinity of the test location and would not intercept communications relating to the test144 arguments on this scenario can be played out at length donald barr retired alamos radiochemist states it is virtually impossible to disguise s poof the signatures of nuclear explosive detonation this is because of the broad range of fission pr oduct and actinide radionuclides which are produced instanta neously and then evolve with time according to wellknown radioactive decay laws any attempt to tamper with either or both of these distributions would produce discordance of the radiochemical data suite the likely nature of such an attempted spoof would become apparent through comparison of the radiochemical data with the extensive data base of us tests coupled with everimproving model calculations of nuclear explosives145 critics state that attribution depends on matching sample of radioactive material with sample from an archive of such materials if the sample does not match any in the archive this method pr ovides basis for ttribution supporters counter that detection of debris from nuc lear test would trigger an immediate all out effort by the united states other nati ons and the ctbto to attribute the test the list of potential testers would be quite small easing the task and debris could reveal information about weapon design provi ding further clues as to the testing nation supporters argue that nation woul d probably need test series to have confidence in warhead design increasin g the odds of attribution opponents reply that one successful test might suffice to confirm simple imp losion design and an unsuccessful test might not be detected evading multiple sensors while many signatures could reveal test it might be possible to conceal them all by conducting nuclear test in large cavity excavated in mining complex deep underground large cavity would permit decoupling excavating the cavity deep

ton yield limit would allow studies of boost gas ignition and initial burn which is critical step in achieving full primary design yield152 bruce tarter then director of lawrence livermore national laboratory stated in 1997 if additional tests were to be allowed then 500 tons would be the minimum nuclear test yield that would be of value for validating experimental and computa tional tools used to assess weapon performance for purposes of helping to validate models for assessing weapon safety nuclear test yields of few pounds would be of value153 ctbt opponents hold that lowyield wea pons can have much more value for new or current nuclear powers now than was the case decades ago even within the 1 to 2 kilotons that the nas report us as the upper limit on effective decoupling kathleen bailey and robert barker write one to two kilotons can be militarily and politically significant to any proliferat or with todays commercially available guidance technology one to two kilotons accu

ven the many nuclear weapons of various yields that this nation has they point to an article reporting on an interview with general james cartwright usmc then commander of us strategic command theoretically if grave threat to the united states emerged that could be deterred only by lowyield nuclear weapon the general might be persuaded to support its development cartwright sai d however to date i havent seen anything that approaches that cartwr ight said my priority is not reduced yield cartwright told reporter in apr il 2005 its to take the accuracy to the point where conventional can

reproducing the object but that test might be of yield too high to be concealed159 supporters argue that nations could not develop thermonuclear weapons under ctbt and see very low yield tests as of little value for weapons development according to richard garwin hydronuclear tests w ill provide little useful knowledge and tests of 01 kiloton would have little value in the development of nuclear weapons160 according to the nas report tests up to 1 to 2 kilotons are concealable in some circumstances and could be used to improve unboosted fission weapons or with difficulty for proof tests of weapons of 1 to 2 kilotons tests up to 20 kilotons are unlikely to be concealable they could be used to prooftest 20kiloton fission weapons or for eventual developm ent full testing of some primaries lowyield thermonuclear weapons fina lly tests above 20 kilotons could not be concealed they could be used to deve lop and test boosted fission weapons and thermonuclear weapons161 thus both the value of tests and the risk of being caught are thought to increase with yield at th same time there is general agreement that nation could develop simple gunty pe or implosion weapon with yield of perhaps 10 to 20 kilotons without testing thereby avoiding the need for evasion the nas report observes that nations w ith more test experience could make more progress in weapons program through covert testing but that the threats these countries can pose to us interest s with the types of nuclear weapons they already have tested are large what they could achieve with the very limited nuclear testing they could plausibly conceal would not add significantly to this162 ctbt supporters hold that the united states has lived with the prospect that russia or china could gain an advantage through cla ndestine testing since the us moratorium began in 1992 russia at least has apparently taken different approach to its nuclear weapons program than has the unite d states so that the programs are not strictly comparable for example the nas report states ru ssian nuclear weapons are remanufactured on 10year cycle163 which contrasts with the current us policy of extending the service lives of existing warheads for many years nonetheless ctbt supporters argue that the united states has advanced in its nuclear capability significantly through ssp in their view it would be instructive to ask the current directors of the three us nuclear weapons laboratories if they would rather be in the position of the russi an or chinese nuclear weapons programs even including the possibility of testing at very low yields or the us enterprise with the scientific tools made available by ssp but without testing the nas report summarizes the value of clandestine testing as follows very little of the

adversaries than the worstcase scenario of clandestine testing in ctbt regime within the constraints posed by the monitoring system164 what risks does nation run if it is caught cheating any nation that ratified the ctbt and then sought to cheat would have to evaluate the risks and benef its of clandestine testing in the 1999 debate attention focused on the feasibility of successful chea ting and the military gains that such tests might or might not confer but virtually attention was paid to the risks of being caught nonetheless the question merits consideration because the answer could be crucial to wouldbe evaders calculus possible alternative cases are sketched here further research would be of use it could be argued that there would be few consequences in this view the conference of states parties to the ctbt pursuant to article v of the treaty may recomme nd to states parties collective measures which are in conformity with international law further the conference or alternatively if the case is urgent the executive council may bring the issue including relevant informa tion and conclusions to th attention of the united nations the might take little action or it might delay in particular if evidence of clandestine testing were not conclusive there might be few or penalties another possibility is that the fearful that an unpunished violation could lead to the unraveling not only of the ctbt but also of us willingness to take further steps toward nuclear disarm ament could impose meaningful sanctions yet another possibility is that some nations could take actions outside the framework instead of attempting to conduct clandestine tests nation wishing to conduct one or more nuclear tests might simply withdraw from the treaty the case for so doing is that it might want to conduct test with yield that could not be hidden it might believe that even lowyield test could be detected especially if it had little or experience with nuclear testing nd test containment and it might want to announce its nuclear capabilities to the wo rld but clandestine testing offers advantages an open weapons development pr ogram could spur riva ls to launch their own program so nation wanting to deve lop nuclear weapons might prefer to keep its intent unknown nation that withdrew from the treaty would lose access to ims data which could help it ev ade detection nation that withdrew from the treaty to conduct nuclear tests might f ace the same penalties as one that conducted clandestine tests and was caught cheating and nation might prefer to stay in good

the ctbt is that the treaty would promote nonproliferation some ctbt supporters favor the treaty by itself as means to slow proliferation while other supporters s ee the treaty as st ep toward nuclear disarmament opponents argue that the treaty would weaken deterrence and that nonproliferation and disarmament are not linked some opponents would resume testing promptly to restore confidence in existing weapons develop new ones and train weapons designers while other opponents w ould resume testing only under more limited circumstances such as if problem developed with an existing warhead that could only be fixed through testing greg mello executive director of the alamos study group offers the following view the nonproliferation value of us ct bt ratification depends on other us policies some connected to the treaty nd some not if those other policies build on and implement the ctbt as disarmament treaty as the text of the treaty proclaims it to be it could have significant nonproliferation value on the other hand ctbt that aims to ban the bang but not the bomb and that the united states ratifies and implements on that basis may have little if any nonproliferation value in that case it would be widely and correctly seen as furthering world order based on nuclear double standard for example ratifying the ctbt while making longterm investments to maintain and improve leaner us nuclear arsenal would make mockery of this treaty in the eyes of most of the world merely having ctbt is not enough of goal to provide real improvement in the foreign relations of the united stat freedom from the threat of nuclear attack ie freedom from nuclear deterre nce would be such goal with the ctbt one means to it in contrast shoul d situation arise in which world led by nucleararmed rich states enforced future ctbt regime by threat of military force or by economic sanctions that cause widespread suffering that situation would not be much different than the one we have today prior to ratification and entry into force171 another possible position is that the ctbt would make little difference one way or the other in this view the extent of proliferation is about what it would be had the united states ratified the ctbt this nation has made progress on nuclear nonproliferation despite not having ratified the treaty the weapons labs have supported 12 annual assessments that nuclear weapons re main safe and reliable despite the lack of testing and the strate gic balance favors this nation whether or not russia or china has tested clandestinely thus neither the worst fears of those who opposed the treaty on grounds that deterrence would collapse without testing nor of those who supported it on grounds that us failure to ratify would accelerate nuclear proliferation have been realized this position has received little if any support the treatys technical contributions to nonproliferation ctbt supporters hold that the tr eaty would make

without nucl ear explosion tests but there will always be nagging doubt whether or how well they perform the hiroshima and nagasaki bombs each weighed about 9000 pounds with yield of 15 to 20 kilotons these must be co mpared with twostage thermonuclear bomb tested in 1957 12 years later that weighed some 400 pounds with yield of 74 kilotons its diameter was mere 12 inches with length of some 42

permit development of new weapons training of nuclear designers and other personnel and exercising of the nuclear weapons complex all of which would in this view make the nuc lear umbrella more

npt to grand bargain in which the nws would move toward nuclear disarm ament while the nonnuclear weapon states nnws would forgo nuclear weapons and support nuclear nonproliferation measures they see worl d without nuclear weapons as the best defense against proliferation and progress in this direction as needed to enlist the worlds support on behalf of this goal as result it is argued steps toward disarmament are essential for nonproliferation ctbt opponents however see logical linkage between nonproliferation and disarmament they believe that by claiming article vi of the npt makes this link supporters are trying to shape it to say so mething it does not according to stephen rademaker former assistant secretary of state it is impossible to discern from this language article vi binding legal obligation on the us and the other four nuclearweapon states to give up nuclear weapons the operativ legal requirement is to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament further th npt does not assume that nuclear disarmament must be prerequisite to general and complete disarmament to the contrary one of the treatys introductory paragraphs spells out the expectation of the parties that actual elimination from national arse nals of nuclear weapons would take place not prior to but pursuant to treaty on ge neral and complete disarmament184 supporters reply that article vi is only part of the picture and that the ctbt is necessary first step toward nonprolifera tion and disarmament they note that the united states along with other nws committed to the ctbt in 1995 and 2000 the npt provides for review conferences every five years article x provides that the 25year conference held in 1995 would decide whether the

and urgency of signatures and ratifications without dela and without conditions and in accordance with constitutional processe s to achieve the early entry into force of the comprehensive

liferation were closely linked nonratification of the ctbt has also complicated us efforts to strengthen the international atomic energy agency safeguards that nonnuclear weapon state parties to the npt must have on their civilian nuclear programs many countries are reluctant to accept new obligations while the united states is unwilling to approve the test ban treaty once we ratify the test ban treaty which the rest of the world views as vital for nonproliferation we will be better able to enlist cooperation on export controls economic sanctions and other coordinated responses to specific problems192 former secretary of state george shu ltz former secretary of defense william perry former secretary of state henry kissinger and former senator sam nunn argued the need to link the goal of disarmament and specific steps to achieve it reassertion of the vision of world free of nuclear weapons and practical measures toward achieving that goal w ould be and would be perceived as bold initiative consistent with americas moral heritage without the bold vision the actions will not be perceived as fair or urgent without the actions the vision will not be perceived as realistic or possible one of the eight steps they recommend is initiating bipartisan process with the senate including understandings to in crease confidence and provide for periodic review to achieve ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty taking advantage of recent technical advances and working to secure ratification by other key states193 by the same token some ctbt supporters contend that us

dangerous ly undermined if others believe however unfairly that the terms of the grand bargain have changed that the nuclear weapon states have abandoned any commitment to disarmament the point of doing more on disarmament then is not to convince the iranians or the north koreans i dont believe for second that further reductions in our nuclear weapons would have material effect on their nuclear ambitions rather the point of doing more is this because the moderate majority of states our natural and vital allies on nonproliferation want us to do more and if we do not we risk helping iran and north korea in their efforts to muddy the water to turn the blame for their own nuclear intransigence back onto us they can undermine our arguments for strong inte rnational action in support of the npt by painting us as doing too little too late to fulfill our own obligations194 ctbt opponents dismiss this seeming inte rnational support according to 2007 study by the international security advisory board federal advisory committee for the state department the npt is too important to be left to the npt professionals these professionals perhaps more aptly rmed groupies are an association of government representatives ngos and antiwar antinuclear activists they often carry agendas far beyond th views of their senior government leaders and are quite disconnected from world realities and from the original intention of the npt it is generally believed that the success in the 2000 review was the result of dipl omatic approaches by the clinton administration directly to internationally influential government leaders195 ctbt opponents state that many nations do not need their own nuclear weapons because they rely on the us nuclear um brella they hold that supporters misread the relationship between nuclear weapons and nonproliferation because the nnws are the main beneficiaries of the npt as robert monroe said the real winners from this inequality between nws and nnws are the nnws theyre overwhelmingly better off by not having to fear nucleararmed neighbors and by being relieved of the staggering expens of maintaining nuclear arsenal196 as the international security

free of nuclear weapons200 the ctbts opponents see the treaty as not enforceable they argue that the international community is long on talk but short on action and point to bosnia rwanda and darfur as examples as well as difficulties in imposing meaningful sanctions on iran for its nuclear activities they would be unwilling to rely on the to enforce the ctbt further disarmament would require some means of knowing as baseline how many warh eads china and russia possessed at some point in time since there is technical means of gaining this data it is argued the united states would not know their remaining stocks even if they were to destroy substantial number supporters see this concer n over lack of enforceab ility as misplaced norms and sanctions they argue have an effect south africa argentina and brazil gave up nuclear weapon programs ukraine ka zakhstan and belarus gave up nuclear weapons on their soil when they became i ndependent states nd north korea seems to be in the

powers having the strict command and control of the united states nd russia with nuclear weapons fissile material and expertise in so many hands in this scenario the risk of nuclear terrorism would rise sharply supporters question the link between the nuclear umbrella and testing they note that japan south korea all members of the european union and all members of nato except the united states have ratified the ctbt203 their ratification it is argued calls into question whether th ey would exit the treaty to develop nuclear weapons of their own should there be some doubt about the reliability of us nuclear forces instead supporters claim nonprolif eration and the ctbt are tightly linked carnegie internationa l nonproliferation conference document stated nearly every speaker emphasized that the ctbt is the most salient indicator of whether the core nuc lear nonproliferation bargain can be sustained the ctbt indicates whet her states are willing to uphold their commitments to reduce the role of nuc lear weapons its implementation would stop the steep plunge in international confidence in the nonproliferation regime us ratificati on of the treaty would pressure other states that also have not ratified to clarify their nuclear policies to the rest of the world including china india egypt israel and iran204 moratorium and entry into force opponents respond that the us moratori um on nuclear testing is an example of compliance with article vi of the npt especially as this moratorium has been in effect since 1992 and so should be seen as supporting nonproliferation they prefer the moratorium to the treaty believing that in the event of problem with nuclear weapon that could only be fixed through tes ting it would be politically more difficult to exit the moratorium than the treaty supporters reply that the moratorium is insufficient the wmd commission an independent organization funded by the swedish government that seeks proposals to reduce

18 2007the commission believes that us decision to ratify the ctbt would strongly influence other countries to follo w suit it would decisively improve the chances for entry into force of the treaty and would have more positive ramifications for arms control and disarmament than any other single measure while nuclearweapon tests have been carried out for many years leaving the treaty in limbo is risk to the whole in ternational community the united states should reconsider its position and proceed to ratify the treaty only the ctbt offers the prospect of permanent and legally binding commitment to end nuclear testing205 similarly the final declaration of th 2007 conference on facilitating the entry into force of the comprehensive nucleartestban treaty stated continuing and sustained voluntary adherence to moratorium is of the highest importance but does not have the same effect as the entry into force of the treaty which offers the global community the prospect of permanent and legally binding commitment to end nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions206 supporters note that the treatys entry into force woul d bring into operation the treatys onsite inspection provisions as inspections can onl occur pursuant to the treaty not the moratorium they believe that the ctbt would provide visible barrier between nuclear power and nuclear w eapons programs that some would be unwilling to cross and this barrier by reducing confidence in weapons program might dissuade some nations from undertaking such program opponents note that even if the united st ates were to ratify the ctbt it would still not enter into force so they see the attempt to gain senate advice and consent as an exercise in futility especially given th at the senate rejected the treaty in 1999 by vote of 48 for 51 against and one present far short of twothirds majority of the 44 annex 2 states those that must pur suant to annex 2 of the treaty ratify the treaty

failure of any one of which could prevent entry into force would china ratify the treaty what basis is there to assume that north korea would ratify why would india agree to the treaty simply because china did indias main rival is pakistan and india might be unwilling to foreclose the option to improve its nuclear weapons through testing given the prospect of instability in pakistan indias stated unwillingness to block entry into force could be taken to mean that pakistan must ratify the treaty before india which seems unlikely ddle east bargain between egypt iran and israel would be difficult

seem low on the agenda of these three nations even if not all 44 annex 2 states do t ratify the treaty supporters see value in us ratification it would give the unite d states leverage to press others to join the treaty senator carl levin said if we are not willing to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty what standing do we have to urge india pakistan or any country to stop testing208 some supporters hold that us ratification would help secure international coope ration with the united states by symbolizing us turn toward multilateralism randy rydell of the office for disarmament affairs said i believe the ctbt does have enormous symbolic importance regardless of the limits of its ability alone to stop prolif eration or prevent the improvement of existing arsenals it stands for the rule of law in disarmament for the need for binding commitments for multilateralism fo r verification and for transparency209 even if few of the 44 annex 2 states do not ratify the treaty the international community could press non members of ctbt not to test and could impose sanctions if they test according to richard garwin us ratification of the treaty would legitimize and mobilize support for u s and international action against nations that test whether or not they are party to the treaty indeed the prospect of such support might deter nations from testing210 it might be possible to find way to bring the treaty into force without all 44 annex 2 states but not in the view of the treatys supporters without the united states in 1982 president reagan set forth series of conditions under which the united states could proceed with the ctbt us policy continues to endorse comprehensive test ban as longterm objective this is to be achieved in the context of broad deep andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34394crs61 211 quoted in sasc ctbt hearings 1999 p 16 212 sfrc ctbt hearing 1999 p 24 213 sfrc ctbt hearing 1999 p 17verifiable arms reductions expa nded confidence building measures improved verification capabilities that would justify confidence in soviet compliance with comprehensive test ban and at time when nuclear deterrent is longer as essential an element as currently for international security and stability211 ctbt supporters assert that these conditions have been met so it is time for the united states to ratify the treaty if not now they ask when the treatys opponents take different view while there have been verifiable reductions in missile silos bombers and submarines the moscow treaty strategic offensive reduction treaty does not provide for verification and there has been verifiable reduction in numbers of nuclear warheads while many programs since 1982 have built confidence with russia as has the disappearance of the soviet union russia continues to modernize its nuc lear forces and concerns remain about china iran and others opponents argu that there are ample opportunities for russia to conduct clandestine tests that would give it military advantage given limitations on monitoring capability and extensive data on testing and evasion gained from soviet tests while deterrence of russian attack may be less salient now than was deterrence of soviet attack in 1982 opponents point to many potential threats to the importance of the nuclear umbrella for deterrence and nuclear nonproliferation and to new sources of international instability such as rogue states nuclear smuggling rings and the prospect of nucl ear terrorism that have arisen since the collapse of the soviet union instead of building confidence it is argued these developments reduce it in this environment they argue the united states must maintain robust nuclear dete rrent that evolves to meet actual or anticipated threats this deterrent they conclude is the best guarantee agai nst nuclear proliferation and maintaining it requires nuclear testing conclusion alternatives packages and net assessment some have suggested modifying the ctbt in order to gain acceptance by the us senate one possibility is treaty that would permit withdrawal after 10 years with reason required but nation othe r than the united states supported this position in negotiations for the treaty212 another is ban permitting very low yield tests but the nuclear weapon states could find threshold to which all could agree other than zero and the nonnuclear weapon states pressed for zero213 third possibility would be to conduct some tests before ratifying zeroyield indefiniteduration ctbt indeed the hatfieldexonmitchell amendment to the fy1993 energy and water development ppropriations act pl 102377 section 507 provided for some tests from ju ly 1993 to september 1996 under certainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34394crs62 conditions though the tests we re not conducted for the ited states this approach would accomplish many things that the treatys critics favor testing would indicate whether leps had maintained existing weapons sufficiently and if not would validate fixes indicate whether rrw designs were effective provide experimental data to va lidate computer models and data drawn from nonnuclear experiments provide nuclear test experience for new generation of weapons designers and others and benefit from advances made by ssp which would guide the tests to gather key pieces of data and from technical advances made in the broader economy since the last test in 1992 on the other hand us testing could lead to testing by russia and china which would enable them to maintain and imp rove their weapons and develop new ones undermining us security and could lead other nations to test as well in proliferation cascade nonnuclear wea pon states might grudgingly have accepted some us testing in 19931996 indeed china and france conducted several tests in this period though accompanied by intern ational protests at present however critics of this approach believe that with the us moratorium in effect for over 15 years and the treaty ratified by over 140 nations resumed us testing even if limited in number and duration and presented as way to secure us ratification could well lead to the demise of the ctbt in any future debate on the treaty the senate may wish to examine whether any of these three alternatives merits consideration even if these alternatives are rejected others might be considered that are not inconsistent with the treaty ctbt supporte rs might offer new safeguards in addition to those set forth by president clinton in 1995 but the 45year history of safeguards indicates that they are all but certain to be part of any future resolution of ratification of the ctbt and so may offer little leverage on behalf of the treaty as another alternative ctbt supporters might offer an rrwctbt package to secure senate advice and consent to ratification yet rrw appears an insufficient inducement some ctbt opponents hold th at the united states could not have confidence in rrw without nuclear tes ting and rrw has only modest political support as evidenced by the fact that congress eliminated fy2008 funds for it therefore if the treaty were to come up again for senate consideration it might have to be considered on its own merits in every arms control treaty each state party gives up something in the expectation that the risks of so doing are outweighed by gains from what it can give up such as ex pensive weapons or programs what the other parties give up and what threats it averts this argues for net assessment rather than accepting or rejecting treaty based on one criterion in isolation there are many criteria to consider in this assessmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34394crs63 can the united states maintain the safety and reliability of its nuclear weapons and the h ealth of the nuclear weapons enterprise well enough over th long term without nuclear testing and what c onstitutes well enough are new nuclear weapons needed for deterrence or do existing weapons coupled with conventional forces suffice will new weapons require testing what is the current balance between monitoring and evasion given that monitoring technol ogy will continue to improve and that evasion capability may improve but in ways that are generally classified and ma well be unknown how is the monitoringevasion balance likely to shift over time how confident can an evader be in its ability to succeed given the many and improving monitoring techniques and the difficulties that could cause an evasion attempt to fail how confident can monitors be in their ability to detect and identify clandestine or an unattributable test in light of the many scenarios that have been set fo rth and the vast information on monitoring capabilities available in the open literature and available through the ims to states parties to the treaty how likely are russia and china to cheat and to gain strategic advantage thereby how likely are other nations to cheat and how would that affect deterrence regional stability and nuclear proliferation would the international community impose severe consequences on ctbt member that conducted clandestine tests would it impose such c onsequences on state not party to the ctbt that conducted test s whether clandestine or not would us ratification of the treaty make nuclear proliferation more or less likely what specific steps would entry into force of the ctbt lead nonnuclear weapon states to take in order to rein in nuclear proliferation would these states take these steps only if the treaty enters into force is us movement toward nuclear disarmament as exemplified by the ctbt essential for nuclear nonproliferation as some suggest or do the many us steps toward disarmament and nonpr oliferation taken to date provide firm basis for fu rther nonproliferation efforts is the us moratorium on nuclear testing reasonable long term balance between those who demand that the united states ratify the ctbt and those who urge return to testinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34394crs64 is the united states likely to exit the moratorium if problem arises that calls for test is this nation less likely to exit the ctbt under that circumstance how likely is the ctbt to enter into force if the united states ratifies it and works to secure ratification by all annex 2 states could the treaty be brought into force if the united states and china ratified it but few annex 2 states did not do technical and geopolitical developments since 1999 warrant reconsideration of the treaty ones net assessment depends on the importance one attaches to these and other criteria and the degree and probability of adverse consequences resulting from an incorrect judgment the assessment is complicated by the accretion of criteria over the course of test ban debates over the pa st halfcentury while arguments over each criterion necessarily shift over time it also appears that new criteria are added but old ones never leave the debate beyond that perceptions on broader issues influence judgment the likelihood of malevolent acti ons by china russia iran and north korea the value of treaties and regimes for restraining or halting nuclear proliferation the balance between obtaining security through military capability or diplomacy and how the two are linked and the value of us nuclear weapons for influencing the behavior of other nations in the case of the ctbt there is more agreement on the direction of these assessments than there is on judgments on individual criteria as result members of congress secretaries of defense and state and chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff have often arrived at opposed assessmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34394crs65 214 us congress congressional record vol 92 79th congress 2nd session 1946

with negotiation of ctbt its top priority this priority resulted at least in part from the npt review and extension conference scheduled for april and may of 1995 at which time the states parties to the npt would decide whether to extend the treaty indefinitely as the united states wanted or for one or mo re fixed periods the decision would be binding on the states parties to the treaty the 1995 npt conference was contentious nnws parties to the npt saw attainment of ctbt as the touchstone of good faith on matters of disarmament they argued that the nws failed to meet their npt obligations by not concluding ctbt they saw progress on winding down the arms race as inadequate they assailed the npt as discriminatory because it divided the world into nuclear and nonnuclear states and argued for nondi scriminatory npt regime in which nation would have nuclear weapons the ctbt in their view was the symbol of this regime because unlike the npt the nws would give up something tangible the ability to develop sophisticated new warh eads some nnws saw npt extension as their last source of leverage for ctbt once they agreed to permanent extension of the npt they could not pressure th nws to achieve ctbt other nnws saw the npt as in the interests of all but would be proliferators and fe lt that anything less than indefinite extension would undermin the security of most nations this position saw the npt as too important to put at risk as means of pressuring the nws for ctbt the review and extension conferen ce extended the npt indefinitely extension was accomplished by package of decisions that because it was so controversial was adopted without vote233 the package included decisions on indefinite extension of the npt strengthening the treatys review process resolution on the
