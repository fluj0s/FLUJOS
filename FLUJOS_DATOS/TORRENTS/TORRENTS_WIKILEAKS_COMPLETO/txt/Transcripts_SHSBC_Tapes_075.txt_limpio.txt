shsbc 75 importance of goals terminals lecture given on 25 october 1961 in just second youre going to clap louder than that because im going to relax the problem of your having to pass examinations in order to have auditing on the condition that you go on and get your noses to the grindstone and get them passed so you dont have to worry about that now dont look so spooked now you can run out all of your unkind thoughts on it okay what is this the 26th of october audience 25th twentyfifth of october okay 25th of october 1961 this is planet earth isnt it yeah okay well now having given you some good news im going to give you some good information but the main thing that you had better know about goals terminals runs and that sort of thing probably has not been made abundantly clear i have been on this particular track here for some time and the lecture im giving you is pretty much of hallmark in this particular line i mean its pretty much of highwater mark because theres great many things have been resolved that had been question for long time you see when youre attacking life head on the doors open and the highways go out long and white quite regularly but sometimes you know that therere some dark woods behind you and now and then why as youre going up wellknown road why you all of sudden find out that that wood is not dark wood anymore that youve gotten some data which wrapped up some little bit of something in putting together the jigsaw puzzle of life in trying to piece out what it is and what it is all about you have problem not unlike having jigsaw puzzle with an infinite number of pieces and its almost infinite and when you first look at this problem as when i first looked at it many years ago it was just potpourri of odd pieces and the funny part of it is they didnt even look like they would ever fit together none of the pieces were made to fit to any other piece in other words it was brandnew thought that it could be fitted together in one piece not in eight thousand different islands now philosophy in past days has tended to compartment life and you have all sorts of compartmentations and philosophy has never actually attempted total view it has been bit beyond them and so they compartmented things up they do various things and weve used some of these dodges ourselves in the past ive used some of them as weve come along ive well take spencer herbert spencer he said that there was two zones of this and that and he broke down various things but within the framework of this and that and conditional to this and that you then had rule you get the basic thought that goes behind this you have things like the knowable and the unknowable and thats an awfully interesting word unknowable oooooo well now more to keep people from worrying about it than any other reason i have used that analogy in the past but that was more to keep people from worrying about it not that i thought there were unknowables i just said that there were areas that you didnt have to know all about before you knew the answers to the situation and tremendous reservations kant for instance he not only compartmented it into the knowable and unknowable but he said that there was transcendentalism and you you little worm you you rat were all calm up here on the philosophic clouds you burn you stupid jerk its mostly all unknown to you and always will be and nobody will ever know anything that has anything to do with anything that is important so just go on and be stupid and be happy about it i dont know exactly where he got this particular notion but i suspect it was his bank and as we look at this huge piled table of pieces of jigsaw puzzle we get some of them together and it makes little bit of more of picture and we get some more of them together and it makes little bit more of picture and then it turns up yellow piece and weve got picture and it doesnt fit in any part of the picture we have got so we put it over here on the side and we say someday we will know about this yellow piece but right now were not going to worry about it particularly because the picture is making sense and we go on and we make more picture and we understand more of it and then all of sudden theres green piece and its hexadiagonal shape and it fits nowhere and we take this green hexadiagonal piece and we put it over here with the yellow piece and we say well were not going to worry about them for little while after while youve put enough pieces over here green purple and pink that didnt belong in the proper picture that you stir them up little bit and all of sudden they go clank and then they become and they go together of themselves and then they go clank and go into the main picture every once in while we make one of these forward surges well this is one of those occasions this is one of those occasions i can tell you flat fact that is to say this is one of these facts thats without reservation and its rather startling because we have done it and we didnt realize there was anything important about this but we have done this in the past but its fact which becomes one of the fundamentals of auditing now i must tell you clearly that auditors are divided into two categories ritualists and fundamentalists theyre divided into these two categories there is the auditor who without any understanding of what hes doing actually goes forward with the ritual and carries through to the end and hes perfectly happy and he very often gets result but he runs into more bugs than other auditors this is the majority of auditors they go down the line and they think thats just fine and i appreciate it you understand because it demonstrates very great faith in but thats what it demonstrates and thats all now they would be better off and any ritualistic auditor who is getting results would get more results and be better off if he knew the fundamentals on which his ritual was based if he knew the fundamental for instance we say agreement to begin session now if he knows what the fundamentals of agreement are he realizes at once that hes got to have mutual knowingness about what this session is all about and regardless of the ritual his end product is going to be mutual knowingness we are going to do soandso and suchandsuch and then we have an agreement and this agreement then precludes the preclear from having an enormous amount of notknow do you see this as an example so one auditor could just go ahead and run model session and everything is fine and run it off to the end and he comes out he gets result its an attestation to scientology and the way its put together that he can get result under that basis but how much better how much better if he knows hes trying to get mutual knowingness about what is going on and make contract and hes fundamentalist hes going by definition what is agreement you see well agreement is mutual knowingness mutual postulatingness towards certain end products and he knows if thats absent if mutual knowingness about what this session is all about is missing that theres going to be notknow throughout the session on the part of the pc its all going to be little bit of mystery so hes not going to make as fast result as he would if he were auditing by fundamental now you can audit by fundamental and use the ritual you see you could actually succeed by just using the ritual and not knowing the fundamental which is quite interesting but you could succeed much better if you knew the fundamental which underlay the ritual and also used the ritual that way why you have many more wins fundamentals are quite important and this is one of the fundamentals of auditing which has been missing right up to this date we could not answer this formerly but if you have traced through i think you could trace through the lectures for the last several years and occasionally find remark by that i have for long time studied this particular facet and hadnt yet an accomplished answer to it finished answer that is is it better i even thought i had it licked one time and it was very close to licked but it is not quite right can you audit conditions at all now weve inclined very definitely up until recently up until now to believe that you couldnt audit conditions very successfully that you should audit terminals now lets clarify this lets clarify this lets classify terminals what terminal can be run on the pc and this is one of these great basic facts of auditing so flap your ears the only terminal that can be run on pc is his goals terminal and other terminal can be run with impunity on pc you can run another terminal for short time you can run it rather limitedly you can appear to be getting away with it everything can be going along fine you hope and all of sudden the bank stiffens up and the pc doesnt seem to be making much progress and so forth thats because youre auditing another terminal than the goals terminal now factually on the long haul you can get away with auditing these terminals sometimes for twenty thirty forty fifty hours you can get away with them for while and all this will become very visible to you shortly but you cannot continue to audit any terminal which is not the pcs goals terminal the only terminal which can be audited with complete impunity with total unlimited runs is the goals terminal of the pc and that is all that can be run in the way of terminals with perfect impunity thats fact nail it down give it its proper level of importance because it will solve for you why did the pcs tone arm go up to 50 and stick it went up to 50 and stuckrefer to this particular moment and you will know why it went up and stuck you must have been auditing some other terminal than the pcs goals terminal it doesnt matter what other terminal you must have been auditing another than his goals terminal so if you were running his goals terminal and it went up to 50 and stuck after you began the run of the goals terminal and then it got sticky and sticky and sticky and there was something real wrong running some doublebarreled process such as your groups 10way bracket that youre running right now and the tone arm went up and it stuck and nothing happened hahaha theres something wrong with the goals terminal that is what is wrong youre auditing some other terminal than the goals terminal you are busily busily happily clearing up present time problem on the pc youre happily clearing this up and all is going well and all of sudden the tone arm starts going up and it goes to 45 and the pc gets very logy and it gets very sticky and starts to comm lag and gets misemotional haha youre running another terminal than the goals terminal of the pc now theres two things which can make that tone arm go up and stick you understand go up is all right go up go down who cares but go up and stick now that will happen on prehav scale run and it does for this reason youve exhausted that particular line and you must get over onto another part of the prehav scale there it is the prehav scale that is doing that but on the 10way bracket if it did this youve not got the right terminal thats all theres something wrong with the terminal withholds can make the tone arm go up and stick and running the wrong terminal can go up and make it stick running the wrong terminal on any process now theres great temptation to run present time problem and so on you see this particular class has helped resolve this and i wish to thank you for it you havent suffered for it particularly pon was crying the other day and i recognized at once why she was crying and i use her as particular example i examined her auditors form wondering about this and i found out that she had been run on the arc break process very hard and very long and what happened she was going up if you dont mind my using this female voice thats all right and she was running along happily cheerily cheerily cheerily and everything was going along fine and then all of sudden started to get little bit misemotional to the auditor and little bit upset with things in general and then they went along and ran the arc break process little longer and the tone arm went up to 50 clank and there it stayed and they kept on running it but pon didnt didnt calm down and didnt feel better now i see today she looks much better and i think they undoubtedly are following the auditors report directions which i gave out last night im sure they ran terminal today and she feels much better isnt that right probably not much better because the terminal itself cause but look at this i wish to use this as an example because its right here in your midst now the arc break process refers to an auditor and refers to pc ah those are two different terminals than her goals terminal these are not her goals terminal see that comes under the heading then in spite of the fact that its cleaning up auditing it doesnt work like this on every pc but itll work eventually like this on every pc you see it doesnt work fast on every pc like that but itll work that way eventually and this will become very comprehensible to you when i go out and tell you all about the mechanism involved in this thing well what happened here see the auditor is not her terminal pc is not her terminal she has been run on an auditor and pc running that 15way arc break process and her attention is being taken off of her goals terminal and her bank is beefing up now this is the createsix phenomena it is right here the createsix phenomena is not involved with creating and ive known there was spook back of that and every time ive mentioned that to you every time ive gone over it ive had some little reservation you remember ive always made little bit of reservation well i dont know why this happens you know it doesnt seem reasonable to and it doesnt happen with and if it happened all the time why it should happen but some peoples banks get very solid when they start creating and so we dont run step six this has happened enough times you see so that we abandoned process which was not uniformly bad process at all why why and that little question has just stayed around its one of these yellow pieces with orange polka dots lord knows where it fits or how why do some people run step six which is create something create something create something and have the whole bank go solid but juust few people have this happen and other people run create something create something create something and as lot of oldtime auditors right here in this room can tell you you can go on and have them create things and create things and nothing bad happens they go on and they get well and everything else well why does it only happen to few so if it was create if create was the total basis of this why then then of course it would work on everybody only it doesnt all right instead of saying like the ancient philosopher sitting on his stone it was probably very unhealthy sitting on stone but anyway sitting on stone he said well there are different types of people there are different types of bank everything is different you see and you have to have understandings of fifteen or twenty different classes because you see they dont all head under and respond to the same principles so men are different and thetans are different and its all different you see and therefore after you get through studying the alpha system then you have to study the beta system and then you have to study you know and here we go you see well i dont work on the same principle im perfectly welcome its perfectly welcome for there to be great differences but if you have the answer to life and the mind you dont have different types of cases and you dont have some cases responding to something and other cases not responding to something you see it must be that youre not quite down to the fundamental it must be that youre dealing with fundamental which is not rock bottom you must be up the tree ways well in this particular instance id never accepted that create phenomena without protest even in lectures when i talked about it maybe you can remember my having objections to this here and there i dont know why i would tell you well it isnt create thats why its wrong terminal thats why huhhuhhuh huhuu little difference here haha some people are so stuck on their goals terminal that you take their attention off their goals terminal and the bank beefs up or when you were running create on them and telling them to mock up things you were having them mock up things other than their goals terminal which were off their goalsterminal line and it distracted their attention off their goals terminal so bank picked up so we get another fundamental here not from that angle this is from another angle entirely this is empirical ive watched this and watched this and watched this and i noticed that banks become solid and the pc gets more somatics and the pc gets more misemotional about the thing and things get more tough and it all gets tougher and tougher and tougher rrrurrerrhes sort of going into concrete what is this why its running the wrong terminal running another terminal than the terminal of the pcs goals chain the pcs goals terminal doesnt do this and it is the only terminal in the case that wont there is just one available terminal in any case one available terminal and that is the goals terminal of the pc there is only one goal there is only one terminal and if you run that terminal matter what you do in the way of process the bank will not beef up itll not become solid but if you run any other terminal longer than its basic tolerance or until the pc notices youre running it why he gets cast in concrete you know i mean he gets misemotional the engrams get tougher you get more screams the circuits suddenly start acting up and so on the case gets rougher now usually in from three to ten days you will get drop out of this if he doesnt get any auditing for three to ten days itll just disappear its not particularly dangerous condition beyond the fact occasionally in dianetics or scientology somebody has suddenly had weight added to them in the process of processing why why running something else than their goals terminal thats all every time you saw increased weight by reason of auditing it was because the bank was becoming more solid it was manifesting itself on the body line and you were running something else than goals terminal that will be good news to several scientologists let call to your attention that the i must say this in defense along this line this fantastic situation where every person is walking around with different valence all from the same source but every person has different valence and it is usually different than the identity he is it is true that the terminal running terminal this is perfectly factual is much superior to running concept but the only terminal that can be run is the goals terminal which is the added statement on the end of the line which makes it completely factual and useful you audit against concept and the pcs havingness will go down or something else will occur you must audit if youre going to audit for long haul or do anything permanent for case you must audit terminal but what terminal it is only the goals terminal of the pc that is available for auditing if you dont know that terminal you cannot run any terminal i cannot say that too emphatically dont run any terminal if you dont know the goals terminal of the pc you can do almost anything with the goals terminal of the pc let us say the goals terminal of the pc is motor machinists mate unlikely terminal who would be motor machinists mate anyway his goals terminal was motor machinists mate well i dont ask you to experiment in this particular line but you possibly could do something like this mock up motor machinists mate thank you mock up motor machinists mate thank you mock up motor machinists mate thank you and then nothing would happen nothing would happen bad to his bank he would get the total kickback of his terminal oh yeah hed be very upset but it will be emotional upset from the terminal and that upset will reduce and discharge and itll run out now why wouldnt some i go clear back to 1950 why wouldnt some engrams run and why wouldnt other engrams run and why when running some engrams did they just get tougher and tougher and why when running other engrams they got softer and softer now why well because the engrams that ran out were on the goalsterminal chain and the engrams that werent on the goalsterminal chain wouldnt run now ive already shown you here in the just few weeks ago that an engram that lay on the goalsterminal chain ran like hot butter if you knew anything about running engrams at all it just ran out and swamped up there was not any great difficulty about it it ran easily and the pc felt much better afterwards but if you ran one which was off the goalsterminal chain as some of you knuckleheadedly did you know i mean youre doing goals assessment and the pc all of sudden gets an engram and you say well ron says its all right to run engrams and you all of sudden run the engram and you made progress and something happened with the goals assessment and everything would start to blow off and little jets of steam started to come out of the pcs ears and it didnt work you had your hands on an engram that wouldnt run why wouldnt the engram run because the engram was not on the goalsterminal chain and did not contain in it terminal of the pcs goals chain in other words his terminal wasnt in the engram so it didnt run now how we got away with running as many engrams as we did lord knows this bug sat there all the time so some engrams ran and some engrams didnt run you get person early enough on the track and you usually run into his goalsterminal chain so we went basic basic earlier earlier the earlier principle still applies perfectly valid you use it today on the prior confusion to knock out hidden standard marvelous itll work you get the prior incident that underlay all the incidents the first time the individual ever had an overt against dianetics and scientology you can park his whole case until you find it and then the rest of the chain blows that principle is right there but lying right alongside of it theres another principle and that is in running engrams if it is not on the goalsterminal chain of the pc and does not actually contain his terminal and is not directly related to his terminal the engram will not run and thats all there is to it that terminal which is not the goals terminal of the pc that item in the bank which has nothing to do with the goals terminal of the pc and so forth have only very limited run and if run too long at some point in the line either at once or twenty hours from now will all of sudden find the bank going solid fantastic isnt it i know some people hearing this and some people thinking about this and looking at this are saying my god weve been walking tightrope yeah we have we have weve been walking tightrope there was fundamental there which was goofy fundamental an oddball fundamental of some kind or another it wasnt much of tightrope i had the ends of the thing pretty well nailed in they were well set in concrete very few have fallen by the boards but nevertheless there was that spook factor and now we discover it well its good time we do this is our first year of clearing where were doing very wide clearing we certainly better know this now all right then if you cant for heavens sakes if you cant run anything but the goals terminal of the pc and if you cant neglect running the goals terminal of the pc and if you cant run other terminals on the pc then howre you ever going to get rudiment in how are you ever going to get rudiment in because they contain other terminals than the goals terminal of the pc ohho well thats horrible isnt it and how are you ever going to clean up any present time problem of long duration if its not on the goalsterminal line huh becomes impossible doesnt it huh isnt this fantastic well fortunately its not impossible well go into that in moment i looked at this with ghastliness before i brought it up here all right lets go into the basic and exact mechanism and ill show you the other mechanisms lets go into the basic exact mechanism of why the bank acts up and wont erase if you run something else than the goals terminal of the pc all right lets take this object lets take this object here all right and this object we will say is the goals terminal of the pc and this object over here we will call an other terminal other terminal now youre all of sudden to see why life becomes practically unlivable and why also the people who have been going around spreading these nice quiet philosophy like it takes living in order to live your life out you have to do some living you see in order to erase it totally oh yes thats around you know processing isnt enough you hear this occasionally processing isnt enough we get some old mystic philosophy or something somebody will say well you have to do some living too you see and now we get where they get this living too you have to go out and live because itll spin you in every time now ill show you how this all amounts to all right here we have the pc valence this is his goals terminal this is the valence that you plunge for and that you assess so crudely and so circuitously for with the valence acting up and the rudiments out and you eventually find it and outside of saint hill they occasionally find one once in while they havent found right one yet but they find otherwise all right thats actually just thats just put it under the heading of dirty crack thats all it is its true but thats i just had lot of cable traffic today on exactly this subject back and forth bangbangbangbangbangbang all on this subject we cant find the pcs goals and we cant find the pcs terminals and there are ways to find the pcs goals and terminals and it cant be because the rudiments are out i mean almost wasnt this bad but i took it in that frame of mind i just chose to be annoyed and superior all right heres thetan hes in the middle of this thing and this is his terminal and there it is and the basic postulates on which this goes in are quite interesting and as soon as you know this by the way you could probably by using fundamentals and little bit of straightwire occasionally make case go bzzutbluuvlum you know not clear him but make him feel awfully odd all right the basic is this as long as the thetan he knows this keeps his attention on his goalsterminal valence as long as he keeps his attention on it it is all right everything is all right this is introversion deluxe as long as he keeps his attention on his goals terminal everything is all right the bank is only normally psychotic and these various things occur now to this and appended to this goals terminal we have innumerable considerations packages personalities postulates circuitry and machinery its all complete package here it sits there have been others there have been earlier ones but im talking about the one which is now available to the auditor and which can be run with impunity and which you find with your ordinary and general run assessment as long as he keeps his attention upon this valence hes okay all is okay the bank will not misbehave itll just be normally nuts hes taken care of and that is built into the machinery in which he is operating that is the builtin strata on which he is functioning and as soon as he puts his attention on any other terminal now get this as soon as he puts his attention on any other terminal hes doing something that is not quite right he is rigged so that the valence in which he is will assert itself the punishment mechanism is that the valence gets more solid and more assertive and more it the second that the thetan you see punishes himself by the basic builtin mechanism and the basic fundamental of the valence that if he puts his attention on anything else then the valence is going to do something extraordinary its really going to act up and its really going to call attention to itself all right so he puts his attention over on this other object and instantly this valence his goalsterminal valence goes woofrrrruuuumcreak ummmummm mmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm uhuh somatics somatics please calling all somatics all right calling operator electriccurrent switch panel mysterious current passing through temples numb feet numb feet calling up numb feet there it goes the whole machinery goes into action as soon as he puts his attention on another terminal now you thought i was talking about auditing huh oh im not im talking about daytoday living oh oh isnt it fantastic that the more terminals he is asked to put his attention on the worse he will get and we have just found big hole in the road called life ill go over that again the second he puts his attention on any other terminal than the one he is interiorized into it acts up and he gets his head knocked off one way or the other and that applies to life so when he sees streetcar conductor if he were to see the streetcar conductor the bank would start acting up because this terminal is what we call the bank an interesting thing i have found ive found lucifer out today this was the rig he goes up to see the bank manager if he puts his attention on the bank mana you see his terminal doesnt even have to be anything related to the bank manager if his he by the way would be fairly comfortable comparatively speaking if his terminal were to be an arch bank robber and it wouldnt be quite so bad putting his attention on merely bank manager if they were slightly related why it might not be so bad but his terminal is washman and he puts his attention on bank president you know the bank president startles him the bank president says well all right ill give you an overdraft and extend your loan depending on what country hes in you know and it startles him you know and for second he looks at the bank manager just for second you see he puts his attention actually on the terminal called bank manager and his bank goes creak creak creak creak bing one of these pinball machines you see in these penny arcades because he put his attention on another terminal the pc is drifting along insession being well interiorized in running and all of sudden the auditor drops the emeter now just the mechanism of attention sliding off of what the pcs doing is of course shock and surprise but that doesnt account for the repercussion that very often occurs the pc is well interiorized into his valence because he is running and all of sudden his attention is shifted over to another terminal whether its emeter or auditor or it doesnt matter what over to another object or terminal his attention is shifted outside of this goals terminal it could happen to him in life but in view of the fact his attention is fairly comfortably relaxed on his goals terminal one way or the other on his bank in an auditing session its just the magnitude of shift you see hes more interiorized and it exteriorizes him harder so his bank goes crunch clank gets solid and acts up all of the mechanisms by which he prevents himself from becoming other than this goals terminal go into action and punish him back into becoming the goals terminal interesting mechanism isnt it life you see he goes he sees fellow student he feels nervous around this fellow student you see he feels nervous now hell feel as nervous about fellow student as the fellow student is appearing person is as nervous about any other terminal than his goals terminal as it appears or manifests to him its direct proportion in other words the more he is forced to put his attention on another terminal the more nervous he gets of course it works out quite easily and simply so heres his heres the pc and his goals terminal hes going along just dandy just fine hes living totally interiorized and as long as he never sees anything and as long as he never meets anybody as long as he never really notices anybody as long as he never talks to anything or notices the physical universe in any way whatsoever as long as all this is occurring he is all right he thinks now that he can gradually become familiarized with his surroundings or gradually familiarized with other terminals is just marvelous it just comes under the heading of familiarization but if you familiarize him along the line and then suddenly familiarize him rather too suddenly about something of the sort the whole goalsterminal structure which is being violated up to this point will go in again clank life is an aberrating activity well there are other terminals in life now you wonder why people dont see well well if they dont see well they dont have to see any other terminals and if they dont see any other terminals of any kind why of course their bank doesnt beef up if they see any other terminals their bank will beef up theyre teaching themselves this lesson all the time if i look not at something else if i put not mine attention upon any other terminal i wont get this cottonpicking backache they know this reactively now everything in book one applies its how the fish protects himself from being eaten and how he uses restimulators and all that sort of thing but the one restimulator and the one mechanism that he used is not sufficiently delineated its in book one it tells you all about it in book one 1950 but it doesnt press it home and theres one factor missing in that book that there is only one such terminal and theres one consequence missing in the book that if he puts his attention on anything else in the way of terminal to some slight degree its going to mess him up well i just level with you theres the data theres the data you get out and board bus the conductor comes by click click snap snap he wants your pennies you get along just fine if you just hand him the pennies you see you see dont really notice him dont pay much attention to it you know its perfectly all right but if he then goes snap snap with one of these punchers you see and your attention goes this way you say damn that you know you get you get about what the borderline is theres apparently some tolerance and probably the tolerance varies from person to person to the degree that theyve been forced to look at other terminals and they can tolerate quite bit from another terminal before they go booey they can tolerate quite bit they can talk to people they can go to parties they can talk to people they can act around but actually life is not peculiarly life that has nothing to do with the mind thats the way its mostly been regarded but why is it that people as they go along in life quite ordinarily go to less and less parties people ordinarily become less and less gregarious well naturally i dont think bodies wear out i think the thetans not the bodys the thetans goals terminal beefs up and when it beefs up to killing point thats it and thats age i think this mechanism is that pervasive in life so you see its pretty pretty fundamental fundamental isnt it all right well this puts us in bind ladies and gentlemen it scraps every rudiments process youve got just like that its not possible you cant put rudiments in obviously it violates this rule obviously you cant audit person because the second that you put his attention on you the auditor why the goals terminal beefs in and he gets worse so obviously auditing is impossible obviously you cant clear up the minor difficulties of the individual if it involves running other terminals that leaves you with just of course goals assessment terminals assessment and goals terminal run period thats what it leaves you with as effective auditing thats the lot as far as effective auditing is concerned so the importance of routine 3 in those characteristics could not possibly be overrated weve come back onto the highway and all of sudden found out theres just one road there mess up that road and youve had it uruuh thats bum show isnt it look you cant run the auditor out because hes terminal so if fellow had too many bum auditing sessions he would have had it right finish him you may as well think this thought through in its most gruesome most gruesome lines im presenting it tto you with as much crepe on it as possible if you find some places on it where i havent hung any crepe why you supply them to yourself you can see that its closed channel person whos had lot of bad auditing of course thats ruined him its obvious theres recovery from anything except by his goals terminal yeah but his rudiments are out so nobody can find his goals terminal and hes not at saint hill hes being audited by somebody who read read short leaflet on it so this gets very interesting doesnt it thats as narrow view as you can get now can the view be expanded at all now these long yards of black crepe festooned about give us this other aspect is there any slightest peepholes of light shining through the funeral crepe are there any yes yes heres another bug heres another bug datum another interesting bug datum its purple piece with crossdiagonal orange and blue slots its shaped like biscuit cutter dissected and made into tolahedron and its ridden along with us for long time because every once in while an auditor has sat down and run fifteen or twenty different processes on pc all of them figurefigure thinkthink processes and the pcs got tremendous case gain next time we try the same processes or anything like these processes nothing happens did you know this bug factor occurred you must have run into it yourself you must have asked somebody to think of being well sometime or another you know or something like that and ran this for little while and something wonderful happened with the case and then you got hold of another case and you said think of being well with great confidence you see you did this enormous confidence think of being well you know and the fellow says all right so what but this funny looking piece is this that cases have recovered on conceptual address they have recovered from running concepts when i first dreamed up concept processing way way back i guess it was i dont know 52 53 52 bunch of psychiatrists and chiropractors and whole bunch of birds next year or something like that they read all the bulletins carefully backwards and god had something like conceptualism and so on and they just took this original material actually for at one time i think only four or five years ago they were running two or three hospitals in the united states and this is all they were doing they were doing it all messed up and backwards and they werent getting much in the way of results but it there was something there and i didnt know how much there was there and fortunately fortunately i knew basically that it was only terminal proposition and i knew you couldnt do anything unless you did something with terminal but it was its taken long long time to sort out what terminal and to find out how to get that terminal and how to run that terminal well thats taken long time to do and if wed stopped with conceptual activities significances we never would have gotten anyplace nobody would ever clear on significances but you can make people feel better the reason you cant clear on significances is of course significances are part of the package of the valence and terminal theyre the valence that the pc is in on his goalsterminal line see his considerations can be shifted around and it doesnt do very much its processing the terminal see but you can shift the terminals considerations somewhat dont think you cant one of the ablest of these processes is old rising scale processing this can change terminal package around faster than anything you ever heard of but it doesnt get rid of the terminal but it doesnt beef it up it doesnt get it upset and you can audit it and you can lay this one down not for very permanent results not for any broad wonderfulness not for any spectacular thing merely miracle here and there depending on the good sense with which you pick out the concept you can audit concepts on preclear you can audit concepts on preclear as long as they do not in any way hook up with terminal that is the basic rule you can audit concepts on preclear as long as they do not in any way hook up with terminal other than his goals terminal that can be done and thats fairly fortunate for you but heres the limiting factor from an auditors practical viewpoint not that it limits this but the auditor trying to apply this is going to every once in while goof hes going to think hes running concept or significance when actually he is running terminal hell say lets see we can run concepts and significances so itd be all right to say what does your mother think that sounds good all right what does your mother think thank you what does your mother think thank you thank you tone arm starts up you know what does your mother think thank you tone arm goes on up higher what does your mother think thank you tone arm gets up to 60 what does your mother think thank you tone arm sticks what does your mother think thank you i dont know ron said that you could audit concepts as long as they werent connected with any terminals uh oh wait wait oh oh oh ive ive been oh oh oh oh ill have to run this out in my next security check because ive been running his mother ive been running terminal on the pc you see and because i had think connected with the terminal i for moment you see didnt realize there was terminal there now thats very gross one thats very gross one you can you can duck one like this and you can say well what would get the idea of running away from things you see oh thats good thats an easy concept see doesnt put anybodys attention on any terminal and the tone arm starts up it starts up and it starts up and the only thing it is its got terminal mixed up with it see now you can get away with running you because this covers to some degree the goals terminal see you can run you but you cant run anybody else not on pc on concept all right and you can heres the next big broad basis of it you can security check terminals why can you security check terminals because the persons overts and withholds from the terminal in limited sense were when his attention got pinned on another terminal than his goals terminal and if you can separate his attention at those points on the track when they have been pinned against other goals terminals you of course are less activating his goals terminal you are picking out times on the track when his attention got onto other people selectively and pinned and stuck on other people and youre picking those points off and not running any repetitive process or fixing his attention on the terminal and in any particular way but by getting his attention on the things that pinned his attention in the past over onto the terminal he therefore feels better and thats why security check works hasnt anything to do with god and has to do with broken mores and attention pinned on groups and it has to do with all those things thats for sure but im talking about just why would coming into the church and confessing that you just murdered one of the choir boys last night for immoral reasons produce tremendous case gain as they claim see well his attention hes got an overt and hes got withhold which pinned his attention on the track on another terminal than the one hes on you werent saying think of murdering choir boys thank you think of murdering choir boys thank you think of murdering choir boys thank you eventually the only thing thats coming through to the pc is choir boys choir boys choir boys and his bank start is likely to get solid see hes liable to get high tone arm and get very upset and that sort now why does the high tone arm occur on withhold why is it accompanied by high tone arm the person is withholding something and so forth its because at that point on the track their attention is pinned on another terminal other than their goals terminal so you get high tone arm you got that one all right now get the idea of time track and the individual at intervals in the past has had this mechanism violated by life life has demanded of him that he take his attention off his goals terminal and put it on another terminal and of course those are best expressed under the heads of overts and withholds so theres the points where his attention is on other terminals so if you can just knock out those points delicately flick flick get the overt off get the withhold off he frees from that terminal and his attention is longer at that point of the track violating his goals terminal so he feels better so knowing that rule you can security check with impunity as long as you dont put his attention on too many terminals that is to say lets not sit down and make list of 8795 people and then lets say mother mother mother mother mother mother mother mother mother mother mother mother mother mother mother and all of sudden the pcs tone arm starts up up up up up up up of course its the auditor who is putting his attention on the mother see the auditor is not disengaging his attention from mother in the past the auditor is putting his attention on mother in the session now you get the two differences there thats very delicate difference we can say all right now what have you done to your mother plang what was that well i did this and that have you ever withheld anything from your mother yeah plang did that and so forth when was that plang you know boom bang all right now have you got any other withholds from your family all right thats fine when was that one all right you know just you could run almost regular security checks as long as you dont say well now what sort of person was your mother now was your mother very mean to you one way or the other now was your mother big woman was your mother small woman did your mother talk loudly or talk softly exactly how did your mother and all of sudden it gets to be word mother to this fellow with letters about six feet high you see and its all massy and bulky and he feels very crushed in and starts to feel sort of solid and sort of upset youve just taken his attention off his goals terminal thats all youve stressed the other terminal too much you get the idea so you can get the overts off and the withholds off oh yeah well this takes off the times on the track when their attention got stuck on the other terminal and as long as you dont get this other terminal pushed into point in the session where their attention is being fixated on this terminal which is in violation of the goals terminal their bank wont get solid they will recover and theyll feel fine okay i gave you all the rudiments processes that are effective processes here several lectures ago they are very easy processes actually the basic process is this whats your attention been on lately thank you what has it been on not what could you look at you see what could you look at is violation of the goals terminal what has your attention been on i just give you that as the fundamental form what has your attention been on you could spot where his attention had been on things and the rudiments would clear up so heres fundamental way this is actually part of lecture of some two or three months ago youve got present time problem all right dont run problems because problems bring up terminals and the person then finds himself facing terminal and then youll find the problem doesnt run because its not his goals terminal and youre going in circles so you dont run present time problem you merely spot the problem when he has had it before and try to get the earliest time his attention was on such problem you just sort of backtrack it and pull out the earliest pin and let his attention just come on up to present time on the thing and youll find out that the problem has discharged without running terminals in connection with the problem you understand rudiments have not been unsuccessful because they are not run very long youre not putting his attention on this terminal over any long period of time so youve gotten away with them but recognize we can recognize now that we have gotten away with something and you can continue to get away with this and you can go on running rudiments processes the same way you are running them without running into too much trouble but here and there youre going to run into enough trouble to cause us to gradually graduate it over to merely this what has your attention been on all right let us take an arc break all right how would you clean up an arc break you would say well do you recall any other ar any other things there that were bad that you didnt you know was your attention was on saying something to somebody and you just couldnt say it and so on do you recall any other circumstances like this oh yes yes oh well got another one oh yeah boom got another one boom got another one yeah thats right oh well i see whats wrong in the session now the pc says ive ive been trying to tell you something and i couldnt tell you see his attention is still stuck on trying to communicate to the auditor or something of the sort see find out where his attention got fixed in the session and unfix it and of course hell feel better because its not in violation of his goals terminal simple so if you just specialize in rudiments in unfixing the pcs attention where it is fixed then he will feel better you see wherever his attention was fixed on the past track on another terminal than himself he violated his goals terminal so its little aberrated point on his track he feels little bit funny about it its amazing the amount of number of terminals that pcs can actually look at without spinning in but if you take auditing with all of the heavydrill mechanics back of it and try to make them face up to terminal in auditing wow wow wow it gets to be pretty wild i mean you keep bringing up well let us say that you have taken up his mother you have run his mother and it was perfectly all right and it worked out all right and you ran his father and you started running his father and this had nothing to do you never assessed this fellow and youve run his father and you were just going to clean up his whole family you see and you ran his father and you ran his father and you ran his father and you ran his father and i dont know the tone arm seemed to be getting up and the case seemed to be getting sort of sticky so you ran his father so you ran his father so you ran his father so you the case seemed to be getting awful sticky by this time and you couldnt quite see what the devil was happening on the thing and you sort of knocked it off and you decided well you couldnt do very much about that and you just skipped it after while and three or four days later it was all right you asked him about his father and he didnt seem to be particularly upset so you let it go by have you had that kind of thing happen well thats whats the back of it youre putting his attention on father and his father was wild violation of goals terminal so was mother but you see its mother plus father made quite lot of violation of goalsterminal attention you see and by the time youd gotten some pcs you could get fifteen family members or something like that up the line before they finally went clank so sec checking can be done disengaging attention fixed in the past can be done and goals terminal running can be done everything you have learned about prior confusion becomes terrifically valid if you omit the problem running dont run the problem because you immediately and at once run into groups and other people and other terminals all right thats what i learned from you i watched your tone arms going boy you sure had time thats why i changed you over quite rapidly on to running your goals terminal so swiftly on almost the identical process of course it was good thing you got used to the process got used to the form got used to auditing it and it didnt do anybody any particular amount of damage except one class member and shes recovered today so thats all right and there is the view of the thing dont just in the interest of not goofing just in the interest of having nothing funny happen in the session just in the interest of everything going along smoothly and the pc never having any arc breaks if you want to have arc breaks with the pc keep his attention on his goals terminal and run him on his goals terminal never put his attention on the auditor and never let his attention go on anything else but the goals terminal pocketypocketypocketypockety pock now theres another mystery on this id better tell you about is why did it take one of thirtysix or more of thirtysix havingness processes some pcs ran on one havingness process and some pcs ran on the other havingness processes one of the thirtysix havingness and one of the thirtysix confront processes do not violate for some peculiar reason the goals terminal of the pc and therefore remedy his havingness and let him move on the track for some reason or another theyre all various combinations of commands and it sort of lets him walk through gate so you ask one pc you say look around here and find something you can have he cant run it the thing gets stiff why does it get stiff violates attention must be on his goals terminal his attention must be on his goals terminal you ask him to look at the wall oh well youve asked him to look at the wall in this particular way and thats good so you finally ask him what emotion does that wall have in it or something like this oh hed tell you that thats easy and for some reason or other this doesnt violate his goals terminal its where the concept of the havingness and the concept of the confront are matched to the nowimsupposedto packages of the goals terminal and where these things are exactly matched where the havingness is matched to the goals terminal and doesnt violate the principles of the goals terminal and where the confront doesnt violate the goals terminal and matches its principles then that havingness and confront works like bomb on the pc you only find two or three or four of those processes will work on each pc and theres thirtysix of them and pcs work on all different ones now whats variable in cases whats variable in cases is the goal whats variable in cases is the terminal and the nowimsupposedtos that go around that valence and these can be infinite you can have the most complex sort of valence think of your own valence just at the moment did you ever see so many complex facets to anything in your life as that valence well people really dont understand what bank president is they really dont he does this and hes nowimsupposedto do that and hes nowimsupposedto here and hes nowimsupposedto there and for practically every answer and facet of life the bank president has an answer its marvelous absolutely marvelous and as long as you dont violate any of these particular principles you can live happy life at what cost well just the cost of you thats all of course you cant be good bank president either because it takes more than imsupposedto to be bank president but somewhere in those havingness processes somewhere in the havingness processes somewhere in the confront processes theres one or two or three or four that work well they dont violate the terminal theyre not necessarily what the terminal would do or not do but they are not in conflict in some mysterious alchemical way with the nowimsupposedtos of the valence and so you sort of found little hole in the picket fence it went through well thats very good now were also then in contest with looking at other holes and for other holes in the picket fence in the way of how do you do things with case well most concepts would be functional as long as theyre strictly concepts theyll patch up case little bit of course you cant change this valence around the valence is in in concrete you can run the valence out but you cant change it around but running concepts you can make somebody feel better and you can alter something of their considerations and remember theres thetan there too and concepts are hole in the fence because its all right to put his attention on an idea but it is not all right to put his attention on another valence therefore you have innumerable people able to absorb or pay attention to or have concourse with ideas that cannot have any concourse with masses they cannot observe masses they cant do anything with masses or people or something but they can do something with an idea well hole in the fence is that the an idea is not violation of the valence terminal now unpinning attention off violations of the goals terminal in the past you see times when his attention has been fixated over on another terminal of course that was violation of the goals terminal so youre patching up that youre of course freeing his attention on the backtrack and thats done by security checking so security checking is wide hole in the fence now theres another hole in the fence is that you can run any problem by picking up the zone of prior confusion and sec checking it his attention stuck on the problem because his attention was already stuck on violations of the goals terminal prior to the occurrence of the problem so you can always get rid of present time problem by finding the incident of prior confusion i did this the other night with mary sue just the most mysterious thing you ever saw you get used to these sort of things takes it in stride i was thinking about this and i noticed that after you after you left she was wheezing and sneezing and so forth she was sitting in the other room and there was heater in there and she was very cold and i noticed that she put on as any texan would put on wool sweater and then she put on coat over the wool sweater and then she put one of these drivingsportcar heavypadded jackets on over that you see and she was looking around for couple of shawls or something and i said what goes on she says im cold so frankly she was under very heavy pressure to get her reports done dont you see and i was standing in the door talking to lot of you you know and i was slowing her down you see so time was sort of stopped but her attention you see was rapidly snapped over on to the group standing in there holding the door open now you said all right now all you have to do is get off her overt thoughts of why dont they go home and why doesnt ron shut the door and why doesnt it get hot in here and why doesnt somebody turn on the heater you know this sort of thing you would have said thats the thing to do and thats all set well i just made nice interesting little twobit test out of it and i did all that and she was still sniveling and she was looking around for four or five more mackinaws and shawls texas fashion and so forth and then i found that while reviewing your sec checking earlier she had become just shakingly furious with couple of incidents where lousy job was being done and it was the prior confusion everything blew straight up she took off the mackinaw after throwing out i actually you get this as an incident if suzie will beg my pardon but you get that as very homey fundamental little piece of nonsense see the apparent ows that would directly cause the situation had and the exact problem had nothing whatsoever to do with being parked on the track that was all much earlier it was actually an hour or two earlier than that and then some other incidents had happened and made the earlier incident key in it was just the prior confusion to what the pc was saying and she didnt have any recall of having done this other thing at all she wasnt thinking about it at all the second it blew into view that was it so actually you havent lost anything you have faster method of getting rid of present time problem than you had before when you get sec check of the prior confusion just find out who was there earlier and did the needle move while they were there earlier and find out what they did earlier than the time they are worried about if theyre worried about eight oclock find out what happened at five they are very stuck in fight with their wife as they come into session and you say theres hell of present time problem weve got to get rid of this problem and so on in order to get on with the session and you say when did this fight take place and they say hohohohoho its been going on all evening it started about supper time you say good when was supper well supper was at sixthirty all right thats fine what happened at five oh well that was before the argument with my wife you see and this has nothing to do with the present time problem because my present time problem with her she didnt have dinner ready and i had to get back here for the session and so forth and we had fight oh well all right well what did happen at five where were you at five i was down at the lumberyard well all right so you were down at the lumberyard who was down at the lumberyard oh well nobody but there were those clank who was that what was that what occurred then what did you do oh well i completely forgot as matter of fact i fired the foreman all right you say thank you very much do you have present time problem you wont get any action you didnt even discuss the fight with their wife anything the pc is worried about is pinned by an unknown prior to the fact that is the rule anything that the pc is worried about is pinned by an unknown prior to the fact any present time problem is fixed as problem by prior occurrence prior to the occurrence or subject matter of the problem ive told you for some years now that any time pc blew on you they had had an arc break for at least an hour half an hour to an hour and half and maybe when i get your goals terminal all run maybe youll notice whats happening to the pc and be able to put your attention on the pc without caving your own bank in so you clean up an arc break how do you clean up an arc break well the pc goes clank blump thud tone arm goes up things get sticky you say do you have an arc break well yes what happened well you muffed that command hmhm all right now lets use the attention what was your attention on sort of thing you get the idea when was the first time your attention was distracted from your auditing from being audited that you can pick up now oh well and bing bing bong thud boom boom pick up two more bang bang another one boom thats it theyre in present time arc break if you dont believe it try it sometime or it was the fight they had before the session that you didnt pick up as pt problem but the arc break is hanging up and is an arc break because of prior enturbulence which is not now in the consciousness of the pc anything that is wrong with the mind is unknown to the mind you neednt make full fetish out of that and say well if the pc says he has stomachache there is need to believe him at all because the pc knows nothing about his case you see you could carry this out to ridiculosity but if the pc said he had stomachache and then told you where he got the stomachache and why he has the stomachache you should realize that this has exceeded the knowingness of the pc because if he knew where he got the stomachache he wouldnt have one but you still use where he got the stomachache and when he got the stomachache so that you can get few hours earlier than that fellow says i had nervous breakdown all of sudden why its most you see youre all trapped into this as being the most logical thing in the world he said i i was sitting at my desk and he said my business was semibankruptcy and and everything was going to pieces and all of sudden my secretary stuck her head in and screamed at your father has just died in convulsion and uh his will is bankrupt and uh uh and so forth and thats why i have this nervous breakdown well now you must believe that the pc has nervous breakdown thats perfectly fact he can observe that but why he has the nervous breakdown when stated by the pc is violation of this fact he still has the consequences of nervous breakdown if he knew where the nervous breakdown came from he would not have the consequences of nervous breakdown so you take the fact that he is suffering from nervous breakdown all right thats fine and you take the fact of when he thought it started and what he thought began it in order to get bit earlier than that and find out what did begin it and start it itll always be earlier and always be unknown to the pc thats how life hangs up now couple this with the fact that it was always violation of his goals terminal because his attention fixated on something else see his attention fixated on something else some other terminal if you pry his attention loose from having fixated on prior terminals why youve got the thing taped in other words sec checking works concept works getting the persons attention off parts of the track it is fixed on that works running terminals dont do it might as well lay the law down now rather than soften the blow and try to make myself look very intelligent about the thing i pat myself on the back for knowing there was terminal there nobody else knew it yeah and now i find out that weve got firm grip on the terminal we know that there is terminal there that is the terminal were looking for and i can impart to you this oddity that apparently now that the checks are all in some of the variations of auditing the arc breaks of pcs lot of why does the tone arm go up and stick lot of these answers are rapidly satisfied by the fact that his attention mustnt be on any other terminal than the goals terminal and its only by taking his attention off the goals terminal by running some other wrong terminal to the case works ill give you an oddity do you know that many dynamic straightwire not very many but enough to make it interesting dynamic straightwire terminals that were found for runs in yesteryear are the goals terminal of the pc isnt that interesting theyre sometimes worded just hair different or something like that its quite interesting that auditors here and there just picked right out off the cuff you might say by doing dynamic assessment and actually would arrive with something which was near throw on it one instance the dynamic assessment gave the food of the terminal which the goals assessment found in other words it was right on the line it wouldnt have been damaging to have run it did dynamic assessment and lets say well this wasnt it but chop suey for some reason or other the only thing that could fall out of the hamper on dynamic assessment was chop suey and we assessed the fellow and we find that his goals terminal was chinaman you see theyre theyre matched up here and there that closely there are probably other methods of crosschecking whether or not the goals terminal is right there are safeguards of this having become sufficiently important mary sue just proposed safeguard she says well why dont you do prehav scale assessment then do run on the l0way bracket on groups and problems on the goal not do the prehav run you see and then go back and do another prehav assessment and see if lot of new levels have suddenly come live as crosscheck there are probably lot of these crosschecks could be used one way or the other and youd know very well whether or not you were running the pcs goals terminal but the best run is is the pc interested is his case running is it fairly easy to keep the rudiments in and does the pc say oh i never want to get clear is the pc getting upset with life and is the pc saying oh i never want to be audited again this is too ghastly yet continues to appear for session there are number of tests there are number of behaviors which are peculiar to the goals terminal all right well there have been lot of snarled spots taken off the line and theyve made much neater picture you possibly will feel little bit confused some of your data you may feel you now have in crosswise its been unstabilized thats why ive gone over it carefully to tell you what data is or is not crosswise and the only thing im telling you is that you have assisted to the degree of showing that you cannot run problem cant be done we still have the whole problems intensive the whole lot but we have it in its original version you go ahead and find it you find the problem and you only find the problem in order to find the prior confusion and then you just sec check the prior confusion and youve got your your problems intensive is just fine just omit running the problem you get in trouble running the problem but you wont get in trouble taking their attention off violations of the goals terminal earlier even though you didnt know what the goals terminal was do you see that so its the same thing you do it the same way theres absolutely everything is just exactly right the only thing ive got to change on the form is just that one little line about running the problem you dont even have to word or run the problem and none of you could do that anyhow so its all right yeah you could run it all right but wording it that was beyond you you see okay so there we are ive brought you up to date some of your cases ought to be running like startled deer ive relaxed the rules now on which youre being examined therefore i expect you to be examined even more frequently but not under so much duress the thing for you to do is to get clear by saturday and then start studying monday finish up the checksheet by next thursday and youve got it made okay thank you
