from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to tom wigley wigleyucaredu subject re fyiphil jones and ben santer respond to cei and pat michaels attack on temperature data record date wed oct 14 124121 2009 cc ben santer santer1llnlgov tom what youd need to point this out is pdf of his thesis or is there paper where the thesis is referred to i recall pat wasnt very good at writing stuff up there was one paper about warming in alaska that i recall either you or reviewing it related to surface warming in alaska and the borehole from lachenbruchmarshall from about 1986 with the pdf you wouldnt need to say that much as it is as you say stupid to leave the trend in with the rest of the variance did the ncdc info help you sort out that data tom p told that they dont infill certain areas in early decades so there is missing data tom p isnt that keen on the method he rightly thinks that it discourages them from looking for early data or including any new stuff they get as they have infilled it so it wont make difference it wont make difference but that isnt the point cheers phil at 0245 14102009 tom wigley wrote dear folks you may be interesting in this snippet of information about pat michaels perhaps the university of wisconsin ought to open up public comment period to decide whether pat michaels phd needs reassessing michaels phd was i believe supervised by reid bryson it dealt with statistical regressionbased modeling of cropclimate relationships in his thesis michaels claims that his statistical model showed that weatherclimate variations could explain 95 of the interannual variability in crop yields had this been correct it would have been remarkable results certainly it was at odds with all previous studies of cropclimate relationships which generally showed that weatherclimate could only explain about 50 of interannual yield variability how did result come about the answer is simple in michaels regressions he included trend term this was at the time common way to account for the effects of changing technology on yield it turns out that the trend term accounts for 90 of the variability so that in michaels regressions weatherclimate explains just 5 of the remaining 10 in other words michaels claim that weatherclimate explains 95 of the variability is completely bogus apparently none of michaels thesis examiners noticed this we are left with wondering whether this was deliberate misrepresentation by michaels or whether it was simply ignorance as an historical note i discovered this many years ago when working with dick warrick and qipu on cropclimate modeling we used spatial regression method which we developed for the wheat belt of southwestern western australia we carried out similar analyses for winter wheat in the usa but never published the results wigley tml and qipu 1983 cropclimate modelling using spatial patterns of yield and climate part 1 background and an example from australia journal of climate and applied

of east anglia in the uk and ben santer at lawrence livermore national laboratory comment in response to petition to epa by the competitive enterprise institute and pat michaels which misleadingly seeks to obstruct epas process in making an endangerment finding on greenhouse gases this new cei tactic is to call into question the integrity of the global temperature data record and by implication the integrity of leading climate scientists ee news pm reported on october 7 climate freemarket group attacks data behind epa endangerment proposal the competitive enterprise institutea vocal foe of epas efforts to finalize its endangerment findingpetitioned the agency this week to reopen the public comment period on the proposal arguing that critical data used to formulate the plan have been destroyed and that the available data are therefore unreliable at issue is set of raw data from the climatic research unit at the university of east anglia in norwich england that includes surface temperature averages from weather stations around the world republican senators also weighed in yesterday urging epa to reopen the public comment period on the endangerment finding to investigate the scientific merit of the research data we talked with ee news on this latest maneuver by the ideologues at cei and contrarian scientist pat michaels and posted on october 8

the cei petition will we suppose produce an appropriate response for the record from epa and relevant members of the science community and while that process drags on cei and michaels doubt will use their petition as basis for attempting to muddy the waters of scientific discourse while sliming leaders of the international climate science community and questioning their motives few of those leaders have begun to comment on this attempt we post below comments climate science watch has received from ben santer at lawrence livermore national laboratory and prof phil jones director of the climatic research unit at the university of east anglia in the uk comment by benjamin d santer 3httpwwwpcmdillnlgovaboutstaffsanterindexphp program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison lawrence livermore national laboratory as i see it there are two key issues here first the competitive enterprise institute cei and pat michaels are arguing that phil jones and colleagues at the climatic research unit at the university of east anglia cru willfully intentionally and suspiciously destroyed some of the raw surface temperature data used in the construction of the gridded surface temperature datasets second the cei and pat michaels contend that the cru surface temperature datasets provided the sole basis for ipcc discernible human influence conclusions both of these arguments are incorrect first there was intentional destruction of the primary source data i am sure that over 20 years ago the cru could not have foreseen that the raw station data might be the subject of legal proceedings by the cei and pat michaels raw data were not secretly destroyed to avoid efforts by other scientists to replicate the cru and hadley centrebased estimates of globalscale changes in nearsurface temperature in fact key point here is that other groupsprimarily at the noaa national climatic data center ncdc and at the nasa goddard institute for space studies giss but also in russiawere able to replicate the major findings of the cru and uk hadley centre groups the ncdc and giss groups performed this replication completely independently they made different choices in the complex process of choosing input data adjusting raw station data for known inhomogeneities such as urbanization effects changes in instrumentation site location and observation time and gridding procedures ncdc and gissbased estimates of global surface temperature changes are in good accord with the hadcrut data results the second argumentthat discernible human influence findings are like house of cards resting solely on one observational datasetis also invalid the ipcc third assessment report tar considers multiple observational estimates of globalscale nearsurface temperature changes it does not rely on hadcrut data aloneas is immediately obvious from figure 21b of the tar which shows cru ncdc and giss globalmean temperature changes as pointed out in numerous scientific assessments eg the ipcc tar and fourth assessment reports the us climate change science program synthesis and assessment report 11 temperature trends in the lower atmosphere steps for understanding and reconciling differences and the state of knowledge report global climate change impacts on the united states rigorous statistical fingerprint studies have now been performed with whole range of climate variablesand not with surface temperature only examples include variables like ocean heat content atmospheric water vapor surface specific humidity continental river runoff sealevel pressure patterns stratospheric and tropospheric temperature tropopause height zonalmean precipitation over land and arctic seaice extent the bottomline message from this body of work is that natural causes alone cannot plausibly explain the climate changes we have actually observed the climate system is telling us an internally and physicallyconsistent story the integrity and reliability of this story does not rest on single observational dataset as michaels and the cei incorrectly claim i have known phil for most of my scientific career he is the antithesis of the secretive data destroying character the cei and michaels are trying to portray to the outside world phil and tom wigley have devoted significant portions of their scientific careers to the construction of the land surface temperature component of the hadcrut dataset they have conducted this research in very open and transparent mannerexamining sensitivities to different gridding algorithms different ways of adjusting for urbanization effects use of various subsets of data different ways of dealing with changes in spatial coverage over time etc they have thoroughly and comprehensively documented all of their dataset construction choices they have done tremendous service to the scientific communityand to the planetby making gridded surface temperature datasets available for scientific research they deserve medalsnot the kind of deliberately misleading treatment they are receiving from pat michaels and the cei santer has received several honors awards and fellowships including the department of energy

6httpwwwcruueaacukcrudatatemperature on the cru web page these people just make up motives for what we might or might not have done almost all the data we have in the cru archive is exactly the same as in the global historical climatology network ghcn archive used by the noaa national climatic data center see here 7httpwwwncdcnoaagovoaclimateghcnmonthlyindexphp and here 8httpwwwncdcnoaagovoaclimateresearchghcnghcngridhtml the original raw data are not lost i could reconstruct what we had from us department of energy reports we published in the mid1980s i would start with the ghcn data i know that the effort would be complete waste of time though i may get around to it some time the documentation of what weve done is all in the literature if we have lost any data it is the following 1 station series for sites that in the 1980s we deemed then to be affected by either urban biases or by numerous site moves that were either not correctable or not worth doing as there were other series in the region 2 the original data for sites for which we made appropriate adjustments in the temperature data in the 1980s we still have our adjusted data of course and these along with all other sites that didnt need adjusting 3 since the 1980s as colleagues and national meteorological services 9httpwwwwmointpagesmembersindex_enhtml nmss have produced adjusted series for regions and or countries then we replaced the data we had with the better series in the papers ive always said that homogeneity adjustments are best produced by nmss good example of this is the work by lucie vincent in canada here we just replaced what data we had for the 200 sites she sorted out the crutem3 data for land look much like the ghcn and nasa goddard institute for space studies data
