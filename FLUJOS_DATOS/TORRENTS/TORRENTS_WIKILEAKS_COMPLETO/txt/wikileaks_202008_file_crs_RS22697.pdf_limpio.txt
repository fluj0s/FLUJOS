federal role parking privileges for individuals with disabilities is distinct from the subject of physical accessibility of parking spaces or struct ures the federal role in ensuring physical parking space accessib ility is significant under the americans with disabilities act ada broad nondiscrimination statute2 government entities private businesses and others3 must adhere to the ada standards fo r accessible design when restriping existing or building new parking lots4 the ada standards mandate specific percentages of vanaccessible parking spaces per parking facility and require accessible aisles between certain spaces5 however the ada standards for accessible design do not require governments or other entities to reserve accessible parking sp aces or issue special license plates or placards for indi viduals with disabilities nor does any other ada regulationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22697crs2 6 see hr 1702 98th cong 1983 see also handicapped parking act hr 3889 99th cong 1985 and

at least one federal court has addressed the issue of whether congress intended the uniform system to be merely hortatory mcgarry v mo dept of rev 7 fsupp2d 1022 1026 wd mo 1998 that court held that in contrast to the ada the uniform system is voluntary program that states can choose to adopt id 11 23 usc 402 2008mandate the provision of such parking privileges therefore any federal action on parking privileges occurs separately from federal rules on physical parking space accessibility congress first considered fe deral action on parking priv ileges for individuals with disabilities in the mid1980s in response to complaints that some states did not honor parking placards for individuals with di sabilities from other states the first bills introduced during that period would have cr eated federal guidelines and authorized penalties for states that failed to comply with those guidelines specifically the initial bills proposed federal sanctions in the form of reduced highway pportionments for states that failed to recognize parking placards issued by other states or failed to implement federal rules6 however those early proposals were not reported out of their respective committees since that time the federal government has created guidelines for parking privileges in 1988 congress enacted legislation requiri ng the department of transportation to create uniform system of parking privileges for people with disabilities7 accordingly the department of transportation promulga ted the uniform system for parking for persons with disabilities8 however congress has never required states to comply with the uniform system nor has it authorized penaltie s for noncomplying states9 rather the enacted law and resulting federal guidelines are merely hortatory10 the legislation re quired the department to encourage adoption of such system by all the states11 but it did not require states to adopt the federal guidelines thus although the federal gove rnment has strong advisory role states have the ultimate responsibility for the devel opment of parking privileges the uniform system the stated purpose of the department of transportations uniform system for parking for persons with disabilities is to provide guidelines to states for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22697crs3 12 23 cfr 12351 2008 13 the ada defin ition of disability is codified at 42 usc 12102

state statutes which incorporate the uniform system definition of person with disability which impairs or limits the ability to walk have held that this uniform system finition is broader th an the ada finition of disability ie some courts have held that the uniform system definition does not apply to individuals who would not otherwise be covered under the ada see eg duprey v conn dept of motor vehicles 191 frd 329 33536 d conn 2000 15 23 cfr 12352b 2008 16 id 17 the uniform system defines special license plate as license plate that displays the international symbol of access 1 in color that

system12 thus the uniform system provides model definitions and rules regarding eligibility application procedures and issuance of special license plates and placards it also contains information to aid states in developing reciprocal systems of parking privileges including sample placards and model rule regarding reciprocity the uniform system is brief it does not contain model rules regarding enforcement nor does it provide model rules specifying lengths of time after which special plates or placards must be renewed or addressing whether eligible individuals must be primary users of vehicles with special license plat instead it contains basic definitions and samples that the department encourages states to utilize as part of their own more detailed parking privilege systems eligibility one key provision in the uniform system is the model definition of eligible individuals unlike the ada wh ich protects every individual with disability13 the uniform system extends parking privileges only to persons with disabilities which impair or limit the ability to walk14 this definition includes people who 1 cannot walk 200 feet without stopping to rest 2 cannot walk without the aid of another person or certain assistive devices 3 have re spiratory volumes of less than certain amount due to lung disease 4 use portable oxygen 5 have cardiac conditions of specified severity or 6 are severely limited in their ability to walk by arthritic neurological or orthopedic condition15 under the uniform system individuals fit within any of these categories must be determined by licensed physician16 application process if an individual qualifies as person with disability which impairs or limits his or her ability to walk then under the uniform systems model rules he or she may submit an application for special license plates17 or windshield placard which entitle the individual to park in specially reserved parking spaces18 certification from licensed physician must accompany an initial application for suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22697crs4 19 23 cfr 12353a 2008 23 cfr 12354b 2008 23 cf r 12355b 2008 20 23 cfr 12353c 2008 several federal circuit courts have

placards together with special license plates placards shall be the only recognized means of identifying vehicles pe rmitted to utilize parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities which limit or impai r the ability to walk under the uniform system21 the system delineates two types of windshield placards removable windshield placards and temporary removable windshield placards removable windshield placards are appropriate for individuals who will qualify as persons with disabilities which impair or limit the ability to walk permanently or for at least six months temporary removable windshield placards are most appropriate for individuals who will have such an impairment or limitation for less than six months22 the uniform system provides samples of each type of windshield placard23 the sample placards display the i nternational symbol of access which was adopted by the disability rights organization re habilitation international in 196924 the symbol is commonly recognized image of wheelchair and is best known as white chair on blue background the samples also include spaces in which to display names of issuing authorities and expiration dates for the placards25 reciprocity in addition to sample placards which aid efforts for reciprocity among states indirectly by providing co mmonly recognized symbol the uniform system includes model rule that directly addresse s reciprocity it provides that states shall recognize removable windshield placards temporary removable windshield placards and special license plates which have been issued by issuing authorities of other states26 state responses all states have laws governing parking privileges for individuals with disabilities and nearly all states have adopted at least some portion of the department of transportations uniform system most states extend privileges to visitors with placardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22697crs5 27 for more information regarding states placar d designs see

states have incorporated the uniform systems definition of an individual with disability which limits or impairs the ability to walk wordforword into their eligibility criteria28 other states eligibility criteria are entirely distinct from the uniform system definition29 between these two options most states have incorporated the uniform syst ems definition in their statutes but have modified or expanded it for example some states have added category for blindness to the uniform system definition30 reciprocity most states extend parking privileges to individuals with special license plates or placards issued by other states many states even extend privileges to people with placards issu ed by other countries31 the language in these reciprocity provisions differs from state to state some st ates codified most or all of the uniform systems reciprocity provision32 other states adopted little or language from the uniform system but recognize outofstate placards nonetheless33 few states extend conditional privileges to outofstate visitors for example north dakota extends privileges only to people from states that also extend privileges to traveling north dakotans34 however even states that extend parking privileges to outofstate visitors have rules that outofstate visitors might not know to follow for example iowa requires that placards be displayed only when individua ls with disabilities are actually utilizing reserved parking spaces35httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22697crs6 36 see eg mo rev stat 30114211 2008 requiring placards to be renewed every four years iowa code 321l21a3 2008 pro viding application criteria for nonexpiring windshield placardsapplication process and administration the state laws are fairly similar regarding some application procedures and criteria for which the uniform system provides model rules for exampl most states require eligib individuals to apply for both special license plates and either temporary or more permanent windshield placards likewise most states issue special license plates or placards after receipt of an application containing certification by physicia n as the uniform system suggests in contrast states laws are relatively different regarding administrative aspects of parking privileges that the uniform system does not address for example state rules regarding the duration for which removabl windshield placards will be valid an aspect the uniform system does not address vary from just two years to indefinitely36 in sum the department of transpor tations uniform system has increased uniformity in the state laws many states utilize uniform sample placards and have enacted statutes requiring reciprocal privileges for individuals bearing placards issued by other states nonetheless the state systems differ in many aspects of parking privilege administration
