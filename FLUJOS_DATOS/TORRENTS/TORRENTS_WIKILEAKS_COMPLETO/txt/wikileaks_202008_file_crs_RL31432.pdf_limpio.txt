has led to agreements to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide co 2 and under certain circumstances to count additional carbon absorbed in soils and vegetation as part of the emissions reductions congress may consider options to increase the carbon stored sequestered in forests as it debates this and related issues forests are significant part of the global carbon cycle plants use sunlight to convert co 2 water and nutrients into sugars and carbohydrates which accumulate in leaves twigs stems and roots plants also respire releasing co 2 plants eventually die releasing their stored carbon to the atmosphere quickly or to the soil where it decomposes slowly and increases soil carbon levels however little information exists on the processes and diverse rates of soil carbon change how to account for changes in forest carbon has been contentious land use changesespecially afforestation and deforestationcan have major impacts on carbon storage foresters often cut some vegetation to enhance growth of desired trees enhanced growth stores more carbon but the cut vegetation releases co 2 the net effect depends on many factors such as prior and subsequent growth rates and the quantity and disposal of cut vegetation rising atmospheric co 2 may stimulate tree growth but limited availability of other nutrients may constrain that growth in this context timber harvesting is an especially controversial forestry practice some argue that the carbon released by cutting exceeds the carbon stored in wood products and in tree growth by new forests others counter that oldgrowth forests store little or additional carbon and that new forest growth and efficient wood use can increase net carbon storage the impacts probably vary widely and depend on many factors including soil impacts treatment of residual forest biomass proportion of carbon removed from the site and duration and disposal of the products to date the quantitative relationships between these factors and net carbon storage have not been established some observers are concerned that leakage will undermine any us efforts to sequester carbon by protecting domestic forests by leakage they mean that wood supply might shift to other countries exacerbating global climate change and causing other environmental problems or that wood products might be replaced by other products that use more energy to manufacture thus releasing more co 2 others counter that the leakage arguments ignore the enormous disparity in ecological systems and product preferences and discount possible technological solutions several federal government programs affect forestry practices and thus carbon sequestration activities in federal forests affect carbon storage and release timber harvesting is the most controversial such activity federal programs also provide technical and financial help for managing and protecting private forests and tax provisions affect private forest management various federal programs can also affect the extent of forested area by supporting development which may cause deforestation or encouraging tree planting in open areas such as pastures

extensive international discussions and negotiations1 responses to this concern have focused on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases especially carbon dioxide and on measuring carbon absorbed by and stored in forests soils and oceans one option for slowing the rise of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and thus possible climate change is to increase the amount of carbon removed by and stored in forests as congress debates climate change and options for addressing the issue ideas for increasing carbon sequestration in forests are likely to be discussed this report examines basic questions concerning carbon sequestration in forests the first section provides brief background on congressional interest in forest carbon sequestration the second describes the basic carbon cycle in forests with an overview of how carbon cycling and storage vary among different types of forests the third section then addresses how forest carbon is considered in the global climate change debate the section begins with an overview of accounting for forest carbon then discusses the carbon consequences of forest management practices the effects of changes in land use and leakage the section then concludes with summary of existing federal programs that could affect forest carbon sequestration 2

at the earth summit in rio janeiro the united nations framework convention on climat change which included voluntary pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was opened for signature president george h w bush signed this treaty which was then ratified by the us senate subsequent negotiations led to the 1997 kyot protocol under which the developed nations agreed to specified reductions in their emissions of greenhouse gases president clinton signed the kyoto protocol but did not submit it to the senate for ratification early in 2001 the george w bush administration decided to reject the kyoto protocol and withdrew from active participation in negotiations on the issues that remain to be resolved3 although enough other parties have ratified the protocol to bring it into force the lack of us involvement means that the united states will not participate in the emissions trading or other elements of the kyoto protocol activities that might relate to carbon sequestration the most voluminous greenhouse gas produced by humans is carbon dioxide co 2 in calculating overall carbon emissions the protocol allows certain removals of carbon by nations forests and soilscarbon sinksto be counte d and deducted from emissions thus one option 1 this report does not address underlying questions of whether global warming is occurring or of the possible human role see crs report rl33849 climate change science and policy implications by jane leggett 2 this report does not address the impacts of climate change on forests although this is also an important scientific issue for discussion of these impacts see the series of articles in special section on climate change and forest ecosystems bioscience v 51 9 sept 2001 720779 3 seecrs report rl33826 climate change the kyoto

changeis to increase the amount of carbon stored in forests carbon sequestration and the extent to which it can be counted as reduction in nations carbon emissions have been the focus of substantial controversy in international negotiations to finalize the operational rules of the kyoto protocol the united states with its extensive forests argued that the carbon absorbed by them should be allowed to offset emissions with quantitative limit to the amounts that can be counted in this way the european union argued strongly in negotiations prior to 2001 that there should be fairly strict limits on how much carbon absorbed by sinks such as forests could be counted against emissions in final negotiations during 2001 on rules to implement the kyoto protocol afte r the united states had withdrawn from the negotiations compromise was reached that allows significant credit for carbon sinks removals and storage of carbon the members of congress attending these negotiations prior to 2001 followed this debate with interest and were awar of the potential impacts of the various possible results of the negotiations in particular if emissions trading were to begin under the kyoto protocol forest owners and managers in countries that were parties to the treaty might be able to receive credits and participate in the trading regime administration and congressional interest in carbon sequestration continues but us participation in the kyoto process is moot at this time it is not clear whether domestic forest carbon program might be established although options have been discussed in legislative proposals protecting forests in developing countries which might earn credits under the kyoto protocol is already supported under the tropical forest conservation act pl 105214 22 usc 2341 et seq 4 mitigating climate change by enhancing forest carbon sequestration may be relatively lowcost option and would likely yield other environmental benefits however forest carbon sequestration faces challenges measuring the additional carbon stored over and above what would occur naturally monitoring and verifying the results and preventing leakage numerous issues regarding the carbon cycle in forests monitoring the levels and changes in forest carbon and the scientific uncertainties about the relationships among forests carbon and climate change are likely to be the subject of ongoing federal research efforts with funding and oversight by the congress g5g138g155g139g152g151g561g5g162g140g149g146g151g144g561g146g151g561g8g152g155g142g156g157g156g561 photosynthesis is the chemical process by which plants use sunlight to convert nutrients into sugars and carbohydrates carbon dioxide co 2 is one of the nutrients essential to building the organic chemicals that comprise leaves roots and stems all parts of plantthe stem limbs and leaves and rootscontain carbon but the proportion in each part varies enormously depending on the plant species and the individual specimens age and growth pattern nonetheless as more photosynthesis occurs more co 2 is converted into biomass reducing carbon in the atmosphere and sequestering storing it in plant tissue vegetation

the process at times eg at night and during winter seasons in nontropical climates living growing forests are net emitters of co 2 although they are generally net carbon sinks over the life of the forest when vegetation dies carbon is released to the atmosphere this can occur quickly as in fire5 or slowly as fallen trees leaves and other detritus decompose for herbaceous plants the above ground biomass dies annually and begins to decompose right away but for woody plants some of the aboveground biomass continues to store carbon until the plant dies and decomposes this is the essence of the carbon cycle in forestsnet carbon accumulation sequestration with vegetative growth and release of carbon when the vegetation dies thus the amount of carbon sequestered in forest is constantly changing with growth death and decomposition of vegetation in addition to being sequestered in vegetation carbon is also sequestered in forest soils carbon is the organic content of the soil generally in the partially decomposed vegetation humus both on the surface and in the upper soil layers in the organisms that decompose vegetation decomposers and in the fine roots 6 the amount of carbon in soils varies widely depending on the environment and the history of the site soil carbon accumulates as dead vegetation is added to the surface and decomposers respond carbon is also injected into the soil as roots grow root biomass increases soil carbon is also slowly released to the atmosphere as the vegetation decomposes scientific understanding of the rates of soil carbon accumulation and decomposition is currently not sufficient for predicting changes in the amount of carbon sequestered in forest soils g22g145g142g561g8g152g155g142g156g157g561g5g162g140g149g142g561 forests generally go through cycles of growth and death sequestering and releasing carbon some forests begin on spacious sites with little or existing vegetation that may have been cleared by natural disaster most commonly wildfire or by human activities eg for agriculture other forests are relatively continuous with natural clearings typically limited to the area occupied by one or few large trees killed by lightning disease and such regardless of the size or origin of clearing most forests begin from essentially bare land with some carbon stored in the soil how much depends on the environment and history of the site especially the last clearing process as trees and other woody plants become established carbon stored on the site increases as woody biomass increases and as annual vegetation eg tree leaves and herbaceous plants typically grows faster than it decomposes productivity fo r commercially usable wood generally follows an sshaped curve with the volume growing at an in creasing rate for many years to point known to foresters as the culmination of mean annual increment generally taking 20 to 100 years or more depending on the fertility of the site and the tree species and then growing at decreasing rate for many more years in theory forests can eventually become overmature where the loss of commercial volume through tree mortality equals or exceeds the additional growth on the 5 fire is selfsustaining chemical process that breaks organic chemicals down into minerals water and co 2 6 roots less than 2 millimeters in diameter are generally considered to be part of the soil not part of the plant that grew them httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31432g5g138g155g139g152g151g561g21g142g154g158g142g156g157g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g146g151g561g8g152g155g142g156 g157g156g561

overmature forests continue to accumulate carbon in their soils7 the relationship between commercially usable wood produced and carbon sequestered varies substantially in three ways first the proportion of carbon in trees commercial wood compared to the noncommercial biomass in bark limbs roots and leaves or needles varies among species some eg pines and other conifers have greater proportion of their total carbon in commercial wood 8 second the proportion of carbon in trees commercial wood undoubtedly changes over time while temporal graph of carbon storage is probably also s shaped as for commercial wood productivity the changes in timing and rates of increase that cause the characteristic s shape almost certainly differ finally significant portion of the vegetative carbon sequestered in forest is in other plantsnoncommercial species of trees shrubs grasses and other herbaceous plants the amount of carbon stored in this other noncommercial growth varies widely among forests thus although many research studies assume fixed relationship between commercial wood inventories and the amount of carbon stored 9 the traditional measures of commercial wood production might not be very accurate for estimating carbon sequestration in forests eventually trees die they may be cut down burned in wildfire blown over or snapped off in wind or ice storm or killed by insects or diseases death can happen to single tree in forest creating small opening or to all or most trees in an area how quickly the carbon is released to the atmosphere depends on the cause of tree death on whether it is harvested for use and on various environmental factors as noted above fires quickly break down biomass and release an enormous amount of co 2 into the atmosphere natural death and decay may require several weeks to several decades to completely decompose the biomass depending on site conditions putting some carbon into the soil and some directly into the atmosphere timber harvesting can store some vegetative carbon for very long periods in solid wood products with longterm uses eg construction lumber in houses while tree tops and limbs and noncommercial species are left to decay or to be burned these possibilities are discussed in more depth below under forestry events and management activities 7 guoyi zhou shugyang liu zhian li deqiang zhang xuli tang

they typically have high carbon contentsaveraging nearly 110 tons per acre see table 1 about half of the carbon in moist tropical forests is contained in the vegetation higher percentage and much higher quantity than in any other biome the remaining carbon is in tropical forest soils tropical forest soils have only modest carbon levels compared with other biomes because the dead biomass rapidly decomposes in the warm humid conditions and the minerals rapidly leach out of tropical forest soils g22g142g150g153g142g155g138g157g142g561g8g152g155g142g156g157g156g561 temperate forests typically occur in the midlatitudesgenerally to about 50 north and south of the equator little farther north in europe because of the continental warming from the gulf stream there are large variety of temperate forests including hardwood types eg oak hickory and maplebeechbirch softwood types g southern pine douglasfir and lodgepole pine and few mixed types eg oakpine however within each forest type and overall temperate forests have much lower tree species diversity than tropical forests temperate forests generally contain less carbon than tropical forests averaging nearly 70 tons per acre more than onethird of the carbon is stored in the vegetation and nearly twothirds in the soil the higher proportion but lower level in the temperate forest soils compared to tropical forest soils is because of slower decomposition rates many of these forests are managed to produce commercial wood products and the management practices used in temperate forests can thus have significant impact on carbon sequestration g4g152g155g142g138g149g561g8g152g155g142g156g157g156g561 boreal forests generally occur north of temperate forests mostly in alaska canada scandinavia and russia the only boreal forests in the southern hemisphere are on mountaintops in new zealand and high in the andes mountains of s outh america boreal forests are dominated by conifersmostly spruce fir and larch with scattered birch and aspen stands boreal forests generally contain more carbon than temperate or tropical forests averaging more than 180 tons per acre less than onesixth of boreal forest carbon is in vegetation the rest 84 is in boreal forest soilsabout three times the amount in temperate and tropical forests and far higher than any other biome except wetlands 13 carbon accumulates to high levels

carbon continued major softwood species pines firs and spruces trees of the order coniferales conifers however some hardwood species eg aspen and poplar are much softer less dense than many softwoods in temperate areas most hardwoods are also deciduous losing all their leaves annually while most conifers are evergreen retaining their needles for more than one year leading to common use of deciduous and evergreen as synonyms for angiosperms and conifers however certain conifers notably larches are deciduous while many hardwoods in subtropical climates and most in tropical climates are evergreen for this report hardwood is used to indicate angiosperms while softwood or conifer is used for coniferous species 13 soil carbon levels in wetlands are nearly double the level in boreal forests b ecause the frequent standing water prevents aerobic decomposition and anaerobic without oxygen decomposition processes are much slower than aerobic processes

general countries with extensive and expanding forests eg russia canada brazil and the united states prefer full accounting while countries with less forestland eg many european countries are concerned about the potential to overstate the carbon benefits of forestry management practices and land use changes that enhance carbon sequestration countries with net deforestation rates are also concerned about counting forest sequestration because it could effectively increase their net emission rated under international agreements article 33 of the kyoto protocol allows counting the carbon effects both sequestration and release of afforestation reforestation deforestation and other forestry and land use changes that have occurred since 1990 if the change in carbon stock is verified verification requires system for estimating the carbon effectsbecause census of carbon changes on every forested acre is infeasibleand for reporting the carbon effects for countries with carbon commitments rather than for projects the surest easiest system for verifying the change in carbon levels is to measur the change in the levels from the beginning to the end of the relevant time period1990 the baseline and 20082012 the kyoto protocol commitment period however this is very slow and expensive approach 14 variety of models can be used for estimating carbon level changes the two basic approaches are landbased approach which begins by identifying the acceptable activities for sequestering carbon and estimating the carbon consequences of those activities and then monitors the lands to determine the extent to which those activities occur and an activitybased approach which also begins by identifying the acceptable activities for sequestering carbon and estimating the carbon

addition there are scientific uncertainties in measuring the 1990 baseline carbon stocks the lands treated the carbon impacts of various treatments and the question of leakage as discussed in the

conversion of forests to pasture cropland urban areas or other landscapes that have few or trees afforestation is planting trees on lands that have not grown trees in recent years such as abandoned cropland not all land use changes have comparable carbon consequences tropical deforestation if pasture replaces the forest could substantially reduce carbon sequestration since tropical savannahs store less than half as much carbon on average as tropical forests 18 in contrast in temperate zones carbon sequestration might actually increase if native grassland replaces forest since temperate grasslands store 50 more carbon on average than do temperate forests but if the temperate deforestation is for crop production less carbon would be sequestered since croplands store only half as much carbon on average as temperate forests 19 the actual impacts both the quantity and the timing or duration of the changeprobably depend on the actual practices employed on the various sites other changes may be less obvious converting working forest ie one that is managed to produce timber and other values to rural residential subdivision would likely reduce forest cover and perhaps undergrowth thus releasing some vegetative carbon but the rest of the vegetation would likely continue to grow and thus may continue to sequester carbon for longer in the subdivision than in working forest depending on the nature and duration of the wood products derived from the working forest 15 ipcc special report 4 carbon accounting 16 ipcc special report paragraph 31 17 birdsey et forest

consequences of land use changes especially in temperate zones according to the 1997 national resources inventory more than 25 million acres of private forestland in the united states were converted to other uses between 1982 and 199720 of these nearly 12 million acres were developed for other uses while 4 million acres were converted to pasture and nearly 4 million acres were either inundated by water deforested or transferred to federal ownership and probably remained forested during the same period nearly 26 million acres were converted to private forestlanda net increase of nearly million acres of private forestland of these more than half nearly 14 million acres were previously pastureland and more than 5 million acres were cropland the conversion of forestland to other uses is dominated by development the rate of development reflects economic growth interest rates and development incentivesstronger growth lower interest rates greater incentives stimulate more development and more conversion of forestland while slower growth or recession higher intere st rates or weaker incentives may retard development while federal monetary fiscal and tax policies clearly affect development rates their impact on forestland conversion is likely less of consideration than the goal of trying to provide stable economic growth for the us economy the conversion of pasture and cropland to forests is also affected by the general economy but is also likely to be directly affected by existing federal programs such as the forestry assistance programs and other agricultural conservation programs discussed below g8g152g155g142g156g157g155g162g561g7g159g142g151g157g156g561g138g151g141g561g15g138g151g138g144g142g150g142g151g157g561g3g140g157g146g159g146g157g146g142g156g561 as discussed above forests cycle carbon accum ulating carbon from the atmosphere during some periods in the forest cycle and releasing carbon to the atmosphere at other times when forest practices alter the vegetation on site they alter this ebb and flow of carbon storage and release by changing biomass levels vegetative growth patterns and soil structure and composition there have been debates in the literature and at least one congressional hearing about the carbon impacts of various forest management practices 21 this section examines the implications of various forestry practices and

vegetation on siteto harvest commercial wood to focus growth on fewer trees to reduce competition among plants etc what happens to the cut vegetation is critical for assessing carbon sequestration when commercial harvests are involved some of the biomass is removed from the site and turned into products the carbon consequences of removed vegetation are discussed below how much biomass and carbon is removed has not been broadly quantified various studies report that 50 to 80 of tree carbon excluding forest soil carbon is removed in commercial timber harvest operations 22 others have stated that wood products formed only modest fraction of the total carbon stored by forest23 this is consistent with newer report showing wood products and landfills accounting for little more than 6 of forestrelated carbon stocks24 the proportion of carbon and biomass removed from any particular site varies widely and depends on the species involved the density of the stand which affects both tree form and undergrowth vegetation the diversity of tree species and tree sizes in the stand and various environmental factors eg the sites climate and soil fertility much biomass and carbon remains on the site for some forest practices such as precommercial thinning described below all the cut biomass remains on the site the remaining biomass coarse roots limbs leaves or needles and other unusable woody material often called slash in timber harvestingbegins to deteriorate and to release carbon how fast the carbon is released depends on whether and how the biomass is treated slash treatments include rolling chopping and crushing all of which are designed to compact the biomass and accelerate its deterioration which typically takes several weeks to several years depending primarily on the climate burning is also common and leads to deterioration and release of some of the carbon to the atmosphere in minutes or hours rather than weeks months or years many research studies presume that the carbon from slash is released within year of the harvest others presume that it is quickly absorbed by new growth resulting from the treatment data on the extent of various slash treatments and on the carbon impacts of the various treatments are sparse 22 see mark harmon william k ferrell and jerry f franklin effects on carbon storage of conversion of old growth forests

addresses the mechanisms by which carbon is accumulated in and released by forest soils one source noted the large uncertainty in estimates of change in soil carbon25 dead vegetation is broken down by decomposersprimarily invertebrate animals and fungi decomposition releases carbon to the atmosphere and incorporates carbon as organic matter humus in the soil the dead carbon in the soil ie not the decomposers or fine plant roots which comprise the living carbon in the soil slowly continues to decompose changing from organic to inorganic forms the inorganic forms eventually 1 dissolve in percolating rainwater and leach through the soil into groundwater and surface waters 2 oxidize and get released directly to the atmosphere or 3 are absorbed by new vegetation the rates at which carbon from dead vegetation returns to the atmosphere likely depend on variety of factors such as the nature of the vegetation the composition of the soil and the humidity levels all of which affect the type and quantity of decomposers on site activities that disturb soils almost certainly decrease soil carbon levels some studies presume loss of soil carbon following soildisturbing activity such as timber harvesting 26 others note the loss without quantifying it27 in general disturbing soils accelerates decomposition rates by increasing exposure of soil carbon to air thus accelerating oxidation activities that disturb soils also kill living soil carboninvertebrate animals fungi and fine rootswhich then begin to decompose thus forestry activities that disturb soils particularly activities to remove the cut vegetation such as commercial timber harvesting will also likely reduce soil carbon levels forestry activities that do not disturb soils such as fertilization and prescribed burning probably have much less effect on soil carbon although they affect the forest carbon balance in other ways as discussed below

in forests several of the forestry practices discussed below are intended at least partly to reduce wildfire risks by reducing biomass levelswildfire fuels the presumption is that lower fuel loads will lead to fewer and less intense fires that are easier and less costly to control numerous ontheground anecdotes support this presumption however little empirical research documents this presumption one study found that scant information exists on fuel treatment efficacy for reducing wildfire severity 30 summary of wildfire research reported that prescribed burning generally reduced fire severity that mechanical fuel reduction did not consistently reduce fire severity and that little research has examined the potential impacts of mechanical fuel reduction with prescribed burning or of commercial logging31 the possibility of removing some noncommercial biomass from the forest and using it to produce energy is also being considered and is discussed below one study found that fires in boreal forests may actually cool the atmosphere despite their large co 2 releases32 the researchers found that loss of darkcolored conifers increased snow cover and that subsequent regrowth was of lightcolored birch and aspen the result was significantly greater albedo light reflectivity which led to greater cooling than the co 2 release led to warming the extent to which this conclusion can be extended is unclear and of course boreal forest fires may have other undesirable effects g8g152g155g142g156g157g155g162g561g18g155g138g140g157g146g140g142g156g561 in general forestry practices are used for four basic goals or purposes to establish trees on site to reduce vegetative competition to improve tree growth in other ways and to harvest the commercially usable wood in the climate

now cleared because of timber harvesting or natural disaster the practice is called reforestation tree planting on sites that have not recently had trees on them such as pastures is called afforestation in addition interplanting planting additional trees is used on sites that have fewer trees than are considered desirable reforestation can use natural or artificial methods natural regeneration relies on tree seeds from surrounding forest stands artificial regeneration includes planting seeds or more commonly seedlings from nurseries on the site advantages of natural regeneration include lower cost and greater stand diversity both of tree species and of the genetic diversity of the dominant tree 30 philip n omi and erik j martinson effects of fuels treatment on

to pests and pathogens advantages of artificial regeneration include greater dominance of commercially desirable tree species greater control over the number of trees established and more rapid establishment of trees all of which increase growth of the desired trees artificial regeneration may be necessary for afforestation since surrounding tree seed sources might be inadequate or nonexistent artificial regeneration likely provides more commercial wood growth faster and may sequester more carbon faster than natural regeneration establishing stands of trees will generally sequester more carbon than leaving the sites without forest cover savannas and other nonforest biomes store much less carbon in their vegetation and may reach plateau or stable carbon stock in their soils in only few years in contrast forests continue to sequester additional carbon in vegetation and roots as it grows for many yearsusually at least decades and even centuries in some ecosystems note however from table 1 that temperate grasslands have greater average carbon stocks than temperate forests generally because perennial grasses increase soil carbon more than forests thus reforestation and especially afforestation regardless of whether by natural or artificial regeneration generally provide continuing additional carbon sequestration for an extended period

that competes with the trees for space light and nutrients this practice is called release when the competing vegetation is as tall as or taller than the desired trees or when it is of different species eg palmetto growing under southern pine trees release can be done chemically with herbicides or mechanically with machines or tools to kill the unwanted vegetation thinning is the forestry practice of removing some of the desired tree species as well as the undesired tree species when the competition for space light and nutrients reduces the growth rate of the commercial timber volume precommercial thinning occurs when the trees are too small to have any commercial value generally less than 55 inches in diameter while commercial thinning is the practice of selling the trees to be removed thinning and release are often proposed as forest management practices to increase forest carbon sequestration some models estimate total carbon on site as fixed relationship to commercial wood volume on site since thinning and release increase commercial timber growth these models would similarly project thinning and release to increase carbon sequestration others however observe that the purpose of thinning and release is often to concentrate the same amount of growth on fewer stems 33 one study examined the potential of thinning and release to increase carbon storage34 this study found that thinning only increased total carbon storage in dense young stands where severe competition significantly reduced growth rates in other cases the practice was redistributing stand growth to smaller number of larger trees with little overall change in carbon storage the author also noted that thinning may increase the loss of soil carbon by reducing canopy cover and disturbing the surface and thus accelerating decomposition rates in contrast release in southern pine ecosystem was found to increase total carbon storage 33 see david m smith the practice of silviculture 7th ed new york ny

removes the lowest branches of commercial tree which may stimulate some upward growth but generally emphasizes wood value growing clear wood without knots rather than growth it is not used much because it has been found to be unprofitable in most situations fertilizing forest stands is another practice to in crease tree growth applying fertilizers to forests can significantly increase growth rates if the nutrient being applied nitrogen potassium phosphorus etc is in short supply in the forest soil furthermore fertilization is likely to stimulate all vegetative growth not just tree growth this is borne out in research on the impact of forestry practices on carbon sequestration 35 an important question whose answer is not apparent from the research is whether the accelerated growth rate from fertilization persists for long time ie whether the growth rate remains higher for an extended period whether it produces shortterm increase for which the prefertilizer rate is sustained for long time ie whether the prefertilization growth rate is maintained after the shortterm increase or whether other factors limit longterm growth rates ie whether growth rates after the shortterm increase are less than the prefertilization growth rates because other nutrients are overdrawn by the fertilizerstimulated growth some have suggested that greater atmospheric co 2 levels could fertilize forests stimulating tree growth number of studies artificially increased co 2 levels in tree plantations and found that growth rates did increase36 others however question whether the increased growth rate can be sustained37 at the broader scale in at least some areas other nutrients especially nitrogen are likely to limit the ability of forests to expand growth with more co 2 available another forestry practice which is becoming more widely used is prescribed burning intentionally setting fires in certain forest areas under specified weather and fuel conditions38 prescribed burning typically produces many forest benefits including less competing vegetation akin to release or thinning lower fuel loads that may contribute to catastrophic wildfires and 35 schroeder intensive

is typically only used in ecosystems adapted to relatively frequent surface fires 5 to 35year intervals between fires which burn the grasses needles tw igs and undergrowth while allowing most of the trees to survive such frequentfire ecosystems occur primarily in temperate zones especially where lightning occurs with little or rainfall however not all temperate forest ecosystems have adapted to relatively frequent surface fires some such as lodgepole pine jack pine and aspen are adapted to regenerate naturally following periodic crown fires where many or most of the trees are killed in such

components however prescribed fires also present risk since they occasionally escape from the prescribed areas and can cause damage they also generate substantial amounts of carbon dioxide one of the mineral components of biomass and other air pollution in the short term prescribed fires clearly increase atmospheric carbon levels to the extent that prescribed burning reduces catastrophic wildfires this practice may be shifting one source of carbon emissions wildfire to another prescribed fire however to date quantitative relationship has been established between prescribed burning and the extent and severity of wildfires in addition at least for dead biomass on site prescribed burning merely concentrates into few minutes or hours the carbon release that occurs over few weeks to few years in other forms of biomass decomposition thus it is not clear how much of the carbon release from prescribed burning is in addition to the carbon release that might otherwise occur from forests

plywood have differing usable lives depending on the use of the wood and ranging from less than 10 years for shipping pallets to 100 years or more for residential construction40 clearly some woodfrom broken pallets furniture concrete forms etcis disposed in landfills and probably sequesters carbon there and some is burned but the majority of carbon in solid wood products remains sequestered in those products for decades most more than 95 of the bark and sawdust are either used as pulp to make paper or burned to produce energy thus substituting for timber used in papermaking or for fossil fuels less than 5 of waste wood from sawmills ends up in landfills for pulpwood logs or bolts less than 115 inches in diameter and usually less than 8 feet in length and waste from sawtimber

there is little paper waste that returns carbon directly to the atmosphere in contrast to solid wood products which may sequester carbon for decades most paper products have relatively brief duration

reduce the carbon released by paper production and use the carbon impacts of commercial timber harvesting have been debated extensively but with little resolution some have calculated that harvesting timber from an overmature forest can sequester substantial additional carbon because the forest is currently sequestering little additional carbon the amount stored is large but annual addition from tree growth is small or even negative b the timber can continue to store carbon for decades in longterm solid wood products and c the newly established stand can sequester large amounts of carbon through its vigorous growth43 others have calculated that the carbon released by harvesting operations substantially exceeds the additional carbon sequestered by new forest stands44 one source has stated that timber harvesting in heavy thinning or selection harvest reduces carbon storage because the growth of residual trees is less rapid than the decomposition of the detritus and harvested wood products 45 another study has shown that some oldgrowth forests continue to accumulate carbon in their soils46 all of these conclusions may be valid in certain circumstances the consequences probably depend on variety of factors such as which products are manufactured how those products are used how much carbon is left on the site and what happens to it there are of course other considerations associated with discussions of harvesting oldgrowth forests in addition reduced impact logging ril has been developed primarily to reduce the damage that timber harvesting can do to soils and to residual trees it is becoming more widely discussed especially for tropical forest harvests but descriptions of ril are generally either lacking in details or highly sitespecific with limited general applicability this is probably because the practices that will reduce logging damages depend on variety of site conditions such as soil type and water content tree species diversity etc nonetheless as ril becomes more widely practiced it seems likely that logging damages including carbon release will decline g25g152g152g141g561g7g151g142g155g144g162g561 using wood residues for energy production has

modifying it to produce more consistent burning characteristics eg by pulverizing it and compressing it into pellets or by digesting it to produce liquid fuel methanol or ethanol the biomass remaining from ethanol production is also burnable and can be used to power the ethanol production instead of using fossil fuels many have noted that abnormally high biomass levels are exacerbating risks of forest fires and have proposed removing much of that biomass to protect forests and communities located near forests such woody forest residues could be used to produce energy using wood for energy has some significant drawbacks although wood could replace some fossil fuels it still produces co 2 and water vapor and some other byproducts when burned wood residues in the forestfrom timber harvesting thinning or other forestry practicesare widely dispersed haul distances and thus costs may limit the scale of wood energy production facilities more important perhaps is that wood residues are highly variable in size ranging from tree tops 4 inches or more in diameter to twigs thus collecting residues is very labor intensive activity the cost to collect and transport forest residues to wood energy facility can be major hindrance to using woody forest residues for energy production g14g142g138g148g138g144g142g561 changes in land use practices to sequester carbon in the united states can also have more subtle impacts on carbon storage globally domestic practices to store carbon by reducing the amount of timber harvested can have an effect commonly called leakage by shifting land uses geographically eg more tropical forest harvests to offset less temperate forest harvests or by shifting demand to other products that require more carbon to produce eg steel or aluminum studs to replace wood studs in homebuilding g14g138g151g141g561g23g156g142g561g14g142g138g148g138g144g142g561 the primary concern expressed in numerous articles is that forest protection and logging restrictions in the united states will lead to more timber harvesting and associated environmental damage elsewhereespecially in tropical foreststo satisfy us demand for wood products48 this leakage is undesirable it is argued because us forest management protects the environment more than comparable activities in other countries these critics assert that us federal and state environmental laws are stricter and more rigorously enforced than other nations environmental laws for protecting air and water quality maintaining animal habitats and preserving rare plants and animals the result is less forest destruction and greater soil protection both of which would lead to less carbon release following timber harvesting in addition most states and federal law for federal lands require reforestation following timber harvests except for planned conversions to other uses so deforestation is less common in the united states 48 see eg h schallau and alberto goetzl effects of

is that harvesting in tropical forests typically results in more waste tropical forest harvests typically focus on the most valuable species leaving most of the trees many of which are damaged temperate forests have less diversity of plant species which can lead to greater efficiency in bi omass utilization and thus less biomass waste to return carbon to the atmosphere also temperate forests have less carbon per acre on average to release when timber is harvested than do tropical forests in addition others note timber extraction is often the first step towards opening up the tropical forest and clearing the land for agricultural production wh at is more in many developing countries property law establishes deforestation as prerequisite of formal claim over the land for those settling in forested areas 50 tropical timber harvests can thus lead to permanent deforestation these rationales are supported by substantial anecdotal evidence but others counter that such assertions have limited empirical foundation concerns generally focus on the potential impacts on tropical forests but the preferred timber species for us consumption are softwoods not the hardwoods found in the tropics it is not clear how much tropical timber would substitute for domestic softwood timber51 imports from tree plantations in chile and new zealand and from virgin forests in eastern russia seem more likely but the environmental effects probably differ substantially from the presumed impacts of leakage to tropical forests52 one economist also has pointed out the difficulties in making international comparisons of environmental choices because of the monumental biological and social differences between the united states and other countries especially those with tropical forests 53 g18g155g152g141g158g140g157g561g6g142g150g138g151g141g561g14g142g138g148g138g144g142g561 another concern often noted is that domestic forest protection to sequester carbon could shift demand to substitute products whose production requires more energy and thus releases more carbon54 most lumber and plywood are used in constructionnew residences home remodeling and nonresidential buildings55 substitute products include steel and aluminum for studs joists and sheathing and concrete and masonry for wall s and flooring the recent reports expressing concerns about product demand

corrim of the national academy of sciences and by the office of technology assessment of the us congress56 while energy use is not perfect predictor of carbon release and production technologies have

annual reforestation expenses64 private landowners are allowed to take tax credit for 10 of their annual reforestation costs up to 1000 credit per year and to amortize their reforestation costs up to 10000 per year over an 84month period with reforestation costs averaging about 250 per acre generally higher in the west and lower in th south this provision would apply to about 40 acres of reforestation annuallynot significant to major corporate forestland owners who may own more than million acres of forestland but substantial for many of the nonindustrial private landowners who own nearly half of the forestland in the united states the second special provision allows the expensing of multiperiod timber growing costs that is annual management expenses can be deducted from other current income rather than capitalized and deducted from timber income from the managed stands as with the accelerated amortization for reforestation this reduces the current income tax liability for the private landownersa significant benefit for all private forestland owners it also simplifies their bookkeeping for tax purposesa significant benefit for the nonindustrial landowners with modest forestland holdings and only occasional timber income finally timber income is allowed to be treated as capital gain if the private landowner has owned the trees for more than year and does not retain an economic interest in the trees after the sale this latter provision essentially precludes certain timber sale practices commonly used by the federal government currently this provision benefits private forestland owners because capital gains tax rates are significantly lower than regular income tax rates these three tax expenditures affect carbonsequestering forestry practices in several ways the reforestation tax credit and accelerated depreciation and the expensing of multiperiod timber growing costs effectively reduce the landowners co sts of these forestry practices which can induce additional forestry practices and thus may add to carbon sequestration capital gains treatment of timber income likely encourages timber harvesting but as discussed above the carbon

programs in addition to the programs discussed above can affect the rate of deforestation and afforestation in the united states development on forest land often called urban sprawl is affected by wide variety of federal programs such as transportation and other infrastructure assistance programs and various tax expenditures the us general accounting office now the government accountability office examined these programs finding that federal impacts are pervasive but that changing federal policies might not have major impacts 65 the only federal program directly targeted on reducing the development of forest land is the forest legacy described above which funds federal and state acquisition of title or easements for forestland threatened with development ie conversion to nonforest uses 64 other reforestation expenses must be capitalized and carried on the books to be deducted against timber income when the reforested stand is harvested 20100 years or more later 65 us general

of forests to and from pasture and cropland66 most notable is the usdas conservation reserve program crp the crp pays farmers who own environmentally sensitive and highly erodible cropland under multiyear contracts to protect those lands planting trees is common method for protecting these croplands and the crp is the largest federal tree planting program that has ever existed even though its primary purpose is to protect soils ot her usda programs that might include funding for afforestation include the environmental quality enhancement program eqip the farmland protection program and the

act of 1992 pl 102486 established purely voluntary system to collect information from entities that emit greenhouse gases including information on how they are reducing emissions or sequesteri ng carbon by any measures including fuel switching forest management practices tree planting and more the energy information agency established guidelines for data reporting and selfcertification while most of the emissions reductions reported in the 1605b program are related to energy efficiency or conservation some are forestry projectsin other countries known as joint implementation as well as within the united states relatively few domestic forestry projects have been reported under the 1605b program reason to report under the program has been the expectation or hope of receiving retroactive credit if carbon credit system were ever established whether such credit would be given and whether reported data are deemed sufficiently reliable remain open and possibly contentious questions g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g156g561 forests store substantial amounts of carbon the amount stored however changes over time as forests grow and die land use changes and forestry practices alter the level and rates of carbon storage while leakage shifting production may offset some of the increases in forest carbon sequestration whether and how to account for this carbon sequestration in policies and programs to mitigate climate change has been controversial under the 1997 kyoto protocol of the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc developed nations agreed to specified reductions in their emissions of greenhouse gases especially carbon dioxide the protocol allows some carbon sequestration as way of meeting the specified reductions the bush administration has rejected the protocol and withdrawn from the continuing activities under the protocol nonetheless accounting for the carbon absorbed by forests and soils and how much credit is due continues to be discussed internationally and the us congress has held hearings on forest carbon sequestration the role of forestry and land use in mitigating c limate change has been controversial forests are enormously variable with broad array of plant species both trees and understory vegetation and substantial differences in the diversity of plant and animal species they contain the myriad permutations of forest plants and soils present formidable obstacles for estimating existing carbon 66 for description of these programs see crs report rl32940 agriculture

forestry activities the carbon consequences of timber harvesting have been particularly controversial because of the scientific uncertainties as well as differences in the types and extent of forests among nations reaching agreement on ways to account for carbon sequestration in forests has been difficult some argue for broadly inclusive accounting others for more conservative approach landbased or activitybased models are generally proposed for estimating changes in carbon storage however the ambiguous language and terminology used by proponents contribute to the inherent difficulties of measuring baseline carbon stocks land uses the carbon impacts of various activities and leakage shifting land or product uses furthermore the enormous diversity of forest types and widespread disputes over the carbon consequences of various practices which result at least partly from the diversity of forests make it difficult to generalize about the opportunities to mitigate global climate change through forest carbon sequestration it is likely that research to reduce some of these ambiguities and uncertainties will be an ongoing element in the efforts of nations to deal with carbon sequestrationand with concerns about climate change g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 ross w gorte specialist in natural resources
