essentially prohibit discrimination against an otherwise qualified individual with disability 7 it should be emphasized that the type of private school placement discussed here is where children with disabilities are unilaterally enrolled in private school by their parents if child with disability is placed in private school by the local education agency in accordance with the childs individualized education program iep this placement is at cost to the parents 20 usc 1412a10b the issues raised in this context are beyond the scope of this report 8 20 usc 1412a10a part b of idea contains the state formula grant program the requirement for free appropriate public education for all children with disabilities and due process protections for such children the participation of children with disabilities who are enrolled in private schools by their parents consistent with the number and location of these children2 these requirements were further detailed in regulations which required that local education agencies leas provide private school studen ts an opportunity for equitable participation in program benefits and that these benefits must be comparable in quality scope and opportunity for participation to the program benefits provided to students in the public schools3 the vagueness of the statute and the equitable participation standard led to differences among the states and localities and to differences among the courts prior to pl 10517 the courts of appeals that had considered these issues had sharply divergent views some courts gave local authorities broad discretion to decide whether to provi services for children with disabilities in private schools which generally resulted in fewer services to such children4 while others attempted to equalize the costs for public and private school children5 the supreme court had granted certiorari in several of these cases but when congress rewrote the law the court vacated and remanded these cases for further consideration6 private school placement under pl 105177 the idea amen dments of 1997 provide that to the extent consistent with the number and location of children with disabilit ies in the state who are enrolled in private schools by their parents provision is made for the participation of these children in provisions assisted by part b by providing them with special education and

secondary schools9 there is also requirement that the statutory provisions relating to child find identifying children with disabilities are applicable to children enrolled in private schools including parochial schools10 the house and senate reports emphasized that the changes made by pl 10517 should resolve issues raised by the courts by specifying that the total amount of money that must be spent to provide special education and related services to children with disabilities in the state who have been placed by their parents in private schools be limited to proportional amount of the federal funds under part b11 the legislative history also addressed the issue of parochial schools and noted that their inclusion was designed to implement the principle underlying the ruling of the supreme court in zobrest v catalina foothills school district that it was not an entanglement violation of the first amendment to provide sign language interpreter paid for with idea funds to deaf student at this parochial school12 department of education regulations the department of education issued final regulations implementing the idea amendments of 1997 on march 12 199913 these regulations were the result of long process which began on october 22 1997 with the publication of proposed rules14 over 6000 comments were received by the department of education regarding the proposed regulations and congress had included statement in the conference report to pl 105 277 indicating concern that the final regulations had not been promulgated and directing that the regulations be promulgated by december 1 1998 when finally released the regulations were long and complex with regard to private school placement the regulat ions reiterated the statutory provisions and stated that individual private school child with disability has right to receive some or all of the special education and related services the child would receive if enrolled in public school15 the department also stated that schools are not prohibited from providing services to private school children with disabilities that are in excess of those required16 the most controversial provision in the regulations relating to private schools is the departments interpretation that the statutory provision regarding services to private school children with disabilities means that the due process procedures of the law do nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98854crs4 17 34 cfr 300457 18 64 fr 12605 1999 19 34 cfr 300457b 20 48 fed reg 12602 march 12 1999 21 cefalu v east baton rouge parish school board 117 f3d 2315th cir 1997 22 one early case goodall v stafford county public school board 930 f2d 363 4th cir 1991 also held that even prior to the 1997 amendments idea did not require that the school provide deaf child with cued speech interpreter at private religious schoolapply to complaints that school has failed to meet the regulatory requirements regarding private schoo l placement by parents17 this prohibition would apparently include the provision of services on childs iep the rationale for this interpretation of the statute is that the statute does not include any individual right to services for private school children placed by their parents and that therefore the need for due process protections is precluded18 however the department of education did determine that child find activities were part of the basic fape obligation and that failure to properly evaluate private school student would be subject to due process19 the regulations do not contain any specific provision relating to whether home schooling is considered to be private school however since several commentators on the regulations asked the department about the issue in its comments on the regulations the department of education stated that state law determines whether home schools are considered to be private schools if the state recognizes home schools as private schools children with disabilities in those home schools must be treated in the same way as other private school children with disabilities if the state does not recognize home schools as private schools children with disabilities who are homeschooled are still covered by the child find obligat ionsand agencies must ensure that homeschooled children are located identified and evaluated and that fape is available if their parents choose to enroll them in public schools20 judicial decisions after pl 10517 prior to the 1997 amendments the courts had varied opinions about what school districts were required to provide for children with disabilities who had been unilaterally placed in private school by their parents number of judicial decisions were pending before the supreme court when the idea amendments of 1997 were enacted these cases were remanded for consideration in light of congressional action in addition in one case which had not yet reached the supr eme court the fifth circuit court of appeals withdrew an earlier opinion21 in general these decisions and others decided since pl 10517 have been more uniform in their interpretation of the law than was the case under the preceding statute the recent cases have found that state which receives idea funds is to allocate proportionate share of federal funds to children with disabilities unilaterally enrolled in private schools by their parents but is not required to provide services on the premises of the private school22 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98854crs5 23 117 f3d 231 5th cir 1997 24 125 f3d 1017 7th cir 1997 25 id at 1019 26

was unclear whether the proportionate amount to be allocated should be allocated for each individual student or whether it should be allocated collectively and remanded the first of these decisions after enactment of pl 10517 cefalu v east baton rouge parish school board23 involved hearing impaired student whose parents requested the services of sign language interpreter in his private school the fifth circuit withdrew its earlier opinion which had established three prong test to determine when school district had to pay for special education services in private schools and found that idea imposed requirement for an onsite interpreter as long as free appropriate public education had been offered to the student similarly in kr v anderson community school corporation 24 the court rejected claim for an onsite instructional aide for parochial school student with multiple disabilities the seventh circuit specifically stated that the amendments unambiguously show that participating states and localities have obligation to spend their money to ensure that disabled children who have chosen to enroll in private schools will receive publicly funded specialeducation services generally comparable to those provided to publicschool children25 in peter v minnesota26 the eighth circuit found right to services for child with disability placed in private religious school by his parents in kdm v reedsport school district27 the plaintiff child who was legally blind and had cerebral palsy argued that he should be provided services in parochial school the ninth circuit disagreed stating that every circuit that had considered the issue since the 1997 amendments had found that idea does not require services to be provided on site at private school there has been limited judicial discussion of the proportionality of funds issue although in russman28 the second circuit discussed the proportionality issue briefly the court in russman was presented with the issue of whether idea required the school district to provide mentally retarded studen t with consultant teacher and teachers aide on the premises of private school and found that the idea as amended does not require school district to provide onsite special education services to disabled child voluntarily enrolled in private school29 more specifically the court found that although state receiving idea funds must allocate proportionate share of federal money to disabled students voluntarily enrolled in private schools whatever services school district is obligated to provide did not have to be provided on the premises of the private school30
