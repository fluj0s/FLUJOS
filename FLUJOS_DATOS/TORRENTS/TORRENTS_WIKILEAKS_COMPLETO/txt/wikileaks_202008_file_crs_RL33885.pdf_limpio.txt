indications exist that the rth korean democra tic peoples republic of korea or dprk regime has been i nvolved in the production and trafficking of illicit drugs as well as of counterfeit currency cigarettes and pharmaceuticals it appears that drug trafficking has declin ed and counterfeiting of cigarettes may be expanding reports indicate that north korea may engage in insurance fraud human trafficking and wildlife trafficking as matter of state policy dprk crimefor profit activities have reportedly brought in important foreign currency resources and come under the direction of special offi ce under the direction of the ruling korean workers party with the caveat that dollar value estimates of clandestine activities are highly speculative conservative timates suggest north kor ean criminal activity has generated as much as 500 million in prof its per year about third of dprks annual exports but has decreased in recent ears core issue is whether the income from the dprks reportedly widespread criminal activity is used to finance the development of weapons of mass destruction or other ke military programs thereby contributing to the dprks reluctance to curb its aggregate level of such activity some also speculate that the dprks criminal smuggling networks could help facilitate the illicit move ment of nuclear or other materi als in and out of the country policy analysts in the past have suggested that north korean crimeforprofit activity has been carefully controlled and limited to fill specific foreign exchange shortfalls however some concern exists that north korean crimeforprofit activity could become runaway train that once tablished could escape control if the dprks crimeforprofit activity has become entrenched or possibly decentralized some analysts question whether the curre nt pyongyang regime or any subsequent government would have the ability to eff ectively restrain such activity should it so desire moreover some suggest that pr oposals to shift dprk crimerelated income toward legitimatesource income ignore the fact that the current regime diverts some illicit earnings to slush funds designed to stain the loyalty of core of party elite and to underwrite weapons development programs challenge facing us policy makers is how to balance pursuing antidrug counterfeiting nd crime policies visàvis north korea against effectively pursuing several other high prior ity foreign policy objectives including 1 nuclear nonproliferation negotiations via th sixparty talks 2 limiting ba llistic missile production and export

democ ratic peoples repub lic of korea or dprk drug production drug trafficking and other crimeforp rofit activities have been an issue of concern for congress the administration the media and the diplomatic community2 the issue is twofold first is general us interest in halting criminal behavior upholding the rule of law and protecting us citizens and assets from illicit activity second is how to deal with government suspected of countenancing or sponsoring activity that ma threaten us diplomatic and security interests challenge facing policy makers is how to balance pursuing antidrug counterfeiting nd crime policies visàvis north korea against effectively pursuing other highpriority us foreign policy objectives including 1 limiting possession and production of weapons of mass struction 2 limiting ballistic missile production and export 3 curbing terrorism and 4 addressing humanitarian needs core issue is whether the income from the dprks reportedly widespread criminal activity has financed the acquisition of weapons of mass struction and has strengthened the dprks ability to maintain until recently truculent compromise positions on the issue of its nuclear weapons program some also speculate that the dprks criminal smuggling networks could help facilitate the illicit movement of nucl ear materials in and out of the country3 resolution 1718 2006 provides for economic sanctions against persons or entities engaged in or providing support for including through illicit means dprks nuclea rrelated other weapons of mass dest ructionrelated nd ballistic missilere lated programs4 counterfeiting copyright and trademar k violations and other illicit activity occur in virtually all countries of the wo rld but in the north korean case numerous sources indicate that the state apparen tly had and may continue to be sponsoring some of these activ ities in this view if the dprk is to join the larger international community of nations it would be expected to cease statesponsorshiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33885crs2 5 note that in addition to citing the likelihood of past dprk state involvement in illicit drug production and trafficking the us partment of state in its march 2006 international narcotics control strategy report incsr stated that indictments in the united states issued in 2005 and the ongoing work of several corporate investigative teams employed by the holders of major united states and foreign cigarette and pharmaceutical trademarks have provided compelling evidence of dprk involvement in trademark violations

supraof such activities and to take appropriate measures against private parties engaged in such production andor distribution as the sixparty talks on north koreas nuclear program have proceeded in 2008 it appears that the us goal of denuclearization has outweighed concerns related to dprk illicit activity with th exception of proliferation of nuclear weapons technology and materials such illicit activity by north korea however could resurface as the sixparty process proceeds and attention turns toward normalizing diplomatic ties with the dprk by the united states japan and south korea and allowing north korea to join international financial institutions such as the asian development bank internati onal monetary fund and the world bank the role of congress in this issue includes overseeing us policy eliciting information and raising public awareness of the issue and balancing us interests when foreign policy goals may conflict with anticrime activities congress also

the budget and international security senate government affairs committee may 20 2003one basis for the 500 million to 1 billion figure for illicit exports is that it can be inferred from international trade data and from reported anecdotes that markets in pyongyang have ample supplies of im ported foreign goods in 2004 north korea is estimated to have incurred trade defic it of 18 billion this deficit rose to about 20 billion in 2005 dropped to an estima ted 13 billion in 2006 and rose to an estimated 27 b illion in 200713 some of this imbalance is financed through food and other aid capital inflows borrowing remittances from north korean laborers working abroad especially in russia and th middle east and tourism pyongyang however does little borrowing on international markets and tokyo has been cracking down on remittances from ethnic north koreans in japan inflows of capital also seem small although they are rising as china and south korea invest in enterprises in the north as result some surmise that in some years as much as 1 billion has been financed by illicit activity14 illicit drug production and trafficking allegations of state involvement there has been evidence to suggest that the north korean government is supporting drug production and trafficking as matter of state policy since 1976 north korea has been linked to more than 50 verifiable incidents involving drug seizures in at least 20 countries15 significant number of these cases has involved arrest or detention of north korean diplom ats or officials concerns about north korean drug trafficking and production were further expressed in the international narcotics control boards 1997 annual report which refe rred to such dprk drug trafficking incident claims as disquietin g in 1999

come to light the state departments march 1 2008 international narcotics control strategy report states that drug trafficking with connection to north korea appears to be down sharply and there have been instances of drug trafficking suggestive of statedirected trafficking for five years17 many analysts suggest that any decline in dprk statelinked drug trafficking activity would likely be in response to enha nced international ttention paid to such activity in the wake of the april 2003 seiz ure of heroin carried on the north korean vessel the pong others however re main skeptical and offer an alternative explanation they suggest that the decline in seizures is because north korean source methamphetamine is now regularly being mistakenly identified as chinese source given growing links of chinese criminal elements to north koreas drug productiontrafficking activities in line w ith such conclusion are press reports in late 2006 of the arrests in china in diffe ring locations of north korean nationals involved with chinese criminals in the tr afficking of methamphetamine however it is not clear from the reports whether the dr ugs were of dprk origin or whether the north koreans arrested had links with dprk officials18 reported scope of illicit drug activity north korea has reportedly produced three main types of illicit drugs 1 opiates including opium and heroin 2 synthetic drugs especially methamphetamine and 3 counterfeit pharmaceutical drugs in 2008 the amount of illegal drug production and trafficking is unlikely to be rge enough for north korea to be cited

diplomats may have been for pers onal use the sheer size of confiscated shipments as much as several hundred kilograms each suggests that endangered species trafficking could have been planned by north korean government entity58 human trafficking according to the state department rth korea is source country for men women and children trafficked for forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation and has been listed by the us government as tier 3 country for as long as it has been included in the state departments trafficking in persons annual reports as tier 3 country north korea reportedly does not comply with minimum standards for eliminating trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so it remains unclear to what extent dprk profits from human trafficking activities as source of revenue however the state department indicates that north korea directly contributes to labor traffick ing by maintaining system of force labor prison camps inside the country where an estimated 150000 to 200000 prisoners are forced to log mine and tend crops59 according to mark lagon director of the us office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons the most common

related to the regimes illicit financial channels one strategy on the diplomatic front has b een to use fora such as the sixparty talks on nuclear proliferation to address issues such as north koreas illicit activities this was the initial preference of the bush administration but since sometime after the bda action in 2007 this tac tic longer appears evident as the bush administration comes to close denuclearization is the primary emphasis of policy on north korea also if the dprk is able to earn foreign exchange and receive more economic assistan ce the pressure to genera foreign currency through illicit activities arguably will diminish the policy debate heretofore has been divided between those who argue to pressure north korea with unilateral tactics that cut dprk off from access to its illicitly generated profits through economic sanctions61 and second group of policymakers more in favor of engagement who seek to resolve the north korean problem mainly by negotiations its goal is to change dprks bad behavior by bringing the country into the circle of peaceful nations and inducing it to act in accord with international standards62 in 2008 the latter argument seems to be carrying the day following recent developments in the sixparty talks continued policy challenge for the united states is to r eceive commitment by pyongyang to curtail its alleged crimeforprofit activities possible vehicle for this discussion could be the working team on the normalization of diplomatic relations between the dprk and the united states since japan south korea and china also

other illicit activities the major purposes of the initiative have been to provide policy support for the sixparty talks and to hold north korea to internationally accepted standards of behavior by enforcing relevant us and other laws the iai has come to involve fourteen different u s government depar tments and agencies and it has received c ooperation from fifteen different governments and international organizations64 the banco delta macau action stemmed partly from the work of the iai the united states and other nations also are taking direct measures to halt shipments of illicit cargo from north korea the proliferation security initiative psi for example is aimed at stopping shipments of weapons of mass destruction their delivery systems and related materials by tracking and searching suspected ships or other conveyances transporting such cargo65 fourteen nations have signed on to the psi and many more have endorsed the principles66 although not directed at illicit activities per the prospect of ships being inspected complicates north korean efforts to smuggle items such as illegal drugs fake pharmaceuticals and counterfeit currency67 weakness of the psi however is that the dprks immediate neighbors china and south korea have not joined the effort though there is some speculation that seoul ma join under new president lee myungbak in addition north korean ships or airp lanes have been halte d by psi operation the role of congress in this issue includes oversight of us policy eliciting information and raising public awareness of the issue and in

include for example granting the dprk normal trading nation status most favored nation status with re spect to us import duties68 or by allowing goods from north and south koreas kaesong industria l complex to be included in the proposed koreaus free trade agreement69 for those assuming that the pyongyang regime wants to curb its crimeforprofit activity an important question yet unresolve d is the degree to which the leadership will be able to do so analysts point out that in nations or regions where the crime has become institutionalized income from such activity often becomes addictive to those involved in the criminal conduct in such instances class of criminal entrepreneurs is created and in the case of north korea analysts point to the systematic criminalization of the state over years and its growing intimate relationships with organized cr ime elements throughout asia70 that is not to say that north korean criminals like other criminals would not be able to switch emphasis from risky criminal activity such as narcotics trafficking to less risky and potentially even more lucrative larges cale manufacture and trade in counterfeit cigarettes and pharmaceuticals trend that may well be underway indeed state countenanced if not state sponsored production of seemingl genuine japanese and us cigarettes appears to be flour ishing as may large scale production of expertly packaged pharmaceuticals such as viagra whereas the capacity to produce opium is dependent on the availability of suitable land and clima tic conditions methamphetamine production and wide range of counterfeiting activities are not limited by agricultural production constraints reports of substantial dprk imports of ephedrine an essential precursor for methamphetamine production support the

international community to entice andor pressure pyongyang into reducing its involvement in crime for profit activity71 others however argue that the more legitimate the source of income the greater the pressure for accountability on the regime since revenue from illicit activities does not usually enter official reco rds hence they maintain that proposals to shift dprk crimerelated income toward legitimatesource income ignore the fact that the current regime diverts some illicit earnings to slush funds designed to sustain the loyalty of core of party elite nd to underwrite weapons velopment programs they suggest therefore that prospects for decrease in crimeforprofit activity are not good and that the current regime is likely to be neither willing nor able to change its dependence on income where accountability is involved still it appears that pyongyang is reducing much of its illicit activity as it finds other means to export and earn foreign exchange
