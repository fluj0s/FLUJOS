there have been two primary sources of immediate funding the federal reserve fed and the us treasury1 under its founding statute the fed has the authority to loan money in unusual and exigent circumstances to any individual partnership or corporation provided five members of the bo ard of governors of the federal reserve system agree 2 this authority has been cited in three of the interventions in 2008 namely bear stearns aig and citigroup the source of money loaned under this section derives from the feds general control of the money supply which is essentially unlimited subject to the statutory mandates of maintaining stable inflation and promoting economic growth3 because the profits of the fed are overwhelmingly remitted to the treasury the indirect source of the funds is the treasury in the case of fannie mae and freddie mac the direct source of funding is the treasury pursuant to the statutory authority granted in the housing and economic recovery act of 20084 in the case of 1 the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic will abso rb up to 5 billion in losses from the guarantee of citigroup assets 2 12 usc sec 343 3 for more information on the

treasury pursuant to the statutory authority granted in the emergency economic stabilization act of 20085 treasury finances these activities by issuing bonds and increasing the federal debt

those currently in progress is not straightforward assistance often comes in forms other than direct monies from the treasury including loan guarantees lines of credit or preferred stock purchases such assistance may have little or upfront cost to the government although loan guarantees in legislation are scored by the congressional budget office cbo as an up fr ont budgetary cost this score reflects the fact that loan guarantee which can be thought of as sort of insurance has value even if it is never used many insurance policies are never used but individuals and companies purchase them to reduce the risk of loss in many past cases the value to various companies of federal guarantees was to enable them to access the private credit markets issuing bonds or obtaining bank loans that they would not otherwise have been able to obtain in other past cases the federal guarantee resulted in lower interest rate on the bonds or loans depending on the conditions attached to each specific intervention and how events proceed thereafter the government may see net inflow of funds from the actions taken rather than net outflow even with net inflow of funds however intervention may have cost if this inflow is less than the benefit that could have been derived from expending the funds for another purpose the summaries below address the maximum amounts promised in federal assistance and attempt to quantify the amounts that have actually been disbursed there are also other more diffuse costs that could be weighed for example many would argue that the cost to the taxpayers of any intervention should be weighed against the potential costs of financial system instability resulting from inaction or that one intervention may lead to more private sector risktaking and thus necessitate additional future interventions moral hazard such costs however are even harder to quantify than the realized cost of the interventions this report acknowledges but does not attempt to address them g20g142g140g142g151g157g561g8g146g151g138g151g140g146g138g149g561g11g151g157g142g155g159g142g151g157g146g152g151g156g561

failure of troubled financial firms market conditions seemed to get worse instead of better after the initial aig intervention treasury argued that more comprehensive solution was needed to restore financial calm it proposed creating troubled assets relief program to purchase up to 700 billion of troubled assets from financial firms as way to restore investors confidence in the health of the financial sector it was argued that financial firms would be unable to replenish their capital by selling equity to private investors unless certain assets were transferred to the government once

recouping some or perhaps all if asset prices rose above their purchase price of the costs on october 3 2008 the emergency economic stabi lization act eesa division of pl 110 343 was signed into law creating tarp in addition to an asset purchase program pl 110343 included an insurance program providing federal guarantees for troubled assets in return for premiums paid by companies it also allowed the government to take an equity stake in companies participating in the asset purchase program pl 110343 provided broad discretion to the treasury to design the parameters of the program making it difficult to evaluate the ultimate costs of the program at this time under the credit reform act and pl 110343 cbo has projected that the total net cost to the government of the 700 billion outlaid under tarp will be approximately 185 billion in net present value terms 7 cbo makes this estimate by comparing the price paid by the government to acquire assets under tarp to the present discounted value of future income accruing to the government from the assets plus future proceeds from the sale of the assets using discount rate that has been adjusted for the risks inhere nt in holding the assets being purchased g22g3g20g18g561g5g138g153g146g157g138g149g561g18g158g155g140g145g138g156g142g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561 on october 14 2008 treasury announced its ongoing fo cus would be

time for term of 10 years renewable by the fed13 in addition jpmorgan chase extended 115 billion loan to the llc that will have an interest rate equal to 45 percentage points above the discount rate thus in order for the principal and interest to be paid off the assets will need to appreciate enough or generate enough income so that the rate of return on the assets exceeds the weighted interest rate on the loans plus the operating costs of the llc the interest on the loan will be repaid out of the asset sales not by jpmorgan chase any difference between the proceeds and the amount of the loans will produce profit or loss for the fed not jpmorgan chase because jpmorgan chases 115 billion loan was subordinate to the feds 288 billion loan if there are losses on the 2995 billion assets the first 115 billion of losses will be borne in effect by jpmorgan chase if the assets appreciate in value by more than operating expenses the fed will make profit on the loan if the assets decline in value by less than 115 billion the fed will not suffer any direct loss on the loan any losses beyond 115 billion will be borne by the fed by the end of 2008 these assets had suffered approximately 3 billion in losses 14 t able 1 summar of curr ent and historical financial inter v entions b the f ederal go v ernment beneficiary action financial commitment final cost to treasury us bankstar p
