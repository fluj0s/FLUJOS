substances whose production sale and use are restricted by domestic law and intern ational drug control agreements the most common illegal drugs include cannabis cocaine opiates and synthetic drugs international trade in these drugs represents lucrative and what at times seems to be an intractable criminal enterprise affecting countries worldwide and generating between 100 billion and 1 trillion in illicit profits per year revenue from the illegal drug industry provides interna tional drug trafficking organizations with the resources to ev ade and compete with law enforcement officials

used for eradication eradication is longstanding us polic regarding international drug control the state department considers crop control the most costeffective means of cutting supply because drugs cannot enter th illegal trade if the crops were never planted destroyed or left unharvested30 without drug cultivation the state departments rationale continues there would be need for costly enforcement and interdiction operati ons proponents of eradication further argue that it is easier to locate and destroy crops in the field th an to locate subsequently processed drugs on smuggling routes or on the streets of u s cities put differently kilogram of powder cocaine is far more difficult to tect than the 300 to 500 kilograms of coca leaf that are required to make that same kilogram also because crops constitute the cheapest link in the narcotics chain pr oducers may devote fewer economic resources to prevent their detection than to conceal more expensive and refined forms of the drug product opponents of expanded supply reducti on policy generally question whether reduction of the foreign suppl of narcotic drugs is ach ievable and whether it would have meaningful impact on levels of illicit drug use in the united states manual eradication requires significant time nd human resources reportedly involving upward of 20 workhours of effort to pull up and destroy one hectare

argue that suspected criminals are more likely to receive fair trial in us courts than in countries where the cal judicial process may be corrupt and where suspects can use bribes and intimidation to manipulate the outcome of trial some anecdotal evidence appears to suggest that the threat of extradition has affected the behavior of foreign drug tr afficking organizations for example some colombian drug traffickers are reportedl distancing themselves from overt drug distribution activities which could be used as evidence to trigger extradition nevertheless this counterdr ug tool

directly targeting drug trafficking organizations and related traffickers for fy2007 hard side counternarcotic s activities constituted roughly 33 of the total domestic and in ternational us counterdrug budget 32 billion for interdiction 468 million for eradication and 946 million for other international hardside activities72 policy makers justify the continued emphasis on hardside activities because they directly di srupt the flow of foreign drugs these tasks are also conceded to require dispr oportionately more funding to implement than softside activities the cost of helicopter to combat drug traffickers for example is substantially more than the cost of providing seeds and agricultural training for alternative crop development projects furt her some argue that the us emphasis on hardside counternarcotics activities is necessary to carry the burden of other international partic ipants in counterdrug effort s and foreign aid donors who reportedly tend to shy away from hardside projects73 among those who agree that hardsid activities are vital component of international counternarcotic s strategy some support ex panding us eradication efforts and recommend

expanded eradication activities especially those involving aerial spra ying of herbicides remain source of controversy proponents argue that swift widespread eradication is necessary to establish credible deterrent against cultivating illicit opium poppy crops critics however argue that eradication may have public health and environmental safety implications may encourage local villagers to align with antigovernment insurgents and in the absence of alternative livelihood options may deepen peasant impoverishment afghan president mid karzai has expressed categorical oppos ition to the use of aerial eradication and us officials state that the administration will defer to the government of afghanistan regarding its future use74 some analysts also suggest that the us military should assume greater role in counternarcotics activ ities since the 1980s the us militarys role in counternarcotics efforts s gradually become more focused on training and equipping foreign counternarc otics officials outside the united states us military personnel have been involved in training and transporting fo reign antinarcotics personnel since 1983 periodically there ve also been calls for multilateral military strikes against trafficking operations as well as increased use of us military forces in preemptive strikes against drug fields and trafficker enclaves overseas dods role in counternarcotics activity first became institutionalized in 1986 when president ronald reagan issued national security decision directive 221 nsdd221 which directed us military forces to support counternarcotics efforts more actively75 dods role further expande d under president george h bush in 1989 who issued national secur ity directive18 nsd 18 to explicitly direct the secretary of

also conducting counterna rcotics activities despite the militarys ability to support drug law enforcement organizations questions remain as to the overall effectiveness of major military role in narcotics interdiction proponents of s ubstantially increasing the militarys role in supporting civilian law enforcement narcotics interdiction activity argue that narcotics trafficking poses national

repercussions overseas more over some personnel in the military remain concerned about an expanded role seeing themselves as possible scapegoats for policies that have failed or might fail emphasize softside of counternarcotics policy those promoting expansion of efforts to reduce producti on at the source face the challenge of instituting programs that effectively reduce production of narcotic crops and production of refined narc otics without creating unmanageable economic and political crises for target countries ma jor area of concern of such policy makers is to achieve an effective balance between the carrot and the stick approaches in us relations with major illicit narcotics producing and transit countries as result some analysts have suggested increasingly linking hardside activities with softside activities such as altern ative livelihood development economic development and institutional reform efforts proponents of softside activities argue that longterm success in halting drug production involves motivating producers to refrain from growing illicit crops many observe that because short term economic stability of na tions supplying illegal drugs may depend on the production and sale of illicit substances it is unrealistic to expect such nations to limit their dr ugrelated activities meaningfu lly without an alternative source of income it has been suggested by some analysts that massive foreign aid effort socalled min imarshall plan is the only feasible method of persuading developing nations to curb their production of illicit drugs77 such plan would involve multilateral effort including participation of the united states and other industrialized donor nations susceptible to the drug problem the thrust of such plan would be to promote economic development replacing illicit cash crops with other marketable alternatives critics have concerns regarding positive incentive concepts they warn of the openended cost of agricu ltural development progra ms economic development projects and institutional capacity building efforts programs would likely be coupled with rigid domestic law enfo rcement and penaltie s for noncompliance which could require us commitment of further foreign assistance that aids country to strengthen its institutional capacity to implement the rule of law sometimes marketable alternatives are more difficult to develop than simply substitu ting illicit crops with licit crops drug crop zones are often located in geographically remote areas with marginal soil quality and extreme insecurity that tend to limit prospects for legal commercial agriculture in some parts of colombia for example observers claim that the most promising strategy to stem drug crop production is to improve ducational

allocated for demand reduction activities including treatment and prevention while 65 was allocated for domestic and international supplyside reduction activities78 in fy2002 roughly 46 of the total drug control budget was for demand reduction activitie s and 54 was for suppl yside activities some observers point to this gradual shift in resources toward supplyside activities to claim that us counternarc otics policy focuses primar ily on combating the supply of illegal drugs to the detriment of focusing on domestic drug demand reduction such arguments are especially voiced by observers in drug producing countries and drug transit countries who view us c onsumption of illegal drugs as the source of the problem79 supporters of stronger drug mand reduction programs also argue that it could be more cost effective to combat illegal drug use and trafficking domestically than in drug source and trans it countries in the developing world where resources and government capacity to combat drugs may be limited80 as result such critics urge the administration to re balance the drug control budget to include more funding for drug demand reducti on and less for drug supply reduction81 the administration however posits that issues related to the balance between counternarcotics resources for drug demand reduction and supply reduction have already been adequately addressed according to ondcps 2008 national drug control strategy for example two of the three drug policy goals are demand reductionoriented to prevent domestic drug use before it begins and to rehabilitate current domestic drug users at the same time others argue that further emphasis on supplyside drug control ac tivities is warranted as tran snational drug trafficking organizations

modified legalization schemes that involve various amounts of government regulation these proposals for example recommend legalizing some but not all types of currently banned drugs restricting the sale of drugs to minors similar to those currently placed on tobacco products and alcohol in many countries or restricting the locations nd types of vendors that woul d be allowed to sell drugs proponents of drug galization suggest that removi ng current sanctions against the drug trade could improve the political and social stability of producer countries the economist argues that legalizing drugs coul d undercut powerful drug traffickers who threaten state stability and corrupt political institutions as it reportedly has in mexico and colombia and could eliminate us of the illicit drug trade as source of revenue for certain reg imes including north korea82 in addition some argue that legalizing drugs would allow the united states and others to reduce the amount of resources devoted to elimin ating th illic it drug s upply through eradication interdiction and other w enforcement efforts83 legalizing the trade in substances currently proscribed by the international drug control regime would involve removing them from the lists of controlled substances one such effort is currently led by the bolivian government with regard to coca leaf which is listed as controlle d narcotic drug by the united nations along with heroin cocaine marijuana and others that are considered to be liable to abuse and productive of ill effects84 proponents of this move argue that coca leaf has been an integral part of bolivian cultu re especially for many of the countrys indigenous people for generations and the option of exporting coca leaf internationally could provide new licit source of income to bolivian peasants the leaves are often chewed or consumed in teas and reportedly serve as mild stimulant an appetite suppressant and an herbal remedy to altitude sickness among other uses85 international debate continues to surround the justifications for including coca leaf as narcotic drug86 proponents argue that consumption of coca leaf is not addictive or harmful to public health they also claim that the original decision to list coca leaf may have been politically motivated and the consequence of ethnic

would quality and safety standards be monitored and enforced whether production and sale of drugs would be taxed and what types of penalties would follow in cases of regulatory violations 93 see for example statements by rep da n burton rin and janice schakowsky dil continuedothers including the administration argu that coca leaf should remain on the list of banned substances87 as early as 1952 the world health organization who expert committee on drug dependence concluded that coca chewing must be defined and treated as an addiction in spite of the occasional absence of some of those characteristics88 in 1993 the who expert co mmittee revisited coca leaf and reported that it should remain internationally controlled because cocaine is readily extractable from coca leaf89 in 2006

abolish and prohibit coca leaf chewing and the manufacture of coca tea mate coca and other products containing coca alkaloids for domestic use and export90 successive us administrations have remained steadfast against such legalization policy proposals according to the dea legalization could lead to several negative consequences that may outweigh many of the positive effects91 these include the possibility that legaliza tion could increase the demand abuse and addiction stemming from an increased ava ilability and access to potentially harmful drugs further legalization may reduce the perception of the social and health risks and costs associated with drug abuse ot hers have also raised concerns about the potentially complex array of regulatory questions and legislative challenges that may arise from decision to legalize drugs92 such concerns may be especially relevant to lessdeveloped countries with limited institutional cap abilities which would likely face significant

or necessary proponents of decriminalization argue th at it is novel policy solution that should be considered as an alternative to what many consider strictly prohibitionist policies some proponents also argue that decriminalization of smallscale and less severe drug trafficking or drug use cases is logical costbenefit decision that can help countries with limited resources to concentrate on combating higherlevel offenders and traffickers critics remain concerned that decriminalization could provide welcome loopholes fo r traffickers who could void penalties for possession and distribution of illegal drugs if caught countries that have experimented with decriminalization policies however reveal mixed results96 further the wide variance in criminalization po licies across

makers to shift drug policy efforts toward focus on public health and harm reduction and less of focus on law enforcement such efforts focus on reducing the public health consequences of drug use and include needle exchange programs and governmentsponsored injec tion rooms drug injection rooms or maintenance clinics have existed in several countries including canada switzerland germany and australia they have provided certain addicts with drugs or clean needles on regular basis some of the same countries also provide free testing of drugs for purity and potentially deadly contaminants major impetus for such policy appr oach began with concerns about the spread of hivaids among intravenous drug users in the 1980s which raised attention to the health issues related to drug use according to advocates of this approach complete eradication of drug s from society is unrealistic and better approach would be to focus on cont aining the damage caused by drugs nevertheless governmentsupe rvised drug use programs exist in contravention to international drug control agreements which obligates parties to ensure that drug use and trade are limited to scientific and medical purposes only the incb regularly urges those countries that mainta in drug injection f acilities to discontinue their operation98 others remain concerned that these facilities could encourage increased levels of drug use and potentially make drug use more socially acceptable some studies on the effects of drug injection facilities however offer some tentative but promising indications of

jurisdiction dates back to the iccs origins though drug trafficking is not included in the iccs current jurisdiction traffick ing was included in the original draft statute103 the senate in the 100th congress expressed support of the possibility of establishing an international criminal court to expedite cases regarding the prosecution of persons accused of having engaged in international drug trafficking104 since then various members of congress have sponsored failed efforts to both support and criticize the icc105 critics of the inclusion of drug trafficking as part of the iccs jurisdiction argue that the current system of bilateral and multilateral agreements is adequate for prosecuting international drug trafficking cases and that it would be inappropriate for the icc to take jurisdiction because drug trafficking is not universally considered serious crime of in ternational concern further critics argue that the potentially large number of transnational drug

organizations to move their illicit products across borders these analysts claim at the very least that the vast vol umes of imports daily flowing in and out of sea air and land entry facilities

general that increased imports from nafta member countries are not resulting in increased illegal drugs and other controlled substances121 in december 2007 the bill was referred to the house ways and means committee by contrast the 1991 andean tr ade preference act atpa and its replacement the 2002 andean trade pr eference and drug eradication act atpdea122 as amended have offered trade benefits to help drug producing countries in the andes region combat drug production and traffi cking by developing and strengthening gitimate industries123 the atpdea which remains in effect but is set to expire on december 31 2008 exempts some 6300 ndean products from us import tariffs according to the 2007 report to congress on the operation of atpdea the office of the us trade representative found that atpdea continues to have positive albeit small and indirect effect on drugcrop eradication and crop substitution as well as job growth in exportoriented industries in the andean region124 the war on terror many observers including some us officials acknowledge that what the bush adminis tration terms the global war on terror in the wake of the september 11 2001 terrori st attacks has supplanted the socalled war on drugs as top us foreign policy priority for example the dea fy2008 congressional budget submission stated that following the september 11 2001 attacks doj and other federal agencies redirected resources from fighting drugs to combating terrorism and improving national security as result additional resources are required for drug enforcement operations including intelligence and other investigative support to maintain the momentum of the federal governments drug enforcement efforts125 others argue that overall counterdrug resources have expanded since 2001 and that congress has been especially active in providing new authorities to fight combined war against drugs and terror among these new authorities include 1 dods global authority to provide counter terrorism support to law enforcement personnel who are also conductin g counternarcotics activities126 2 deas authority to pursue drug traffickers who are also terrorists or are providing funding

transactions invol ving foreign jurisdictions to combat money laundering128 some however find that efforts against the illicit drug trade and counterterrorism are at times in conflict this has especially been raised as concern in afghanistan where insurg ent groups nd drug trafficking groups often overlap some observers explain that us and llied counterinsurgency actors are placed in dilemma when their informants also happen to be known drug traffickers or actively involved in the drug trade us pursuit of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency objectives at the expense of counternarcotics goals some say may inherently exacerbate illicit drug trade substate conflicts efforts to reduce producti on of illicit narcotics at the source are sometimes met by active and violent opposition from combination of trafficker political and economic groups in some nations such as colombia traffickers have achieved status comparable to state within state in others allegations of drugrelated corruption have focused on hi ghlevel officials in the military and federal police as well as heads of state in addition some traffickers have aligned themselves w ith terrorist and insurgent groups and have reportedly funded political candidates and parties pronarcotic peas ant workers and trade union groups and high visibility popular public works projects to cultivate public support through robin hood image as resu lt some say that standard narcotics policies are likely to underperform in pl aces with weak governance and conflict129 in the case of colombia some critics have argued that counternarcotics efforts especially aerial eradication campaigns can have the unintended effect of aggravating the countrys ongoing civil conflict because colombias guerrilla groups pose as advocates of growers spra ying may broaden support for such groups thereby contradicting the objectives of th governments counterinsurgency efforts in the affected zones these observers believe that colombias enforcement priorities should shift to ta rgeting critical nodes in tran sportation and refining and to the extent possible sealing off traffi c routes to and from the main coca producing zones the argument is made that interdiction can disrupt internal markets for coca derivatives and that compared to erad ication it imposes fewer direct costs on peasant producers and generates less political unrest poverty alleviation according to the administrations 2006 national security strategy nss helping the worlds poor is strategic and

security thr eats and since 2002 the bush administration has committed the united states to the goal of doubling the size of the worlds poorest economies within decade131 some analysts however argue that current international drug cont rol reduction campaigns may be at odds with the administrations antipoverty commitments for some countries production of illicit narcotics and the narcotics tr ade have become an economic way of life that provides subsistence level of income to large numbers of people from whom those who rule draw their legitimacy crop reduction campaig ns seek to displace such income and those workers engaged in its production in this regard these campaigns may threaten real economic and political dangers for the governments of nations with marginal economic growth consequently some analysts argue that crop reduction programs in lowincome countries could lead to greater poverty especially if substitute incomes are not readily available to those whose income depends on drug production
