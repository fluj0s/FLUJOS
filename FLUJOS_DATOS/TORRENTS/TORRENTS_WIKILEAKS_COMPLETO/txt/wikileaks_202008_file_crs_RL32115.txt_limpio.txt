congressional research service the library of congress missile proliferation and the strategic balance in south asia summary this report analyzes the policy implications of missile proliferation in south asia providing information on indias and pakistans missile programs and their role in regional security the report also provides background on the indiapakistan conflict and the us role and reviews the regions strategic security dynamics the report concludes with review of key issues and options for us policy the united states has long been concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems in south asia this concern became acute after may 1998 when both india and pakistan tested nuclear explosive devices since that time both countries have continued testing nuclearcapable ballistic missiles and both have established command and control authorities to oversee their nuclear arsenals india and pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 and have significant unsettled territorial disputes although the status of weaponization is unclear slowspeed arms race appears to be underway on the asian subcontinent and the proliferation of missile capabilities in south asia has been identified as potentially major threat to regional stability and to key us foreign policy goals persistent aspect of us engagement in the region has been the difficulty of maintaining balanced approach toward two antagonistic countries while simultaneously promoting perceived us interests during the 1990s us security policy toward south asia focused on preventing weapons proliferation but the bush administration shifted to more pragmatic approach emphasizing restraint in this area for perhaps the first period in history the united states currently enjoys simultaneously positive relations with both countries while relationships between the united states india and pakistan have taken on positive hue potential for regional instability persists the strategic capabilities of india and pakistan could provide ready catalyst for transforming disputes or terrorist incidents into potentially cataclysmic confrontations both countries also are pursuing the development or acquisition of missile defense systems it is unknown at this early stage if missile defenses will offer degree of stability to the region or if they will create an imbalance thus prompting the other country to build more missiles to compensate for the disparity key issues for congress addressed in this report are the extent to which missile proliferation in south asia enhances or upsets regional stability and the role of us policy in promoting such stability as well as in tension reduction and nonproliferation levels of us foreign assistance to india and pakistan the establishment of aid restrictions the transfer of conventional weapons platforms possibly including missile defense systems the setting of export control parameters and nonproliferation goals and the maintenance of policy and intelligence oversight of us relations with india and pakistan constitute additional issues of concern to congress this report will be updated as warranted by events contents

in south asia providing information on indias and pakistans missile programs and their role in regional security the report provides background on the indiapakistan conflict and the us role and reviews the regions security dynamics and strategic force capabilities including each countrys ballistic missile capability to deliver weapons of mass destruction wmd the report concludes with review of key issues and options for us policy1 us and congressional interest us security interests in south asia concentrate on weapons proliferation strategies to reduce tensions antiterrorism and regional stability this report emphasizes the role of missiles in south asian security because of their potential use as delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons as such the proliferation of missiles in the region is considered to be central variable in calculations gauging regional stability during the 1990s the us security focus in south asia sought to minimize damage to the nonproliferation regime prevent escalation of nuclear arms and missile race and promote indopakistani bilateral dialogue especially on the sovereignty dispute over kashmir in light of these goals the clinton administration established five benchmarks for india and pakistan based on the contents of security council res 1172 which condemned the two countries nuclear tests of may 1998 these were signing and ratifying the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ctbt2 halting all further production of fissile material and participating in fissile material cutoff treaty fmct negotiations limiting development and deployment

technologies and establishing bilateral dialogue between new delhi and islamabad progress in each of these areas has been limited and the bush administration makes reference to the benchmark framework3 neither india nor pakistan has signed the ctbt and both appear to be continuing their production of weapons grade fissile materials4 the status of weaponization and deployment is unclear though there are indications that this is occurring at slow but more or less steady pace5 earlier optimism in the area of export controls waned as fears have gained credence that these countries especially pakistan might seek to export wmd materials andor technologies6 finally while there has been repeat of the intense 1999 military clashes in kashmir and tenmonthlong military standoff in 2002 ended without largescale fighting bilateral tensions remain significant and substantive dialogue between new delhi and islamabad is underway upon taking office the bush administration set out substantively to build upon an initial improvement in us relations with new delhi begun by president clinton while also shifting us nonproliferation policy from seeking to prevent south asian nuclearization to encouraging india and pakistan to be more responsible nuclear 3 many analysts believe that the bush administration is less interested than previous administrations in normativelegal efforts at nonproliferation and is more concerned with pursing active counterproliferation ejaz haider nonproliferation iran and pakistan friday times lahore september 19 2003 4 india has consistently rejected both the ctbt and the nuclear nonproliferation treaty as discriminatory calling instead for global nuclear disarmament regime while both india and pakistan maintain selfimposed moratoria on nuclear testing they refuse to sign the ctbta position arguably made more tenable by us senates rejection of the treaty in 1999 5 central intelligence agency unclassified report to congress on the

pakistans possible transfers of uranium enrichment materials and technologies to north korea during the 1990s and perhaps as recently as july 2002 have sparked new concerns in us policymaking circles see crs report rl31900 weapons of mass destruction trade between north korea and pakistan by sharon squassoni in addition to possible proliferation activities involving north korea some reports indicate that irans nuclear program has benefitted from pakistani assistance moreover there exist fears about the physical safety and security of pakistans nuclear weapons themselves along with concerns that pakistani nuclear scientists have been in contact with islamic militant groups possibly including qaeda see testimony of jon wolfsthal before the subcommittee on europe and the subcommittee on international terrorism nonproliferation and human rights of the house international relations committee may 14 2003 the evil behind the axis angeles times january 5 2003 pakistan

us focus away from international nonproliferation treaties such as the ctbt and withdrawing from the antiballistic missile treaty the bush administrations deemphasis of vertical proliferation8 issues has contributed to legitimizing south asias strategic arsenals9 in the face of congressional questioning about seeming contradictions in us policy assistant secretary of state for south asia christina rocca stated in march 2003 that the united states is taking pragmatic approach that seeks to have india and pakistan exercise restraint with regard to the proliferation of strategic arsenals10 the september 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states and ensuing usled antiterrorism efforts transformed us relations with india and especially pakistan which again became frontline ally and beneficiary of significant us foreign assistance up from 35 million in fy2001 to more than 1 billion in fy2002 indias swift offer of full support for us antiterrorism efforts was widely viewed as reflective of much improved usindia relations in 2003 and for perhaps the first period in history the united states simultaneously enjoys positive relations with both countries11 this circumstance may mean that the ability of the united states to influence south asian security dynamics is at an alltime high at the same time differences with pakistan over issues of terrorism proliferation and democratization and with india over definitions of terrorism us policy in the middle east and human rights continue to cloud forecasts of future us engagement with south asias two largest and nucleararmed countries the key issues for congress addressed here are whether missile proliferation in south asia enhances or detracts from regional stability and the role of us policy in promoting such stability as well as in tension reduction and nonproliferation levels of us foreign assistance to india and pakistan the establishment of aid restrictions the transfer of conventional weapons platforms possibly including missile defense systems the setting of export control parameters and nonproliferation goals and the maintenance of policy and intelligence oversight of us relations with

july 22 2003 crs4 pakistan all have vital congressional facet pending and future legislation could influence levels of stability in south asia regional conflict and the us role understanding presentday missile proliferation in south asia and relevant us policy options is aided by review of the historical setting three wars in1947 48 1965 and 1971 and constant state of military preparedness on both sides of their shared border have marked the halfcentury of bitter rivalry between india and pakistan bloody battle in the kashmiri mountains near kargil in 1999 cost thousands of lives and marked historys first significant direct clash between the forces of two nucleararmed countries most recently 10monthlong military standoff in 2002 involving up to one million indian and pakistani soldiers was viewed as the closest the two countries had been to fullscale war since 1971 and caused the us government to become deeply concerned that conventional war could escalate into nuclear confrontation12 persistent and oftentimes perplexing aspect of us engagement in the region has been the difficulty of maintaining moreorless balanced approach toward two antagonistic countries while simultaneously promoting perceived us interests in south asia india has seven times the population and four times the land area of pakistan in 2002 the indian gdp was more than eight times that of pakistan and the indian military enjoys 21 or 31 advantage in numbers of soldiers and conventional arms13 yet despite indias clearly greater status in these concrete terms the united states has for the past halfcentury found itself much more closely engaged with pakistan in particular during the 1950s when pakistan was part of the usled alliance system to contain the soviet union the 1980s when pakistan was frontline ally in ussupported efforts to defeat the soviet army in afghanistan and today when pakistan is again frontline ally this time in usled efforts to defeat islamic militancy cold war14 india and pakistan were established in august 1947 from what had been british india some 500000 people died during the partition and by october the two countries were fighting war over the disputed kashmir region even before the onset of the ussoviet cold war there existed strategic divergence between the 12 statement of george tenet before the senate armed services committee worldwide

and patterns on both sides which persisted for many decades15 over the course of the cold war us interest in south asia was inconsistent and almost wholly subordinated to efforts at containing soviet and chinese communist expansion perceived absence of compelling geostrategic or economic stakes limited the extent of us involvement in south asian affairs during the 1950s pakistan became embedded in usled treaty organizations that sought to encircle and contain communist expansion two key results were the institutionalization of close uspakistan ties and the provision to islamabad of large assistance packages16 while this uspakistan security relationship developed indian leaders concentrated on nationbuilding and followed policy of what became known as nonalignment by the mid1950s washingtons differences with new delhi gave rise to what top us diplomat characterized as correct but rather chillyexchanges that would last for several decades17 after brief 1962 border war with china exposed serious weaknesses in the indian army the united states initiated military assistance programs for new delhi that totaled about 150 million by 1966 however the second indiapakistan war over kashmir in 1965 spurred the united states to end military assistance to both countries given pakistans 10 years of close cooperation with the united states some in islamabad felt betrayed by this move however when east pakistan now bangladesh fell into turmoil in 1971 leading to the forced partition of pakistan after its defeat in third war with india president nixon elected to tilt us support toward pakistan and in so doing brought usindia relations to nadir18 indias peaceful nuclear explosion of 1974 made south asian weapons proliferation top tier us concern for the remainder of the cold war the soviet invasion of afghanistan of 1979 transformed uspakistan relations virtually overnight and during the 1980s pakistan became regarded as frontline us ally in the struggle against soviet expansion19 15 stephen p cohen the united states india and pakistan retrospect and prospect in india and pakistan selig harrison paul kreisberg and dennis kux eds washington woodrow wilson center

enterprise carrier task force into the bay of bengal in 1971 to deter an indian attack on west pakistan an event that had lasting effect on new delhis security perspectives 19 the military regime of pakistani gen ziaul haq subsequently received several billion dollars in us economic and military aid even as president reagan continued the continued crs6 postcold war following the soviet unions withdrawal from afghanistan and its subsequent collapse in 1991 us policy toward south asia sought to break the zerosum mind set that had plagued indopakistani relations since partition and was reinforced by the global rivalries of the past decades20 proliferationrelated restrictions on aid to pakistan constrained this effort however and contributed to perceived imbalance in us policy after their reimposition in 199021 for india the end of the cold war meant an end to two decades of close indiansoviet relations and major reduction of aid infusions from moscow at about the same time disaffected separatists in the jammu and kashmir state launched fullblown rebellion there during the 1990s islamabad came under intense criticism from both india and the united states for its active role in supporting the insurgency and later for its support of the afghani taliban regime the may 1998 nuclear tests triggered sweeping us aid restrictions on both countries and an october 1999 military coup in pakistan brought added us sanctions on that country22 yet the decadelong shift in us orientation toward south asia became especially clear when president clinton visited the region in march 2000 spending six days in india but only six hours in pakistan post911 the september 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states suddenly transformed us relations with pakistan which again became frontline us ally this time against radical islamic terrorists and their supporters india also joined the usled antiterrorism coalition and remaining aid restrictions on both india and pakistan were quickly lifted by congress and president bush however while the bush administration has moved to bolster usindia relations on broad front including regular and unprecedented joint military exercises and potentially major arms sales to new delhi the uspakistan relationship has continued to be constrained by us concerns regarding islamabads possible role in wmd proliferation terrorist infiltration into both indian kashmir and across the durand line separating pakistan and afghanistan and perceived antidemocratic practices by president gen pervez musharraf despite these concerns

make the finding required to make assistance available 22 see crs report rs20995 india and pakistan us economic sanctions by dianne rennack crs7 bilateral security dynamics debate over regional nuclear weapons and missile race central to an analysis of the meaning of missile proliferation in south asia are two key questions first is strategic arms race between india and pakistan underway and second does progress in the development of missile and nuclear capabilities promote or degrade regional stability indian and pakistani government officials express desire to avoid engaging in costly and potentially disastrous arms race while also asserting that such race is afoot23 yet 2001 defense department review of proliferation threats indicated that indian and pakistani strategic programs continue to be driven by the perception of the others effort and that the two countries are in period of accelerated nuclear weapons and missile development that may be termed slowspeed arms race24 in 2002 director of central intelligence tenet told the senate select committee on intelligence that both india and pakistan are working on the doctrine and tactics for more advanced nuclear weapons producing fissile material and increasing their nuclear stockpiles both countries also continue development of longrange nuclearcapable ballistic missiles and plan to field cruise missiles with land attack capability25 apparent titfortat ballistic missile tests in april 1999 and again in march 2003 have been viewed as evidence that an actionreaction dynamic is indeed at work26 many analysts argue that overt nuclear weaponization by either side most especially of their ballistic missiles could be highly destabilizing especially if significant nuclear missile forces are deployed in the absence of secure command and control structures if these forces are perceived as being vulnerable to attack one or both sides might adopt launchonwarning status making conflict escalation even more difficult to govern27 ever since the 1998 nuclear tests in south asia it has appeared that indias strategic decisionmaking is key factor in shaping regional stability according to the pentagon indias development of mediumrange ballistic missiles mrbms is motivated by its desire to be recognized as great power and strategic 23 musharraf says arms race on subcontinent associated press newswire

crs8 competitor with china28 china seems content with its existing deterrent against india and pakistans limited resources appear to constrain its ability to initiate an indopakistani arms race29 thus key variable in the future evolution of south asian nuclear proliferation is indias strategic intention in relation to china one of the more dangerous scenarios is one in which india actively seeks to gain nuclear parity with china by building larger nuclear arsenal and longrange delivery force in the middleterm the deployment of agni missiles capable of striking chinas eastern population centers could spur beijing to retarget more nuclear forces to the south and likewise move islamabad to seek some form of parity in this arena thus potentially setting in motion fullblown arms race on the asian subcontinent30 moreover some observers suggest that us sales of theater missile defense systems in asia or the deployment of national system covering us territory could spur further ballistic missile proliferation in south asia see below31 deterrence models debate over the proliferation of strategic arsenals generally is divided into two camps optimists and pessimists32 proliferation optimists operate under the logic of deterrence wherein the possession of nuclear weapons by both sides of an adversarial interstate relationship can be expected to produce stability put simply mutual deterrence obtains when both sides believe that the costs of aggression or escalation are likely to outweigh the potential benefits of such action33 proliferation pessimists however take the view that the spread of nuclear weapons capability is inherently destabilizing and dangerous and that nuclear dynamics in the developing world are unlikely to recreate the cold war pattern political and technological factors in conflictprone areas are seen to create conditions where nuclear weapons will not produce stability and the introduction of more nuclear weapons will significantly increase the likelihood that these weapons will be used34 many analysts have pointed to the brief bloody kargil conflict of 1999 as evidence that south asias strategic arsenals do not contribute to stability and may lead to the use of nuclear weapons35 28 us department of defense proliferation threat and response 1997 29 ben sheppard south asia nears nuclear boiling point janes intelligence review april 1999

came perilously close to continued crs9 only seven months after the may 1998 tests the main architect of the benchmark framework thendeputy secretary of state strobe talbott noted that the new delhi and islamabad governments were justifying their moves to overt capabilities with reference to the ussoviet experience almost as if they see cold war brinkmanship between the superpowers as something to be emulated he warned that such perspective misreads the reality of ussoviet interactions and that historic geographic and economic differences appear significant in the south asian case36 this use of the cold war experience illustrates the general proliferation optimism of the indian and pakistani governments in contrast with the proliferation pessimism expressed by some us government officials especially those in the state department as noted above bush administration officials have been more muted in their criticism of south asian strategic arsenals both india and pakistan have claimed to be seeking only the nuclear weapons needed for minimum credible deterrence mcd37 most indian and pakistani planners have conceived of mcd as significantly scaleddown form of the massive urbanindustrial retaliation envisaged under the us nuclear doctrine of the 1950s based on the ability to launch retaliatory strike that would inflict unacceptable damage upon an adversary38 given the expressed positions of the indian and pakistani governments and their observable behaviors as noted in the sections above it would appear that some form of strategic arms race is taking place on the asian subcontinent albeit one in which progress is limited by economic and technological factors there exists consensus however on the question of how such 35 continued nuclear exchange in june 1999

on this issue tends to be decisively colored by fundamental beliefs about the utility of nuclear deterrence and the extent to which it obtains in south asia such beliefs often are derived through analysis of key variables that affect stability in the region indian and pakistani strategic capabilities and control mechanisms and their potential deployment of missile defense systems regional

signatory of the biological weapons convention bwc is believed to have an active biological defense research program as well as the necessary infrastructure to develop variety of biological agents39 estimates on indias nuclear weapons arsenal vary but number of analysts believes that as of 2002 india had between 30 to 35 nuclear weapons with yields varying between 5 to 25 kilotons kts despite an indian claim that it had detonated nuclear device on may 11 2002 with 43 kt yield40 these devices are likely configured as aerial bombs or missile warheads while precise breakdown of number of bombs versus missile warheads is unknown senior pakistani military official reportedly claimed that the majority of indias nuclear weapons were configured as aerial bombs41 while india reportedly has number of different types of aircraft some analysts believe that it would use 1970s and 1980svintage sovietbuilt mig27 flogger aircraft with range of 800 km and the anglofrench jaguar aircraft with 1600 39

assembly without its plutonium core in 1999 and again in 200144 while such tests are considered crucial for warhead development by some experts some nuclear scientists believe that additional flight testing to adequately test the weapons fuze and trigger will be required before india could deploy nucleararmed missiles operationally45 according to press reports indias defense minister george fernandez reported to the indian parliament on july 29 2003 that india had conducted 20 tests of seven different types of missiles including two agni variants during the first half of 200346 while not weapon or delivery system indias satellites contribute to its strategic capabilities some analysts believe that indias network of communication satellites and its technology experiment satellite which reportedly has an optical resolution capacity of one meter provides india with strategic early warning capability that could help ensure the survivability of its nuclear forces these satellites could also help improve indias military command control communication and intelligence capacities47 pakistani weapons and delivery systems pakistan member of the cwc since 1997 is not believed to possess chemical weapons but according to january 2001 us department of defense dod report has imported number of dualuse chemicals with commercial applications that could also be used to make chemical

configured as both aerial bombs and missile warheads despite pakistani claims of higher yield weapons seismic measurements from pakistani nuclear detonations on may 28 and 30 2002 suggest weaponized yields more along the order of 912 kt and 46 kt respectively49 it is possible that pakistan has higher yield weapons that have not been tested while pakistan has obtained variety of combat aircraft from different nations many experts believe that the most likely aircraft to be used to deliver nuclear weapons would be the us f16 fighter twenty eight f16 single seat and 12 f16 b two seat fighters

suspected nuclear weapons states50 despite the september 22 2001 presidential determination waiving the pressler amendment and other sanctions on india and pakistan the administrations current five year 3 billion aid package will reportedly not include the promised f16s despite president musharrafs request that their sale be approved51 pakistans current fleet of f16s is believed to be capable of

its missiles are not truly deployed but on daytoday basis are maintained in what is described as state of induction induction is described as the peacetime non threatening activity of acquiring weapon and testing and training with it deployment is described as belligerent posture with missiles actually on launchers deployed to forward locations and kept in high state of readiness for use56 both countries have been accused of having deployed their missiles on number of occasions during the july 1999 kargil crisis us intelligence reportedly detected the pakistani military deploying nuclear armed missiles fact reportedly unknown to pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif who was in washington dc on july 4th conferring with president clinton in an attempt to deescalate the kargil situation57 both countries nuclear weapons are believed to be stored in facilities separate from airfields and missile units for both security and maintenance purposes one observer suggested that in order for india and pakistan to have more credible nuclear postures both countries should increase the state of alert of their nuclear forces to at least provide rudimentary capability to launch under attack he posited that such posture could be particularly of use to india in terms of china which is believed to keep portion of its ballistic missile force on high state of alert58 many analysts however believe that the current state of alert in india and pakistan is credible deterrence posture and that any move by either country to increase its posture could have negative consequences

point out that in order for it to be effective there must be clear and undisputed lines of authority and established and practiced procedures on january 4 2003 the indian government announced the establishment of its nuclear command authority reportedly the nuclear command authority consists of twotiered political council headed by the prime minister who will be the singular authority for launching nuclear attack and an executive council chaired by the prime ministers national security advisor who will provide input for decision making purposes and execute directives from the political council61 as part of the establishment of the nuclear command authority the indian government also established strategic forces command which according to press reports would command all strategic assets defined as aircraft landbased missiles and nuclear weapons and bombs62 while the indian government claimed that the establishment of the nuclear command authority and the strategic forces command were logical command and control arrangements some officials conceded that the creation of these two entities was also response to international concerns about indias rudimentary almost nonexistent nuclear command and control structure and also to send firm message to pakistan63 debate over regional missile defense regional missile defense has been viewed by some analysts as potential catalyst to promote stability and by others as an inherently volatile proposition which could upset the regions strategic balance in july 2002 deputy assistant secretary for defense presented dods position on regional missile defense to the senate governmental affairs committee we believe that missile defenses generally speaking are part of an inherently stabilizing concept the right to defend yourself against these missiles is something we feel is matter to explore with the indians with the pakistanis if theyre interested64 this pentagon position reportedly is not shared by

india obtained the joint us israeli arrow ballistic missile interceptor that it might heighten tensions with pakistan65 the indian approach to missile defense some experts believe that indias motivation for missile defense capability was result of pakistans acquisition of m11 shortrange ballistic missiles from china in 1992 and its continued development of longer range and more capable missiles66 other analysts note that indias desire for missile defense is also function of its concern about the chinese df21mediumrange ballistic missiles believed to be deployed in western china pakistans periodic declarations that it would use nuclear weapons against india if it feels threatened likely reinforced new delhis desire to obtain ballistic missile defense capability india is reported to be pursuing two approaches to regional missile defense creating an indigenous system or purchasing complete system from another country since late 1993 indias defense research and development organization drdo has reportedly been involved in efforts to modify the indiandesigned akash lowto medium altitude surfacetoair missile sam into an interceptor capable of engaging ballistic missiles67 while some analysts report that efforts are still underway to develop the akash into missile defense system there have been opensource reports of the akash being tested against ballistic missile targets number of reports suggest that india also is interested in purchasing the jointlydeveloped us israeli arrow missile defense system from israel because the united states has played major financial and scientific role in developing the arrow any legal export of the system by israel would likely require prior us approval both the senate and house armed services committees have expressed reservations about possible sale to india or other countries turkey has also expressed an interest in the arrow and reportedly have the following concerns although the arrow is defensive system it could possibly be re engineered into and offensive system its sale could possibly trigger regional offensive arms race israel has allegedly transferred or attempted to transfer critical military technologies to countries of concern such as china such sale could violate the provisions of the missile technology control regime mtcr missile nonproliferation arrangement to which the united states is party and 65 ibid 66 see crs report rl31555 china and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles policy issues by shirley kan 67 ibid crs16 concern that israel would profit from the sale of product largely paid for by the united states and might also constitute competition to raytheons us patriot missile system68 the arrow 2 missile system is designed to provide terminal phase69 intercept against short and medium range ballistic missiles and reportedly can detect and track up to 14 inbound missiles at distances as far as 500 km away and then intercept them as close as 16 to 48 kilometers from the missile system some experts believe that india would deploy the arrow system along the line of control separating kashmir and the indiapakistan international border to protect population and military centers70 india has also reportedly been in negotiations with russia since 1995 to acquire either the s300pmu1 or s300v antitactical ballistic missile system71 in may 2003 an indian newspaper reported that india had discussed sale of the us patriot advanced capabilities3 or pac3 air and missile defense system with us deputy secretary of state richard armitage according to indian authorities cited discussions have been underway with the bush administration since may 2002 about such sale but the us government has not given raytheon the goahead to provide india with pricing availability and other information needed to begin the acquisition process72 observers offer variety of implications for indian missile defense some feel that indias deployment of missile defense system could erode pakistans confidence that its f16s and missiles if vulnerable to intercept could continue to provide credible nuclear deterrent against india73 other analysts believe that an indian ballistic missile defense capability would break the current state of mutual nonweaponized deterrence74 and lead pakistan to mount nuclear warheads on deployed missiles which could destabilize the region another possibility is that pakistan may adopt use it or lose it policy whereby pakistan might employ its nuclear forces early in the conflict to penetrate indian defenses75 another possibility is that pakistan could embark on program to develop greater number of missiles and nuclear warheads in order to saturate and overwhelm indias ballistic missile 68

56 crs17 defenses some analysts reject these possibilities and claim that indian missile defense would contribute to regional stability but provide little explanation as to how missile defense would actually achieve this the pakistani approach to missile defense with the waiver of the pressler amendment because of pakistans support for the united states in its war on terrorism the indian press has reported that pakistan has initiated negotiations with the united states to purchase ballistic missile defense system76 it claims that pakistan is attempting to acquire either the patriot system or the hawk or nikehercules system the hawk and nikehercules systems are longer in active service with the us army and were designed primarily to shoot down sovietera longrange bombers while both systems are in use around the world with variety of militaries it is not known how effective they would be against modern aircraft and ballistic missiles some analysts feel that the acquisition of one of these systems could help dissuade pakistan from further missile development in an attempt to overcome indias ballistic missile defense capabilities pakistan reportedly has stated that it would deploy any missile defense systems around nuclear facilities and at sites where missiles are built and stored such deployment might be intended to insure that at least some of pakistans nuclear warheads and missiles would survive an indian strike and be available as deterrent if pakistan did acquire ballistic missile defense system from the united states india might react by producing more missiles and nuclear weapons to offset an enhanced capability by pakistan to intercept indian aircraft or missiles particularly if pakistan acquired the more modern and capable patriot system another concern could be that patriot technology provided to pakistan might be transferred by pakistan to china north korea or iran and be used in the development of countermeasures to prevent us intercept of their ballistic missiles key issues and options for congress nonproliferation mtcrrelated issues some experts have expressed concern that india or pakistan might export their missiles or nuclear technology to other nations increasing the number of nuclear missilearmed nations thereby increasing the security risk to the united states and other countries neither india nor pakistan nor china for that matter are members of the missile technology control regime mtcr77 which was established in 1987 to restrict the proliferation of wmd capable ballistic missiles cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and their associated technology the mtcr is not legally binding treaty or formal 76 information in this paragraph on us antimissile systems is from pak to acquire anti ballistic missile from us times of india delhimay 15 2003 77 for detailed mtcr information see httpwwwmtcrinfoenglishindexhtml crs18 agreement but mtcr members do voluntarily agree to enforce common export control standards many analysts agree that the mtcr has had positive impact on slowing missile proliferation congress may consider the possibility of renewed us efforts to gain indian and pakistani accession to the mtcr because of the legally non binding aspect of the mtcr and its requirements for effective national export control mtcr membership might be first step in helping to promote other bilateral or regional initiatives to address missile proliferation and security concerns critics of this approach might cite both countries longstanding resistance to enter into what pakistans permanent minister to the called in 1997 cartel formed by some industrialized countries for the purpose of placing controls on the transfer of technology and an arrangement for promoting their own security interests only78 technical assistance various technologies might reduce the risk of an indiapakistan nuclear exchange technical assistance for both countries could take number of forms version of nunnlugartype program has been discussed in congress and some analysts see india and pakistan as prime candidates for such program79 other initiatives such as establishing missile launch notification agreement or hotline might be considered military sales designed to help each country safeguard its missiles from accidental launch are also possible option opponents of technical assistance could argue that it would virtually be impossible to extend any form of technical assistance to one nation without arousing suspicion in the other country what we might consider as safeguarding ballistic missiles from accidental launch could be construed as improving the ability to launch missile surprise attack by either country another consideration is that of equity pakistan with smaller and less modern military could argue that it deserves considerably more technical assistance than indiaa position that might arouse considerable indian opposition export controls another option that could be explored is multilateral initiative to assist india and pakistan in improving their export control systems particularly as they pertain to missile technology such an initiative could be stand alone effort undertaken to improve the overall quality of each countrys system or it could be in anticipation of eventual mtcr membership in order for country to become an mtcr member it must be approved for membership by all current members and meet stringent export control requirements it is not known how receptive india or pakistan would be to such an initiative export controls are essentially domestic legal matter and us assistance in this area might not be well received or even appreciated for that matter in pakistans case 78 missile technology control regime its

controls which could limit its missilerelated dealings with north korea and iran would likely meet considerable resistance from government and military officials confidencebuilding measures confidencebuilding measures or cbms are described as measures designed to reduce the risk of deliberate or accidental conflict and build trust by demonstrating the ability of the parties to keep promises80 confidencebuilding measures are by means new to india and pakistan the 1999 lahore declaration entailed number of cbms designed to reduce the risks of nuclear exchange prompted by an accident or misinterpretation of nuclear or ballistic missile test81 pakistans deployment of troops to kargil and the ensuing fighting in july 1999 effectively derailed the lahore process and its associated cbms some analysts suggest that the united states could play role in helping to establish series of cbms in the region experts point to the previously abandoned hotline notifications of military exercises and missile launch notifications82 another possible cbm could be an aerial monitoring effort along the lines of the open skies agreement if initial joint monitoring flights along the line of control proved successful then deeper more intrusive flights might be future option other possible measures might involve assisting india and pakistan in the establishment of mechanism to settle disputes perhaps modeled on the us russian nuclear risk reduction centers in moscow and washington or providing technological support in establishing series of ground based sensors in critical disputed areas some experts assert that the united states would not necessarily have to be directly involved in all aspects of mediating or monitoring but could provide technological support and advice as needed critics of regional cbms might emphasize the past failure of cbms due to the volatile nature of the region resurrecting previouslyattempted cbms only to have them suspended due to disagreement or incident could further their argument that the region is not conducive to this particular approach perhaps more practical and costeffective approach might be to attempt to first settle regional disputes diplomatically and then institute appropriate cbms on an incremental basis based on equal commitments from both india and pakistan proliferation security initiative

authorities and with relevant international laws and frameworks the psi group met in paris in october 2003 and adopted these principles detailed in the fact sheet series of ussponsored naval interdiction exercises called pacific protector were conducted in september 2003 involving australia and great britain as part of the psi85 while the administration claims that the psi does not target any particular country many experts believe that the psi was developed in response to growing north korean missile exports and technological assistance to countries of concern in theory both india and pakistan could be subject to seizures of wmd and missilerelated items under the psi congress may further explore the legality of the psi both in terms of us and international law other issues for congress may include how the psi complements or detracts from current nonproliferation regimes congress might also review the scope of the psi in terms of india and pakistan will proscribed shipments to or from these countries be interdicted or will we choose not to interdict in order to maintain favorable relations with both countries and their continued cooperation in the global war on terror the crs report weapons of mass destruction counterproliferation legal issues for ships and aircraft questions the legality of the psis intent to interdict sea air and land shipments the report acknowledges that international law recognizes that states have limited right to interdict vessels and aircraft in specific circumstances but suggests that the psis wideranging provisions to interdict and seize wmd and missilerelated technologies on the high seas appear doubtful under current international law suggestions to address this issue range from amending current international laws governing the sea and air to include wmd and missile technologies to amending current nonproliferation treaties86 other issues pakistannorth korea relations of critical concern to both congress and the administration is suspected pakistannorth korean proliferation relationship both countries stand accused of proliferating missile and nuclear technology and many analysts believe that rapid advancements in pakistans missile and perhaps nuclear program can be directly attributed to north korean assistance some experts suggest that as pakistans missile programs have matured and advanced

presidential determination waiving number of sanctions against both india and pakistan87 sanctions were the primary means by which the united states attempted to compel pakistan to terminate proliferation activities with north korea today the situation is considerably more complex and may merit congressional attention the brahmos cruise missile concerns have been raised about current and proposed us missile defense vulnerability to the alleged supersonic stealth enhanced brahmos cruise missile being developed by russia and india could these missiles in the hands of hostile states and nonstate actors provide them with dangerous asymmetric military advantage another issue is how difficult would it be to develop nuclear warhead for the brahmos and what countries presently have the scientific and engineering capability to do so vertical and nonmissile proliferation while us efforts to strengthen the international nonproliferation regime have slowed under the bush administration some observers advocate increasing pressure on india and pakistan to encourage their accession to such treaties as the npt and the ctbt moreover the worlds nascent nuclear powers watch closely for any new us development and procurement of nuclear weapons and so us decisions in this realm may have cascading effects on the scope and pace of global proliferation perspectives and behaviors thus while some policy makers believe that new us nuclear weapons would enhance deterrence others claim that such weapons would undermine us nonproliferation goals see crs issue brief ib90091 nuclear nonproliferation issues by carl behrens crs report rs20351 comprehensive test ban treaty pro and by jonathan medalia and crs report rs21619 nuclear weapons and us national security by amy woolf missile defense the ramifications of possibly providing usdeveloped missile and air defense systems to india and pakistan are of concern while some experts contend that providing both countries with these systems would help to deescalate tensions others argue that it could heighten tensions and possibly invite military adventurism by creating false sense of security in addition to the impact that missile defense might have on india and pakistan its possible effects on sinoindian relations could be serious concern were the united states to provide such systems to india and pakistan issues related to technology transfer would arise policymakers including many in congress would be concerned about the potential for onward transfer of advanced us missile defense technology to countries such as north korea iran china and russia if these or other countries had access to us missile defense technologies 87 in presidential determination signed on september 22 2001 president bush waived sanctions on india and pakistan and reestablished military sales on selected items crs22 the potential may exist for them to develop countermeasures and penetration aids that could render us theater missile defenses less effective terrorism for more than one decade the united states repeatedly has expressed concerns about ongoing terrorism in pakistan and neighboring regions and about the continued existence in pakistan of outlawed terrorist groups after september 2001 these concerns became acute some members of congress along with numerous independent analysts have opined that perceived need for allies in the global anti terrorist coalition has caused the united states to significantly mute its criticism of south asian wmd proliferation and signs of onward proliferation activities by pakistan in particular88 it appears that continued us focus on counterterrorism policy requires tradeoff in relation to nonproliferation policy options for congress in addressing this issue include adjustments in us development assistance to improve economic and educational conditions in pakistan possibly with regard to reform of the extensive madrassa religious school system89 review of military assistance to both india and pakistan may affect levels of terrorism in the region in recent years such assistance has emphasized counterterrorism including ground transport airlift communication surveillance and emergency response equipment initiatives to help resolve the kashmir dispute might also reduce the incidence of regional terrorism another facet of us concern in this area regards fears that terrorists in pakistan or india might gain access to nuclear materials in those countries90 options for addressing this possibility include authorizing expansion of cooperative threat reduction programs aimed at securing pakistans andor indias nuclear assets or otherwise seeking to make the regions nuclear arsenals safer through new initiatives although such initiatives may conflict with us treaty obligations and are opposed by some proliferation analysts see technical assistance section of this report above regional stability the united states recognizes that geostrategic and geopolitical stability in south and southwest asia are augmented by strong us ties with both india and pakistan with new delhi the bush administration seeks to increase the scope and

billions of dollars in us economic and military aid for the remainder of the current decade92 in both south asian capitals the united states is viewed by some as an unreliable ally so the extent to which indians and pakistanis feel assured about longterm us engagement in the region will almost certainly affect their willingness to cooperate on those issues most important to us policy makers for these reasons and others many in congress continue to be interested in initiatives that affect the overall tenor of us relations with india andor pakistan as well as the progress of economic development and human rights promotion in the region many observers believe that increased us trade with and investment in india and pakistan would enhance more stable and pacific international relations on the subcontinent some emphasize the need for strong democratic institutions major issue may be more effective us role in efforts to resolve what arguably is the single greatest threat to regional stability continuing violence in the kashmir region from broader perspective many experts believe improved uschina and indiachina relations could do much to ensure more tranquil asia in coming years and decades assessment in the new centuryand especially after september 2001south asia is longer the strategic backwater that it was for many us analysts during the cold war the overt nuclear postures of india and pakistan and usled antiterrorism efforts centered on southwest asia have made the regions security dynamics matter of great concern for the united states where government officials acknowledge that stable and thriving south asia would advance us interests with regard to missile proliferation and south asian security many appear sanguine about the future from the perspective of proliferation optimists the establishment of nuclear command and control mechanisms and the deployment of reliable ballistic missile capabilities on both sides is seen to contribute to crisis stability through mutual deterrence and thus to decrease the likelihood of fourth fullscale india pakistan war however proliferation pessimism continues among many some years ago thendeputy secretary of state strobe talbott warned that unless india and pakistan exercise genuine restraint and great care the nuclear weapons delivery systems themselves could become source of tension and

making the outbreak of war substantive risk the continued proliferation of strategic arsenals in south asia cannot be viewed with complacence among the future developments that could exacerbate regional tensions are the increased influence of hindu nationalism in new delhi andor the increased influence of islamic fundamentalism in islamabad moreover many analysts are concerned that continued military rule in pakistan will hamper efforts at regional entente in the near term two issues appear key to south asian security or its absence 1 ongoing violence in the kashmir region and pakistani support for or tolerance of islamic terrorist groups operating from territory under its control and 2 afghani instability and ongoing conflict along the pakistanafghanistan border trends in these areas are difficult to determine but significant violence has continued in both theaters in the middle and longer term developments in four areas appear directly relevant 1 the course of indiachina relations and strategic posturing 2 the extent of positive us engagement with both india and pakistan 3 new delhis weapons procurement decisions and 4 the possible deployment of missile defense systems here trends appear to be mixed new delhi and beijing have moved toward more peaceful relations and the united states is remaining fully engaged with both of south asias largest countries yet indias energetic acquisition of sophisticated new weapons platforms and pursuit of missile defense systems may bode poorly for regional stability moreover within each of these areas the progress and scope of regional missile proliferation represents crucial and interactive facet the importance of us policies toward south asia is difficult to deny missile proliferation and its implications for south asian security are worthy of careful monitoring in the future 93 deputy secretary of state strobe talbott us diplomacy in south asia progress report us department of state dispatch december 16 1998 crs25 appendix missile programs india some experts believe that indias ballistic missile program is motivated primarily by desire for political and technological prestige and to lesser extent strategic military considerations towards pakistan and china94 indias program is considered to be one of the most ambitious missile programs in the developing world capable of producing missiles with ranges equal to those deployed by the original five nuclear powers united states russia china england and france many analysts consider indias ballistic missile program derivative of its space program which is rated by some as one of the most advanced programs among emerging missile nations some experts claim that indias space launch vehicles constitute an intercontinental ballistic missile icbm capability but others argue that although conversion of space launch vehicles into icbms is possible india does not have security requirement that would necessitate such an undertaking india launched its first satellite in 1975 atop soviet rocket and by 1980 was able to launch small spacecraft into orbit using its own domesticallyproduced slv3 space launch vehicle95 the indian defense research and development organization drdo established the integrated guided missile development program in 1983 under the direction of abdul kalam to develop ballistic missiles most likely in anticipation of the adoption of the missile technology control regime mtcr by number of key supplier countries india went on what was described by some analysts as shopping spree for gyroscopes accelerometers and motion simulators from suppliers in the united states germany france and sweden96 many analysts cite this foresight in obtaining high quality foreign missile components and subsequent reverse engineering by indian engineers as key factor which has enabled indias missile program to become virtually selfsufficient this self sufficiency permits india to avoid international export control restrictions as well as inherent difficulties that could arise with extensive foreign involvement in its missile program india has developed two ballistic missiles the short range prithvi and the medium range agni97

the target would be expected to impact and is the standard for measuring accuracy for missiles and bombs 99 the dhanush is essentially the indian navys ship launched version of the prithvi ii and has been under development since 1983 the first test of the dhanush reportedly resulted in failure 30 seconds after its launch from an indian offshore patrol vessel anchored in the bay of bengal where the missile was launched from the ships reinforced hydraulically stabilized helicopter deck which had been converted into launch platform 100 solid propellants are generally favored as they are safer to store and easier and quicker to put into action than liquid propellantfilled missiles countries that produce solid propellant missiles are generally considered to have more technologicallyadvanced missile program than those countries who produce strictly liquid propellant missiles 101 information on the prithvi i is from janes strategic weapons systems p 84 102 zahid hussain missile tests raise

including islamabad and other major cities103 prithvi ii prithvi ii missiles are reportedly used by the indian air force to attack enemy airfields and to support the indian army on the battlefield some experts believe that efforts are underway to adapt the full range of prithvi i warheads for prithvi ii use104 first test fired in january 1996 the prithvi ii is assessed to be capable of hitting almost half of pakistan including almost all critical military targets and all major cities105 prithvi iii the prithvi iii is currently under development and is not yet believed to be operational it is believed to have range of 350 km and payload of 750 kg and may also have either new liquid or solid propulsion system some reports suggest that india may install global positioning system gps guidance system that could reduce the missiles cep to 25 m agni i the agni i is twostaged intermediaterange single warhead ballistic missile the agni i is believed to have minimum range of 500 km and maximum range of 2500 km with cep of 100 m some analysts believe that india has developed 45 kt nuclear warhead for the agni i and possibly 200 kt warhead the agni i has separating reentry vehicle rv that reportedly has an altitude control system and aerodynamic maneuver fins designed to make intercept from ballistic missile defenses more difficult the agni i considered technology demonstrator and not developed weapons system by the indian government has undergone three test flights between 1994 and 2002 agni ii the agni ii has two solid propellant stages and some experts believe that it has minimum range of 500 km and maximum range of 3000 to 35000 km the agni ii is believed to have 100 m cep and separating 200 kt nuclear warhead weighing approximately 500 kg the agni ii was first test launched in april 1999 some analysts suggest that small number of agni ii missiles fewer than five have been operationally available since late 2000 and that the annual production rate since then has been from 15 to 20 missiles the agni iis range permits it to strike all of pakistan and deep into western portions of china106 agni iii the agni iii is believed to have range of 5000 km range of

india claims that the agni iii will be both rail and roadmobile with new inertial guidance system and will be able to deliver onetonne warhead beyond the range of combat aircraft the agni iii may have three stages and some analysts speculate that the first and second stages may be solid propellant stages and the third stage either liquid or solid propellant109 india has claimed that the agni iii would only be used to deliver conventional warheads but with reported cost of 45 to 8 million us dollars per missile some experts find it difficult to imagine that the cost of such missile could be justified unless it was used to deliver nuclear weapons110 submarine launched ballistic missiles slbms according to some us intelligence sources india is developing submarine launched ballistic missile slbm known as the sagarika which could be operational sometime after 2010111 india reportedly is seeking nuclear triad missiles aircraft and sea based to insure that at least some of the countrys nuclear weapons survive first strike attack112 it is unclear if the sagarika is intended to be deployed on modified russian kiloclass submarine or russian akulaclass submarine which is believed capable of firing only cruise missiles or indias advance technology vessel nuclear submarine that has been under development with russian assistance since 1985113 russian involvement in indias missile program reportedly more than two thirds of indias military equipment is from russia or the former soviet union and some analysts believe that india will purchase an additional 8 billion us dollars worth of military items from russia in the decade to come114 while specifics are not readily available some analyst suggest that it is reasonable assumption although indias missile program is considered largely selfsufficient that india will continue to acquire some missile components and other missilerelated technology from russia 107 janes strategic weapons systems p 82 108 india agni

considered by many analysts to be stateoftheart missile which travels at supersonic speed it is about 3 times faster than the current us tomahawk cruise missile and has been built with stealth technology which according to some experts could make it virtually impossible to intercept both countries reportedly plan to deploy the brahmos with their armed forces as well as export the brahmos to third world countries possibly to offset us military capabilities according to global securityorg the twostaged brahmos which can be fired from air land and sea could be modified to accommodate small nuclear warhead adding another operational capability to indias nuclear missile arsenal while india and russia have publically stated their intentions to deploy the brahmos to their respective armed forces by the end of 2003 some military officials believe that they are still several years away from deploying the missile116 pakistan many analysts consider pakistans ballistic missile program to be response to indias ballistic missiles its sophisticated air defense system and indias large and wellequipped armed forces117 some experts feel that relatively rapid advances in pakistans missile program are result of competition between samar mubarak mund of the national development complex responsible for solidfuel missiles and abdul qadeer khan of the khan research laboratories where liquidfueled missiles are produced despite these two competing organizations pakistan relies heavily on north korean chinese and to lesser degree iranian assistance in its missile program118 prior to 1989 pakistans missile arsenal was comprised primarily of hatf i rockets119 and hatf ii missiles with ranges of 80 and 280 km respectively indias 1989 launch of its agni i missile in conjunction with the us denial of delivery of f16 aircraft120 to pakistan is credited by many experts as central events that compelled islamabad to pursue ballistic missiles as pakistans primary means to deliver

range carrying 100 kg payload121 some analysts speculate that the limited range and payload capacity of these rockets would preclude the use of nuclear warhead and more likely payloads include high explosives submunitions and possibly chemical weapons122 the hatf is accuracy is unknown and pakistan may have as many of 80 of these rockets123 hatf ii the hatf ii is twostage solid propellant missile of 280 km range with 500 kg payload or 450 km range with 300 kg payload124 the hatf ii program is believed to have been terminated due to technical problems but some analysts speculate that in

considered by many experts as desirable characteristic for nuclear weapons delivery but limited range precludes its use to strike new delhi or large population centers lying beyond the indian desert127 the m11 is roadmobile solid propellant missile with 600 m cep that in addition to high explosive sub munition and chemical warheads can possibly deliver variety of nuclear warheads with 2 10 or 20 kt yields128 it is possible that m11s may be fitted with gps technology to increase their accuracy shaheen i the shaheen i is solid propellant single warhead missile reportedly developed by dr samar mubarak munds national development complex many analysts consider the shaheen i scaledup version of the chinese m11 missile the shaheen i has reported range of 600 km an accuracy of 200 m and can carry 750 kg 35 kt nuclear warhead or conventional or chemical munitions because launch preparations for the solidfueled roadmobile shaheen i are relatively short the missile reportedly can be launched within 5 to 10 minutes of its arrival at presurveyed launch site some analysts speculate that pakistan may have had from 5 to 10 shaheen is available for testing and operational use by the end of 1999 and more may have been produced since then shaheen ii the shaheen ii is roadmobile twostage solid propellant ballistic missile also developed by pakistans national development complex many analysts speculate that the shaheen ii is based on the chinese m18 missile129 the shaheen ii reportedly has 2500 km range 350 m cep and can carry 750 kg 15 to 35 kt nuclear warhead as well as high explosives submunitions chemical and fuelair explosives130 the shaheen ii is also believed to have separating reentry vehicle and its accuracy may be enhanced through the use of gps technology the shaheen ii was first publically displayed in march 2000 and it is not believed to have been flight tested to date some experts speculate that pakistan may have produced from 5 to 10 shaheen iis ghauri

deployed in late 1998 by pakistans 47th artillery brigade with 510 missiles available for testing or operational use ghauri ii the ghauri ii is believed to be lengthened and improved version of the ghauri i possibly employing new propellants and motor assembly the ghauri iis accuracy is unknown but its range is believed to be between 1800 to 2300 km and could also accommodate 15 to 35 kt nuclear warhead as well as the full range of warheads available for the ghauri i ghauri iii missile has been reported to be in development with possible 3000 km range and motor tests for this missile were believed to have taken place in july and september 1999 foreign involvement in pakistans missile program february 2000 report from the central intelligence agency cited chinese and north korean assistance as critical for islamabads efforts to produce ballistic missiles133 some analysts suggest that china may have been heavily involved in the development of the shaheen i 1999 us intelligence report alleges that china transferred designs for missile factory to pakistan and this factory is currently being used to produce shaheen i missiles134 july 2000 report from the us intelligence community stated that china had stepped up its shipments of specialty steels guidance systems and technical expertise to pakistan135 press reports citing january 2003 central intelligence agency report to congress on weapons technology claim that china also assisted pakistan in developing the shaheen ii and possibly nuclear weapons136 pakistan is believed to have started development of the ghauri i in 1993 with north korean assistance137 experts believe that the ghauri i is essentially north korean dong missile indias interception in june 1999 of ship carrying large amount of missile technology from north korea to pakistan has raised the issue that north korean missile technology may be able to help pakistan achieve ranges out to 8000 km138 there is also evidence that pakistan is
