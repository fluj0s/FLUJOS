6504c27 shspec59 awareness levels lrh makes several observations on recent organizational outpoints wherever the public impinges on the organization it enturbulates and erodes it is the public that is in confusion we are putting the stable datum of an organization or scientologist into the middle of the confusion an individual cannot stand alone against the public in the midst of this confusion he will get knocked appetiteovertincup by the public unless backed up by the organization every scientologist and org in the world is connected with the suppressive thing called the society so they would skid if left by themselves you are dealing with psychotic society there are thirtytwo levels below 0 and the average public is at least fifteen levels below 0and neurosis starts at ten levels below 0 it goes only few levels down then becomes psychosis psychosis is an inability to observe and thats your public last year when lrh first had total reality on the exact character of the reactive mind on exactly how it was there and exactly what it was calculated to make an individual do he was shocked knowing that shock is an indication that there is something wrong with what he is shocked with he went over the structure of the bank suppressed challenged and arc broke it the shock was not actually with the reactive bank but with the pretenses that had been made about the character of man i havent cognited heavily for ages lrh cant get his own ta up masses affect his body but not him here is some more data that lrh has found on the subject of clear clears time track is gone so the eidetic memory talked about in book one is there only if he puts it there clear recalls not with pictures but by knowing pictures are completely unnecessary for any kind of recall at all this is probably the only change theres been from the definition of book one clear there are also energy phenomena mentioned several years after book one like heating things up by looking at them clear can make something warm by staring at it as person goes on up he takes both the new abilities and the lost disabilities for granted the negative gain is gain by absence and the positive gain is regaining his natural abilities after all so he may not notice the change unless he mocks up what was wrong with him last week so dont expect your pc always to be telling you what wonderful auditor you are that is bank phenomenon that will destimulate in three to ten days the persons increased awareness may not be all pleasant he can look at some dynamic or sphere of existence and see it clearly with shock the common denominator of behavior is degree of awareness that is what is held in common by all life there is such thing as being aware or not aware it is all degrees of awareness gradient like all the scales the difference between person and person b is degree of awareness or awareness of different things there are certain things of which one would become aware in order to get or as one got case advance if you skip one or two or three of those you cant become aware of this higher one lrh plotted the scale of awareness to get the bridge down to homo sapiens not having noticed the gap that he had created between himself and the lowlevel pc that is how he got thirtytwo levels of awareness below level 0 he suddenly found himself looking at the human race and it was horrible shock it felt weird he got over it in about twentyfour hours realizing that if you could deal with the average public pc you could process dog you are at least ten or twelve levels below communication with the average public pc the problem is how do you process when you dont have comm line another problem is that as someone comes up in awareness he goes through antisocial bands as well as inoffensive ones there are bands amongst them that are passive and propitiative these are resting places in which society doesnt worry about you ie it doesnt try to suppress you these lower levels are jammed together and it is bit hard to tell the order down near the bottom the awareness scale measures what person could become aware of if you find person anyplace on the awarenessscale then the next action which you have to do to give him case gain is to make him aware of the next level above that for instance someone below suffering might have case gain by being made to suffer you wouldnt necessarily process him up to this awareness the lowest type of process you would use is mimicry he would be aware that he was doing it because you were doing it awareness is always matter of increasing perimeter of reality you get concentric circles of awareness for instance psycho is only aware out to his fist beyond that is delusion awareness can invert and increase into delusion which puzzles you since the person seems to be getting nuttier delusion is inverted awareness youve got to increase his awareness in the direction of sanity or reality process in the direction of something real person who is improving gets more and more aware of what is going on inside wider and wider perimeter you could get guy aware of wall two feet in front of his face and it could be vast improvement you can do this with 8c increasing the distance to the wall when the pc touches it communication begins to come in you can have action without awareness ie you can have the situation where what the individual is aware of and what he is doing are not the same thing ever hence you get longterm headaches therefore the observation of conduct will not diagnose person unless you have little secret awareness scale of your own in other words youd have to know the secret of what the mest universe dictates as gradient scale of awareness observation of conduct will not lead to solution of the situation and man falls down in thinks that it will the field of psychology etc being entirely based on observation and labelling of conduct comes up with inaccurate diagnoses and messedup solutions you cant watch patient and decide that he is gymnastico potico and firebug who is compulsively attracted to water on that account the reason this girl keeps going to the water fountain is because she is thirsty she may be stuck in french foreign legion engram in the sahara therefore the remedy might have nothing to do with water fire etc the moment you grasp this principle you get the stable datum dont draw and conclusions from conduct all unexpected conduct tells you is that you dont know about something but that is something to know labelling is bad science and leads to solution all science is is the discovery that or all science had to find out to become science is that when something isnt working you havent got the answer this explains the advance of the physical sciences the mental sciences got parked by substituting authoritarian statements for searching for workable answer if as an auditor you base what you do on what the pc is doing you will go nuts too for instance if the pc is nattering and the auditor agrees with the natter and takes the pcs data as truth nothing happens conduct can be used only as an indicator that since the pc is behaving in some way that you didnt expect there is something about him that you didnt know that you can ask the pc regardless of whether it is missed withhold or not what dont i know about you will resolve the situation labelling it wont never just label conduct that you dont understand know that you dont know what is going on and find out also consider what the pc can find out about himself the nuttier someone is the harder he is to handle he is less aware and you are less aware of what you dont know about him also the nuttier the pc is the harder it is to get his attention so that you can find out what he is aware of and what is going on and what you dont know the dont knows are fabulous you have to push to get the person to become aware enough to get him high enough on the awareness scale so that you can find out enough so you can find out what you dont know about the person the game would be what can i find out about this person and what can he find out about himself by increasing that awareness scale the person will get saner and saner more and more aware more and more himself he can hit dynamic situations which he becomes aware of with shock you have to eat humble pie to begin this subject at all you have to know that there is something in the universe you dont know and that for person who is way down scale is the most dangerous utterance that he could possibly make he is so totally sealed off from things that if everyone realized how blind he was he thinks theyd just eat him up so he compensates for his unawareness by automatic mechanisms of pretense he lacks the courage to say well i dont know anything about that and yet he cant resolve any situation until he says well whaddya know ive got an area where i dont know therefore when you see somebody behaving oddly the only thing you know is that theres something youre certainly unaware of and that he is probably unaware that he is unaware of hell cover that up with pretended awareness which doesnt exist ie delusion having gone through despair on the subject person can come up to realization that there is something you can know about anything you confront you can know that you dont know and that is the first thing you should know about it now you can take the action necessary to find out and in the process of finding out the whole thing will clarify the amazing thing about aberration is that if you did find out about something eg the internal government of russia it would either go clear or collapse just finding out what situation is asises that situation running an engram out of an organization or an individual is just continuing to pull into view what people didnt know about the individual or organization the only way in which you could fail to pull something into view is to suppose that you knew all there was to know about it and that there was nothing more to learn clear has become broadly aware of where he is unaware when he spots something like this he decides that 1 he should find out or 2 it doesnt make any difference you can decide whether it is worth finding out and if you do start finding out it will collapse
