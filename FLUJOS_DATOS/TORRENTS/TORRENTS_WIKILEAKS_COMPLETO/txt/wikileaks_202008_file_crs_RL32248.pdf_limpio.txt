refined from crude oil industrial reside ntial and commercial activities as well as electri city generation use petroleu mbased products along with volatile changes in crude oil prices the i ndustry has faced evolvi ng health safety and environmental require ments which have chan ged and multiplied product specifications and required capital investment in refineries since the late 1990s the industry has unde rgone significant structural change which might alter its profita bility requirements its ability to provide stable product volumes to the consuming market and its ability to adapt to current and future environmental requirements two significant structural changes characterize the industry mergers acquisitions and joint ventures have chan ged the ownership profile of the industry altering concentration patte rns both regionally and nationally change in the business model from an integrated compone nt to standalone profit center has focused attention on earning competitive pr ofit rates at each stage in the production chain evidence suggests that the new market structure and business model might demand better economic performance from the industry regulatory compliance to meet congressionally mandate d environmental standard s both on refined products and refinery sites requires substantial capita l investment by refi ners and has resulted in reduced profitability according to the energy information administration eia to the extent that continued capacity ex pansion and technologi cal investments are reduced or not undertaken because of low historical rates of return even though recent returns are higher us depe ndence on imported re fined products might increase or product markets could be di srupted by shortages and price spikes as the

in the transportati on residential commerc ial and industrial sectors of the economy in 2007 over tw thirds of refinery output went to transportation uses nearly quarter went to industrial uses nd the remainder was used in residences comme rcial activities and elect ricity generation the transportation sector remains the most h eavily dependent on petroleum drawing over 95 of its fuel needs from refineries because the refining industry plays such key role in providing energy for the us economy its structure and economic c ondition are matters of national interest in recent years the industry has undergone significant change the traditional industry model based on ownership by ve rtically integrated oil companies with profitability viewed within the context of linked supply chain has been altered by companies and joint ventures whose primary business is refining increasingly the business model for these firms as well as the integrated oil companies is the stand alone profit center refiners now must earn market rates of return for investors as well as returns sufficient to make investments in expansion technological improvements possible business restruct uring and to meet environmental regulations both with respect to refine d product specifications and refinery site operations and expansion should the industry fail to meet thes marketbased pe rformance standards policy makers may be faced with the prosp ect of weighing the costs and benefits of decisions taken to mitigate s upply and price volatility especially in gasoline markets if the industry determines that it is unable to invest sufficiently to meet projected demand increases additional s upplies of refined pr oducts will likely be imported if imports were to increase significantly policy makers might need to prioritize the needs of the local markets with in the context of national energy security goals the ability of the refining indus try to meets its economic challenges will likely determine in part the nature of the energy challenges facing congress this report seeks to describe the recent performan ce of the refining industry to evaluate the structural changes that ar occurring in the industry nd to analyze the nature and effects of the challenges confronting the industryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32248crs2 refining economics when considering the economic performan ce of petroleum refiner several characteristics should be noted first the production process is capital intensive and technological improvements ar embodied through investment s in the basic refinery as result any circumstan ce which affects the availab ility or allocation of capital investment can have significant structur effects on the firm and the industry second the major variable cost in the pr oduction process is crude oil the price of which is determined in the world petroleum market third while labor and other variable costs are relatively small fractions of total costs great deal of attention is given to minimizing them in the interests of enhancing profit margins finally regulatory costs both capital and opera tional required to meet congressionally mandated environmental sta ndards on both refined produc ts and refinery sites increase as new requirements are phased in evaluating the economic performance of the petroleum refining industry is complicated by the fact that many refineries can use crude oil of lower quality as an input while others cannot crude oil can be of lighter or heavier density as well as having higher or lower sulfur content the density of the crude oil is important because in general lighter crude oil i nput yields lighter product mix lighter product mix is important because lighter products are generally in higher demand and yield higher prices for the refiner does this mean then that refineries th at are able should always use the lightest crude oil available not necessarily if the crude oil market pricing mechanism is working well the market compensates for differences in the quality of crude oil by price differential the lightheavy price spread however at any given time the actual specific spread value for any set of crude oils is also influenced by relative availability on the world market as well as the location of the oil as result the value of the spread changes and at any given time the purchase of either light or heavy crude might be warranted by economic conditions if technologically feasible for the refiner table 1 shows the behavior of the lightheavy price spread over time measured in constant dollars following historic peak in the late 1970s the spread dropped sharply with the general collapse in the pr ice of oil in the mid1980s in the early 1990s the spread increased relative to the low values of the late 1980s and as result during the 1990s us refiners invest ed heavily in technologies that allowed the use of heavier crude oil inputs thes investments led to stronger demand for heavy crude oil effectively raising its price and reducing the magnitude of the spread as well as the profit potential of those investments during the recent period of increased crude oil prices from 2004 th rough 2007 the spread between light and heavy oils has again increased reaching r ecord levels in 2006 by january 2008 the spread had increased to 1879 another reco rd in the longer term it may well be that the relative quantities of light and heavy crude oils available on the market will continue to shift toward the heavier oils this shift if it continues might still validate the financial investments made by refiners in the 1990s and encourage additional investment in refinery enhancementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32248crs3 1 energy information administration pet roleum marketing monthly

april 2008 table 4 p 13 the most advantageous market position fo r complex refinery that has invested in the capability to produce light product mix from heavy crude input is large price spread between light and heavy crude and also large spread between light and heavy products in that environment s imilar to that observed in 2007 refiner can buy heavy crude to minimize direct input costs and sell light product mix at relatively high prices to enha nce the gross margin per barrel the potential for economic gain represented by these two price spreads form the incentive for investing in more complex processing units in the refining process while these units enhance economic performance they require substantial capital investment usually billions of dollars in 2005 refinery capital expenditures by the financial reporting system frs companies in the united states totaled 15 bi llion up from 81 billion in 2004 likely reflecting th high returns earned by refiners in 2004 as well as other factors2 however in 2006 refinery investment declined to 11 billion decline of 27 when compared to 2005 additionally 57 billion was spent by the frs companies in foreig n refinery capital expenditures in 2006 anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32248crs5 3 energy information administration performance profiles of major energy producers 2006 december 2007 table 16 data and charts 4 the frs companies are those major energy companies that report to the energy information administrations financial reporting system frs to be included as major energy company the firm must satisfy at leas t one of the following control at least 1 of us crude oil production or reserves control at least 1 of us natural gas production or reserves or control at least 1 of us crude oil distillation capacity or product sales in 2001 the frs companies share of refined product output was 85increase of 883 not all of this amount was for technological improvements or capacity expansion environmental ba sed investment is also included4 an additional factor in refining economic s is crude oil sulfur content defined to also include the presence of heavy metals and contaminants low sulfur crude oil is said to be sweet while crude oil with high sulfur content is said to be sour low sulfur crude oil sells at premium compared to higher sulfur crude oil because substantial investment must be made at th refinery to reduce the sulfur content of the product mix these two factors crude oil density and sulf ur content taken together determine the quality differential in crude oil prices at any point in time refiners strive to run an optimal mix of crude oils through their refineries the optimal mix depends on the state of the re fineries equipment and technology the desired output product mix and the price spreads on available crude oils and products in the longer term the refiner mu st decide whether to continue to invest in new technologies as they become availa ble based on expected future values of these factors defining profitability measures of economic performance in th refining industry usually begin with the gross margin the gross margin is defined as the difference between the wholesale composite product price and th composite refiner acquisition cost of crude oil both the product price and th acquisition cost of crude oil must be composites or weighted averages because they reflect the multiproduct nature of refinery output as well as the multigrade character of the crude oils used as refinery inputs the gross margin is simple firs t approach to refinery profitability it is computed as the total revenues from product sa minus the cost of the largest single input in refinery operations crude oil ho wever other inputs are used and they too generate costs which leads to the net margin the net margin is defined as the gross margin minus petroleum produc t marketing costs internal energy costs and other operating costs both margins are usua lly expressed on per barrel basis over time crude oil prices have been volatile reflecting international political and economic events both margins normally respond inversely to movements in the price of crude oil other things held qual an increase in crude oil prices would reduce positive margin and decline in the price of oil would expand the margin of course other things are rarely equal changes in the price of crude oil may be passed on to consumers of pe troleum products however refiners ability to pass on price increases and maintain sales volumes may not be equal for each component of the product mix produced by th refinery as result in practice margins mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32248crs6 5 the eia in compiling frs data defines return on investment as net income earned by the us marketingrefining line of business excluding unallocated items mainly interest expense as percentage of net fixed assets involved in us refining and marketingincrease or decrease when the price of oil increases additionally in some cases the event which accounted for the change in cr ude oil prices might itself alter specific product demand levels for example when ex pectations concerning the onset of war in iraq drove up crude oil prices they also reduced the demand for air travel and hence jet fuel lower demand for air travel made it difficult for refiners to pass on cost increases of crude oil while maintaining sales volumes for jet fuel as result of these factors margins are not stable or even predictable during periods of crude oil price volatility the outcome tends to depend on the nature and magnitude of the crude oil price change as well as the level of demand in the product markets over time persistently low margins may have important consequences for the industry low margins may lead to re duced refinery inves tment which ultimately can lead to constrained domestic capacity and higher product prices but low margins also put pressure on refiners to reduce operating costs and spread fixed costs over larger production runs in an effort to enhance margins the relationships between crude oil quality product price mix and technological improvement make capital i nvestment management important to the refining industry in refining there ar several competing mands for investment funds capacity expansion is necessary to keep pace with growing demand siting new refinery is long and expensive pr ocess as result virtually all us capacity expansion in the last decade or more has come from enhancing and modifying existing refineries technolog ical investments can improve refinery economics by allowing refiners to use cheap er heavy sour crude oils as inputs and still produce light high value mix of products finally investment must be undertaken to keep both the refinery site and the products it produces in compliance with evolving environmental standards the issues rrounding refinery investment are covered later in this report the most widely used measure of econo mic performance in the refining industry is return on investment roi5 as with the gross and net margins assessing this measure requires care first refining returns are usually reported together with returns from marketing largely determined by motor vehicle gasoline retail sales marketing net income can also be affect ed by credit card business performance and convenience store profits neith er of which is directly associated with the core business of refining petroleum produc ts second depending on accounting procedures and transfer pricing rules an integrated oil company might report profit as earned in various business activities of the company contrasted to company whose only business is refining third preciation reduces the net value of assets over time creating an upward bias in roi over time for any specified level of net income fourth business strategy decisi ons such as whether to distribute products at the retail level through companyowned rvice stations or through franchises can alter the measured roi by affecting the invested capital basehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32248crs7 performance of the refining industry table 3 provides historical data on refini ng

reflect refinery ec onomics emerge from the data underlying these margins first general operating co sts declined by about 50 percent over the period the refining industry has exerted significant effort in controlling cost and enhancing efficiency second energy cost s related to the pr oduction process within the refineries have declined this is the result of significant effort by the refining industry to harness waste energy and appl it to productive purpose in the interest of reducing costs for most of the period th combination of volatile prices for crude oil and refined products offset the increases in efficiency imple mented at refineries yielding low and volatile margins af ter 2002 the financial performance of the industry was enhanced by the rising petrol eum product prices in

price of crude oil which is weighted average of the prices refiners paid for domestic as well as imported crude oil 7 economists define demand to be inelastic when specified change in price say 1 increase yields decline in quantity demanded of less than one percent petroleum product demand is more elastic in the longer term as consumers are more able to adjust their decisions to the higher pricesinstability in other oil producing parts of the world6 while motor gasoline demand for 2004 increased by about 1 the price of gasoline increased by about 24 jet fuel demand increased by about 4

6 overall refined pr oduct revenues for the frs co mpanies increased by about 26 from 2004 to 2005 and total refined product costs rose by almost 21 data for 2005 and 2006 suggest much st ronger financial performance for the refining industry crude oil prices based on the refiners average composite acquisition cost averaged over 50 per barrel in 2005 and ove r 60 per barrel in 2006 this led to dramatic spikes in mo tor gasoline prices and other petroleum product prices the airline industry has c ontinued to show weak demand for jet fuel but the cold winter periods increased th demand for heating oil and diesel fuel demand continued to increase in the s hort term the demand for most petroleum products appears to be relatively inelastic with respect to price meaning that the rising cost of crude oil can be passed on to consumers with little loss in sales volume yielding high net income for refi ners when oil prices are high7 table 5 provides an overview of profitability for the refining and marketing sectors of the frss companies measur ed by roi the values for roi are complicated by the joint reporting of refining and marketing as noted earlier in this report these two sectors have different capital intensities and different age profiles for their capital stocks leading to differing values of invested capital net of depreciation the data shown in table 5 are somewhat at odds with other measures of industry activity especially those relate d to capital investment even though roi has become negative twice in the data set production rates and industry capacity continue to expand suggesting that an in centive for capital investment exists how might this behavior be explained for the integrated oil companies even though profit rates might have been low and volatile in refining and marketing it is possible that the firm as whole made adequate returns from other parts of the business notably the production of crude oil however this explanation is not consistent with the profit center business model the industr appears to be adopting for the non integrated oil refiners who constitute rger component of the industry since the wave of merger and acquisition activity of the late 1990s this explanation is not applicable the data in the table 5 indicate that in 2000 roi in domestic refining and marketing was 96 rising to 145 fo r 2001 an increase in the rate of return of over 50 the declining margins of 2002 left the roi in the negative range for that year the first negative returns since 1992 for 2003 the frs

1973 to 1981 in 1973 there were 268 refineries with capacity of 1364 million ba rrels per day in the us and by 1981 there were 324 refineries with capacity of 1862 million barrels per day as

refineries declined by over 50 while the total capac ity of the sector declined by about 8 ownership of refining assets has changed as well table 8 shows the top twenty us refiners rated by cap acity several observations can be made about this table first in 1980 ownership of refineries was rgely held by the major integrated us oil companies in 2006 significant fore ign ownership existed including british petroleum plc the fourth largest refiner and pdv america subsidiary of the venezuelan national oil company second the period since 1981 has seen significant merger and acquisition activity within the us oil industry as oil companies sought to acquire expanded crude oil reserves as well as other assets through acquisition and merger with other firms as result of rgers acquisitions and corporate strategy the ownership of many speci fic refineries has changed hands even though the total capacity of the corporate entity has remained relatively stable for example the bayway refinery in linden new jersey with current capacity of 238000 barrels per day was owned by exxonmobil but is now owned by conocophillips conoco and phillips petroleum were separate companies in 2001 third the industry now has significant capacity operated by firms that are not integrated oil companies at all but specialize in only part of the petr oleum supply chain fourth specific joint venture organizations eg motiva enterp rises have been created to engage specifically in refining joint ventures have become common because they allow for significant cost and risk reductions thr ough asset sharing and rationalization but do not require the financial and institutional stresses of more direct union through merger or acquisition httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32248crs14 table 8 top twenty us

section viii table 11 october 2007 the characteristics of the refining indus try suggest that significant structural change has occurred over the past twenty years much of that change can be attributed to the forces of economic rationalization rather than to economic decline however even if it can be determined that the industrial structure today is stronger than that of the past it still may be that the industry is not fully capable of meeting the challenges of the future one of the most obvious structural ch anges undergone by the industry is the number and size of available refineries clearly the numbe r of refineries has sharply decreased three factors play role in explaining the decline the end of government regulation technological devel opments and economic reality the emergency petroleum allocation act of 1973 pl 93 159 attempted to ensure an equitable distribution of petrol eum products establish equitable prices and preserve the independent sector of th oil industry at time when oil market relationships were in disa rray after the oil embargo of 1973 through its supplier purchaser rule the buysell program and the crude oil entitlement program all of which tried to protect small indepe ndent refiners the act had the effect ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32248crs15 10 energy information administration the us petroleum refining industry in the 1980s october 1990 p 6increasing the incentive to build and own small refineries many of which were inefficient between 1973 and 1981 there wa s net expansion of 43 refineries 75 newly constructed 32 old units closed all but two of the new refineries had an input capacity of less than 50000 barrels per day which was the average refinery size in 1973 the average capacity of the new re fineries that came on line over the period was 14900 barrels per day the utilization rate of the refinery sector declined during the expansion phase in 1973 the capacity utilization ra was 939 but by 1981 it had fallen to 686 the industry wa s characterized by idle capacity too many producers and many refineries too small to benefit from economies of scale in addition many of the small refineries were very simple distillation facilities unsuited to produce the product slate requi red by the market and environmental requirements as result good porti on of the output of these facilities was only suited to serve as feedstock for larger tec hnically sophisticated re fineries president reagan ordered the elimination of the allocation programs that favored the small refiners in 1981 and since then the i ndustry has responded to market forces10 technological and economic rationale s for the decline in the number of refineries are linked the ma rket for petroleum products has become heavily skewed toward lighter product mix mainly gasoline to serve demand from the transportation sector lighter product mixes are primarily produced by adding additional technical processing units downstream from the basic distillation procedure the technology and economics of the industry suggest that investment in those downstream facilities is only rational for large scale plants due to significant economies of scale the net effect of these factors may be that the smaller number of larger refineries operating in 2006 are economically and technologically better prepared to meet the requirements of the market than the earlier structure even with far fewer refineries and smaller total capacity although foreign ownership of refineries on us soil has increased this may be the result of continuing process of interna tionalization of the oil industry us major oil companies have long had pres ence in all aspects of the industry around the world they have brought quality products as well as technological expertise and investment to many countries today with the largest oil companies even more international in character than in the past the united states is receiving share of the products technology and inves tment that us oil comp anies provided and continue to provide around the world threat to us supply security related to foreign ownership might be possible if the owner of the refineries was controlled by foreign governments with oil supply as well as hostile intentions to the united states but this does not seem to be the case in the present pattern of ownership beyond the number of firms and their productive capacity and the extent of foreign ownership another im portant part of the structur of the refining industry is the degree of concentration concentrati on

of environmental compliance costs on us refining profitability 19952001 may 2003challenges facing the refining industry historically the major oil companies treated the refining activity as an integrated part of production stream that ran from exploration to final retail sale of petroleum products one implication of th is business model was that the refining sector was not necessarily considered to be standalone profit center refinery profits or losses could be integrated with other parts of the business this model has changed in the 2000s to one requiring each component of the supply chain to pull its own weight or generate sufficient profitability to satisfy investors requirements for return on invested capital this changed business model results at least partly from the entrance into the refining market of large independent companies whose major interest in the petroleum industr is downstream refining and marketing14 given the place of refined products in th economy earning sufficient return on invested capital in the refining industry shoul d be possible after all the industrys output is largely characterized by products that are essential to modern life motor gasoline diesel fuel jet fuel and othe r products whose dema nd has generally been growing the industry has also made si gnificant progress in controlling operating costs although the most significant cost that of crude oil is beyond its control the basic challenge to the industry is to main tain competitive roi at the same time that adequate capital is allocated to technolog ical improvements refinery expansion is undertaken to meet forecaste d increases in demand and i nvestments to keep refinery products and sites cons istent with environmental ws and regulations are made15 if the refining industry is successful in m eeting this challenge more stable market will likely prevail if industry is unsucce ssful in meeting this challenge the market is more likely to experience instability char acterized by supply disruptions and price spikes as well as an increasing dependen ce on foreign supplies of refined products environmental requirements from refiners point of view most environmental require ments whether they affect product specification or site compliance affect bus iness operations in similar manner they require capital investment in additional stages or technical processes to be added to the refinery the inves tment process begins with certification and permit approval with regulatory agencies and ultimately moves to design and construction at the refinery to implement the new processes some of the current or expected product specificati on requirements that are likel to affect refiners over the next several years include reduced sulfur content

recognize that they all have similar impact on the refining industry they require an allocation of resources to capital investment that does not result in lower costs or increased output and are therefore likely to affect th ability of th industry to meet economic performance expectations capital investment capital expenditures in the refining indus try serve variety of purposes first they may augment capacity or upgrade t echnological capability either through the construction of new refineri or through the modifica tion of existing refineries second they may be required to allow both or either the produced products or the site itself to meet environmental requirements third capital expenditures may be used for mergers and acquisitions as discussed earlier in this report there has been significant investment in new refineries in the united states in the past twenty five years however investment has taken place to enhance the capacity of ex isting facilities investment in capacity expansion and technology is exp ected to generate pr ofits enhancing the net margin and yielding positive roi environmental investments are different they are required to allow the refinery to stay in operation but they yield little or direct financial return for th refiner they are either absorbed from profits or passed on to the consumer or both since they in crease the capital value of the refinery but yield net revenue they can reduce th overall roi depending on cost pass through to the consumer capital expenditure for merger and ac quisition has dominated the investment picture in the refining indus try since the late 1990s these expenditures are made for variety of reasons from entering or expa nding firms presence in the industry to rationalizing refining strate gy to production and marketing goals or by legal directive as in conjunction with the stipulations to complete merger or acquisition firms expect these expenditures also to be profitable at least in the longer term even though refining and marketing prof itability has grown with the oil price increases since 2004 the profit and cash rich position of integrated oil companies and domestic refining companies may not translate into capital investment in the refining sector the choice to invest in new refinery is actually decision to produce an additional barrel of refined petroleum products for the us market growth in product demand especially gasoline sugges ts that the demand for the additional product is fairly certain the question remains what is the cheap est way to provide that extra

refine ry of another company the fundamental economics as well as the market and regulatory environments suggest that all other things equal construction of new refineries is not likely to be the chosen alternative over the past two decades refiners have chosen to expand existing refineries in preference to new construction the reasons are part economic and part regulatory economic rationales favor ex pansion over new constructi on because the fixed cost associated with new facility can be avoi ded and economies of scale at the expanded facility can be realized satisfying regulatory requirements for an expansion at an existing facility are likely to be less costly less time consuming and less subject to challenge by local groups compared to new facility given the economics of the oil market it may remain cheaper to import extra petroleum products than to produce them in the united states excess capacity for gasoline that meets us specifications is av ailable in europe nd other parts of the world similarly it may also be cheaper for any given company to expand its refining capacity by purchasing assets from other companies while this strategy may improve the supply position of the acqui ring firm it does little to improve the supply position of the us market as whole special circumstances may justify construction of new facility such facility is planned for cons truction

of investment cited is large and significant uncertainty remains concerning actual values if accurate there could be some concern that environmentally based claims on capital expenditure might crowd out other investments in that case investment in capacity expansion might not be funded even though potentially profitable that lack of investment could drive up capacity utilization rates even higher which would likely increase the fragility of the market and make it more open to price volatility and quantity disruption the strength of the crowdingout argument diminishes when the rapid increase in capital expenditure shown in figure 1 for mergers and acquisitions from 1999 to 2001 is considered clearly the ability to rais capital either in the form of debt or equity must have been available to the industry to fund the pproximately threefold increase in investment from 1999 to 2001 much of it to finance mergers and acquisitions the ability of the industry to manage and balance its capital investment budget between competing claims may well be an important dete rminant of how well the industry is able to meet increasing mand with new envir onmentally compatible capacity production and growth in its reference case forecast the eia projects that refined products consumed will increase from 207 million barrels per da in 2004 to 227 million barrels per day in 2015 and 269 million barrels per day in 203022 this growth implies an average annual growth rate of 11 over the period another way of looking at the projected growth is to note that if it were to be met by domestic refining capacity it would require capacity increments of approxima tely 238000 barrels per day per year this would be equivalent to the production capaci ty of one new large refinery an additional similarly sized refi nery would have to be dded to the capacity base each year to meet projected market requirements alternatively capacity expansion based on technological improvements w ould have to continue at high rate for the 26year period set against this forecast of increasing demand is the incrementally increasing capacity of the industry as well as the dec lining number of refineries the last new refinery to open in the united states was th petro star refinery in valdez alaska in 1993 which had an original capacity of 38000 barrels per da and was simple refinery the last refinery of

open in the united states was the ma rathon refinery in garyville louisiana which opened in 1977 more than 30 years ago23 with this historical record construction of new 400000 barrelperday capacity refinery per year to meet projected demand growth would app ear to be major challenge several factors come into play in the re fining industrys plan to meet forecasted market requirements even though new refineries were constructed during the 1990s and the number of refineries decline d refinery capacity increased on average 15 per year if projected into the future this growth is sufficient to meet the eia long term forecast of demand increases for refined products these increases in capacity are due to investment in new pr ocessing units marginal expansion known as capacity creep obtained through bottleneck removal and more intensive use of existing capacity by lengthening time between maintenance and overhaul this type of expansion ultimately coul d encounter diminishing returns although the record of the industry suggests that even more capacity might be squeezed out of the existing stock of refineries another key factor in maintaining pr oduction is capacity u tilization capacity utilization rates remain hi gh approximately 93 in 2003 and almost 91 in 2002 the capacity utilization rate has remained above 90 every year since 1993 excess capacity is luxury refiner seems anxi ous to support because of its effect on profitability this view is borne out by executives who participated in the rand study24 imports with capacity utilization rates near maximum new refinery construction likely and growth through capacity creep less than the growth in eia projected demand imports of petroleum products would seem to play an increasingly important role in the supply of refined products refined product imports mostly from canada the caribbean and europe have been an important component of the total supply equation for some years in 2006 petroleu m product imports of all types totaled about 35 million barrels per day which am ounted to approximately 17 of total product supplied to the us market import dependence on re fined products has averaged approximately 6 of

while the increase in motor gasoline and blending components is 223 imported petroleum products other than gasoline and gasolin blending components include wide variety of distillate fuel oils jet fuel liquefied petroleum gases residual fuel oil unfinished oils and other products several difficulties could emerge as increased reliance is placed on imports the first issue is sourcing if worldwide economic growth continues to remain sluggish an excess of world refining cap acity could persist and the us market might well continue to find product available european sources accounted for over 50 of motor vehicle gasoline and 40 of gasoline blending component imports in 2007 continued availability of european st ocks at volumes co mparable or greaterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32248crs25 than these levels may not be sustainable europe is undergoing transformation of its transportation fuels mix while its refinery capacity is largely oriented toward gasoline production due to past investment decisions the european vehicle fleet is rapidly moving toward diesel fuel the implication is that until refinery conversion is completed european refine rs will have an excess supply of gasoline to sell on the world market as result the long term availability of european supplies of gasoline may diminish as the us demand for gasoline continues to grow slow growth in the asian economies excluding china continue s to hold back the growth of demand for gasoline in the region before the financ ial crisis in 1997 asian gasoline growth rates were the highest in the world until economic recovery is complete and demand growth comparable to precrisis levels returns the asian market is also likely to have excess refining capacity n ear term sourcing of imports then from europe as well as asia seems relatively secu re in the longer term structural change in the european fuel mix and the recovery of asian demand growth may limit available imports the second factor influencing the viability of increased reliance on imports is the segmented nature of the us gasoline market gasoline in the united states is longer fungible or easily

specification is tight even though gasoline of other specifications might be available as the large us market is divided into smaller submarket s that demand fuels not required in other regions or other parts of the world it might become difficult to find refiners on the world market willing to customize production to satisfy particular us demands the result can be that spot shortages and price spikes similar to those that occurred in chicago in 2002 in conjunction with the limination of mtbe as gasoline additive availability as well as price considerations suggest that if gasoline were standardized commodity rather than sp ecialized good it would be less likely to be linked to local market instability final factor regarding imports has to do with long and short run matching of demand and supply the eia forecast indi cates long term need for imported refined products mainly gasoline and bl ending components recently there has been growing market in very short run target of opportunity cargoes of refined products that is an almost speculative market has develope d in which tanker might load cargo without firm buyer at port where gasoline is available at an attractive price the owner of the cargo then directs the tanker to the port at which the best price might be earned on the one hand this type of activity represents market forces directing supply to areas with high demand on the other hand the process may represent somewhat opport unistic and uncertain way of securing supplies it is not hard to imagine s cenario where this type of supply dependency might periodically lead to market disruptions complete with shortages and price spikes permits and regulatory uncertainty an important concern of the refining industry is largely administrative and regulatory as noted earlier in this report the refining industry is working within long term program of implementing congressionally mandated environmentalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32248crs26 25 dj peterson and sergej mahnovski new forces at work in refining rand science and technology p 85 26 ibid p 7079 27 ibidstandards some see the regu lated environment as an oppor tunity some participants in the rand study noted that regulations fo rmed barrier to entry into the market the result might be higher profits for whic h they cite california refiners who are faced with the most stringent set of federal state and local environmental regulations in the nation and yet operate the most profitable refineries in the nation25 in general however the rand study reports significan t concern in the industry regarding the administration and implementation of the regulatory process26 according to the rand study the best case regulatory process from the industrys point of view is one that min imizes uncertainty and maximizes flexibility the industrys preference is to see regu latory roadmap laid out which covered an adequately long planning horizon say decad they would like to see plan where regulations contradict or compete with one another they would like to see phasing in of regulations in manner that minimizes pressure put on construction or investment timetables and plans they would like to see smooth timely permitting process in which administra tive delays are minimized i ndustry would also prefer to have flexibility in how technologically to meet environmental standards27 conclusions the petroleum refining industry forms critical infrastructure in the us economy it provides products which allow america to move whether by air land or sea but it must accomplish this while maintaining national and regional environmental standards the industry has demonstrated that this is possible there has been minimal market disruption that can be traced to the refining sector over the past twenty years however the eia annual energy forecast 2006 suggests that the industry is unlikely to be able to mainta in this performance over the planning period to 2030 without the domestic market becoming significantly more dependent on imported motor gasolines and blending co mponents increased import dependency implies the potential for both supply disrupti on as well as national energy security concerns the eia has found that the legacy of past environmental requirements on the industry have been substantially reduced ro i the industry has been able to absorb these lower rates of return in the past largely because of the ownership structure of the industry and the associated business mode l new market structure and business model might implicitly require better economic performance from the industry to the extent that the performance of roi negatively affects decisions concerning continued capacity expansion and technological investment in the industry the effect of the structural changes in the indus try might have nati onal energy policy implications
