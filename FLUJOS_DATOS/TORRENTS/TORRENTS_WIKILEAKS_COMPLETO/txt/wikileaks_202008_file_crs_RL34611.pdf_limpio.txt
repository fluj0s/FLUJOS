analysis introduction conference committees have long been known as the third house of congress in bicameral legislature like the us congress they are usually the principal forum for reconciling major bills passed in di ssimilar form by the two houses these bicameral units often write the final vers ion of major measures that both chambers will vote upon as one senator said conferences are where the final touches are put on legislation which constitute s the laws of the country1 house member stated lets face it the conference committee is where it all happens2 r s congressional scholar put it in the legislative process all roads lead to the conference committee3 current developments suggest however that the third house characterization might require modification it is not th at conference committees are unimportant it is that another method for adjusting and reconciling bicameral differences on significant legislation s taken on greater prominence in the contemporary congress this method is the exchan ge of amendments or messages4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34611crs2 4 continued house amendments thereto see floy d m riddick and alan s frumin senate procedure precedents and

made during clos ed bargaining sessionsbetween the houses the socalled ping pong procedure some lawmakers even state that conferences are becoming thing of the past member of the senate noted processing bills by exchanging messages amendments with the house is becoming the norm rather than the excep tion formal conferences are becoming rare5 if the conference committee is being somewhat eclipsed by the ping pong procedure as an important way to achieve bicameral reconciliation on consequential legislation that would represent an important institutional change this apparent development merits some attention and analysis accordingly this reports purposes are fundamentally twofold to examine the reasons for the heightened salience of the ping pong approach and to consider seve ral reasons for and the implications that seem to flow from using this procedure rath er than convening conferences to resolve interchamber disagreements on major legislation to fulfill these two purposes the report is organized into six sections as follows first it will provide an overview of the methods congress employs to achieve inter chamber agreement on legislation includi ng ping pongs place in the bicameral resolution process second it will brie fly discuss how each chamber gets to conference underscoring how the convening of conference committees in the senate can be effectively blocked even if majo rity of senators would agree to send the measure to conference third it will examine why there seems to be more reliance in recent years on the ping pong method in reconciling bicameral differences on significant legislation than on the conference committee route important to underscore at the outset is that informal negotiations among key bicameral actors suffuse the lawmaking process unsurprisingly confidential bargaining to achieve mutually acceptable agreements is part and parcel of both the conference committee and the amendment exchange procedure key bicameral actors typically craft policy compromises in closed session and then use the amendment exchange method to win housesenate agreement on them6 on capitol hill private negotiating sessions and discussions among house and senate members are daytoday occurrence these confid ential meetings influence lawmaking from the introduction of bill to bicameral reconciliation procedures usually are not isolated ac tions they are employed in policy political and legislative context hence the fourth section of the report provides an overview of three case examples to illustrate in concrete setting the factors that may trigger use of ping ponging over the conve ning of conference committees the threehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34611crs3 7 an amendment tree is chart or diagram that among other things shows the number and types of amendments that may be pending to measure or matter before any amendment is voted upon there are maximum number of amendments permitted by particular chart or diagram ie the tree and once that number is reached the tree is filled after that further amendments are in order until one of the socalled limbs or amendments on the tree is disposed of the senate majority leader is able to fill the tree rather easily because he is granted preferential recognition by the senates presiding officer the result the majority leader is recognized by the pr esiding officer to propose amendments backto back until tree is filled worth brief mention is that the 110th senate has reportedly witnessed more treefilling than in any other recent congress see congressional record vol 154 may 6 2008 pp s3754s3757measures are the energy independence and security act hr 6 the honest leadership and open government act s 1 and the reauthorization of the state childrens health insurance program or sc hip hr 976 brief summary of the key elements associated with ping pong ing each bill will conclude the discussion these three bills were selected because they were the only ones in 2007 where the senate majority leader employed strategic maneuver called filling the amendment tree during the bicameral resolution stage7 this procedural device is way for the majority leader to protect an informally negotiated bicameral compromise from amendment to be sure there are other significant measures where ping ponging without any treefilling has occurred in the senate the treefilling maneuver may not have been necessary or appropriate because for example the bicameral compromise enjoyed broad bipartisan support tree filling might create more legislative problems than it could solve such as arousing the ire of lawmakers who wanted to offer amendments of their own or deadline pressures prompted agreement to the bicameral accord still treefilling can sometimes be usef ul procedure in facilitating passage of priority legislation which is why these measures were chosen for examination fifth the report will discuss several reasons for and implications of ping ponging amendments backandforth betwee n the chambers instead of forming conference committees to achie ve bicameral agreement on legislation lastly summary observations will be presented including why the exchange of amendment pattern has seemingly evolve d to become more important feature of bicameral lawmaking activity achieving bicameral ignition on legislation under the constitution before measures can be sent to the white house for presidential consideration th ey must pass the house and senate with exactly the same bill number and legislative text the issue then is how to unite what the constitution divides when one chamber agrees to measure at variance with comparable bill adopted by the other house although the constitution is silent on the matter congress has vised three basic methods or procedures to achieve bicameral ignition httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34611crs4 8 there is technical limit to the number of times measures can be shuffled between the chambers the thirddegree amendment prohibition amendments to amendments to amendments are not in order applies to am endments between the house and senate this parliamentary principle can be set asid if either chamber wants to do so 9 crs report 98812 amendments betw een the houses by elizabeth rybicki 10 richard cohen national journal july 28 2001 p 2396first one house enacts unchanged the others bill most measures anywhere from 63 to around 85 percent in biennial congress are enacted into law when one chamber adopts verbatim the legislati on received from the other body one chambers deference to the other houses b ill has various explanations ranging from the lack of controversy to political nece ssity because time is running out in legislative session the hi ke over time in the percen tage of measures rubber stamped into enactment see table 1 probably reflects number of factors setting aside their noncontroversial ch aracter such as members electoral imperative the urge felt by many to claim credit for passing constituencyfocused legislation and the artful drafting of legislation to assure that it has broad bi partisan and bicameral appeal to be sure house and senate members and thei r staff aides often consult informally prior to bills introduction in either chamber to f acilitate its approval by the secondacting house without amendment the other two methods specifically deal with reconciling bicameral differences when the two chambers pass different versions of the same bill the house and senate can message or ping pong amendments backand forth between them until substantive disagreements on measur are worked out with the ping pong or exchange of amendments appr oach one chamber may adopt the other houses amendments or further modify the others amendments until both finally agree to identical language for all the provisions of the legislation8 as legislative scholar explained when the house or senate passes measure it is sent to the other chamber for further consideration if the second chamber passes the measure with one or more amendments it is then sent back to the originating chamber in modern practice the second chamber typically substitutes its version of measure as single amendment to the measure as passed by the first chamber the first chamber then may accept the amendment or propose its own further amendment in this way the measure may be message d back and forth between the house and senate in the hope that both houses will eventually agree to the same version of measure9 the ping pong method of bicameral reco nciliation is frequently used in the closing days of congress to save time wrote congressional journalist bills may be sent back and forth on an hourly ba sis until there is meeting of the minds or one side backs down or the tw chambers give up in failure10 week before christmas 2007 for example the house and nate agreed to enact the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 2008 h r 2764 with congress unable to enact 11 of 12 appropriations bills by the start of the new fiscal year october 1 2007 largely because of sharp conflicts over spending priorities between congressional democrats and president bush as well as with congressional republicans thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34611crs5 two chambers opted to use the ping pong route given clashes between democrats and republicans and lawmakers anxious to depart for the holiday season political and temporal considerations were among the factors th at prompted use of the amendment exchange method as the preferred way to reconcile interchamber differences on hr 2764 roughly 11 to 24 of public laws enacted during recent biennial congresses took the ping pong or amendments between the houses route the 12 figure for the 20052007 period as

conference committee even if some differences were resolved through amendment exchange bicameral ignition may also occur when th house and senate agree to establish conference committee each chamber selects number of conferees from the relevant committees of jurisdiction to reconcile the items in bicameral disagreement only relatively small number of public laws passed by congress anywhere from around 5 to 13 as revealed in table 1 reach the conference stage but these are often the most complex controversial and consequential on some occasions combination of the two approaches pi ng pong and conference committee or vicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34611crs6 11 until the mid1990s conferences on appropriations b ills virtually always reported number of discrete amendments in disagreeme nt by longstanding practice the house initiates appropriations bills and the senate would then adopt series of amendments to the housepassed measure appropriations conferences would report partial conference report to their respective chambers which would be agreed to then each chamber would consider the amendments still in disagreement which reflected either true policy clash or technical rule violation for example diffe rences thus appropriations conferences often observed twostep process the house would first agree to partial conference report and then address the amendments in disagreemen t both matters would then be sent to the senate which would first adopt the partial conference report and then consider the amendments in disagreement forwarded to it by the house this practice stopped after republicans captured control of congress in november 1994 longer does the senate adopt discrete amendments to housepassed appropriations bills instead the senate appropriations committee follows the practice of other standing committees by striking the entire text of the housepassed bill and replacin g it with complete substitute the senates version of the money bill one reason for the change was to expedite congressional action on appropriations measures another explan ation for the change was the increasing willingness of the house rules committee to i ssue special rules granting blanket waiver of points of order against conf erence reports as result considering senate amendments in disagreement outside the formal confer ence report because they violated various procedural rules was longer necessary fo r additional relevant material see crs report 98813 amendments in disagreement by james v saturno 12 jeffrey h birnbaum lawmakers seek shortcut in negotiating

the chambers may start out usin g the ping pong procedure but then convene conference committee to reconcile outstanding disagreements it is quite common for house and senate committee and party leaders along with relevant staff to c onduct private preconference negotiations prior to the formal convening of conference these might be characterized as v irtual conferences for example meeting behind closed doors senate and house lead ers are taking the unusual step of negotiating final bill to address the nations housing crisis even before the senate adopts its own version trying to short circuit legislative process that might otherwise drag well into the summer12 in these cases sometimes the creation of conference committee will be mo re an indication that deal is done than forum to find one13 private negotiating sessions also occur regularly as noted earlier with the exchange of amendment procedure for ex ample confidential negotiations occurred when the house passed genetic nondiscr imination measure hr 493 on april 25 2007 which the senate considered the following year april 24 the senate replaced the language in hr 493 with complete substitute and returned the bill as amended to the house where it was cleared on may 1 for presidential consideration the point is that the sena tes complete substitute was the result of informal bicameral negotiations as the ranking senator on the relevant committee of jurisdiction stated few days before the house approved the substitute it has even been preconferenced with the house si so we are pretty sure that once

we let them into the process early so that everybody would know what was happening14 ping ponging in the spotlight recently legislative analysts and others have noted an increase in the use of the exchange of amendment procedure for bicameral reconciliation difficulties in creating conference committees for severa l major bills elevated the ping pong procedure to greater prominence in resolving interchamber differences on legislation as former sena parliamentarian robert dove stated theres question that amendments between the houses has been used more today than it has in the past but thats because senators blocking legislation from going to conference has happe ned more often15 congressional scholar and former house staff director calculated the extent to which major bills were resolved by establishing conference committees or using the ping pong approach during equivalent periods of the gopcontrolled 109th congress 20052007 and the democratically controlled 110th congress 20072009 hi s study determined of major bills approved by the house and senate that required some action to resolve differences between the two versions 11 out of 19 58 percent were settled by conferences in the current congress compared with 18 out of 19 95 percent in the previous congress put another way the current 110th congress has been negotiating eight times as many bills as the 109th congress outside the conference process this is done by using the pingpong approach of bouncing amendments between the houses until final agreement is achieved16 in short the current reality is that majo r bills often cannot reach the conference stage leaving informal negotiations and am endments between the houses as the alternative methods for resolving bicam eral differences on major legislation getting to conference house and senate procedure house briefly the two mostused methods for getting to conference are unanimous consent with house rule xxii available if an objection is made and special rules from the rules committeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34611crs8 17 typically house bill with senate amendments is held at the speakers desk since senate amendments at this stage are not privileged meaning they have rightofway to the floor some other way is required to dispose of them if lawmaker objects to unanimous consent request to take them up for detailed study of resolving bicameral differences see crs report 98696 resolving legislative differences in congress conference committees and ame ndments between the houses by elizabeth rybicki 18 john v sullivan how our laws are made washington dc gpo 2007 p 25 precedents state that motions in the house to dispose of the senate amendment are not privileged and require unanimous consent or special rule from the committee on rules the only exception being motion to ask or ag ree to conference under rule xxii clause 1 see wm holmes brown and charles w johnson house practice guide to the rules precedents and procedures of the house washington dc gpo 2003 p 841 19 more specifically house rule xxii clause 1 states motion to disagree to senate amendments to house proposition and to request or agree to conference with the senate or motion to insist on house amendments to senate proposition and to request or agree to conference with the senate shall be privile ged in the discretion of the speaker if offered by direction of the primary committee and of all reporting committees that had initial referral of the propositiona routine request is for lawmaker to ask and receive unanimous consent to go to conference on measure mr speaker i ask unanimous consent to take from the speakers table the bill hr 1234 with th senate amendments thereto disagree to the amendments of the senate and as k for conference with the senate17 members request unanimous consent because senate amendments at this stage of the proceedings are not privileged meaning they cannot be called up at practically any time for immediate consideration when other business is pending18 if lawmaker objects the memb er who requested unanimous consent could then invoke clause 1 of house rule xx ii this rule permits legislation to reach conference by majority vote of the house if member of the committees of original jurisdiction typically the chair is author ized by his or her panel to offer the following

would contain language such as that upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to take from the speakers table the bill hr 1234 with the senate amendment thereto disagree to the senate amendment and ask for conference with the senate sp ecial rules are privile ged debated under the hour rule and cannot be am ended unless the previous question motion that if agreed to ends debate and requires vote on the pending matter the special rule is rejected rarely is the previous question motion defeated by vote of the house members simply put the house is an institu tion whose formal rules

conference senate unlike the majority rule principle of the house the senate is minority rule institution its rules and precedents grant large parliamentary prerogatives to each senator such as the right of extended deba as one senator exclaimed the only thing that its easy to do in the senate is slow things down the senate is 100 human brake pads20 slowing the senate down can occur even if senator merely threatens to filibuster measure or matter in todays senate there is often neither the time nor the votes to terminate dilatory debate or filibuster so talkathon threat is sometimes enough to prevent action on legislation threefifths vote of the entire membership if vacancies 60 of 100 nators as prescribed in senate rule xxii is required to end filibuster if the senate is narrowly divided and ideologically polarized it is often impossible to attract the 60 votes to convene conference it is generally the case that the majority leader or the majority floor manager will ask and receive unanimous c onsent when heshe makes this request mr president i ask unanimous consent that the senate insist on its amendments or disagree to the house amendments to the senate bill request conference with the house on the disagreeing votes thereon and that the chair be authorized to appoint conferees notice th at there are three distinguishable parts to this request insist or disagree request and authorize the appointment of conferees if lawmaker objects to the unanimous consent request then the majority leader or floor manager would have to move each st ep separately and each motion is subject to extended debate as former senate parliamentarian dove noted the three steps are usually bundled into unanimous consent agreemen t and done within seconds but if some senators do not want conference to occur and if they are determined they can force three separate cloture votes to close debate and that takes time it basically stops the whole process of going to conference21 and if cloture closure of debate as outlined in rule xxii were invoked on each part senators keen on preventing conference still could offer innumerable moti ons to instruct conferees who are

senates difficulty in convening conferences number of commonly occurring factors explains why the senate sometimes experiences delay or difficulty in getting to conference for example senate and house leaders who want or expect to go to conference may delay the appointment of conferees because there is dispute over conferee selection the number to be chosen and the party ratio at issue in these cases might be concern over the representation of diverse views in conference limiting the size of the conference delegation could block certain lawmakers from serving on the conference committee conversely increasing the number of conferees could ensure that certain members would serve on the conference committ ee party leaders too may want to conduct informal preconfer ence negotiations with the white house or house before the senate officially names conferees delay in forming conference may be tactic to pressure the other body to concede on certain policies in bicameral disagreement or delay might be form of hostage politics the naming of conferees on certain bill will not occur until the other body appoints conferees on different measure in bicameral dispute three other overlapping reasons however largely account for the contemporary senates difficulty in conve ning conferences each rits additional discussion they are the senates tradition of extended debate the filibuster the polarization that characterizes the modern senate and the exclusion of minority party conferees from participating in the bicamer bargaining process senators and extended debate the reality or threat of extended debate has long been part of the senate so why has it now come into relatively recent prominence as blocking tactic with respect to the convening of conferences thus focusing more emphasis on the ping pong method part of the answer is the rise of the i ndividualist senate congressional scholars state that senators today take for granted that they and their colleagues will regularly exploit the powers the senate rules give them they are increasingly outward directed fo cusing on their links with interest groups policy communities and the media more than on their ties to one another23 internal incentives to employ extended bate sparingly have given way to other incentives requests by outside groups to engage in dilatory actions on certain measures for example that encourage lawmakers to push their own agendas even if the senates lawmaking activities might grind to halt another part discussedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34611crs11 24 congressional record vol 140

minority senator was reported to say it would be hard to vote against lot of good th ings in the ethics and lobbying package because there are some bad things there we vote on imperfect legislation every day73 third the political circumstances made it difficult for many lawmakers to vote against an ethics and lobbying reform p ackage especially with the august work period looming and the potential for constituents asking members how they voted on what seemed like good government in itiative recall that the culture of corruption was theme used during the n ovember 2006 elections in the

conclude both parties r ecognized that public dismay with the congress over lobbying scandals combined with the pro mises made by house and senate majority party leaders to enact ethics and lobbying reforms prom pted enactment of s 1 the inability to create conference committee can be largely attributed to relatively small number of senators who were concerned that the earmark reforms they successfully championed would be dropped or diluted by the conferees thus the exchange of amendment procedure was em ployed with each chambers party leader in charge of the informal negotiating process most party members in each chamber supported the final compromise and s 1 the bill number symbolized its priority status passed with large majorities in each house reauthorization of schip hr

forwarded to the senate but that chamber took action on the bill on the day before the house passed champ july 31 the senate began consideration of its approach to reauthor izing schip the senate used house passed bill hr 976 the small business tax re lief act as the vehicle for reauthorizing schip why because the schip bill reported by the senate finance committee contained tax provisions and the constitution as noted earlier requires revenueraising measures to be initiated by the house thus when hr 976 was taken up the finance chair offered comple substitute the substitute replaced all the text in hr 976 with the measure s 1893 reported by the finance committee the senates version of the schip r eauthorization was narrower than the houses for example the senate pr oposed 35 billion

measure passed the house in close vote it easily was agreed to in the senate in part because the final version of the legislation was narrower and less costly than the houses original bill number of senators blocked the appointment of conferees because they wanted commitments that any compromise that emerged from conference would comport with their views unable to create conference committee majority party leaders turned to the ping pong method which included informal negotiati ons among limited number of house and senate majority party lawmakers along with few minority party senators their privately negotiated compromise house amendment to the senate amendment to hr 976 was subsequently agreed to by both chambers but president bush vetoed the schip reauthorization bypassing the conference stage reasons and implications the recent tendency to bypass the conf erence stage underscores that house senate interrelationships change and adapt to the broader legislativepolitical environment of which they are part compared with the 1950s or 1960s todays congress is more open partisan workload packed and deadlinedriven there are many more interest groups that influen ce and monitor legislative proceedings and individual lawmakers are not reluctant to utilize parliamentary tools to advance their objectives because these developments have sometimes made the convening of conference committees problematic the exchange of amendment procedure and the concomitant informal negotiations that accompany it has become more efficient method for resolving bicamer differences on major legislation several of the reasons for the heightened importance of the ping pong approach and the implications that flow from its us on major legislation seem directly or indirectly related to at l east six factors setting aside the earlier discussion about the relative ease of blocking the appointment of conferees in the senate the six are 1 further enhancement of the role of party leaders

executives september 19 2007 p a45committees and their leaders 3 marginal role of the minority party 4 constraints on the deliberative process 5 the avoidance of proceduralpolitical issues and 6 the lack of transparency whether these factors are causes or effect s of ping ponging or both merits brief mention because cause and effect are hard to disentangle it is probably safe to say that the six factors reflect both ingredients to one degree or another for example the apparent increase in reliance on ping ponging might be viewed as either cause or effect of enhanced party leadership influence cause because party leaders today play larger role throughout all lawmakin g stages including bi cameral negotiations the preference of party leaders in short might be to utilize amendment exchange rather than conference committees so as to better ensure the achievement of party preferred goals an effect because difficulties in creating conference co mmittees have provided central party leaders with more opportunities to step in and assume wider responsibility for reconciling bicameral diffe rences on major legislation through the ping pong and informal negotiating met hod perhaps more useful than making judgments about cause and effect is to consider whether difficulties in forming conference committees helped to encourage these six developments further enhancement of th role of party leaders by any reasonable test the four capitol hill party organizations play active roles in the lawmaking process their organizational elements party caucuses or committees for example are active party leaders are increasingly prominent and party voting is at comparatively high levels given sharp conflicts between the two parties on key policy issues and narrow ma rgins of party control rankandfile lawmakers generally recognize the need for strong leadership for their substantive and political agenda to succeed the par tisan polarization in congress contributes to strengthened party leadership especially in the house nevertheless majority party senators expect their leader to exploit majority status for partisan advantage88 if conference committees cannot be convene d because of dilatory practices or if time constraints prevent their use the principal negotiators on major legislation are often house and senate majority leaders along with limited number of other key lawmakers on schip for example house majority leaders indicated that if the senate was unabl to convene conference becau of blocking actions by various senators they would meet informally with their senate leadership counterparts to negotiate compromise as one account noted the top house and senate majority leaders met for near ly two hours working to reach final agreement on compromise schip legislation89 regardless of the reasons that preven t the convening of conference committees the exchange of amendments procedure highlights the powerful negotiating role of central party leaders they are strategically positioned to fashion major bicameral leadership compromises perhaps with little input from rankandf ile members thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34611crs29 90 it is worth noting that democratic caucus rules do not require term limits for house chairs for example it was reported recently th at majority party lawmaker pointed out that when the issue of term limits has come up in the

approach on major legislation is illustrative of the centralization of party control that characterizes the contemporary house and to lesser extent the senate in the senate majority party leader s recognize that the ping pong method avoids potential series of probably impossibletobreak fili busters associated with the appointment of conferees limits on the role of co mmittees and their leaders the drift toward centralized party authority has tightened leadership influence over committees and their chairs sixy ear term l imits for hous committee and subcommittee chairs90 as well as comparable sixyear term limits for senate republicans restrict the ability of committee chairs to accrue independent authority as occurred during earlier decades when pund its sometimes referred to the leaders of committees as the dukes or barons of capitol hill use of the ping pong procedure on the majority partys prio rities can mean that committee leaders and members exercise generally minimal influence over the compromises reached by each chambers top party leaders the aforementioned energy bill hr 6 is an example of committee members with expertise on the issue criticizing the process by which the measure was jointly assembled by each chambers majority leaders press reports indicated for example that as many as 40 democrats were reported to have signed letter of complaint to party leaders expressing their dismay at the secret development of the energy compromise91 as committee chair stated hr 6 is not the product of formal conference but rather the result of amendments being passed between the hous and senate as means of resolving the differences between their respective b ills i have noted in the past and will continue to note that i find this manner of legislating to be unsatisfactory and unwise given the difficulty experienced by the senate in going to conference on this bill this year however this process is the best that we can hope for under the circumstances one of the reasons this ping pong process is inferior to that of formal conference is the lack of conference report and thus the lack of written legislative history detailing why certain policies were adopted and others excluded92 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34611crs30 93 carl hulse in conference l process undone by partisanshiip new york times september 26 2007 p a23 94 emily pierce and

exclaimed house chair underscoring how the ping pong approach has shifte d power from house and senate committees to house and senate party leaders marginal role of the minority party just as there have been cases of minority party exclusion from conference committees as mentioned earlier the same holds true in the case of the amendment exchange method minority party members have been excluded from these bicameral negotiating sessions unless their input is sought by the leaders in charge of the back andforth amendment procedure moreover such participation is more likely to involve minority senators than minority house members the contributions of minority party senators might be important in devising product that can attract not only majority but also the supermajority vote often required to enact legislation in that chamber for exampl on the schip legislation two minority senators took part in the health talks but minority house members did93 the benefits of an interchamber bargai ning process where ll sides participate was underscored by spokesperson for hous minority leader both parties views are considered the process is likely to be perceived as fair because it comports with the regular order and stronger and more credible bicameral product is likely to be the outcome as the spokesperson explained the conference process serves to allo w members to buy into final bill sometimes there are tweaks and changes that have to be made but it allows buy in absent that kind of process youre really getting majoritydriven bill without bipartisan support94 majority party lawmakers might reply that they understand the principle of minority rights but contend that the ot her side often prefers obstructionism to cooperation so as to prevent the majority party from accomplishing its agenda as result minority lawmakers may be excluded from participating in the processes for bicameral reconciliation ironically becau the senate so metimes blocks the convening of conference co mmittees this may mean that senators who normally would be chosen as conferees are lik ely to be excluded from the ping pong negotiations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34611crs31 95 recent example of extensive debate associ ated with the amendment exchange procedure is the foreclosure prevention act hr 3221 the senate for example engaged in considerable debating and amending of the

to be achieved through deliberative or reas oned process where all major issues and views are debated and discu ssed conference process th at involves lawmakers with specialized expertise from both parties nd both chambers arguably provides for wider range of interests and preferences to be considered and debated the amendments the bi cameral compromises that are ping ponged between the houses are usually crafted in private by relatively small number of members largely from the majority party to be sure once these privately negotiated house amendments or senate amendments to legislation are taken up in each chamber there is generally time for lawmakers to debate and amend the bicameral accords95 the deliberative process however could be c onstrained in the house by special rules from the rules committee or in the senate by treefilling offering all the amendatory motions that can be pending at one time the two chambers and the two parties have their differences but rigorous and vigorous exchange of views in conference setting might better compared with the exchange of amendments method expose weaknesses in the legislation promote thorough analysis generate bipar tisan support or encourage consideration of new ideas and perspectives in the judg ment of senior h ouse minority member bypassing the conference stage increases th likelihood that you get legislation that

highlighted in the previous discussion on polarization close elections narrow margins of control in each chamber and significant policy differences are among the factors that influence the politicalprocedural actions of house and senate members nd party leaders house nd senate majority leaders as result have an incentive to counter minority party actions aimed at forcing vulnerable majority party lawmakers to cast tough votes that might cause them electoral difficulties in the ne xt election the next two parts of this section highlight several formal house and senate procedural rules governing conference committees that majority party leaders might want to avoid or circumvent because of political concerns house after the house has agreed to go to conference but before the conferees are officially named by the speaker the chamber may adoption motion to instruct their conferees for example to uphold the houses position on certain policy issue member of the minority party is granted priority to offer this motion and only one can be made at this stage instructions are nonbinding on the soontobe named conferees but they do serve various purposes one of these is political instruction motions can be framed to force votes on hot button issues that could cause electoral problems for majority pa rty members who hold closely contested seats furthermore if conference cannot reach agr eement within 20 calendar days and ten legislative days then an unlimited number of motions to instruct are in order minority party members can offer repetitive motions to instruct so as to compel votes on their electionyear and political priorities party leaders sometimes avoid this issue by delaying the appointment of c onferees until the preconference negotiations are near completion the house might also take steps to recommit the conference report with instructions if the other body has not disc harged its conferees by acting first and favorably on the conference report minority party member is given priority by the speaker to offer the motion to recommit the conference report with instructions which might be drafted to re quire vote on single isol ated issue that might cause political heartburn for the majority party there are motions to instruct with the ping pong method the ping pong method also disallows use of the motion to recommit with respect to house or senate

of items into conference repor ts air drops are measures or matters inserted into conference reports without fi rst being enacted by the house or senate these are considered violations of scope parliamentary principle which also applies to the house in brief scope means that conferees are to consider only the matters in disagreement between the chambers they are not to include new matter nor are they to delete matter agreed to by both chambers under the previous rule xxviii scope point of order upheld by the pres iding officer would effectively kill the conference report under the revised senate rule if poi nt of order is sustained against airdropped items that does result in rejection of the conference report but the offending material is deleted and the remaining matter can be returned to the house for its consideration using the ex change of amendment procedure for example when rule xxviii point of order was raised against conference report for first time under the ne w procedure it was sustained by the presiding officer he then stated under the rule the senate now considers the question of whether the senate should r ecede from its amendment to the house bill and concur with further amendment t he conference report minus the offending material102 the senate agreed to the motion put by the presiding officer the senate also created brand new rule rule xliv key feature of this rule is the public disclosure of earmarks before conference report can be considered sponsors of earma rks must be identified through lists charts or other means and made publicly available on c ongressional website for at least 48 hours the majority leader or appropriate co mmittee chair must certify in statement on the senate floor for example that these requirements have been met before it is in order to vote on conference report rule xliv also permits senator to raise point of order against one or more provisions of conference report if they constitute new directed

requirements by megan suzanne lynchprocess103 worth noting is that paragraph 8 of rule xliv applies to discretionary and mandatory spending and not to author izations of appropriations the point of discussing these two rule changes the revisions to rule xxviii and the new rule xliv is to underscore that amendmen ts between the houses are not subject to their formal procedures and requirements104 lack of transparency private negotiations among limited numbe r of participants is fundamental characteristic of bicameral negotiations on major bills as for the amendment exchange method transparency and open deliberations are minimized if combined with special rule limiting amendments in the house and treefilling in the senate which closes off amendment opportunities for members unlike the joint explanatory statement accomp anying conference report there is required public paper trailor written record of the deci sions made during the informally negotiated amendment exchange procedure except for wh atever material is spread on the record during house and senate floor debate th ere are also layover requirements for the exchange of amendment procedure but there are for conference reports layover rules give members an opportunity to read about the decisions made in conference committee prior to floor action layover ru however may be waived by special rules from the house rules committee and the need for cloture provides senators with the opportunity to read the amendmen ts associated with the ping pong method still the conference route seems to provide the potential for more openness and transparency compared to the ping pong method three reasons buttress this assessment first conference committees produce tw formal products that are publicly available the conference report the legal language and the joint explanatory statement an explanation of the conference report under house rules rule xiii clause 7 the joint explanatory statement shall be sufficiently detailed and explicit to inform the house and senate of the effects of the report on the matters committed to conference conference reports and joint explanatory statements are printed in the

negotiating sessions associated with the ping pong method third transparency of conference pro ceedings can sometimes be an important strategic component of the lawmaking pr ocess televising conferences over c span the cable satellite public affairs network which has occurred several times in recent years could be part of the strategy for influencing conference decisionmaking by

stated this was the first tax conference in his memory that was held entirely with the public permitted complete access televised ove r the internal television network for the entire time of the conference there were separate conference meetings all of the conference meetings were public107 the chair of the senate conferees agreed with this assessment on tax conferences he said nearly all of the toughest decisions come down to private negotiations between the two chairmen in this conference however all discussions were aired publicly108 the rationale for complete openness was to blunt any allegations from opponents that untoward deals were being made in secret there have been instances of television coverage of the private negotiations associated with the ping pong method concluding observations although table 1 does not reflect numeri cal increase in the ping pong method its recent use on major bills is something that does seem significant volleying amendments between the houses on consequential legi slation is outside what might be considered the regular order the creation of conference committee the usual venue for reconciling bicameral differences on major measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34611crs37 as result there are at l east five issues associated with ping ponging that merit discussion first the more prominent role of ping ponging may reflect the gradual institutionalization of leadershipinfluenced bicameral bargaining process that has been evolving for several years bicameral bargaining is not static process it has undergone many changes over the years the old conference style where limited number of conferees from single committee in each chamber haggle over inter chamber differences long er suffices as the prime method for reaching bicameral compromises today party leaders exercise large influence in achieving and coordinating interchamber agreement on majo r bills often resorting to the ping pong method for this purpose the bicameral ro of party leaders results from various developments such as the need to mobiliz support for partypreferred policies from diverse array of engaged actors inter est groups executive officials nonconferee lawmakers bloggers and so on second there is arguably l ittle significant difference between c onvening virtual conferences where bicameral co mpromises are worked out in private among key lawmakers and employing the amendment exchange method where inter chamber accords are also hammered out in closed meetings by select number of house and senate leaders there are differences however the threat or reality of filibuster in todays senate appears so severe that it has produced changed bicameral dynamic for reconc iling housesenate differences on legislation further there are numerous house and senate rules and practices triggered by the conference method that can be avoided by the ping pong approach these include such things as potential controversies i nvolving conferee selection th instruction of conferees or scope violations third the bargaining dynamic associated with ping ponging may have its roots in senate developments that have occurre d over several decades the thrust of these changes has led to more individualistic and partisan senate where lawmakers individual or partisan preferences so metimes take preceden ce over institutional requirements congressiona l scholars have examined how the senate has changed over several decades and these changes influence todays conferee appointment process capsule summary might include the following developments during the 1970s there was an increase in the number of filibusters and other delaying tactics as the chamber witnessed heightened sense of influence on the part of each senator many sena tors regardless of party were more willing to employ their formidable parliamentary prerogatives to advance individual goals even if that meant blocking the senates business or foiling the agendasetting authority of the majority leader professor richard f fenno jr noted legislative scholar studied how the 1950s senate evolved from co mmunitarian institution where members were expected to use filibusters sparingl and only for highstakes national issues to todays individualistic nate he found that with more openness more media visibility more candidatecentered electi ons more interest groups more political obligations and more sta ff members became independe nt entrepreneurs unwillinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34611crs38 109 richard f fenno jr the senate thr ough the looking

increasingly contentious with polarization along partisan and ideological lines that largely coincide110 this pattern continued into th 2000s given any lawmakers ability to stall legislative action and narrowl divided chambers oftinability to invoke cloture it became much more difficult for the senate to convene conference committees as result majority party l eaders in both houses turned to amendment exchanges and informal negotiations to iron out bicameral differences this negotiating pattern has persisted in recent years regardless of which party has been in charge of the congress fourth bypassing the conference stage is not without its own complications brief summary of 2008 housing measure hr 3221 will help make the point remember that the aforementioned hr 3221 started out as an energy bill with many of its provisions folded into hr 6 the energy case example during the exchange of amendments between the chambers the bill remained in the senate however and became the vehicle to carry major housing initiative th senate devised package of housing proposals that contained energy tax incentives and as mentioned before the constitution requires the house to originate tax measures so the senate deleted the legislative text contained in hr 3221 and replaced it with housing and energy relevant proposals the legislation pa ssed the senate on ap ril 10 2008 as senate amendment to hr 3221 the amended bill was returned to the house including with new title the foreclosure prevention act111 on may 7 2008 the house rules committee reported procedural resolution hres 1175 that made it in order for th house to take up hr 3221 with the senate amendments thereto worth unders coring are two points first senate amendments to housepassed measures lack privilege an automatic right to the floor and require special rule for this purpose second the house can respond to senate amendments in any way that it wants in this case the special rule permitted the financial services chair to make motion to concur in the senate amendments with three house amendments all three were adopted by the house along with an amended title112 hr 3221 became the american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act and was vo lleyed back to the senate the three house amendments to the sena amendments to hr 3221 things quickly became procedurally complicated in the senate leading to complex parliamentary maneuvers there were three motions for cloture an unsuccessful motion to refer the house amendments to the banking committee tree filling by the majority leader

the history of change lawmaking processes adapt in big and little ways to new pressures actors and events yet one constant is that both chambers must pass measure in absolutely identical fashion before it can be sent to the white house for presiden tial consideration recall that table 1 provides data on the methods used to secu re bicameral concurrence on legislation what the table cannot reveal is that many respected individuals believe that once littlediscussed method the exchange of amendments between the houses httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34611crs40 recently has taken on larger
