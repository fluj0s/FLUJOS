as of january 17 2006 while 406005 had been demobilized prior to that date after completing their tours7 note however that the total mobilization and demobilization figures count re servists more than once if they have been mobilizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31334crs3 8 based on the data available to the author it is unclear how many individuals have been involuntarily activated more than once 9 section 12302 of title 10 states in time of na tional emergency declared by the president or when otherwise authorized by law an au thority designated by the secretary concerned may without the consent of the persons concerned order any unit and any member not assigned to unit organized to serve as it in the ready reserve under the jurisdiction of that secretary to active duty other than for training for not more than 24 consecutive months the secretary concerned as define d in 10 usc 101a9is the secretary of the army with respect to the army the secretary of the air force with respect to the air force the secretary of the navy with respect to th navy marine corps and coast guard when it is operating as part of the department of the navy although the law assigns authority to mobilize reservists to an official designat ed by the secretary concerned the president in his capacity as commander in chief is u ltimately responsible for the decision to order reservists to active dutymore than once the total number of individuals mobilized is therefore lower than stated above and probably by significan t margin due to the number of people who have been called up more than once8 these reservists were called to active duty under mob ilization authority known as partial mobilization in time of national emergency declared by the president partial mobilization authorizes the service secretaries9 to order members of the ready reserve to active duty for period not to exceed 24 consecutive months up to 1 million members of the ready reserve may serve on active duty at any one time under this provision of law the presid ent may declare national emergency and mobilize reservists under this provision of law without approval from congress this authority was also used to mobilize reservists during the later part of the persian gulf war 1991 dods general policy has been to keep reservists on active duty for more than one year and in the majority of cases to date mobilized reservists have not been required to serve more than one year however the policy does allow the service secretary to keep reservists on active duty for up to 24 cumulative months if they are needed to meet operational or other requi rements it should be noted that dods policy capping reserve service at 24 cumulative months is more restrictive than the 24 consecutive month cap specified in law if dod were to change its policy to mirror the law reservists could be mobilized multiple times for tours of 24 consecutive months apiece also some members of the national guard have been called up to perform duties related to one in nonfederal status additionally in 2001 and 2002 thousands of members of the national guar d were activated at the order of their respective governors to provide additional security at air ports they were called up under title 32 of the us code which mean s they were under state control but with federal pay and benef its these distinctions have significant bearing on the type of pay benefits and legal protections to which the affected individuals are entitled for more information on this topic see crs report rl30802 reserve component personnel issues by lawrence kapphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31334crs4 10 however law prohibits the conscription of surviving sons not necessarily sole surviving sons in certain circumstances conscription also known as the draft is governed by the military selective service act located at 50 usc appendix 451 to 471 part of this law 50 usc appendix 456 st ates except during the period of war or national emergency declared by congress person may be inducted for training and service under this title sections 451 to 471a of this appendix unless he volunteers for such induction 1 if the father or the mother or brother or sister of such person was killed in action or died in line of duty while serving in the armed forces after december 31 1959 or died subsequent to such date as result of injuries received or disease incurred in line of duty during such service or 2 during any pe riod of time in which the father or the mother or brother or sister of such person is in captured or missing status as result of such service as used in this subsection the term brother or sister means brother of the whole blood or sister of the whole blood as the case may be note however that the legal authority to induct men into the military which is contained in the military selective service act expired on july 1 1973 therefor this provision of law is not currently relevant 11 department of defense directive 131518 procedures for military personnel assignments paragraph e3101 january 12 2005 12 department of defense directive 131515 special separation policies for survivorship paragraph 4 november 21 2003 this policy does not apply during periods of war or national emergency declared by congress if the individual has courtmartial charges pending if the individual is being processed fo r involuntary separation for cause or if the individual voluntarily enlists reenlists or vol untarily extends his or her term of active duty after being notified of the family casualty on which the survivorship claim is made 13 department of defense instruction 131518 procedures for military personnel assignments paragraph e2144 january 12 2005what policies govern the deployment of sole surviving sons and daughters statute governs the deployment of sole surviving sons and daughters in todays allvolunteer military10 however the department of defense does have an administrative policy governing assignments of sole surviving or daughter this policy allows sole surviving sons or daughters to apply for protective assignment status which once approved pr ohibits his or her assignment to any overseas area designated as hostilefire or imminentdanger area nor to duties that regularly might subject him or her to combat with the enemy11 in addition to protective assignment enlis ted personnel who become sole surviving sons or daughters after having entere d service may also apply for and be granted discharge in most circumstances12 however the term sole surviving or daughter does not simply mean the only child in family according to dods definition sole surviving or daughter is the only remaining or daughter in family where the father or mother or one or more sons or daughters served in th armed forces of the united states and because of hazards with such military service either 1 was killed 2 died as result of wounds accident or dis ease 3 is in captured or missingin action mia status or 4 is permanently 100percent disable d is hospitalized on continuing basis and is not employed gainfully because of such disability13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31334crs5 14

military personnel assignments paragraph 69 january 12 2005 16 however there is law which deals with the treatment of conscientious objectors during draft the draft is governed by the m ilitary selective service act codified in 50 usc appendix 451 to 471 part of this law 50 us c appendix 456j states nothing contained in this title sections 451 to 471a of this appendix shall be construed to require any person to be subject to combatant training and servic in the armed forces of the united states who by reason of religious training and belief is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form as used in this subsection the term religious training and belief does not include essentially political sociological or ph ilosophical views or merely personal moral code any person claiming exemption from comb atant training and service because of such conscientious objections whose clai m is sustained by the local board shall if he is inducted into the armed forces under this title said sections be assigned to noncombatant service or shall if he is found to be conscientious ly opposed to participation in such noncombatant servicebe ordered to perform for period qual to the period prescribed in section 4b section 454b of this appendix such civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health safety or interest as the di rector may deem appropriate note however that the legal authority to induct men into the military which is contained in the military selective service act expired on july 1 1973 therefore this provision of law is not relevant to people serving in the military today 17 department of defense directive 13006 conscientious objectors november 21 2003the sole surviving or daughter i ssue is different from the commonly cited albeit fictional sullivan act or sullivan law the sullivans were five brothers serving on board single us navy ship the uss juneau during world war ii their ship was sunk by the japanese on november 13 1942 and ll of the brothers died in response to this tragedy some proposals were made to prohibit brothers from serving together on the same ship but congress did not pass any such law nor did the president issue an executive order to that effect in response to similar tragedy which occurred the previous year three brothers serving aboard the uss arizona perished during the pearl harbor ttacks the navy did issue policy forbidding commanding officers from appr oving requests from brothers to serve together but the policy was apparently not enforced and did not prohibit the navy from assigning brothers to the same ship14 current dod policy states that concurrent assigning of service members of the immediate family to the same military unit or ship is not prohibited but requests for reassignment to different unit or ship may be approved for all but one service member approval of such requests however are contingent upon military requirements15 what policies govern the status of conscientious objectors statute governs the treatment of c onscientious objectors currently serving in the military16 however the department of defense does have an administrative policy relating to this issue17 of course in todays allvolunteer military those who have moral objections to pa rticipating in war will likely choose not to join thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31334crs6 18 department of

religious or moral objections to participation in war such people may apply for transfer to noncombat related duties or for an administrative disc harge depending on the nature of their convictions following application form investigatory pro cedure is initiated by the military to ascertain the facts and nature of the applicants claim based on this investigation and the criteria for granting c onscientious objector st atus defined in the dod policy determination is made to either grant or deny the applicants claim with respect to the criteria for granting conscientious objector status crucial one is the requirement that the individual be opposed to participation in war in any form18 in other words the objection must be to all wars rather than specific war19 this standard precludes those who ar opposed to some wars but not all wars from being classified as conscientious objectors in 2000 slightly over 100 servicemembe rs applied for conscientious objector status in 2004 this number was over 400 of thos who apply approximately half are approved20 are there other exemptions from serving in combat zone yes if service member is killed dies or is declared captured or missing the other service members of th same family will be exem pt upon request from serving in designated hostilefire areas or if already serving in such as area will be reassigned this also applies to those w ho are categorized as 100 disabled by the service or the veterans administration21 in addition w ounded pers onnel who have been medically evacuated and hospitalized for more than 30 days outside the hostilefire area will not be returned during the same tour they may however be eligible for subsequent combat tours this provision does not apply to those hosp italized for injury accident

active federal service23 since 1990 this authority has b een delegated to the secretary of defense by executive order24 secretary of defense donald rumsfeld delegated this authority to each of the individual milita ry services on september 19 2001 allowing those services to stop loss by keep ing individuals on active duty beyond their normal date of separation or retirement stoploss has usually been implemented to permit the military to retain people with critical skills during time of cr isis since september 11 2001 all of the services have implemented such skill based stop loss for various lengths of time although none of the services currently have such policy in effect however the army has implemented st oploss policy which delays the departure of personnel from units deploying to iraq and afghanistan until 90 days after the unit returns from its deployment the purpose of this it based stoploss is to maintain unit cohesion and thereby maximize military effectiveness among units headed for combat environment the army has bot h an active army and reserve component unit stop loss program under both soldiers are affected from 90 days prior to their units mobilizationdeployment

involuntary separations for example discharges due to criminal acts will not be affected by stoploss dditionally the adoption of stoploss policy does not modify service policies or regulations which might lead to an administrative discharge eg for homosexuality or to medical discharge most recently congress has required the secretary of defense to report on the actions being taken to ensure that new enlistees are adequately informed concerning service stop loss policies26 compensation what types of special pays and benefits are available to military personnel participating in oef and oif many

fire events are likely to ccur have usually already been designated as imminent danger zones and if not they us ually become so designated if hostile fire events occur on even sporadic basis still the

general eric shinseki the army chief of staff to assert before the house armed services committee in july 2001 that given todays mission profile the army is too small for the mission load it is

11 2001 operations noble eagle enduring freedom and iraqi freedom have dramatically increased th manpower needs of the military services especially for the army which has s houldered the bulk of the manpower burden associated with the occupation of iraq these manpower needs have been filled primarily through the call up of over 500000 re servists longer duty days and higher perstempo rates for many active duty personnel and the use of contract personnel so far this response has abled the military to perform its assigned missions but some observers note that it c ould cause problems in the future for example in unacceptably low retention rates unacceptable performance levels and difficulty responding to new crises if carried out over an extended period of time in order to prevent such problems fro m occurring congress and the executive branch have taken number of actions for example at the end of fy2003 and fy2004 the department of fense invoked statutory provision which allowed it

this pool has already been utilized quite heavily since september 11 2001 many members of the ready reserve have not been mobilized yet the total strength of the ready reserve which is made up of the selected reserve the individual ready reserve and the inactive national guard is currently about 113 million of these roughly 35 to 40 have been involuntarily mobilized200975 however the army is having difficulty increasing its strength due to recruiting shortfalls another prominent initiative intended to reduce manpower strain is the armys ongoing effort to reorganize itself conver ting from divisional structure to one based on brigade sized units of action76 the army believes that this reorganization will increase its pool of deployable units wh ich could help redu ce perstempo rates the army is also shifting of some critical military capabilities from the reserve component to the active component thereb reducing the need to call up reserve units to support military operations and re training personnel from skills in lower demand such as air defense and artillery to skills in higher demand such as military police other alternatives which have been suggested include contracting out more functions to the private sector increas ing the use of technologies which reduce manpower needs securing greater participation in iraq and afghanistan by allied military personnel reducing u s involveme nt in missions such as the sinai and kosovo and withdrawing us forces fro m iraq in relatively large numbers77 what would it take to reinstit ute the draft is return to conscription in th us likely any attempt to reinstate the draft woul d require congressiona l approval the legal framework for conscription is codified in law but the law contains provision which prohibits actual induction into the armed forces after july 1 197378 to reinstate the draft congress would have to pass legislation reau thorizing inductions at the present time it appears unlikely that the us will reinstate the draft to meet its manpower needs while the army and some of the reserve components are having difficulty making recruiting goals the military is meeting its retention objectives and has large pool of trained personnel in the reserves that it can draw on to augment its active forces79 additionally while conscription is useful forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31334crs19 for federal service in oneoefoif under 10 u sc 12302 still it appears that over half of the ready reserve has not been activated since september 11 2001 on the other hand if one looks only at the selected reserve the mobilization ratio is higher and if one looks at just the selected reserve of the ar my reserve and army national guard the mobilization ratio is higher still based on the best available data it appears that about 50 of the currently serving members of the army national guard and the army reserve have been involuntarily mobilized for federal service in oneoefoif under 10 usc 12302 since september 11 2001 80 examples would include junior level curity guards and personnel with basic construction skills however some would argue that these tasks are not inherently military and could be performed by iraqi civilians rather than by us military personnel others would argue that these tasks take on military character in hazardous environment like iraqproducing large numbers of ba sically trained military personne l it is not very useful for producing high skill specialists which th military often has the greatest need for for example intelligence analysts linguists special operations forces civil affairs personnel and pilots these people need ears of training and high motivation levels to become proficient in their military occ upations however s hould reconstruction and counterinsurgency operations in iraq require major us presence for prolonged period of time the utility of draft might become more active consideration such mission could mand large numbers of military personnel who do not require the more specialized skills80 the draft might also be useful if congress decided to dramatically expand th size of the army over short period of time see also crs
