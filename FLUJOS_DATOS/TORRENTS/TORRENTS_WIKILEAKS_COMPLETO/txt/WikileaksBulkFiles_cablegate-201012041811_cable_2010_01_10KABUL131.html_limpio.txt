classified by ambassador eikenberry for reasons 14 b and d 1 s summary the afghan lower house wolesi jirga wj has voted to accept 7 of 17 cabinet nominees presented in president karzais second tranche of candidates the parliament has not yet decided if it will recess until midfebruary or continue until the new cabinet is complete presidential palace chief of staff daudzai told us january 12 that this was the desired outcome political calculation to allow karzai to back out of campaign promises with traditional powerbrokers the political winners of the vote include pashtun and tajik conservatives and jihadis as well as counternarcotics minister associated with the drug mafia meanwhile neither the two strongest female candidates nor any of the uzbek and hazara candidates passed muster many mps claimed they voted down candidates because they were weak nobodies connected to warlords did not offer sufficient significant donations to their 2010 parliamentary elections campaigns or due to ethnic affiliations end summary wj votes on the second tranche of cabinet nominees 2 u on january 16 the wj voted to approve seven of 17 cabinet nominees presented in karzais second tranche of candidates ten nominees were rejected some ministerial candidates like the mrrd minister gained exactly the minimum 113 votes required while the counternarcotics minister received the highest number of votes at 162 of total of 249 mps 223 were present for the vote the literacy ministry was not included on this latest list because karzai has not formally created the new ministry and the wj has not approved it the president decided to keep the martyred and disabled as part of the labor and social affairs ministry four more positions that require confirmation but have not yet been submitted are the heads of the intelligence service the central bank and the red crescent society as well as the attorney general these positions are traditionally submitted after the completion of the ministerial approval process 3 u those candidates approved in the second tranche included the foreign affairs minister justice hajj and religious affairs economy rural rehabilitation and development mrrd and the labor social affairs and martyred minister vote tallies and short biographic notes are in paras 10 and 11 the parliament has not yet decided if it will recess until midfebruary or continue until the cabinet is complete they will meet again on january 17 and will likely decide at that point palace we wanted them to be rejected 4 s presidential palace chief of staff omer daudzai told dambassador ricciardone january 12 that the palace purposefully introduced weak candidates associated with some of the traditional powerbrokers so that the parliament would reject them daudzai only expected about five nominees to pass he claimed this approach allowed karzai to back out of campaign promises to some of these former warlords and instead nominate more candidates that were loyal to karzai daudzai claimed karzai had asked him to refrain from campaigning for ministers and that karzai was pleased that the tone of the powerbrokers in meetings to discuss cabinet nominations had already improved since the first cabinet list as the warlords were more willing to accept karzais suggested cabinet nominations daudzai believed the third list would be stronger political winners and losers 5 s the political winners of the vote include pashtun and tajik conservatives as well as counternarcotics minister associated with the drug mafia the winners also included one afghan millatformer king zahir shah candidate foreign affairs two candidates associated with former warlord and fundamentalist ustad rasoul sayyaf hajj and justice one hezbeislami afghanistan candidate economy and three candidates either associated with former warlords marshal fahim or professor rabbanis jamiat party mrrd labor and social affairs and counternarcotics meanwhile the two strongest female candidates were not approved nor were the three candidates associated with dostum and the uzbek junbesh kabul 00000131 002 of 005 party health transport and communications the three hazara candidates commerce public works and urban development and the one proiran candidate higher education also failed vote motivations remain numerous 6 sbu the wjs display of strength both on january 2 and january 16 doubt reflected variety of motives including candidates qualifications blowback from executive dominance political and financial gain as well as desire to avoid warlord candidates and certain ethnicities reftel several mps told us this cabinet list was full of weak nobodies lacking the political stature to be effective ministers 7 sbu the wj also sought to assert itself after years of executive dominance in particular in the first round of cabinet voting at least three cabinet ministers had received wj votes of confidence in the past five years yet karzai kept them in office as acting ministers in some cases for several years also when the wj overrode karzais veto of the media law which required the executive to obtain the wjs approval of the head of the main governmentsupported media outlet rta the executive sent the case to the supreme court and quietly had karzais version approved during the busy presidential elections period 8 s understandably mps wanted to maximize their leverage for both political and financial gain the cabinet approval process is one of the rare occasions when the wj is in position of power mps tell us this is the time when mps can obtain significant donations to their 2010 parliamentary elections campaigns alhaj moeen marastyal pashtun kunduz told us january 14 that mps prefer second and third lists of cabinet nominees so they can receive second and third envelopes of cash he claimed the counternarcotics minister was distributing to mps record amounts from 8000 15000 usd per mp 9 s some mps have voted against warlord candidates and opposed or supported others depending on ethnic affiliations notably unlike in the first round of cabinet voting some traditional powerbrokers are now attempting to disassociate themselves from the candidates however influential former warlord sayyafs political advisor admitted to us january 12 that most of these candidates are in fact associated with the powerbrokers and indeed rabbani had his candidates as did sayyaf they did not want to admit it for fear that this would cause their candidates to fail the approval process short bios and vote tallies 10 s approved
