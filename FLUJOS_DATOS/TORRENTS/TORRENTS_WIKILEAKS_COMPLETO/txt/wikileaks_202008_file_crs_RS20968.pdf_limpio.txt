jordanus free trade agreement labor issues mary jane bolle specialist in international trade foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the usjordan free trade agreement fta implemented as pl 10743 which went into effect december 17 2001 breaks new ground by including multiple worker rights provisions in the body of us trade agreement rather than as side agreement for the first time for this reason it adds some controversy to the congressional debate over whether worker ri ghts provisions should be included in future trade agreements some observers eye this c onfiguration of worker rights protections as model for future trade agreements others view it as onetime occurrence justified only because jordan has strong tradition f labor protections still others oppose the inclusion of labor provisions in trade agreem ents under any circumstances this report will be updated as events warrant this report examines the labor provisions of the usjordan free trade agreement fta and compares them with those of the north american free trade agreement nafta it also looks briefly at the larger issues of including worker rights provisions in trade agreements and summarizes the pos itions of major stakeholders in the ongoing debate on including labor provisions in trade agreements the usjordan fta was signed in the presence of thenpresident bill clinton and king abdullah ii on october 24 2000 submitted to congress as hr 2603 and s 643 on january 6 2001 approved by the governme nt of jordan on july 15 implemented as pl 10743 on september 28 and went into effect on december 17 2001 by presidential proclamation 7512 december 7 2001 it provi des for 10year transitional period during which duties on almost all goods traded between the countries except tobacco and related products will be totally phased out1 the trade effects of the usjordan fta are expected to be small but growing in 2001 the united states im ported 229 million worth of commodities about 002 of allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20968crs2 us imports from jordan up more than 200 from 2000 and ranking it 95thamong countries from which the united states im ports goods in return the united states exported 339 million less than 005 of all us ex ports worth of goods to jordan which placed it 74thamong countries to which the ited states exports goods major provisions of the agreement labor issues over the agreement revolve d around two sets of provisions labor provisions and dispute settlement provisions the labor provisions of the usjordan fta located in the body of the agreement are relatively straightforward occupy one page of text and require three things first they require that each country enforce its own labor laws in manners affecting tra and b that those laws reflect both internationally recognized worker rights as defined by the us trade act of 1974 as amended and core labor standards as define d by the international labor organization second the provisions require that the partie s to the agreement not waive or derogate from their own labor laws as an encouragement for trade with the other party third they provide that each party will be considered in compliance with the agreement where n yd v i t i nf r mt h er q u i r m n t sr f l c t sa r s n b l ee x r c i s eo fd i s c r t i n r results from bona fide decision regarding the allocation of resources the dispute settlement procedures slightly longer than the labor provisions occupy one and onehalf pages of text they provide for resolution of disputes that arise over interpretation of the agreement b alleged failure of party to carry out its obligations under the agreement and c measures taken by party that allegedly severely distort the balance of trade benefits or substantially undermine the f undamental objectives of the agreement pursuing dispute through the complete re solution procedure provided for in the agreement would take 270 days or about ne months any dispute would move up the ladder for consideration first through c onsultations between contact points these would be followed with consideration by joint committee and further consideration by dispute settlement panel the panel is required to present report containing its findings of fact and its determinations which will be nonbinding if the dispute is still not resolved within 30 days after the joint committee presents its report the affected party will be entitled to take any appropriate and commensurate measure issues with the labor provisions supporters including many democrats argued that the labor provisions did not break much new ground conceptually the u sjordan provisions are similar to those in the nafta labor side agreement in that in both agreements each country must enforce its own worker rights laws while ove r the long term b strive toward adopting complete body of worker rights principles and c not waive or derogate from its own labor laws as an encouragement for trade provisions of the two agreements are compared in table 1 opponents including many republicans saw the labor provisions as breaking considerable new ground because they were located in the body of the agreement where theywould be subject to dispute settlement procedures and possiblysanctions moreoverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20968crs3 2jordan opposes reopening fta but would accept side letter inside us trade april 13 2001the dispute resolution procedure entitled either party to take any appropriate and commensurate measure if the dispute re solution procedure on the included labor provisions fails and that would appear to include sanctions the call for memora ndum of understanding as compromise measure some observers suggested that the united states and jordan exchange side letters or memoranda of understanding agreeing that any appropriate and commensurate measure does not mean sanctions but leaving open what else the words might mean2such letters were actually exchanged by the ambassador of jordan and us trade representative robert zoellick on july 23 2001 these ide ntical letters pledged to resolve any differences that might arise between the t wo countries under the agreement without recourse to formal dispute settlement procedures they also specified that each government would not expect or intend to apply the agreements dispute settlement enforcement procedures in manner that results in blocking trade in house floor debate the agreement to not use sanctions was viewed alternately as 1 part of cooperative structure to help secure comp liance without recourse to traditional trade sanctions that are the letter of the agreement thomas and 2 step backwards for future constructive action on trade levin the exchange of letters paved the way for house and senate approval of the trade agreement the house approved hr 2603 by voice vote on july 31 2001 the senate approved hr 2603 by voice vote on september 24 the government of jordan had already approved it on july 15 it became law as pl 10743 on september 28 2001 during the senate debate senator phil g ramm warned that he will oppose any effort to turn the usjordan fta into model for how future trade agreements should deal with worker rights and environmental protec tion issues he argued that they should not be part of trade deals conversely senate finance committee chairman max baucus indicated he hoped the usjordan fta would set precedent for how future trade agreements would address issues like labor and the environment he also refuted statement made bysenator graham that the p rovisions would undermine us sovereignty or prevent lawmakers from enacting and enfo rcing us labor and environmental laws if congress had not been able to resolve the issue of sanctions with the exchange of memoranda of understanding or similar docum ents it would have had several other options other than to approve the agreement as n egotiated it could have approved the agreement with conditions and in effect required the president to renegotiate it b amended any implementing legislation or c as under the fasttrack procedure simply disapproved the agreement and the implementing legislation containing the language of the agreement as introduced the larger debate about including worker rights provisions in trade agreements the labor provisions of the usjordan fta and reaction to them can also be viewed in the context of the larger ongoing debate in congress about the linkage of worker rights and tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20968crs4 the most recent debate has been ongoing sinc 1994 when presidential fasttrack authority to negotiate new trade agreem ents contained in the omnibus trade and negotiating act octa of 1988 pl 100418 expired the octa included as principal negotiating objective of the united states in trade agreements to promote worker rights under that authority nafta was negotiated with its labor side agreement the issue of debate in recent years has been which of three courses to follow whether to include in new fasttrack authority more limited presidential authority to include labor provisions than in the expired legislation b similar authority or c broader authority after fasttrack renewal fforts spanning parts of nine years congress finally included language that is arguably more limited in some aspects but which also includes more detailed requirements pl 107210 signed august 6 2002 finally renewed presidential fasttrack authorityor trade promotion authority tpa as it is more recently being called the renewed authority to negotiate trade agreements on an expedited basis without amendment and with limited debate includes numerous labor provisions as both overall negotiating objectives and principal negotiating objectives overall negotiating objectives typically advisory in nature reiterate the two concepts included in the expired 1988 authority 1 to promote respect for worker rights but specifying that it shall be done in the int ernational labor organization which has virtually enforcement powers limitation not included in the expired legislation and 2 to ensure that domestic labor laws are not weakened as an encouragement for trade the principal negotiating objectives on labor an d the environment typically enforceable include three goals new to fasttrack language but somewhat reflective of both nafta and jordan trade agreements and also of previous attempts to renew fast track authority these are 1 to strengthen the capacity of us trading partners to promote respect for worker rights 2 to ens ure that party does not fail to enforce its own labor laws in manner aff ecting trade and 3 to ensur that labor policies do not unjustifiably discriminate against us exports or serve as disguised barriers to trade with the passage of new trade promotio n authority in august of 2002 the debate now has shifted once more and the new focus is on monitoring the kinds of labor provisions that will be negotiated as part of new trade agreements currently in negotiation stakeholders stakeholders are watching to see how provisions of the new trade promotion authority law will become translat ed into trade agreements to the extent that negotiators attempt to and are able to include them in future trade agreements stakeholders against actually includi ng labor provisions in the body of trade agreements argue that 1 such provisions impede the flow of free trade and are not needed 2 any labor and environment provisions could put us companies at serious disadvantage visavis their competitors in the world trade organization 3 the us jordan language should be one time occurre nce rather than precedent and 4 that potential violations of core labor standard s should be pursued multilaterally through the international labor organization ilo rather than through trade agreements the ilo part of the united nations was establis hed in 1919 to promote worker rights ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20968crs5 mentioned it has direct enforcement powers working instead through technical assistance and moral suasion stakeholders in favor of including labor provisions in the body of trade agreements argue in favor of using the usjordan f ta labor provisions as model for other trade agreements the aflcio asserts that an even more elaborate mechanism than is included in the usjordan fta is needed to ensure that foreign labor laws are brought up to international standards on clear timetable and b to prevent the use of trade and investment agreements as busin ess tools to force down wages and working conditions in the united states and abroad conclusion the usjordan fta continues and arguab ly advances the linkage of worker rights provisions and trade beyond that containe d in the nafta labor side agreement it does this by including the worker rights provisions in the body of the agreement and b by raising the possibility of sanctions in t hat either country may take any appropriate and commensurate measure if the dispute procedures do not lead to resolution even though letters exchanged by us and jordan governments have pledged not to exercise those sanctions with regards to potential l abor violations the jordan agreements influence was also felt in the reauthorization of tpa language which would continue to permit new trade agreements to include provisions similar to those in the jordan agreement in the body of the agreement table 1 comparison of key provisions of usjordan free trade agreement and nafta provisionusjordan free trade
