increasing fears about the spread of highly contagious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and pandemic influenza federal state and local governments have become increa singly aware of the need for comprehensive public health response to such events an effective response could include the quarantine of persons exposed to infectious biological agents that are naturally occurring or released during terrorist attack the isolation of infected persons and the quarantine of certain cities or neighborhoods the public health authority of the states derives from the police powers reserved to them by the tenth amendment to the us constitution the authority of the federal government to prescribe quarantine and other health measures is based on the commerce clause which gives congress exclusive authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce thus state and local governments have the primary authority to control the spread of dangerous diseases within their jurisdictions and the federal government has authority to quarantine and impose other health measures to prevent the spread of diseases from foreign countries and between states in addition the federal government may assist state efforts to prevent the spread of communicable diseases if requested by state or if state efforts are inadequate to halt the spread of disease some state laws are antiquated and until recently have not been reviewed to address the spread of disease resulting from biological attack other state laws do not cover newly emerging diseases such as sars or pandemic influenza in light of rece nt events however many states are reevaluating their public health emergency authorities and are expected to enact more comprehensive laws relating to quarantine and isolation public health experts have developed model state emergency health powers act to guide states as they reevaluate their emergency response plans this report provides an overview of federal and state public health laws as they relate to the quarantine and isolation of individuals discussi on of constitutional issues that may be raised should individual liberties be restricted in quarantine situation and federalism questions that may arise where federal and state authorities overlap in addition the possible role of the armed forces in enforcing public health measures is discussed specifically whether the posse comitatus act would constrain any military role and other statutory authorities that may be used for the military enforcement of health measures

that the sole end for which mankind are warranted individually or collectively in interference with the liberty of action of any of their number is selfprotection that the only purpose for which power

of avoiding persons with contagious diseases may be found in the oldest of writings including leviticus and numbers in the old testament wherein specific instructions are given for the inspection and sequestration of lepers1 the term quarantine is derived from the italian words quaranta giorni which refer to the 40day period during which certain ships arriving at the port of venice during the black death plague outbreaks of the 14th century were obliged to sit at anchor before any persons or goods were allowed to go ashore2 following plague epidemic in london in 1664 england passed rigorous quarantine laws all quarantined vessels were required to show solid yellow flag to indicate they we re under quarantine as late as 1721 some ships coming to england from infected areas were burned at sea 3 the earliest evidence of quarantine in colonial america occurred in the massachusetts bay colony in 1647 when vessels from the west indies were forbidden to land or discharge passengers and cargo during plague outbreak the first federal quarantine law was passed in 1796 in response to continued yellow fever epidemics4 in the event of biological attack or the introduction of highly contagious disease affecting the public the us health system may take measures to prevent those people infected with or exposed to disease or diseasecausing biological agent from infecting others5 the terms used to describe these measures quarantine and isolation generally apply to distinct groups of persons but are often used interchangeably quarantine typically refers to the separation of individuals who have been exposed to an infection but are not yet ill from others who have not been exposed to the transmissible infection 6 isolation refers to the separation of infected individuals from those who are not infected7 varying degrees of quarantine exist and the authority to order quarantine or isolation is generally very broad first both complete quarantine and isolation usually involve the confinement of contagious individuals to their residences pursuant to orders from the state health department health officials post public notice forbidding anyone from entering or exiting the dwelling alternatively health authorities may confine an infected person to either hospital or prison second health authorities may order modified quarantine which selectively restricts an individual from participation in certain activities eg jobs involving food 1 leviticus 1448 and numbers 52 lawrence gostin public health law power duty restraint 2045 2002 2 centers for

quarantine power also includes the authority to place contagious individual under surveillance to insure strict compliance with quarantine orders finally the health department may issue segregation orders which require the separation of an entire group of people from the general population quarantine orders may extend to any persons who come into contact with the infected individual 8 primary quarantine authority typically resides with state health departments and health officials however the federal government has jurisdiction over interstate and foreign quarantine in addition the federal government may assist with or take over the management of an intrastate incident if requested by state or if the federal government determines local efforts are inadequate9 this report examines federalism and other constitutional issues related to quarantines discusses current federal and state statutes and regulations and explains the militarys role in enforcing quarantines

although the federal government has the authority to authorize quarantine under certain circumstances the primary authority exists at the state level as an exercise of the states police power the 4 th congress appears to have recognized this principle when in 1796 it debated whether to authorize the president to establish regulations to impose quarantines at ports of entry11 after opponents argued that the authority belonged to the states congress passed law authorizing the president to assist states in enforcing their health laws12 which it soon replaced with law requiring certain federal officials to observe restraints and quarantines imposed by state laws and to aid state officials in their execution 13 in 1824 the supreme court alluded to states authority to enact quarantine laws in gibbons v ogden 14 in gibbons the court noted that although quarantine laws may affect commerce they are by nature health laws and thus fall under the authority of state and local governments courts have noted that the duty to ensure that the public health is preserved is inherent to the police power of state and cannot be surrendered 15 however the supreme court has recognized 8 edward fallone

legislate must give way under the supremacy clause16 the federal or state origin of quarantine laws may influence the means and methods of their enforcement the constitution does not expressly vest the executive branch with the authority to execute state laws and the federal government has authority to order state officials to execute federal law17 article iv 4 guarantees federal assistance to states only in cases of invasion or insurrection or at the request of the state legislature or the executive if the legislature cannot be convened in the case of domestic violence the tenth amendment provides that powers not expressly vested in the federal government are retained by the states or the people18 it may be argued that distinctly federal interest must exist before congress can legislate with respect to public health and that although the constitution does not expressly say so federal law enforcement officers may not ordinarily enforce state laws without the permission of the state government 19 federal and state quarantine laws are also subject to constitutional due process constraints the fifth and fourteenth amendments prohibit governments at all levels from depriving individuals of any constitutionally protected liberty interest without due process of law20 what process may be due under certain circumstances is generally determined by balancing the individuals interest at stake against the governmental interest served by the restraints determining whether the measures are reasonably calculated to achieve the governments aims 21 and deciding whether the least restrictive means have been employed to further that interest in addition some have suggested that military enforcement of quarantines raises additional civil liberties concerns these aspects are discussed more fully below g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g19g158g138g155g138g151g157g146g151g142g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g162g561

section 361 of the public health service phs act 42 usc 264 the secretary of health and human services hhs has the authority to make and enforce regulations necessary to prevent the introduction transmission or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the states or possessions or from one state or possession into any other state or possession23 while providing the secretary with broad authority to promulgate regulations as in his judgement may be necessary this law limits the secretarys authority to the communicable diseases published in an executive order of the president 24 the list of communicable diseases in executive order 13295 currently includes cholera diphtheria infectious tuberculosis plague smallpox yellow fever viral hemorrhagic fevers sars and influenza caused by novel or reemergent influenza viruses that are causing or have the potential to cause pandemic25 generally federal regulations authorizing the apprehension detention examination or conditional release of individuals are applicable only to individuals coming into state or possession from foreign country or possession26 thus federal regulations require the reporting of ill passengers on international conveyances such as airplanes and boats27 during the 2003 response to the sars epidemic federal officials pr ovided health alert information to air travelers returning to the united states from areas with sars outbreaks boarded airplanes with travelers reported to be ill to assess their symptoms and facilitated transport of ill passengers to hospitals federal officials also provided updates to the public and worked with state and local public health agencies to investigate possible sars cases 28 in addition section 361 of the phs act authorizes the apprehension and examination of any individual reasonably believed to be infected wi th communicable disease in qualifying stage29 and to be moving or about to move from state to another state or b to be probable source of infection to individuals who while infect ed with such disease in qualifying stage will be moving from state to another state 30 if found to be infected such individuals may be detained for such time and in such manner as may be reasonably necessary31 during times of war the authority to apprehend and examine indi viduals extends to any individual reasonably believed 1 to be infected with such disease as specified in an executive order of the president 22 us const art i 8 23 42 usc 264a subsection also authorizes other public health measures including destruction of animals or

state or possession if he or she determines that measures taken by local health authorities are inadequate to prevent the spread of the disease34 to prevent the spread of diseases between states the regulations also prohibit infected persons from traveling from one state to another without permit from the health officer of the state possession or locality of destination if such permit is required under the law applicable to the place of destination35 additional requirements apply to persons who are in the communicable period of cholera plague smallpox typhus or yellow fever or who having been

proposed changes to its quarantine regulations42 if adopted these changes would constitute the first significant revision of the regulations in parts 70 and 71 in 25 years the proposed changes are an outgrowth of the cdcs experience during the spread of sars in 2003 when the agency experienced difficulties locating and contacting airline passengers who might have been exposed to the sars virus during their travels in announcing the proposed regulations cdc director julie gerberding said these updated regulations are necessary to expedite and improve cdc operations by facilitating contact tracing and prompting immediate medical follow up of potentially infected passengers and their contacts 43 the proposed regulations would expand reporting requirements for ill passengers44 on board flights and ships arriving from foreign countries they would also require airlines and ocean liners to maintain passenger and crew lists with detailed contact information and to submit these lists electronically to cdc upon request45 the lists would be used to notify passengers of their suspected exposure if sick person were not identified until after the travelers had dispersed from an arriving carrier the proposed regulations address the due process rights of passengers who might be subjected to quarantine after suspected exposure to disease the regulations also provide for an appeal process46 g21g157g138g157g142g561g18g152g149g146g140g142g561g18g152g160g142g155g156g561g138g151g141g561g19g158g138g155g138g151g157g146g151g142g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g162g561 although every state has the authority to pass and enforce quarantine laws as an exercise of their police powers these laws vary widely by state generally state and local quarantines are authorized through public health orders though some states may require court order before an individual is detained 47 for example in louisiana the state health officer is not authorized to confine any person in any institution unless directed or authorized to do so by the judge of the parish in which the person is located48 diseases subject to quarantine may be defined by statute with some statutes addressing only single diseas or the state health department may be granted the authority to decide which diseases are communicable and therefore subject to quarantine49 42 the proposed regulations may be viewed

the quarantine or isolation period generally release is accomplished when determination is made that the person is longer threat to the public health or longer infectious50 one common characteristic of many state quarantine laws is their overall antiquity with many statutes being between 40 and 100 years old51 the more antiquated laws often do not reflect contemporary scientific understandings of disease or current treatments of choice52 in the past state laws were often enacted with focus on particular disease such as tuberculosis or typhoid fever leading to inconsistent approaches in addressing other diseases53 until recently despite the inconsistencies and perceived problems with such laws state legislatures have not been forced to reevaluate their quarantine and isolation laws due to decline in infectious diseases and advances in public health and medicine54 however in light of recent threats and security concerns many states have begun to reconsider their emergency response systems including the states authority to quarantine55 review of quarantine authority was listed as priority for state governments in the presidents 2002 national strategy for homeland security56 federal authority over interstate and foreign travel is clearly delineated under constitutional and statutory provisions less clear however is whether the state police powers may be used to restrict interstate travel to prevent the spread of disease57 in public health emergency federal state and local authorities may overlap for example both federal and state agencies may have quarantine authority over an aircraft arriving in large city from foreign country thus coordination between the various levels of govern ment would be essential during widespread public health emergency58 bioterrorism exercises such as topoff 2 in may 2002 have continued quarantine in tuberculosis cases however recent 2004 amendments grant the governor quarantine power during catastr ophic health

local authorities respond simultaneously to public health emergency one authors comments on lessons learned from topoff 2 are instructive59 perhaps the most significant lesson in reference to the law and topoff 2 is the most obvious namely the fact that the law at the intersection of public health and bioterrorism is extremely unsettled there is not lack of law to draw upon in addressing specific questions but rather myriad of laws that must be considered most of which were developed to address more mundane public health matters or designed to respond to more traditional emergency situations it is critical for the legal responders to be sensitive to the rights of affected individuals and the public at large because in the heat of the moment concern for individual rights may be seen as secondary ma tter in particular heightened sensitivity to human rights must be exhibited in areas where physical imposition or restraint come into question such as isolation quarantine and mandated medical examinations while considerable progress is being made in coordinating approaches to the ageold practices of isolation and quarantine other rights issues in this context remain open questions such as the need to be sensitive to postdeprivation rights the right to legal counsel the nature of clinical evidence required to justify such measures and the policies concerning the application of isolation and quarantine to populations g15g152g141g142g149g561g21g157g138g157g142g561g7g150g142g155g144g142g151g140g162g561g10g142g138g149g157g145g561g18g152g160g142g155g156g561g3g140g157g561 the model state emergency health powers act the model act was drafted by the center for law and the publics health at georgetown and johns hopkins universities60 the model act seeks to grant public health powers to state and local public health authorities to ensure strong effective and timely planning prevention and response mechanism to public health emergencies including bioterrorism while also respecting individual rights61 it is important to note that the act is intended to be model for states to use in evaluating their emergency response plans passage of the model act in its entirety is not required so state legislatures may select the entire model parts of it or none at all many states have used parts of the model act while tailoring their statutes and regulations to respond to

the model act quarantine is defined as the physical separation and confinement of an individual or groups of individuals who are or may have been exposed to contagious or possibly contagious disease and who do not show signs or symptoms of contagious disease from nonquarantined individuals to prevent or limit the transmission of the disease to nonquarantined individuals 63 isolation is defined as

individuals during public health emergency64 the model act encourages the public health authority to adhere to specific conditions and principles when exercising quarantine or isolation authority65 these conditions and principles include ensuring that the measures taken are the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of the disease monitoring the condition of quarantined or isolated individuals and providing for the immediate rel ease of individuals when they longer pose substantial risk of transmitting the disease to others66 the model act provides that failure to obey the rules and orders concerning quarantine and isolation shall be treated as misdemeanor67 the model state emergency health powers act sets forth procedures for quarantine and isolation under two different sets of circumstances sect ion 605a addresses procedures for temporary quarantine and isolation without notice if delay in imposing the isolation or quarantine would significantly jeopardize the public health authoritys ability to prevent or limit the transmission of contagious or possibly contagious disease to others the quarantine or isolation must be ordered through written directive specifying the identity of the individuals subject to the order the premises subject to the order the date and time at which the quarantine or isolation are to commence the suspected contagious disease and copy of the provisions set forth in the act relating to isolation and quarantine 68 the public health authority is required to petition within 10 days after issuing the directive for court order authorizing the continued isolation or quarantine if needed69 apart from the emergency procedures outlined above the public health authority may petition court for an order authorizing the quarantine or isolation of an individual or groups of individuals with notice of the petition given to the individuals or groups of individuals in question within 24 hours70 the public health authoritys petition must include the same information as required in the emergency directive discussed above in addition to statement of the basis upon which isolation and quarantine is justified in compliance with this article71 hearing must be held within five days of the petition being filed and the court shall grant the petition if by preponderance of the evidence isolation or quarantine is shown to be reasonably necessary to prevent or limit the transmission of contagious or possibly contagious disease to others72 an order authorizing quarantine or isolation may not do so for period exceeding 30 days though the public health authority may move to continue quarantine or isolation for additional periods not exceeding 30 days73 64 public health emergency is defined to include an occurre nce or imminent threat of an illness or health condition that is believed to be caused by bioterrorism or the appearance of novel or previously controlled or eradicated infectious agent or

measures in emergency situations including quarantine involve balancing the rights of individuals with the states police power to protect the needs of the public health safety and general welfare historically this balance can be seen in public health crises over the past century or so 76 it is well known that public health raises conflicts between individual and societal interests the context may vary but the essential tension of balancing individual and group interests is largely the same for example at the beginning of the twentieth century key issue was vaccination against smallpox in the 1980s contentious issue was the reporting of human immunodeficiency virus hiv test results by name to public health authorities after september 11 2001 and the anthrax episode shortly thereafter there has been debate about whether broad emergency powers to protect public health should be given to governors and state health departments and if so whether special new legislation is needed many of the same issues arise in the use of largescale quarantine measures such as those used to combat sars footnotes omitted the supreme court in gibbons v ogden in 1824 alluded to states authority to quarantine under the police powers in 1902 the court directly addressed states power to quarantine an entire geographic area in compagnie francaise navigation vapeur v louisiana state board of health 77 where both the law and its implementation were upheld as valid exercises of the states police power shipping company in this case challenged an interpretation of state statute that conferred upon the state board of health the authority to exclude healthy persons whether they came from without or within the state from geographic area infested with disease 78 the shipping company alleged that the statute as interpreted interfered with interstate commerce and thus was an unconstitutional violation of the commerce clause the court rejected this argument holding that although the statute may have had an effect on commerce it was not unconstitutional79 when quarantine is established in geographic area due to adverse conditions in the area courts are thus likely to uphold the restrictions the supreme court has stated that the right to travel does not mean that areas ravaged by flood fire or pestilence cannot be quarantined when it can be demonstrated that unlimited travel to the area would directly and materially interfere with the safety and welfare of the area80 in miller v campbell city 81 an order to evacuate an 74 section 605c 75 section 605e 76 mark rothstein are traditional

faith or maliciously82 the county needed to act quickly because of the potential danger so liability was found courts have recognized an individuals right to challenge his or her quarantine or isolation by petitioning for writ of habeas corpus83 although the primary function of writ of habeas corpus is to test the legality of the detention84 petitioners often seek declaration that the statute under which they were quarantined is unconstitutional or violative of due process due process is concern though courts are reluctant to interfere with states exercise of police powers with regard to public health matters except where the regulations adopted for the protection of the public health are arbitrary oppressive and unreasonable 85 the courts appear to defer to the determinations of state boards of health and ge nerally uphold such detentions as nonviolative of due process and as valid exercises of states duty to preserve the public health thus the court in

unwarranted because she was not actually sick though the court noted that it is not necessary that one be actually sick as that term is usually applied in order that the health authorities have the right to restrain his liberties by quarantine regulations 88 in justifying quarantine under these circumstances the court explained that because disease germs are carried by human beings and as the purpose of an effective quarantine is to prevent the spread of the disease to those who are not infected anyone who carries the germs must be quarantined 89 the court found that in the case of person

quarantined to prevent the spread of the disease90 however some courts have refused to uphold the quarantine of an individual in cases where the state is unable to meet its burden of proof concer ning that individuals potential danger to others or if restriction is viewed as unreasonable or oppressive91 in wong wai v williamson 92 the san francisco board of health ordered all chinese re sidents to be inoculated against bubonic plague and restricted their right to leave the city citing nine deaths allegedly from plague the inoculations were tainted causing severe consequences the court inferred that the regulations were properly authorized but nevertheless struck them down as not based on any established distinction in the conditions that are supposed to attend the plague or the persons exposed to its contagions93 shortly after in jew ho v williamson the same court held that the quarantine requirements applied only to chinese and questioned whether bubonic plague actually caused the

the president may be authorized by the constitution or by statute to use the military to enforce quarantine or conduct other law enforcement activities as needed during an epidemic prior to the civil war congress was generally reluctant to involve itself with any type of disaster assistance 117 and health measures except in areas under exclusive federal jurisdiction were generally left to the regulation of the states however congress has given the president through the secretary of hhs the authority to help states enforce quarantine laws with respect to any vessels arriving in or bound to any of their ports or districts including the use of the military118 this authority which originated in law passed in 1796119 does not extend to the control of movement of persons within the united

enforcing cdc health regulations with respect to foreign passengers and cargo125 the armed forces have not historically played major role in enforcing quarantines during epidemics126 the army medical corps has provided medical assistance to victims of yellow fever and other epidemics and contributed extensively to medical research127 but it does not appear that an outbreak of diseas has ever overwhelmed state and local authorities to the point where federal military intervention was required it is however conceivable that in major epidemic opposition to quarantine measures could lead to civil disorder and significant numbers of state and local law enforcement officials could themselves fall victim to the disease in each case to such an extent that federal assistance or intervention would be needed to ensure the execution of federal or state laws in such circumstances the president could invoke the insurrection act 10 usc 331335 to employ the national guard or regular armed

as before either the enjoyment of equal protection of the laws is impeded or the execution of federal law and related judicial process is obstructed on exercising the authority the president is required to notify congress as soon as practicable and every 14 days until ordinary law enforcement is restored the authority to employ military force in section 333 remains unchanged except that the presidents recourse to any other means is eliminated and the relevant state is to be deemed to have denied constitutional equal protection any time the authority is exercised outside of the newly described disaster scenario rather than when any part or class of the states people is deprived of right privilege immunity or protection named in the constitution and secured by law although this remains one of the alternative prerequisites for invoking the authority even under disaster conditions the amendment has been criticized as encouraging recourse to federalization of national guard troops and employment of other military troops in the event of natural disaster even if the governor of the affected state does not believe the situation calls for federal troops
