major conflicts since that time up to and including the vietnam war the specific conditions for naturalization under the various statutes th at were enacted before the ina vary12 for example the original civil war statute affected only persons serving in the armies of the united states and did not include the navy or marine corps which were included in 189413 among other standards under various stat utes the civil war statute required residency of one year later statutes gove rning naturalization through service in the navy or marine corps require d service of 5 consecutive years in the navy the length of one tour of duty in the navy at that time or service for one tour of duty in the marine corps subsequent statutes have similar requirements with variations in the length of service required and the gree to which residency is waived the early statutes required the alien to be 21 years old and waived the now obsolete requirement to declare ones intent to become citizen certain period of time prior to filing natura lization application the requirement of an honorable discharge dates from the civil war statute statutes during world war i and the korean war permitted natu ralization proceedings to take place abroad14 the world war i statute15 for the first time waived the fee during wartime permitted reenlistment only upon the condition that the alien was in the process of becoming citizen ie had filed declaration of intent to naturalize and required that naturalization application base d on peacetime service have b een filed while in regular service after reenlistment or within six m onths of honorable disc harge or separation from such service which is currently the deadline for filing or while in reserve service after regular service thus at l east

required three years of service for naturalization based on peacetime service which is th currently required period until the vietnam war special provisions for wartime service were generally enacted during particular war and only c overed service during that war not for either past or prospective periods of c onflict although 329 of the ina as enacted in 1952 included world wars i and ii it ma provision for future periods as consequence congress enacted laws to include the korean war and the vietnam war in 1968 congress amended 329 of the ina to provide that the president is to designate by executive order such peri ods when the armed forces of the united states are engaged in armed conflict with hostile foreign force not every deployment of us forces to an area where armed conflict occurred has been designated as period of hostilities since the executive order designating the termination of the vietnam war for naturalization purposes only two additional periods of hostilities have been designated for such purposes president clinton designated the persian gulf conflict as period of hostilities and in 2002 president bush designated the war on terrorism beginning on september 11 2001 as period of hostilities16 although president reagan desi gnated the grenada campaign as period of hostilities federal court invalidated it entirely because in contravention of statutory guidelines for such designations the executive order attempted to limit the expedited naturalization benefit to pers ons who served in certain geographic areas and the record showed that the president would not have designated the campaign as period of hostilities without the geographic limitations17 as result of the decision president clinton revoked the earlier grenada designation18 military actions in somalia bosnia ko sovo haiti and pana ma have not been designated as period of hostilities alt hough us forces faced hostile conditions special issues arose with regard to filipinos who

veterans were exempted from the requirement of having been admitted to lawful permanent residence to the united states or having enlisted or reenlisted in the united states subsequent amendments enabled naturalization processi ng to be conducted in the philippines however such special considerations only applied to applications filed by february 2 1995 special consideration was also extended to members of hmong guerilla units that aided the us military during the vietnam war era the hmong veterans naturalization act of 200021 provided an exemption from the english language requirement and special consideration for civics testing for laotian refugees who supported the us armed forces as members of guerrilla or irregular forces in laos during the vietnam war period of hostilities these special provisions also cover widows and spouses of such guerrilla veterans who were also admitted as laotian refugees the spouses of living veterans ve to have been married to the veteran at the time such veteran sought admission into the united states as refugee the number of beneficiaries under this statute was limited to 45000 the special provisions only applied to na turalization applications f iled by veteran or spouse within three years after may 26 2000 or by veterans widow within three years after november 1 2000 during the 1950s there was special stat ute authorizing naturalization for those aliens who had enlisted outside the united states and had not been admitted to the united states as lprs popularly known as the lodge act22 it was originally enacted in 1950 and was periodically exte nded during the 1950s finally expiring on july 1 1959 notwithstanding that service was not during specified period of hostilities the act authorized naturaliza tion under 329 of an

in the military prior to operation iraqi freedom in february 2003 there were total of 57754 foreign nationals serving in the us ar med forces of these over 37000 noncitizens served among the 14

petitions pending with uscis as well as foreign nationals who are part of households with mixed immigrant and citizenship statuses this shift is likely due to several factors most notably the number of foreign nationals who became citizens since 2003 and deplenished number of foreign nationals eligible to serve foreign nationals from the philippines appear to comprise the largest single country of citizenship for aliens in th armed forces although the dod does not have native country data for bout 25000 foreig n nationals in the military and does not have citizenship data for almost 22000

fingerprints from military service members had already been partly addressed by uscis the fingerprint requirement is not in the statutes or regulations governing naturalization rather it is the practice to submit these to be used in conducting the criminal background check on naturalization applicants in testimony before the senate committee on armed forces director emilio gonzalez of the uscis noted that uscis in collaboration with the dod and the federal bureau of i nvestigation fbi had instituted change in the fingerprinting process permitting u s military personnel to sign release authorizing the use of fingerprints provided at enlistment for immigration purposes59 however recent congressional hearing tes timony alleged that fbi processing of fingerprints still accounts for significan t delays despite the acceptance of dod fingerprints60 aside from these public laws s 2840 as marked up and ordered reported61 would expedite certain military servicerelated applications by establishing fbiliaison office in uscis to monitor the completion of fbi background checks and by establishing deadline for processing ch naturalization applications these requirements would apply to naturalization applications filed by or on behalf of current and former service members based on military service the spouses of current service members posted abroad surviving spouses and children of service members who died on activeduty service and deceased service members eligible for posthumous citizenship if uscis could not meet the deadline it would be required to give the applicant an explanation for the delay and an estimate for the completion date the bill would also require the director of uscis to submit to the relevant congressional oversight subc ommittees annual reports iden tifying every application covered by the requirements of the bill that is not processed and adjudicated within one year after filing due to delays in required background checks within 180 days of enactment the comptroller general would be required to submit to congress report regarding the average length of time taken by uscis to process and adjudicate applications for naturalizati on filed by or on behalf of members of the us armed forces deceased members of the armed for ces and their spouses and children the amendments to current law proposed by s 2840 would sunset five years after the date of enactmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31884crs24 hr 6020 would expand the scope of military naturalizations by inter alia 1 providing that persons serving honorably in the armed forces in support of contingency operations as defined at 10 u sc 101a13 woul d be eligible for naturalization based in ina 329 as if they had served during designated period of hostilities 2 increasing the period within which person may file an application under ina 328 8 usc 1439 after termina tion of service from six months to one year and 3 eliminating the need to allege satisfaction of certain requirements during periods when service was not continuous the bill would eliminate conditional lpr status for certain alien spouses sons or daughters who are memb ers or veterans of the armed forces and the requirement that service member petitioning for removal of conditional status for an alien spouse s on or daughter must appear for personal interview removal proceedings could not be initiated agains t an alien who has served or is serving honorably in the ar med forces w ithout th approval of the director of the uscis or the assistant secretary of homeland security for us immigration and customs enforcement after consideration of certain factors aliens who have served or are serving honorably in the armed forces would not be subject to expedited removal proceedings or reinstatement of removal

sibling of member of the armed forces any other ground of inadmissibility or deportation except for national security grounds and inadmissibility for drug trafficking could be waived at the discretion of the secretary of homeland security or the ttorney general spouses and children of an lpr serving in the armed forces would not be subject to the numerical limits on visas for the spouses and children of an lpr the status of an alien spouse child daughter parent or minor sibling of an eligible member of the armed forces shall be adjusted to that of an lpr if such alien 1 applies for adjustment and is in the united states on the date of filing such application 2 is admissible as an immigrant and 3 pays fee determined by the secretary of homeland security certain grounds of inadmissibility would not pply to such adjustment of status and certain other grounds could be waived at th discretion of the secretary of homeland security this benefit would be available for two years after the death of an eligible member of the armed forces whose death resulted from injurydisease incurred in or aggravated by hisher service in the armed forces an eligible member of the armed forces would include 1 us citizen who is serving or has served honorably as member of the selected reserve of the ready reserve or on active duty during period of hostilities and 2 an alien who is eligible for naturalization under ina 329 s 1348 one of the comprehensive immig ration reform bills included the dream act 621632 with its provision that two years of military service honorable discharge if discharged may sa tisfy one of the requirements for achieving unconditional lpr status this would be available to an undocumented alien who has initially been granted conditional lpr status as person who has been continuously physically present in the ited states after initially entering while under the age of 16 years among other qualifications section 751 of s 1348 would amend ina 329 to provide that persons who are not us citizens shall not be denied th opportunity to serve in the us armed forces and that with the approval of the chain of command an alien who

third the alien must take the naturalization oath of allegiance the alien shall be naturalized not later than 90 days after satisfying the requirements of this provision hr 1745 would provide immigration benef its to the immediate relatives of an active duty or reserve member of the armed forces it would waive inadmissibility of such immediate relatives based on misrepresentation of material fact in order to procure an immigration benefit or on false claim of citizenship for any purpose or benefit under any federal or state w the bill would also extend the v nonimmigrant visa to military families v vi sas enable the spouses and children of lprs who filed familybased immigrant petitions before december 21 2000 and are awaiting the availability of an immigrant visa to enter and wait in the united states for the immigrant visa if the petiti on or the visa availa bility if the petition was approved has been pending for three years or longer the bill would permit the spouses and children of active duty or re serve military personnel to receive v visa regardless of when the petition was filed or how long the petition or visa had been pending although not directly involving military service with regard to the naturalization of lprs originally admitted into the united states as special immigrant iraqi or afghani translat ors or interpreters pl 1103662 provides that time spent abroad as translator or interpreter for the us department of state or armed forces shall not be considered to break any period for which continuous residence in the united states is required for naturalization current issues waiver or dod adjudication of naturalization requirements although pl 108136 and close cooperati on between the dod and uscis of the dhs appear to have facilitated the natu ralization of military service personnel particularly of those serving abroad s upporters of military serv ice members advocate further streamlining of the process bey ond the provisions recently enacted in the 110th congress some proposals would make naturalization au tomatic for persons who are deployed to combat zone waiv ing any requirement for demonstrating good moral character or knowledge of civics or english critics of such proposals although acknowledging the sacrifice and contribution of military personnel in combat zone urge caution when considering eliminating substantive requirements such as good moral character supporters of such proposals argue that persons serving in the military can be assumed to have working knowledge of english and that an allegiance to the principles of us government and good moral character can be fairly attributed to pe rsons serving honorably in combat zone justifying thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31884crs26 63 margaret d stock

international law on immigration needs of americas fighting men and women p 6 may 20 2008 hereinafter stock written testimonywaiver of any technical test of civics nd english or necessity of demonstrating good moral character independently furthermor once person is deployed to combat zone the timely processing of naturalization application becomes more urgent other proposals would not waive requireme nts for good moral character civics and english but would authorize the chain of command in the dod to determine whether military service member satisfies these requirements proponents assert that the commanding officers of military service member would be better able than uscis adjudicator to judge whether that service member satisfies the requirements opponents note that it would burden military officers with having to learn immigration law and act as immigration adjudicator and that commanding officers may inadvertently take into account factors that are not re levant to naturalization adjudication or may even interject pers onal knowledge and biases in the process more limited proposals would permit certain requireme nts for naturalization processing to be satisfied by equivalent requirements or functions satisfied by the dod such as medical physical examinations providing immigration benefi ts for immediate relatives there is currently special relief from removal nor special consideration for permitting aliens waiting for an immigrant visa to enter or remain in the united states based on whether the alien is an immediate relative of military service members advocates of special immigration benefits for family members of military personnel frame such benefits as consideration extended to the military pers onnel to relieve them of anxiety and uncertainty concerning the status of family members while they are on active duty particularly if they are deploy ed abroad in hostile area supporters of current law argue that family members s hould not receive speci treatment because they happen to be related to us military service member they warn that expansion of removal relief and other immigration benefits to family members would have implications beyond the desire to assist us military personnel in addition to such substantive relief for family members of military service members there are certain procedural complications or delays reportedly medical examinations required for application for an immigrant visa for admission to the united states as an immigrant or for adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence cannot be performed by most military physicians because they are not recognized by dhs as being qualified to perform such examinations thus imposing on military families the time and expense of obtaining examinations from dhs designated physicians63 under ina 232 8 usc 1222 8 cfr 2322 and 42 cfr part 34 medical officers of th us public health service and dhs designated civil surgeons with at least four years of professional experience are authorized to conduct medical examina tions of aliens for immigration purposes civil surgeons with less than four years of experience may be designated

immigrants described in ina 101a27k 8 usc 1101a27k defini ng certain aliens who enlisted in the us armed forces abroad as special immigrants64 aside from this limited purpose it appears that military physicians are not considered to be civil surgeons for the purpose of conducting immigra tionrelated medical ex aminations therefore legislation would be necessary to mandate that military physicians be considered civil surgeons for medical examinations required for the family of service members prosecutorial discretion in removal of us service members current policy guidelines of us customs and immigration enforcement ice direct that military service be taken into consideration in determining whether prosecutorial discretion should be exercised in favor of an alien subject to removal particularly an alien eligible for naturalization based on military service65 the policy disfavors but does not absolutely preclude initiating and pursuing removal actions against members of the us armed forces and reportedly some ice officers are doing so66 in any case the policy is not grounded in statutory requirement therefore ice officials could choose to rescind or modify the policy at their discretion legislation would be n ecessary to make such policy permanent part of the immigration statutes andor to strengthen favorable exercise of discretion or prohibit prosecution of removal proceedings against current or former service members proponents of such legislati on argue that removal actions unnecessarily subject service members who are likely to be granted militaryservicebased naturalization to the time expense and stress of having to defend against such actions burden the federal government and us taxpayers with the expense of prosecuting such actions which are likely moot and undermine the needs and effectiveness of the us armed forces when active service members must take time away from their duties to defend agains t such actions and potentially could be
