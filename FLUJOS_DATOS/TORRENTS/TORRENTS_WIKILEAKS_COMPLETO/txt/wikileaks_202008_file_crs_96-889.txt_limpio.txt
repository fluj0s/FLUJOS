defense costind and defense industries updated december 3 1997 shirley kan analyst in foreign affairs foreign affairs and national defense division congressional research service the library of congress abstract the purpose of this crs report is to examine the origins and command roles and influence of the commission of science technology and industry for national defense costind an important military organization that plays role in chinas weapon programs sales of civilian goods acquisition of military technology and arms sales and export controls under costinds centralized coordination chinas military facilities and defense industries were to be made more efficient and effective costind is in charge of military research and development testing and production in the military and in the defense industries chinas defense industries comprise six stateowned sectors electronics nuclear aviation spacemissiles ordnance and shipbuilding there are now large state owned corporations in these defenseindustrial sectors and they engage in both military and civilian business the future of costind will be tied to whether it can resolve persistent problems in equipping the pla with modern weapons and continuing to restructure chinas immense defenseindustrial complex this crs report covers costind before its reorganization under the state council in march 1998 in an effort to separate weapon producers from buyers in the pla this report will not be further updated china commission of science technology and industry for national defense costind and defense industries summary congressional interest in the chinese military or peoples liberation army pla has increased as result of the march 1996 tensions in the taiwan strait continuing allegations of chinese proliferation of technology useful in weapons of mass destruction and reports that some chinese defenserelated corporations have circumvented us export controls to acquire dualuse technology the commission of science technology and industry for national defense costind an important highlevel pla organization plays role in chinas weapon programs sales of civilian goods acquisition of military technology and arms sales and export controls the purpose of this crs report is to examine the origins and command roles and influence of costind costind was founded in july 1982 through the consolidation of multiple organizations concerned with weapon programs costind answers to two superior organizations the state council the highest governmental organ and the central military commission cmc of the chinese communist party the highest command of the military however costind belongs to the peoples liberation army pla organizational system commanded by the cmc costinds new director is lieutenant general cao gangchuan who has the bureaucratic rank of minister under costinds centralized coordination chinas military facilities and defense industries were to be made more efficient and effective costind is in charge of military research and development testing and production in the military and in the defense industries chinas defense industries comprise six stateowned sectors electronics nuclear aviation spacemissiles ordnance and shipbuilding there are now large stateowned corporations in these defenseindustrial sectors and they engage in both military and civilian business over time costind has acquired further perhaps competing roles as chinas interests evolved in addition to overseeing weapon development and production costind has also facilitated civilian commercial deals increased weapon and technology acquisition from foreign countries promoted foreign arms sales and taken on export control and nonproliferation roles costind has exercised considerable influence such influence includes political influence through personal access to top leaders foreign policy influence through some control over foreign arms sales military influence over weapon modernization and economic influence through responsibility for the defense industries which are part of the debilitated stateowned sector recently however there has been debate about whether constinds influence has weakened since the 1980s chinas economic reforms leadership changes in costind and continuing systemic problems in the defense sector may have eroded costinds influence the future of costind will be tied to whether the current director can resolve the problems in equipping the pla with modern weapons and continuing to restructure chinas immense defenseindustrial complex

the commission of science technology and industry for national defense costind an important highlevel pla organization plays role in chinas weapon programs sales of civilian goods acquisition of military technology and arms sales and export controls this report describes the origins and command roles and influence of costind in the pla and the defense industries in addition two subordinate organizations of costind will be discussed the china association for peaceful use of military industrial technology capumit and the china defense science and technology information center cdstic origins and command costind was founded in july 1982 through the consolidation of multiple organizations concerned with defense research and development and production the national defense industry office the national defense science and technology commission and the office of the science technology and equipment committee of the central military commission cmc were merged to form costind2

gangchuan who was appointed in december 1996 four of the five deputy directors are lieutenant generals shen rongjun xie guang huai guomo and shen chunnian defenserelated roles costind plays important roles in chinas defense modernization those roles involve implementation of chinas defense policy concerning weapon research and development and production diversification of defense industries to integrate military and civilian production technology acquisition and intelligence collection and arms export and export control defense policy implementation costind has been called one of the four large general headquarters of the pla5 costind is an influential player in carrying out chinese defense policy including weapon programs and resource allocations this policy is said to be formulated in piecemeal fashion by the plas general staff department for military operations and plans the national defense university for background and doctrinal analysis and costind for research and planning on weapons technology and systems in addition costind controls vast amount of personnel units and bases6 for example costind director general ding henggao wrote that to further the implementation of the 863 plan hightechnology research and development plan costind over ten years organized 5600 scientists and technicians from nine departments in 16 provinces and cities to concentrate their research in the aerospace and laser technology fields7 also many locallevel offices concerned with defense industries throughout china are part of costinds system or network one study of the defense complex finds that costind controls large budget to fund defense research development and production while there is range of different estimates this study speculates that chinas defenseindustrial complex may include as many as 50000 factories research academies and other facilities with possibly five million personnel whole towns some secret are part of this immense 4 china today defense

coordination among weaponsrelated organizations it exercises both direct and indirect influence costind controls satellite launch sites and all aspects of nuclear weapons development it also derives influence from allocating funds for weapons procurement and development and setting priorities9 rand study concludes that costind is the plas fourth most influential organizational player in devising and supervising defense policy10 according to chinese study on the defense industries published by costindaffiliated press costind is the leading body by which the cmc conducts centralized control of the defense science and technology of the whole pla it is also the leading organization under the state council to conduct unified management of defense science technology and industry 11 under the state council chinas defenseindustrial complex has consisted of six sectors electronics nuclear aviation spacemissiles ordnance and shipbuilding five of the six sectors were restructured from ministries to state corporations china national nuclear corporation aviation industries corporation of china china aerospace corporation china north industries group norinco and china state shipbuilding corporation meanwhile the ministry of electronics industry is also known as the china electronics industry corporation12 thus costind sets policy and planning for weaponsrelated research and development in military facilities as well as in defenseindustrial facilities for example after the persian gulf war costind deputy director shen rongjun called for chinas weapon development programs to focus on hightechnology especially electronics and military applications of satellites13 the chinese study on the defense industries also described the following tasks assigned to costind study trends in development of weapon systems and equipment organize efforts to modify weapons and to conduct tactical and technical evaluations research design trial production testing certification and serial production of new types of weapon systems and equipment 8 cheung tai ming chinas defenseindustrial complex in the 1990s the long march to modernization and commercialization 1993 9 ostrov

nuclear and space industries appear to give costind close relationship with the second artillery costind and the cmc direct the chinese academy of engineering physics which runs chinas nuclear weapon laboratories15 according to an expert on chinas defense industries costind runs chinas spacemissile program and operates front companies such as the china satellite launch agents ltd16 another organization china satellite launching and tracking control is also subordinate to costind17 in short costind carries out its part of defense policy by coordinating and controlling research and development production and acquisition of advanced technology and weapons by the many organizations involved organizations may be military services or commands bases ministries factories research academies universities or corporations centralized coordination is also needed because the various organizations are in two hierarchical systems the military and the state owned defense industries diversification of defense industries integrating military and civilian production study on the rise and fall of the national defense science and technology commission one of costinds predecessors explained that the creation of costind was intended to eliminate the past conflicts between the military research and development sector and the production sector by combining them in one organization costind was initially formed to improve efficiency and effectiveness of military research and development and production efforts costinds role however has been broadened to closely integrate the civilian and military sectors of research and development and production18 14 china today p 121122 15 norris robert s andrew s burrows and richard w fieldhouse nuclear weapons databook british french

mission of developing defense and civilian production in january 1982 deng articulated 16character policy combine military with civilian peace with wartime military take priority nurture military with civilian this policy is referred to as the militarycivilian combination policy19 in practice although deng intended military modernization to continue to be treated with priority decline in military procurement and budgets and drive toward commercialization in china have made civilian profitmaking competing goal pla and defenseindustrial enterprises have been exhorted to diversify production to include profitable civilian or dualuse civilian or military goods20 an official estimate says that civilian products now account for roughly 80 of the total output value in the defense industries21 most likely much of this commercial value has been added by the few successful defenserelated industries electronics aerospace including satellite launches for chinese organizations and foreign businesses aviation and shipbuilding even with the policy of combining military and civilian production many of chinas defense industries are in financial trouble according to an oecd study only about 40 of defenseindustrial enterprises earn regular profits another 40 make occasional profits but are not necessarily profitable the remaining 20 have not developed civilian operations and are drain on government revenues22 nonetheless the diversification drive toward civilian production is intended to serve the defense industries as well as the national economy at national conference on defense science technology and industry into the 21st century attendees agreed on three recommendations 1 concentrate on the development of high and newtechnology industries 2 develop technologies that serve both military and civilian objectives and 3 actively apply civilian technology especially electronic information and manufacturing technology to military research and production23 19 china today p 159

general chi haotian vice chairman of the cmc and chinas minister of defense wrote in april 1996 that the military enterprises transferred to the production of goods for civilian use must pay attention to retaining the capabilities of producing military supplies general chi also urged increased application of military technology to civilian use as well as application of civilian technology to military fields and the development of dualuse technology24 through the china association for peaceful use of military industrial technology or capumit costind promotes domestically and internationally its public relations concerning civilian production capumit also facilitates business deals for chinas defenserelated factories research institutes and other enterprises especially with foreign companies in july 1993 capumit together with united nations organization held large exhibition in hong kong called the 1993 hong kong conference and exhibition on international cooperation to promote conversion from military to civilian industry many chinese defense enterprises including those in the ordnance aerospace electronics shipbuilding weapons and nuclear industries as well as pla corporations such as china xinxing group under the general logistics department promoted projects seeking foreign investments25 capumits publicity materials tout it as civilian organization founded in 1986 to promote the peaceful use of military industrial technology it operates under the guidance of costind the state planning commission and the state science and technology commission its members include enterprises and institutes in chinas defense industry lieutenant general huai guomo one of costinds deputy directors is an honorary chairman of capumit the organization of capumit according to the materials consists of general assembly at the top with council subordinate to the assembly subordinate to the council are four organizations general office development and exchange department science and technology development department and international liaison department technology acquisition and intelligence collection since the early 1980s acquisition of advanced foreign technology to apply to weapons production appears to have been an increasingly important objective of costind in carrying out defense policy to further technology acquisition beginning in 1980 the state council and the cmc set up state corporations under various defenserelated offices commissions and ministries costinds new era corporation for example was established at this time the corporations were allowed to conduct import and export of civilian and military goods the compendium on chinas defense industries states that on the basis of adhering to 24 chi haotian taking the road of national defense modernization which conforms to chinas national conditions and reflects the characteristics of the times my understanding acquired from the study of comrade jiang zemins

international technical exchanges and cooperation to import some advanced technology from few countries to provide better platforms for launching independent designs and upgrade the modernization of military equipment26 the us defense intelligence agency dia apprises that chinas defense industrial organizations are key to supporting the uniformed services and chinas industrial base and to acquiring military and dualuse technology in addition to new era xinshidai corporation other important defense trading corporations directly under costinds control are yuanwang group corporation and galaxy new technology corporation besides these corporations two key supporting organizations are capumit already discussed and cdstic27 yuanwang corporation reportedly created company in california called technology selection inc to transfer us technology to china28 galaxy new technology corporation set up sinous joint venture called hua mei telecommunications to acquire advanced telecommunications technology useful for chinas military29 as part of its function in acquiring advanced technology with military applications costind collects intelligence both overtly and covertly according to study of chinese intelligence operations costind is one of chinas secondary intelligence organizations members of costind have attempted to steal foreign especially american technology for military applications costind technical experts principally posing as businesspeople working for the new era corporation travel overseas to collect information and identify what technology or weapons systems are needed they have reportedly tried to clandestinely acquire us technology which has not been approved for export another cover for costind personnel has been the poly technologies corporation also known as baoli which is corporation under the general staff departments equipment and technology department30 in addition within costind is an intelligence research institute established on march 14 1959 before costinds genesis the intelligence research institute sends its personnel to foreign countries as students or visiting fellows and encourages them to participate in professional associations and academic activities this intelligence research institute is also known in open and international fora as the china defense science and technology information center or cdstic31 26 china today p 158 27 blasko et 28 greenberger robert s lets make deal chinese find bargains in defense equipment as firms unload assets wall street journal october 21 1996 p 1 29 gilley

and domestic and foreign exchanges for example on october 26 1995 cdstic held seminar in china on military technical revolution with participants from the academy of military sciences national defense university armed services and defense industries32 cdstic also houses department of arms control and disarmament studies whose experts are allowed to travel abroad hold discussions with foreigners about arms control and military issues and publish articles33 cdstic publishes journal in hong kong called conmilit or contemporary military affairs in chinese its promotional information says that cdstic was founded on march 14 1959 and is an institute directly subordinate to costind cdstic specializes in research on defense science and technology and is staffed by hundreds of researchers and technical experts covering wide range of specialties cdstic takes pride in having chinas most advanced information processing facilities including computer system backed by comprehensive databases cdstic also houses library with two million technical papers and scientific journals34 arms export and export control through supervision of its subordinate corporations and coordination of other defenserelated corporations costind plays role in chinas foreign arms sales and export control for example it was costind which on december 5 1984 approved the aerospace ministrys plan to develop produce and export m9 short range ballistic missiles35 in theory arms sales may be coordinated by costind the plas general staff department the ministry of foreign affairs and other departments in reality the general staff department and costind are believed to have the final authority corporations might consult with the foreign ministry over sensitive sales36 costind also participates in formal structure for export controls as china has become sensitive to foreign concerns over proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and has increased participation in arms control and nonproliferation efforts in november 1995 the state council issued the first chinese defense white paper which shed some light on chinas enigmatic export controls in the section on exercising strict control over military weapons and technology transfers the 31 continued beijing national defense industry press 1989 p 514516 32 cited in gill bates china and the revolution in military affairs

wilson and hua di chinas ballistic missile programs international security fall 1992 p 3435 36 lewis et beijings defense establishment p 89 95 crs9 white paper stated that the state council and the cmc set up the state administrative committee on military products trade sacmpt to exercise centralized control over military exports the primary members of this committee are representatives of the ministry of foreign affairs general staff department costind the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation and other departments37 in september 1997 china issued new regulations to control nuclear exports in part to ameliorate us concerns in considering the implementation of the 1985 us china agreement on nuclear cooperation the china atomic energy agency caea38 costind and the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation moftec are primarily responsible for implementation of the regulations costinds important role in strategic arms control policy partly derives from its supervision of the chinese academy of engineering physics which runs chinas nuclear weapons laboratories39 and the china national nuclear corporation which produces stores and controls all fissile materials40 influence as can seen in the previous discussion costind has exercised considerable influence costind has derived political influence from its director who is high level military officer through the previous director general ding henggao costind also enjoyed access to the top leaders through his family connections ding director from 1985 to 1996 is the soninlaw of the late marshal nie rongzhen who was an important leader of chinas defense industrial efforts dings wife nie li was lieutenant general and vice chairman of the science and technology committee of costind until her retirement in 1994 such nepotism at costind exemplified widespread effort beginning in the 1980s by children of top leaders also referred to as princelings to acquire lucrative and highlevel positions dings connections provided costind access to top leaders and important political influence in addition the commission has economic influence through its responsibility for the financial health of the immense defenseindustrial complex and role in facilitating civilian business costind has played in role in defense policy as ministrylevel organization overseeing weapon modernization 37 information office of the state council of the peoples republic of china china arms control and disarmament november 1995 38 caea is part of the china national nuclear corporation cnnc which represents chinas

proliferation activities and exports to them require license from the bureau of export administration 40 frieman wendy chinese arms control organizations basic primer washington saic corporation february 27 1995 p 78 crs10 programs and foreign technology acquisition it even has some influence in chinas foreign policy through its authority over arms sales and its increasing role in export control however there has been recent debate about whether costinds influence while still considerable is in decline there are several factors that point to decrease in costinds authority since the early 1980s first as part of the overall trends of commercialization and decentralization in china costinds control over the defense industries has weakened dia notes that few of the larger defense production facilities and complexes have formed their own corporations in recent years and apparently are seeking to operate somewhat independently of nationallevel organizations41 moreover some analysts believe that the state corporations retain their profits from civilian sales and are not required to submit such revenues to costind it is uncertain what share of profits from military sales are returned to costind for defense research and development and production in any case chinese foreign arms sales have dropped since the 1980s it can also be assumed that enterprises tend to underreport revenues to retain more of the profits and that different deals have different profitsharing arrangements according to one study the pla is allowed to keep part of the profits from arms sales while costind and the general staff department are supposed to direct how those funds will be spent the ministry of finance is also supposed to receive part of the revenue to add to chinas foreign exchange reserves then there are of course individual sales commissions for chinas movers and shakers42 in short increasingly profitable and independent defenseindustrial corporations have recently relied less on costinds allocations economic reforms have also initiated responsibility or contract systems in china costinds logistics system has likewise implemented contract system in research and development projects the contract system aims to ensure that timeliness and quality goals are met while competition reduces the costs43 contract system has likely reduced costinds control over weapon programs second economic reforms and drop in military procurement have resulted in decline in defenseindustrial output as share of the total industrial output of china one report estimates that stateowned enterprises now account for perhaps half of chinas total industrial output among them the defenseindustrial sector now accounts for about 12 of the gross output of all stateowned enterprises44 41 blasko et 42 lewis et beijing defense establishment p 103 43 fan juwei and kuoshan commission of science technology and industry for national defense provides effective support for scientific research in national defense liberation army daily may 22 1996 translated in fbischi 44 berthelemy and deger p 44 crs11 third leadership changes have also affected costinds influence nie rongzhen died and nie li has retired general ding henggao was replaced in december 1996 by lieutenant general cao gangchuan dings retirement removed longtime powerholder whose patrons were leaders of the revolutionary generation costind however may find powerful patron in general chi haotian who is considered to have an important relationship to costind45 in october 1995 chinas president and cmc chairman jiang zemin promoted chi along with zhang wannian to cmc vice chairman in preparation for the retirements of the more senior vice chairmen generals liu huaqing and zhang zhen lieutenant general caos appointment surprised those who expected the promotion of deputy director from within costind instead the top leaders transferred cao from his position in the general staff department as deputy chief of general staff of the pla caos reassignment likely reflects the top leaderships new priority on meeting the plas requirements for modern equipment especially from russian israeli and other foreign sources cao can be expected to advocate the immediate needs of the pla for modern weapons perhaps over the needs of the defense industries to continue research and development of indigenous designs another indicator of caos priorities and chinas turn to greater use of foreign military technology is the decision announced in july 1997 to open the defense industries to foreign investors costind and the equipment department of the plas general staff department made the decision reported the china daily costind the equipment department and the ministry of electronics industry plan to hold in 1998 the first china international defense electronics exhibition to attract us and other foreign defense manufacturers to market in china last but not least costinds prestige may have declined over the last decade as chinas defense industries continue to suffer systemic problems despite the creation of costind acquisitions of foreign weapon systems such as the russian su27 fighter indicate that indigenous defense programs are not satisfying the plas immediate needs according to experts chinese military research and development production and deployment still suffer lack of central oversight and interconnectedness the defense industries are still fragmented and said to be almost feudal46 conclusion deng xiaoping and other chinese leaders formed costind in 1982 with ambitious aims under costinds centralized coordination chinas defense industries were to be made more efficient and effective over time however costind has taken on additional sometimes competing roles as chinas 45 swaine michael d the military and political succession in china rand corporation 1992 p 7172 46 bitzinger richard and bates gill gearing up for hightech warfare washington center for strategic and budgetary assessments february 1996 crs12 interests evolved in addition to overseeing weapon development and production costind has also facilitated civilian commercial deals increased weapon and technology acquisition from foreign countries promoted foreign arms sales and taken on export control and nonproliferation roles due to the status and connections of its leaders vast resources and the importance of its roles costind has exercised considerable influence at the same time chinas economic reforms changes in the leadership and continuing systemic problems in the defense sector may have weakened costinds influence the future of costind will be tied to whether the current director can resolve the problems in equipping the pla with modern weapons and continuing to restructure chinas immense defenseindustrial complex this restructuring will also affect the fate of chinas entire debilitated stateowned sector for other versions of this document see
