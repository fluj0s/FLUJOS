background and legisla tive proposals 109th congress by r eric petersen this report will be updated as necessary enforcement of statutory restrictions1 studies occasionally use the term legal fiction to desc ribe statutory restric tions on executive lobbying2 this reputation comes from some ambiguity and ambivalence in congressional policy as well as enforcement decisions by the department of justice even those who advocate selective restrictions on departmental lobbying understand that the gislative process depends on free flow of information from the executive branch to congress nevertheless certain types of executive branch lobbying have b een found offensive to lawmakers and have prompted statutory limitations principal statutory restriction 18 us c 1913 recognizes both the need for executive lobbying and the need for limitati ons after prohibiting certain executive practices the statute provides that it shall not prevent officers or employees of the united states or of its departments or agencies from communicating to any such member ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22209crs2 3 ancher nelsen lobbying by the administration in we propose modern congress 145 new york

of the public business critics of executive lobbying realize that agencies n eed some latitude in promoting their own programs as one legislator remarked cer tainly any administration should be expected to use all legal means at its disposal to encourage acceptance of its programs3 statutory sanctions against executive l obbying have had limited effect because of uncertainty about the law and justice department interpreta tions because of conflicting statutes and interpretations it is sometimes difficult to find violation of agency activity on february 17 2005 comptrolle r general david m walker objected to agencies using appropriated funds to produce or distribute prepackaged news stories intended to be viewed by television audiences that conceal or do not clearly identify for the television viewing audience that the agency was the source of those materials month later joshua b bolten director of the offi ce of management and budget issued memorandum stating that the governme nt accountability office gao opinion conflicted with the view of the justice department and it is the justice department and not the gao that provides the controlling interpretations of law for the executive branch4 under article ii section 3 of the cons titution presidents have right to give congress information on the state of the uni on and to recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient vice presidents and members of the presidents cabinet enjoy broad di scretion to speak out on public issues the justice department has taken the position that agency heads may use the facilities of their institutions to address unsolicited letters to members of congress with respect to pending legislation5 executive department officials are free to publicly advance administration and department positions even to the exte nt of calling on the public to encourage members of congress to s upport administration positions6 the comptroller general stated in 1977 we have consistently recogniz ed that any agency has legitimate interest in communicating with the public and with legislators regarding its policies and activities7 even with regard to the president however the justice department has cautioned against grassroots appeals even by the president that involve substantial expenditures of appropria ted funds for such things as levision or radi time newspaper or magazine advertisements or mass unsolicited distribu tion of printed materials8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22209crs3 9 legislative activities of executive agencies

and other stimuli originating from w ithin an administration the gao and the former bureau of the budget have objected to agency publications that are proselytizing in tone and propagandistic in substance9 the justice department has pointed out that the right of citizens to lobby congress does not mean right to use federal funds for that purpose although private persons and organi zations have right to petition congress and to disseminate their views freely they can be expected within the framework established by the constitution to do their lobby ing at their own expense they have inherent or implicit right to use federal funds for that pur pose unless congress has given them that right10 statutory limit on publicity experts with bipartisan backing congress in 1913 stipulated in an appropriations bill m oney appropriated by th is or any other act shall be used for the compensation of any pub licity expert unless specifically appropriated for that purpose11 this statutory restriction res ponded to what legislators from both parties considered pattern of agency abus representative frederick gillett sponsored this provision after learning that the ci vil service commission had advertised for publicity expert in the department of agricu lture the csc circular explained that the publicity expert would prepare news matter nd secure the publication of such items in various periodicals and newspapers to representative gillette it did not seem proper for any department of the g overnment to employ person simply as press agent to advertise the work and doings of that depa rtment and it is to prevent that in any department that this amendment is offered to clarify his amendment he agreed that nothing in it would prevent an employee of the department of agriculture from giving to the country information as to the work of the department12 i n t h t s n s t h amendment was aimed not at informative bulletins but rather at press releases intended to promote the agency and its mission agencies were able to circumvent this stat utory restriction in part by avoiding the position of publicity expert wh ile permitting positions for dir ector of information chief educational officer supervisor of information research direct or of publications and other imaginative titles13 although the 1913 legislation re mains part of permanent law 5 usc 3107 it has been substantially diluted by other statutes that specifically authorize and fund experts who publicize agen cy programs today it is commonplace for congress to supply funds to agencies and departments for public information officers the issue becomes whether thos officers supply basic inform ation to the public or step over the line and function as publicity expert gao does not view

congress was the practice of agencies using appropr iated funds to stimu late public support or opposition to pending legislation in 1919 c ongress passed language to prohibit that practice and this statutory restriction known as the lobbying with appropriated moneys act remains part of perm anent law 18 usc 1913 debate in the house of representatives in 1919 reveals that memb ers were offended by bureau chiefs and departmental heads writing letters throughout the country sending telegrams throughout the country for this organization for th is man for that company to write his congressman to wire his congressman in behalf of this or that legislation15 the statute currently provide s part of the money appropriated for any enactment of congress shall in the absence of express authorization

the introduction of an bill measure or resolution proposing such legislation law ratifi cation policy or appr opriation the restric tion was not intended to prevent agency employees from communicating

violations of section 1913 originally carried criminal penalty of fine imprisonment for not more than one year or both the employee after being given notice and hearing by the superior officer vested with the power of removing him shall be removed from office or employment the justice department never prosecuted anyone for violating this provision amendments in 2002 removed the criminal penalties and substituted civil penalties included in the title of the us code that covers contractors and grantees 31 usc 1352 authorization bills congress has found it necessary at times to enact specific constraints to prohibit executive agencies fro m lobbying on particular public issues for example after the civil rights commission decided to press its views on the abortion controversy congress enacted this language nothing in this chapter or any other acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22209crs5 17 42 usc 1975af 2000 this limitation first appeared in an authorization for the commission in 1978 92

prohibited from undertaking to influence the passage or defeat of any legislation by congress or by state or local legislative body but agency personne l may testify or make other appropriate communication when formally requested to do so by legislative body committee or member thereof or b in connection with legislation or appropriations directly affecting the activities of the corporation18 in 1987 congress responded to executive bran ch lobbying in support of the military forces in nicaragua by adding several sections to the foreign relations authorization act one sec tion prohibited the use of funds for political purposes funds authorized to be appropr iated by the statute or by any other statute authorizing funds for any entity engaged in any activity concerning the foreign affairs of the united states shall be used for these purposes 1 for publicity or propaganda purposes designed to support or defeat legislation pending before cong ress 2 to influence in any way the outcome of political election in th united states or 3 for any publicity or propaganda purposes not authorized by congress19 the justice department interpreted paragraph 3 to prohibit covert attempts to mold opinion through the use of third parties it also ruled that the administration was entitled to respond to media requests for oped pieces or interviews by referring the media to supporters of the contras in the pr ivate sector but it would be unwise for the administration to solicit the media to prin t articles by or interviews with anyone not serving in the government and of course the administration cannot assist in the preparation of any articles or statements by private sector supporters other than through the provision of inform ational materials20 private contractors

executive lobbying must be accompanied by persistent and determined congressional oversight fortified if necessary by sanctions in the form of reducing agency funds or withdrawing discretionary authority that agencies value and do not want to lose congressional hearings gao investigations and media coverage are effective in limiting agency abuse
