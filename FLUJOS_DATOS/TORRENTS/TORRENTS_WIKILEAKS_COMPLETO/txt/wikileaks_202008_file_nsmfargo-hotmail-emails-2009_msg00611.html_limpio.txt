lee bonorden contact austin daily herald published thursday july 30 2009 people ask all the time do you still read the herald since you retired i do and i think everybody should there now that i have fulfilled my retirement contract with the herald i can be honest with you reading the herald keeps in touch with life in austin and helps to avoid embarrassing social situations for instance fellow asked what did you think of that immigration reform rally in july fortunately i read about it in the herald the newspaper had front page story the following monday and whole page of pictures inside i confessed i did not attend the rally immigration reform is serious issue but this event was organized by man who identified himself as sympathizer with the national socialist movement whenever i want to learn more about immigration reform i avoid listening to members of that movement i dont know what they could add to the discussion the heralds account one that i can now view as reader of the paper searching for the truth reported confrontations between people estimated the crowd at 100 people and displayed pictures showing people pointing fingers faces contorted mouths open and handmade signs obviously the herald thought the immigration reform rally organized by selfavowed national socialist movement member was important enough to merit the extensive coverage the other news coverage that caused to take pause was headline chase subject in freeborn county jail the headline said it all i didnt have to read the story when deputies must chase prisoner in the nearly new freeborn county jail its the end of civilization as i know it i just hope the mower county commissioners saw that story too and are taking steps to insure that wont happen in our new county jail there are hundreds of offenders waiting to move into the new facility being built in downtown austin once theyre in jail prisoners should stay in their airconditioned cells watching cable tv reading girlie magazines calling friends on cell phones smuggled into the jail on visiting day surfing the internet for new facebook friends or waiting for trip to the dentist eye clinic or hospital to have doctor take look at that back ache suffered crawling out window during burglary attempt there should be need to chase subjects in jail enjoying the accommodations provided by taxpayers and dont get started about seeing that womans obituary photo next to the young couples engagement photo the other day putting an obituary next to an engagement is awkward to say the least i also read chicago suntimes columnist neil steinbergs july 6 effort headlined hamming it up at spam museum the columnist began by recounting his visit to johnnys main event restaurant and the less than satisfactory experience next he crossed north main street and visited the museum as far as humility well ive never been to corporate museum that said so many unenthusiastic things about its product such as eating spam is better than eating bugs uttered by lifesized video of fatigueclad soldier the columnist writes less than flattering account of visiting what is to austin sacred place in closing he suggests he received lackluster sales job on other local attractions and claimed the museum staff suggested he could stay at holiday inn in austin or wellington minn wellington never heard of the place theres plenty to read in any newspaper believing it to be true is the challenge this column included httpwwwpecomlocalnewsinlandstoriespe_news_local_s_hate304925cb1html racial hate group activity on increase in region nbsplisten to storynbsp download story podcast 0854 am pdt on thursday july 30 2009 by john asburythe pressenterprise fueled by anger over the economy immigration and the election of president barack obama white supremacists have been increasing in number in the inland region and throughout california during the past year local and national experts say the southern poverty law center which tracks hate activity reports 84 known hate groups in california the 2 state texas has 66 about dozen of those groups are in the inland area including riverside hemet san bernardino and temecula according to the center in the past year new chapter of the national socialist movement sect of the largest neonazi group in the country started in riverside according to riverside county sheriffs investigators and the antidefamation league the group has not been tied to criminal activity in the inland area authorities say story continues below click to enlarge if you look at the election of the first black president and the state of the economy being what it is today with unemployment at an alltime high these types of things are kind of perfect storm for these feelings to foment and for white supremacists to feel validated said joanna mendelson california investigative researcher for the antidefamation league civil rights advocacy group in addition to concerns about membership going up inland agencies are seeing few of the groups become more sophisticated and violent developing criminal organizations that dont just target minorities but are also branching into drugs and weapons trafficking those activities are easier to conceal in remote regions like some parts of the inland area said mendelson and inland authorities statistics on hate crimes committed and charges filed remain limited the most recent state attorney generals office report was based on crimes committed in 2007 but inland police and sheriffs investigators and national experts point to number of factors including recent violent attacks and rise in hate propaganda online as evidence that hate activity is on the rise here local law enforcement agencies are stepping up efforts to monitor hate groups such as racist skinhead organizations which commonly adopt aryan or newnazi beliefs and target people of certain races and religions the goal is to put violent offenders in prison and stop criminal groups before they gain too much power for example seven members of hemet skinhead group have been arrested in the november beating of hispanic man described by hemet police as backlash against obamas election san bernardino county authorities say they dismantled large skinhead organization this year that they suspect was involved in multiple murders and assaults in addition to the skinhead and neonazi groups on the southern poverty law centers list of inland southern california hate groups the center includes border security organization an antigay religious group and black separatist group which may be deemed intolerant but are not linked to crime or violence brian levin director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at cal state san bernardino said he believes the inland area has the largest number of hate groups in the united states when you look at the sheer number of groups in the inland empire to begin with it is significant he said breeding ground law enforcement officials say the inland area follows the pattern of other areas on the outskirts of larger cities where hate groups pop up amid white flight migration out of cities and suburbs that have become more developed and diverse southern california is prime location for recruiting of white supremacist gang members hemet police detective bob nishida said theyre looking for the type of people with neonazi beliefs and for this area generally speaking theres lot of people with those same beliefs though most of californias skinheads are not affiliated with any groups the inland area is an exception since the election weve seen an increased drive for groups to unite under one flag said san bernardino county sheriffs deputy eric ogaz in remote regions such as the high desert skinhead groups are more frequently holding unityfests joint meetings between different organizations to merge forces and have the potential to plan criminal activity he said authorities see such rallies as an effort to become more violent and instill fear into the community it makes more sense for them to act as unit ogaz said theres greater fight in dog working in the sense of pack this spring san bernardino county sheriffs deputies arrested seven members of the inland empire skins the suspects were accused of an october home invasion robbery and attempted murder in hesperia and conspiracy to commit murder of witness in san jacinto the group based in san bernardino and hesperia originated in 2002 its members often have tattoos of swastikas and other symbols of hate against blacks hispanics and homosexuals san bernardino county sheriff rod hoops said the department suspects the group is responsible for numerous murders and assaults the sheriffs department also has linked the group to gun trafficking to and from riverside county while the inland empire skins primarily target minorities ogaz said the october home invasion and attempted murder case targeted another skinhead who was selling drugs the organization is traditional sect of skinheads where members believe in remaining drugfree to keep their blood pure and they will go after anyone known to be using or selling drugs ogaz said the same day the suspects were arrested april 20 two women in the gang had arranged to give birth because it would have been adolf hitlers 120th birthday ogaz said motivations for hate while black people remain the most frequent target of white supremacists experts say hatred of hispanic immigrants is perhaps their fastestgrowing motivation both locally and nationally what weve been seeing is the growth driven by antiimmigrant propaganda said mark potok director of intelligence projects for the southern poverty law center the economic downturn also has played role in drawing people to white supremacist groups mendelson said two main scapegoats are hispanic immigrants who are blamed for taking jobs and jews blamed for the banking collapse she said the riverside county district attorneys office classifies racist skinhead organizations into two categories those traditionally focused on political ideology and those that commit crimes more like street gang there do seem to be more skinhead gangs with prison ties moving into the inland empire said nikolaus peterson riverside county deputy district attorney theyre not as motivated by hate as much as criminal control and dealing drugs other skinheads are opposed to racism and criminal activity he said you cant paint every shaved head with the same brush peterson said hollie schrack 24 of big bear city is member of coors family skins which stands for comrades of our racial struggle she said her racialist beliefs are not about hating others but about loving people of her own heritage other groups are allotted to have significant amount of pride and venues to idealize pride for their heritage she said its sad were not allowed to be proud of being white schrack said she doesnt consider herself white supremacist or superior to other races but she does discourage interracial relationships hemet police took notice of the coors gang last year following an august stabbing of another white supremacist who did not want to join the gang nishida said schrack denies race played factor in beating that police say coors members committed hispanic man was beaten into coma in hemet in november four members are charged with attacking the man while screaming white power according to hemet police coors members contend they were defending themselves after the man broke into one of their cars on the groups web site which schrack took down after the arrests the organization professed we hate with pure virtuous hatred anything or anyone that threatens our way of life or attempts to stand in the way of our racial preservation cracking down local law enforcement has begun trying to crack down on many of the white supremacist groups suspected of violent crimes and drugtrade involvement both the riverside and san bernardino county sheriffs departments have gang task forces that track the white supremacists in addition to other street gangs the hemet valley gang task force has joined with the riverside county sheriffs department and district attorneys office to add white supremacist groups to their gangprevention program gang officers are attempting to reach teens and their families to steer them away from violence said nishida since the coors arrests the gang has been dormant nishida said it hasnt gone away they seem to always come back he said theres high chance they probably will other than imprisoning group leaders and violent members authorities say little can be done to stop hate groups from forming or to change their ideologies if one group is dismantled oftentimes more quickly form still inland law enforcement agents say they are trying to stop the groups from gaining momentum by enforcement against smaller crimes the intention is that tracking groups and making arrests will prevent larger conspiracies from being carried out theres such thing as minor crime ogaz said if we dont treat these aggressively small crimes could fester and create communitywide tension commander
