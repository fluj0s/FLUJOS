agree to greatly increase what they were paying for the gas2 as 2006 ended russia appeared to be preparing to cut off natural gas supplies to belarus and georgia unless the two former soviet republics agreed by the yearend to pay much higher prices in 20073 the cutoffs to ukraine and moldova in pricedispute contexts damaged russias reputation as reliable energy supplier and reportedly have prompted former soviet union and west european countries to investigate where they might obtain nonrussian gas4 also reportedly during late 2006 price negotiations gazprom warned belarus that its failure to agree to higher prices could jeopardize the countrys energy supply5 6 in addition the actual and threatened cutoffs have provoked criticism that russia is using energy as political tool7
