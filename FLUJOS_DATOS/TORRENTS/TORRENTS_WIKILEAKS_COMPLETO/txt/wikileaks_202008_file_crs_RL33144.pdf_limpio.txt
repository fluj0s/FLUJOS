trade organization doha round trade negotiations has quickened as the july 2007 expiration for fasttrack or trade promotion authority for expedited congressional consideration of trade agreement legislation approaches although technical negotiations have addressed specific formulas for reducing tradedistorting farm support and tariffs highlevel political discussions have yet to produce satisfactory compromise among wto members for future agricultural trade liberalization negotiations were suspended in july 2006 when core group of wto member countriesthe united states the european union eu brazil india australia and japanknown as the g6 reached an impasse over specific methods to achieve the broad aims of the round for agricultural trade substantial reductions in tradedistorting domestic subsidies elimination of export subsidies and substantially increased market access for agricultural products the wto is unique among the various fora for international trade negotiations in that it brings together its entire 150country membership to negotiate common set of rules to govern international trade in agricultural products industrial goods and services regarding

foster mutual agreement doha round negotiators were operating under deadline effectively imposed by the expiration of us trade promotion authority tpa which permits the president to negotiate trade deals and present them to congress for expedited consideration to meet congressional notification requirements under tpa an agreement would have to be completed by the end of march 2007 tpa which could be extended by congress preserves congresss key role in approving trade agreements while providing the president with credibility to negotiate with trading partners who otherwise might fear that congress would amend an agreement that had been negotiated as result of the suspension of the negotiations major source of pressure for us farm policy change will have dissipated supporters of farm bill changes were looking to doha round agreement to require changes in us farm subsidies to make them more compatible with world trade rules proponents of continuing farm subsidy programs appear strengthened by the indefinite suspension of the doha talks the ited states must still meet obligations under existing wto agricultural agreements and some trade analysts think that without new trade agreement there could be an increase in litigation by wto member countries alleging they are harmed by us farm subsidies this report assesses the status of agricultural negotiations in the doha round

discusses agricultural issues in world trade organization wto multilateral trade negotiationsthe socalled doha round or the doha development agenda dda the initial focus is on the implications of the suspension of doha negotiations in july 2006 for future trade negotiations and the next us farm bill the report discusses current efforts to revive the suspended negotiations the reasons for the july 2006 suspension of negotiations and the agreements reached at the december 1318 2005 hong kong ministerial meeting briefly discussed also are the role of the us congress the major negotiating issues and proposals at play in the doha round the historical development of agricultural trade negotiations since the uruguay round and the potential economic benefits estimated to ensue from successful trade agreement according to several recent studies

formal negotiations the pace of efforts to revive the doha development agenda multilateral trade negotiations has quickened as the expiration of fasttrack or trade promotion authority for congressional consideration of trade agreements approaches tpa in title xxi of pl 107210 expires june 30 2007 unless the 110 th congress votes to extend it and there is little likelihood that comprehensive trade agreement could survive congressional debate without the expedited procedures that tpa provides some members of congress have discussed extending tpa either in its present form or with amendments that would give greater weight to labor and environmental considerations 2 tpa authority would be needed for speedy consider ation of multilateral trade agreement but also for various other free trade agreements that are currently being negotiated3 just as disagreement over agricultural issues was the principal cause of the july 2006 suspension of negotiations agriculture has been at the center of efforts to restart the negotiations after resuming on november 16 2006 negotiations have focused on various formulas for reducing tradedistorting subsidies and tariffs there have also been discussions at the political level involving presidents and prime ministers as well as trade ministers the political discussions have involved expressions of support for successfully concluding the round as well as expressions of willingness to reach satisfactory compromises on the issues dividing wto members 4 1 many of the technical terms and negotiating positions referred to in this

union eu and the developing countries led by brazil and india to make more generous offer for reducing trade distorting domestic support the united states is insisting that the eu and the developing countries agree to make more substantial reductions in tariffs and to limit the number of import sensitive and special products that would be exempt from cuts importsensitive products are of most concern to developed countries like the european union while developing countries are concerned with special productsthose exempt from both tariff cuts and subsidy reductions because of development food security or livelihood considerations brazil has emphasized reductions in tradedistorting domestic subsidies especially by the united states some of which it successfully challenged in the wto usbrazil cotton dispute discussed below while india has insisted on large number of special products that would not be exposed to wider market opening discussions have been particularly intense between the united states and the eu the us president has met with the president of the eu ropean commission and there have been several meetings between the us trade representative and the eu commissioner for trade while us and eu negotiators have not changed their official positions since suspension of negotiations as described below there have been suggestions that each could show more flexibility the united states might offer greater percentage reduction in domestic support if the eu offered to reduce tariffs further and limit the number of importsensitive products however new offers on domestic support and market access by the united states and the eu are constrained by domestic political considerations neither us nor eu farmers have professed willingness to support further concessions on subsidies or tariffs clear idea has yet emerged as to how much tariff reduction would be needed to match domestic subsidy cuts or vice versa to satisfy us or eu farm interests while us and eu agreement is necessary c ondition for successfully concluding doha round agreement it is not sufficient the 1994 uruguay round was concluded due in large part to useu agreement on the major issues in doha round negotiations however developing countries are playing major even decisive role brazils position on both domestic support and tariff reduction discussed below is considered by many as middle ground although the united states has said that brazils proposal for tariff reduction an average cut of 54 falls short of the kind of ambition in tariff reduction it has called for an average cut of 66 india as member of the g20 group of developing countries has endorsed the g20 proposal but has yet to demonstrate any flexibility in its demand for large number of special product exemptions from new trade rules the next step in restarting the doha round negotiations will be an informal wto ministers meeting on the margin of the world economic forum in davos switzerland in january 2007 the aim of the meeting will be to take stock of trade ministers views and if possible make decisions about resuming negotiations at the ministerial level around 30 trade ministers representing the full range of wto member country interests are expected to attend the meeting successful davos meeting could result in new schedule for resuming negotiations in the doha round not

g16g142g144g152g157g146g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 on july 24 2006 the director general of the wto pascal lamy announced an indefinite suspension of further negotiations in the doha round the principal cause of the suspension was that core group of wto member countriest he united states the european union eu brazil india australia and japanknown as the g6 had reached an impasse over specific methods to achieve the broad aims of the round for agricultural trade substantial reductions in tradedistorting domestic subsidies elimination of export subsidies and substantially increased market access for agricultural products the united states maintained that it had made an ambitious offer of reductions in trade supporting domestic support discussed below that had not been matched by agricultural tariff reductions by the eu or by market opening for agricultural and industrial products by brazil and india both large developing countries the eu and brazil argued that the us offer on domestic support did not go far enough in reducing tradedistorting support and would in fact leave the united states in position to spend more on such subsidies than under the current wto uruguay round agreement on agriculture doha round negotiators were operating under deadline effectively imposed by the expiration of us trade promotion authority tpa which permits the president to negotiate trade deals and present them to congress for an up or down vote without amendment to meet congressional notification requirements under tpa legislation an agreement would have to have been completed by the end of 2006 tpa expires on june 30 2007 some trade policy analysts think that reauthorization of tpa faces uncertain prospects in the 110 th congress some however suggest that congress might extend tpa tem porarily if doha round agreement seemed imminent as was the case in 1994 for the uruguay round multilateral trade agreements number of agreements had already been reached in the doha round agricultural negotiations but they are contingent on comprehensive agreement in the single undertaking nothing is agreed until everything is agreed that is th round and will now be put on hold those include an agreement by the eu to eliminate its agricu ltural export subsidies by the end of 2013 and an agreement by developed countries to extend duty and quota free access to 97 of the exports of the least developed countries the agreement at hong kong to provide early and ambitious subsidy reduction for cotton also is dependent on there being comprehensive doha round agreement the wto will continue to provide aid for trade funds to help developing countries participate more fully in the world trade system aid for trade discussions were conducted outside the framework of doha round negotiations as result of the suspension of the negotiations major source of pressure for us farm policy change has dissipated the current farm bill pl 107171 expires in 2007 and many were looking to doha round agreement on curbing tradedistorting domestic support to require changes in us farm subsidies to make them more compatible with world trade rules the option of continuing current farm subsidy programs appears strengthened by the indefinite suspension and uncertain prospects of the doha talks legislation hr 4332 hr 4775 and s 2696 already had been introduced in the 109 th congress to extend the 2002 farm bill by one year the american farm bureau at its 2007 annual meeting just concluded endorsed the concepts of the

payments and pricerelated commodity support5 the united states must still meet obligations under existing wto agricultural agreements which limit its tradedistorting spending to 191 billion annually some trade analysts think that there could be an increase in litigation by wto member countries that allege they are harmed by us farm subsidies6 the expiration of the peace clause article 13 of the 1994 uruguay round agreement on agriculture means that wto mber countries are longer bound by an agreement to refrain from challenging each others agricultural subsidy programs so long as commitments under the agreement are being met brazils successful challenges of us cotton subsidies and eu sugar subsidies in wto dispute settlement are cited as illustrations of the possible kinds of legal actions that wto members might take7 canadas recent challenge to us corn and other farm subsidies appears aimed at influencing the next farm bill8 another consequence of the suspension of doha ro und negotiations is that the united states may pursue more aggressively bilateral and regional free trade agreements ftas currently the united states is negotiating nine ftas agreements with larger economies will be particularly attractive to us agricultural interests the us trade representative has indicated that in the near term priority will be given to negotiating ftas with such larger us trading partners as korea and malaysia9 tpa procedures also apply to legislation to implement bilateral ftas lending some urgency to the completion of ongoing negotiations in time to meet tpa deadlines for congressional notification congress also could choose to extend tpa for bilateral trade agreements

the hong kong hk declaration adopted on december 18 2005 deals with all three pillars of the agricultural negotiationsexport competition domestic support and market accessand also with the controversial issue of the nature and pace of reform of tradedistorting cotton subsidies in the united states and other developed countries most progress was made in negotiations on the export competition pillar with an agreement on specific end date for the elimination of export subsidies but difficult negotiations remained on establishing new disciplines for other forms of export competition detailed negotiations were not carried out for domestic support and market access as throughout the doha agricultural negotiations tradedistorting domestic support and market access especially how to deal with access for importsensitive products and special products remain the thorniest issues some agreement was reached on how to deal with export subsidies and market access for cotton but this issue still pits the united states which argues for handling the reduction of tradedistorting support for cotton within the domestic support pillar against the cottonproducing african countries who insist on an early harvest of reductions in cotton support g7g161g153g152g155g157g561g5g152g150g153g142g157g146g157g146g152g151g561 the most concrete outcome of the hong kong ministerial was an agreement to eliminate agricultural export subsidies by the end of 2013 the european union eu the largest user of export subsidies had opposed setting an end date maintaining that wto members needed to determine first how other forms of subsidized export competitionexport credit programs insurance export activities of state trading enterprises stes and food aidwould be disciplined the united states and brazil among others had been demanding an end to such export subsides by 2010 to be followed by negotiations on other forms of export completion as compromise the hk declaration calls for the parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidies and disciplines on measures with equivalent effect by the end of 2013 the end date will be confirmed however only after the completion of modalities for the elimination of all forms of export subsidies with respect to other forms of export competition the hk declaration included the following export credit programs should be selffinancing reflecting market consistency and of sufficiently short duration so as not to effectively circumvent real commerciallyoriented discipline on exporting stes disciplines will be such that their monopoly powers cannot be exercised in any way that would circumvent the direct disciplines on stes on export subsidies government financing and the underwriting of losses

agreed to three bands for reductions with the percentages for reducing support in each band to be decided during the modalities negotiations the eu would be in the highest band and be subject to the largest reduction commitments while japan and the united states would be in the middle band the us proposal would have subjected japan to higher percentage cut of its domestic support all other wto members including developing countries would be in the bottom band the hk declaration states further that the overall reduction in tradedistorting domestic support will still need to be made even if the sum of the reductions in the three categories of trade distorting supportamber box blue box and minimiswould otherwise be less than the overall reduction requirement 11 this appears intended at ensuring that the united states does not engage in box shifting to maintain its current spending levels g15g138g155g148g142g157g561g3g140g140g142g156g156g561 the hk declaration calls for four bands for structuring tariff cuts with the relevant band thresholds and withinband reduction percentages to be worked out during modalities negotiations the treatment of sensitive products those to be exempted from formula tariff reductions was also left to modalities negotiations preliminary draft of the declaration would have required wto member countries to ensure that for sensitive products the greater the deviation from agreed tariff reduction formulas the greater would be the increase in tariff rate quotas the extent to which tariff rate quotas for sensitive products are expanded remains key determinant of the market access gains that would result from the round the hk declaration also ensured that developi ng countries would have two privileges not otherwise available to developed countries 1 the right to selfdesignate number of tariff lines to be treated as special products with lower cuts in tariffs based on certain criteriafood security livelihood security and rural development and 2 the ability to impose special safeguard mechanism ssg on imports based on both import quantity and price triggers 12 g5g152g157g157g152g151g561 on cotton the hk declaration reaffirms

negotiating groups and brief list of key wto terms during oversight and consultation with the administration on the doha round agriculture negotiations chairmen of both house and senate agriculture committees expressed their views on the kind of wto agricultural agreement that would garner their support14 according to the chairmen the four principles that should guide any wto agreement are substantial improvement in real market access greater harmonization in tradedistorting domestic support elimination of export subsidies and greater certainty and predictability regarding wto litigation negotiations on the agricultural modalities in us and other country proposals continued in preparation for the hong kong wto ministerial during november and december but as the meeting approached the negotiations appeared to have reached another impasse the united states the g20 and the cairns group called for the eu to improve and resubmit its offer on market access because it was not as extensive as its current reform proposals for domestic support and export competition and thus provided insufficient bargaining room the eu with at least partial backing from the g10 and india claimed that it was unable to improve its market access offer without some formal proposals from other countries on reform in the nonagricultural trade sectorsprimarily services and industrial goods with the prospect of little movement at hong kong under prevailing circumstances eg limited time to bridge useudeveloping country differences and internal eucountry disagreements over the nature of the eus offer news reports surfaced about scaledback ambitions for the hong kong ministerial 15 in the draft ministerial declaration for the hong kong meeting the wto director general pascal lamy suggested that rather than agreeing on modalities trade ministers set deadlines for establishing modalities and agreeing to schedules of concessions both before the end of 200616

socalled african cotton initiative four leastdeveloped african countriesbenin burkina faso chad and maliproposed may 2003 sectoral initiative for cotton that would entail the complete elimination of export subsidies and tradedistorting domestic support by all wto members17 although not specifically mentioned in the doha round negotiating mandate cotton was identified as key to successful conclusion of the doha round following the cancun ministerial in september 2003 preliminary agreement on framework for the doha round negotiations reached in july 2004 see detailed discussion below also recognized the importance of cotton for certain developing countries and stated that cotton will be addressed ambitiously expeditiously and specifically within the agriculture negotiations 18 in addition the framework called for the establishment of cotton subcommittee established on november 19 2004 to deal with the initiative going into the hong kong meeting there were two main proposals for dealing with the trade related aspects of the sectoral initiative on cotton19 one was revised proposal from the african group and the second was an eu proposal both called for decisions to be made at the hong kong ministerial the african proposal called for export subsidies on cotton to be eliminated by the end of 2005 tradedistorting domestic support would be completely eliminated by january 1 2009 with 80 eliminated by the end of 2006 and 10 each in 2007 and 2008 the market access aspects of the initiative would be addressed by dutyfree and quotafree access for cotton and cotton products from leastdeveloped countries an emergency fund would be established to deal with depressed international prices additionally this proposal called for technical and financial assistance for the cotton sector in african countries the eu proposal called for the hong kong ministerial to endorse more ambitious and faster commitments on cotton than for agriculture as w hole the eu provided details of its proposal for cotton but without assigning numerical targets which is consistent with its position that hong kong should not be about deciding numbers ie actual modalities for export subsidies the eu proposed an earlier end date for elimination as to market access the eu indicated its willingness to eliminate all duties quotas and other quantitative restrictions on imports from all countries for domestic support the eu would eliminate all tradedistorting subsidies for cotton the eu indicated that all its cotton commitments will already be in place as far as the eu is concerned from 2006 the us position on the cotton initiative has been that cotton should be dealt with as an integral part of the agriculture negotiations thus cotton subsidy reductions or market access 17 for detailed

previous multilateral trade rounds held under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the predecessor of the wto during the uruguay round an agreement between the united states

meeting was greeted with strong opposition from group of developing countries 21 this group led by brazil india and china known as the g20 has remained together since cancun and is playing key role in the doha agricultural negotiations the g20 was first among the major players in the doha round to offer proposal on agricultural modalities in advance of the hong kong meeting and its proposal became benchmark for evaluating other developed country proposals not only the more advanced developing countries like the g20 members but also the least developed countries ldcs are participating actively in the doha negotiations the african cotton initiative discussed above is an example of the ldcs attempting to use multilateral trade negotiations to accomplish their policy objectives the ldcs also

substantial improvements in market access reductions of with view to phasing out all forms of export subsidies and substantial reductions in tradedistorting domestic support these topicsdomestic support export subsidies and market accesshave become known as the three pillars of the agricultural negotiations the dm declaration also provided that special and differential treatment sdt for developing countries would be an integral part of all elements of the negotiations the dm declaration took note of nontrade concerns reflected in negotiating proposals of various member countries and confirmed that they would be taken into account in the negotiations march 31 2003 was set as the deadline for reaching agreement on modalities targets formulas timetables etc for achieving the mandated objectives but that deadline was missed during the rest of 2003 negotiations on modalities continued in preparation for the fifth wto ministerial conference held in cancun mexico september 1014 2003 while the united states and the eu reached agreement on broad framework for negotiating agricultural trade liberalization before the cancun meeting group of developing countries the g20 which includes brazil china india and south africa among others made counter proposal the g20 proposal emphasized agricultural subsidy and tariff reduction for developed countries with fewer demands on developing countries the chairman of the cancun ministerial circulated draft declaration at the meeting that attempted to reconcile differences between developed especially the united states and the eu and developing countries especially the g20 on the agricultural issues neither the proposals made by the united states and the eu the g 20 nor the chairmans draft declaration proposed specific modalities formulas targets or timetables for reducing tariffs and tradedistorting support and for phasing out export subsidies the cancun ministerial conference thus failed to reconcile differences on agricultural issues as well as differences between developed and developing countries over expanding the negotiating agenda to include such issues as competition and investment policy the cancun ministerial ended without an agreement on modalities or framework for continuing multilateral negotiations on agricultural trade liberalization the inconclusive end of the cancun ministerial largely eliminated the prospect that the dda would conclude by its scheduled end date january 1 2005

policy effects in estimating the economic benefits to the us and world from new round of trade liberalization two points must be kept in mind first based on the current proposals for reforming the domestic and trade policy of wto members any agreement from the doha round will institute only partial liberalization ie it will allow countries to maintain some policies whether domestic subsidies or border measures that continue to distort agricultural trade second current proposals deal with setting limits on aggregate spending categories if adopted each individual member country will ultimately decide how to implement their domestic policies so as to achieve the aggregate spending limits agreed to under new trade agreement

liberalization the following common conclusions emerge28 policies that distort agricultural trade account for roughly twothirds of all policies that distort trade in goods of any kind of policies that distort world agricultural trade tariffs and tariffrate quotas are by far the most costlyaccounting for 80 to 90 of the costwith domestic support and export subsidies comprising the remainder significant gap between bound and applied tariff rates for most products in most countries suggests that substantial tariff cuts in bound rates those affected by doha round negotiations will have to be realized before applied rates are actually lowered similarly significant gap between bound and actual domestic spending levels suggests that substantial cuts in bound domestic spending limits those affected by doha round negotiations will have to be realized before actual spending levels are lowered much of the eventual market access gains will be determined by the treatment of sensitive products ie their number and the extent to which they are exempted from reform 2005 world bank study to measure the effects of partial trade liberalization using cuts to tariff and subsidy bounds similar to those contained in the g20 proposal but with special treatment for sensitive or special products found that such reform would produce annual welfare benefits to the world in 2001 dollars of 745 billion once fully implemented 29 this compares with potential annual benefit of 182 billion under full trade liberalization and suggests both the potential economic importance of successful doha round as well as the extent of remaining policy reform needed to achieve full liberalization however the world bank study also found that if developed countries are allowed to select 2 of their tariff lines 4 for developing countries as sensitive products and provide them with special trq protection that includes very high abovequota tariffs then annual economic benefits from trade liberalization would fall to 177 billion30 in other words nearly 80 of the potential economic gains would be eliminated the same study also found that substantial portion of the potential economic benefits could be preserved even with 2 sensitive product threshold if abovequota tariffs are capped at 200 under this scenario the annual economic benefits from trade liberalization are estimated at 443 billion 28 the

guarantees current doha reform proposals would likely reduce the effectiveness of traditional export credit guarantees at supporting us commodity exports into pricecompetitive markets however ongoing

the united states together with the eu and japan account for nearly 90 of global agricultural domestic support subsidies34 as result these three countries are most likely to bear the brunt of the

proposal for reform of domestic support table 3 the us amber box ceiling would be lowered by 60 to approximately 76 billion this compares with current amber box spending in fy2005 of an estimated 127 billion and an amber box ceiling of 191 billion as result us domestic support programs would require some redesign with likely box shifting to be able to meet such lower ceiling although there are many ways that such changes could be achieved likely candidate would include shifti ng away from marketdistorting programs such as loan deficiency payments ldp or marketin g loan gains mlg and towards greater use of green box programs such as decoupled direct payments conservations payments or rural infrastructure development

exemptions both nonproduct specific and product specific w ould be bound at 25 of the value of relevant production ie either aggregate or commodity specific for nonproduct specific minimis this would result in ceiling of about 5 billi on compared with estimated exemptions of 62 billion in fy2005 however shifting the countercyclical payments ccp to the blue box see below would bring spending under

increases in imports for most us agricultural commodities since us agricultural tariffs are already very low relative to most other nations and relatively few commodities receive tariffrate quota trq protection dairy products beef and sugar are three of the major us beneficiaries of trq protection each of these products are likely to continue to receive protection as sensitive products under new dda agreement although specific information concerning the identification of sensitive products has yet been made by the united states or any other negotiating country expanded quota levels would likely result in increased imports for each of these commodities the us proposal does not provide any specificity regarding the administration of trqs however the g20 proposal recommends that minimum access quotas be set at 6 of domestic consumption for some undefined base period aust ralia recommended higher access quota level of 810 of domestic consumption

by the chairman of the senate agriculture committee senator chambliss the food and agricultural policy re search institute fapri analyzed the potential impacts on us agriculture of the us proposal see tables 13 for details of the us proposal37 under the us proposal the amber box ams annual limit falls to 76 billion representing 60 cut from the previous 191 billion limit to achieve this lower spending limit fapri had to make specific assumptions about us farm policy reform see table 4 38 in particular loan rates for grain oilseed and cotton and the dairy support price were reduced by 11 sugar loan rates were reduced by 16 to avoid excessive stock accumulation and ccp payments were redirected from the amber box to the redefined blue box for all nonsensitive products tariff reductions are made in accordance with the tiers described in table 2 in addition for each designated sensitive product trqs were increased by 75 of the 19992001 level of domestic consumption finally export subsidies are eliminated by 2010 in addition to the above program changes two scenarios were evaluated an uncompensated scenario where all target prices were reduced by 7 and compensated scenario where instead of lowering target prices direct payment rates were increased by 7 ccp payments equal the target price minus the per unit direct payment rate minus the higher of the loan rate or the market price thus both of these scenarios have the effect of lowering ccp payments by 7 the difference is that in the compensated scenario government outlays are increased to offset the lower ccp payment replacing nonproduct specific ccp payments with decoupled direct payments represents shifting from the capped blue box to the unlimited green box summary of the net effect of these changes is presented in table 4 and are described briefly below 37 fapri potential impacts on us agriculture of the us october 2005 wto proposal fapriumc report 16 05 dec 15 2005 hereafter referred to as fapri

and 42 billion respectively livestock receipts increase in response to higher prices for cattle hogs poultry and milk due to increased us meat and poultry exports higher crop receipts result from both increased feed demand and exports key drivers behind the higher international commodity prices and higher us exports include the following39 removal of export subsidies raises prices in the international wheat barley rice sugar beef and dairy markets expansion of trqs in general increase trade in those protected commodities by exposing highly protected markets to lower international prices tariff reductions in general raise the demand for traded products while reductions of domestic support reduce competition from more inefficient producers expansion of rice trqs in japan and south korea in particular push international rice prices higher by 8 on average tariff reductions and the removal of the special safeguard mechanism in japan raise both demand and prices for pork and beef in the fapri study us farm real estate values experience small but significant changes under the uncompensated scenario average us farm land values decline by 14 as the reduction in government payments 225 more than offsets higher market returns factors other than net market returns and payments affect land values but changes in profitability play an important role and in the uncompensated scenario translate into lower projected future revenue streams to the land under the compensated scenario farm real estate values increase by 17 as slightly lower projected government payments 18 are more than offset by expected market returns suggesting improved longrun returns to the land 39 for more details see card 2005
