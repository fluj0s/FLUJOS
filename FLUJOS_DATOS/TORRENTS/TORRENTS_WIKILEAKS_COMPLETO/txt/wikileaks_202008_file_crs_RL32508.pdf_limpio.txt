for congress summary intelligence surveillance and reconna issance isr functions are principal elements of us defense capabilities and include wide variety of systems for acquiring and processing information needed by national security decisionmakers and military commanders isr systems range in size from handheld devices to orbiting satellites some collect basi c information for wide range of analytical products others are designed to acquire data fo r specific weapons systems some are national systems intended primarily to collect information of interest to washingtonarea agencies others are t actical systems intended to support military commanders on the battlefield collectively they account for major portion of us intelligence spending that according to media estimates amounts to some 40 billion annually for some time congress has expressed c oncern about the costs and management of isr programs with minor exceptions isr acquisition has been coordinated by the defense department nd the intelligence community although there are long existing staff mechanisms for reviewing and coordinating isr programs in the context of the annual budget submissions many in congress believe that existing procedures have not avoide d duplication of effort excessive costs and gaps in coverage examples that some observers c ite are separate efforts to acquire new generation of reconnaissan ce satellites and high altit ude unmanned aerial vehicle uav known as global hawk both system s acquire some of the same sorts of information and serve similar customers but they are acquired in distinctly different ways moreover in both cases procurement efforts have been beset by increasing costs and schedule delays recently enacted statutes mandate be tter integration of isr capabilities and require that the defense department prepare roadmap to guide the development and integration of isr capabilities over the next fifteen years an effective roadmap if developed could potentially ensure more co mprehensive coverage of targets and save considerable sums of money to tablish responsibility for an intelligence communitywide effort the 911 commission recommended that new position of director of national intelligence be established to manage the national intelligence program but not joint military and tac tical inte lligence programs which would continue to be managed by the defense department this position was included after extended debate in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 that was approved by the president on

disseminate intelligence are encompassed in the budget category known as intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr1 isr covers multitude of programs ranging from billion dollar satellites to hand held cameras the bulk of funding is for research and development rd and procurement personne l costs are comparatively low some systems are used only by military units others are national systems operated by washingtonlevel defense agencies mo st are surrounded in secrecy but total spending on isr while difficult to estimate with unclassified information undoubtedly runs into the tens of billions of dollars the isr programs considered in this report are managed by the central intelligence agency cia and by the large intelligence agencies and components of the department of defense dod2 isr acquisition has in recent years come under strong critic ism reportedly there are technical problems with the ne w generation of rec onnaissance satellites along with billion dollar costoverruns onl small number of the planned high altitude uavs are actually deployed and ther have been difficulties in ensuring that the troops who need intelligence acquire it in timely manner there is widespread awareness that isr spending much greater than in past years could easily absorb even larger portions of defense and in telligence budgets making the need for tradeoffs even more important some observers point to the possibility that satellites and uavs potentially undertake the same or similar missions but that the current system gives little opportunity for cost compar isons

continuedacquisition process appendix provides case study of the tradeoffs between satellites and unmanned aer ial vehicles uavs understanding the procedures for acquiring isr systems is however complicated by the fact that different isr systems are acquired in entirely different ways by different intelligence agencies or military services and are designed for different users in addition the acqui sition processes are overseen by different congressional committees it is difficult to ensure efficient acquisition in the separate programs which are often based on innova tive technologies it is even more challenging to envision seamless and comprehensive system of systems and to ensure the acquisition of an optimal mix of specific systems congressional concerns with isr lack of coordination although procedures for coordinating th budgeting of isr programs have long been in place some members of congress have concluded that the procedures have not been wholly effective there has been it is argued inadequate data to compare systems capabilities and costs across th spectrum of intelligence programs an imbalance between collection and analysis programs and an intelligence effort that does not reflect an optimal allocation of extensive resources expressions of congressional concern go back number of years in 1995 the senate select committee on intelligence ssci expre ssed its misgivings about existing cooperation among agencies and recommende d joint review by the director of central intelligence dci and the deputy secretary of defense to ensure that both intelligence community and defense department equities are served in the planning programming and management of all intelligence activities and programs3 some believed that giving the dci gr eater management responsibilities would improve the management of isr programs including those in the department of defense dod reflecting that view the fy1997 intelligence authorization act pl 104293 included provisions that st rengthened the ability of the dci to manage the intelligence community by codifying his authority to participate in the development of the budgets for defens ewide and

the budgets of nfip elements and to transfer funds and personnel w ith the concurrence of affected agency heads the conferees in considering the fy1997 legislation urged the dci to be more assertive in using these authorities6 in may 2000 the senate intelligence committee reported that the budget practices of the central intelligence agency cia and the intelligence community as whole are simply inadequate to ddress current require ments upper level program managers lack sufficient insight into the process to make informed and timely decisions regarding the allocation of funds and to assure congress and themselves that funds are being sp ent as appropriate d and authorized7 the next year the committee again argued that the intelligence community is handicapped by the lack of comprehensive strategic and performance plans that can be used to articulate program goals measure program performance improve program efficiency and aid in resource planning accordingly the committee directed the dci to produce comprehensive intelligence community strategic plan and performance plan as well as complementary strategic and performance plans for the intelligence agencies within the national foreign intelligence program aggregation the committee asked that such plans be unde rtaken annually and made available to congressional committees by march 1 of each year8 in 2002 the senate intelligence committee ac knowledged receipt of the first ever plans coordinated across the intelligence community aimed at establishing performance measures aligned with the stated goals and priorities of the director of central intelligence the committee went on however to indicate that further work is needed and suggested that devel oping new systems merely to acquire new capability was insufficient the capability had to meet validated intelligence needs key issue is the development of performance plans and measures that are not focused solely on the attainment of intelligence capabilities but also on the value received from such capabilities in pursu it of intelligence community missions9 despite this admonition the next year the committee called attention to the absence of 2003 perfo rmance plan submission even though the deadline had passedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32508crs4 10 us congress senate select committee on intelligence authorizing appropriations for fiscal

basic information about its acquisition efforts it is very difficult for the committee to understand what needs to be done to modernize nsa when nsa cannot prov ide an adequate baseline of ongoing development and acquisition programs projects and activities the committee has fenced funds over the past two fiscal years to try to bring command attention to this problem subm issions to date have shown progress but are not comprehensive in identifying known projects and programs that are being funded in the ccp future funding requests will be balanced against the nsa acquisition baseline so it is in the agencys best interest to get this done right and soon ibid p 17with request for an extension10 more significantly the committee noted that it is aware of capability within dod or the intelligence community for objectively independently and comprehensively evaluating alternative sensor and platform architecture and capabilities there are some capabilities within different agencies and departments but none that are available independent of the program offices to model and assess cross program trades without regard to the location of the sensor or platform ir space land or sea or the level of compartmentation consequently although dod and intelligence community officials expend substantial effort and time evaluating program trades they do so without the benefit of the rigorous quantitative modeling necessary to optimize collection capabilities and architectures given the vast sums involved in these programs even modest increases in the efficiency of resources allocation could lead to substantial benefits furt her the committee notes that the national military strategy as well as the defense planning guidance have been developed in recent years without the par ticipation of the director of central intelligence or his staff notwithstandi ng the growing importance of intelligence to military operations and the need to build forces commensurate to validated threats11 section 355 of the fy2004 intelligence aut horization act p l 108177 required report from the dci and the secretary of defense assessing progress in the development of comprehensive and uniform analytical capability to assess the utility and advisability of various sensor and platform architectures and capabilities for the collection of intelligence and the improvement of

armed services was informed that the council had recently started meeting testimony of stephen cambone undersecretary of defense for intelligence before the senate armed services committee april 7 2004in separate legislation congress also urged that dod take greater role in managing isr in section 923 of the fy2004 defense authorization act pl 108 136 congress found that there is not currently welldefined forum through which the integrators of intelligence surveillance and reconnai ssance capabilities for each of the armed forces can routinely interact with each other and with senior representatives of department of defense intelligence agencies as well as with other members of the intelligence community to ensure unity of effort and to preclude unnecessary duplication of effort12 pl 108136 further stated that the exis ting structure of intelligence programming may not be the best approach for suppor ting the development of an intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance structure th at is integrated to meet the national security requirements of the united states in the 21st century accordingly the fy2004 defense authoriza tion act directed the under secretary of defense for intelligence to establish an isr integration c ouncil to provide permanent forum for assessing isr capabilities the council is to consist of senior intelligence officers of the services the special operations command the joint staff and the directors of dod intelligence agen cies the dci would be invited to participate the council would be char ged with developing comprehensive roadmap to guide the development and integration of dod isr capabilities for 15 years13 in addition to its general concerns about isr programs some members of congress have specifically focused on two issues related to budget processes that they argued undermine their abilities to conduct oversight of isr efforts they argue that congressional budget justif ication books have been inad equate and that there has been an overreliance on supplemental ppropriations to fund continuing isr programs congressional budget justification books cbjbs effective congressional oversight depends on accurate

complete budgetary submissions in the form of congressional budget justificati on books proposals for isr programs are to be forwarded to intelligence committees along with armed services and appropriations committees justification materials on national programs are submitted to the two intelligence committees along with classified cbjbs which include one volume for each nip program pl us

their review generally in the spring and ear ly summer the legislation is referred to the armed services committee which have the option of submitting separate report prior to floor consideration classified budget justification books provided by the administration to congress are the primary ways in additi on to oral testimony by which congress obtains information about intelligen ce programs in 1997 hpsci criticized justification books for lacking several critical components n ecessary for the committee to ensure proper alignment of f unding within the funding appropriations categories clear identification of each project its specific budget request numbers the appropriation category eg other proc urement defensewide rdte navy etc the budget request line number and if research and development project the program element number are essential to this tas k therefore the committee directs the cms community management staff and the defe nse department to provide this specific data in all fu ture budget justification documents14 in 2000 hpsci expressed its continued frustration with perceived lack of detail provided in justifica tion books which are classifi ed and strongly criticized financial management practices at some nfip agencies hpsci stated thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32508crs7 15 hrept 106620 p 24 16 hrept 108163 p 25 17 section 504a1 of the national security act requires that funds for intelligence activities be specifically authorized by th congress intelligence authorization acts including their classified annexes provid specific authorization although appropriations acts also usually have generalized language providing specific authorization to meet the 504a1 requirement the inclusion of such provisions in appropriations acts serves as authorization until authorization bills are enacte d or in the absence of authorization bills as often occurs when supplemental appropriations b ills are enacted even when authorization legislation is under consideration the two appropriations committees also review intelligence budget submissions and intelligence funds for most intelligence activities are included in annual defense appropriation bills supplemental appropriations that fund intelligence activities include an authorizing provision to comply with section 504 of the national security act but they are not reported by the two intelligence committees 18 during floor consideration of the fy2004 in telligence authorization bill representative hastings member of hpsci stated it is im portant to note that this bill authorizes only part of the operating funds for the intelligen ce community huge portion of intelligence funds were provided in the 87 billion iraqi counterterrorism supplemental and in the continued the nfip agencies need greater insight into their financial obligations and the capabilities that they are developing nsas baseline activity for example identified many areas of duplicative development as well as lack of investment in key strategic areas yet due to the lack of detail the cbjb did not provide this information the committee notes that at least at some agencies internal financial management practices seriously complicate this process15 in 2003 hpsci again called attention to limitations in the data included in cbjbs which is often less extensive than that routinely provided in dod budget materials the committee believes for example that acquisition program details in the cbjbs should include major milestones nd deliverables for contracted projects for the entire length of contract and c ontain more specificity for the budget year of the request many of the project milestones in the cbjbs are however at such highlevel that the committee is unable to determine the stage of the development activity or what will be accomplished in the coming year the project descriptions are often so vague that the committee is unable to determine the value of or even what is being developed16 supplemental appropriations while procedures for annual budget sub missions have long been established there has been an increasing practice in recent years and especially since the september 11 2001 attacks of providing intelligence funding in supplemental appropriations acts17 of the 1656 billion in supplem ental appropriations that the defense department has received since september 2001 significant but not publicly identified portion of these sums at least 16 billion not counting funds received in the fy2004 iraq supplemental was directed at intelligence and intelligencerelated activities18 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32508crs8 18 continued supplementals that proceeded it congressional record november 20 2003 p h11674 19 us congress house permanent select

consideration of proposed supplemental intelligence spending within the context of established programs the hpsci noted in july 2002 the advantage of the supplemental process to the intelligence community is that pressing budgetary demands can be met in shorter time and with fewer bureaucratic hurdles than the regular year ly process however by continuing to rely on supplemental appropriations year after year the intelligence community risks fostering budget process that is ripe for abuse and longterm funding gaps the house committee also argued that the defense emergency response fund derf funding initiative that permits dod to shift funds from central fund to specific appropriations accounts after enac tment as required for counterterrorist operations has turned into just another vehicle to fund items that the intelligence community did not get through the re gular budget and planning process19 i n particular it is argued s upplemental legislation can unde rcut established budgeting and congressional oversight pr ocedures making it more difficult to weigh tradeoffs and adjust overall priorities it can in some situations lead to the launching of programs that are unlikely to be sust ained in the regular authorization and appropriation process some question the proprie ty of funding core programs in emergency supplemental legislation which are inte nded to provide for additional unforeseen needs resulting from combat and occupation duties in june 2003 hpsci reiterated its concerns regretting that core missi on and core mission support programs have also been funded in supplemental appropria tions it argued that the repeated reliance on supplemental appropr iations has an erosive negative effect on planning and impedes longterm strategic planni ng the committee hopes that the ic has finally reached plateau of resources and capabilities on which longterm strategic planning can now begin further hpsci concluded the committee cannot help but note that budgeting by supplemental consequentially limits congressional oversight the committee strongly believes that the health of the ic is directly related to the oversight from congress it receives certainly the confidence of the american people activities and programs of the ic is increased signific antly as result of the transparency that exists between the ic and its congressional overseers20

prevalent in the past 10 years it is time to rein in this practice21 reprogramming issues concern for some observers of the intelligence community are the current procedures for reprogramming of previ ously appropriated f unds reprogrammings are intended to permit shiftin g funds to meet unanticip ated new requirements that arise during the course the year the national security act permitted the dci to transfer funds appropriated for one program within nip to another program within the nip but there were congressional concerns that reprogramming procedures did not invariably met statutory requirements22 in may 2000 the house intelligence committee complained about significant and deleterious m ovements of money from field stations to cia headquarters that were inconsistent with national security act provisions and asked the cia inspector general to investigat whether statutory provisions were being followed23 similar concerns were expressed by the senate intelligence committee recent actions includi ng taxing directorates for funds to be used in other areas and moving f unds within expenditu re centers without congressional notificati on have eroded this committees confidence that appropriations are used as intended24 during floor consideration of the fy2004 intelligence authorization conference report senator roberts chairman of the senate intelligence committee commented on difficulties in the out years as the national foreign intelligence program becomes burdened with content that is more costly than the budgeted funding this

the provision was not however included in the version of the bill that was enacted as pl 107306 section 311 of the senate version of the fty2004 intelligence authorization bill would have deleted the unforeseen requirements criteri on altogether but the provision was not adopted in conference momentum for reorganization given the congressional concerns indi cated above number of members and outside observers have argued that major restructuring of the intelligence community would be required if certain challenges in isr efforts are to be addressed effectively the 2002 joint inquiry c onducted by the two intelligence committees to review the background of the 911 attack s recommended the establishment of position of director of na tional intelligence who would have the full range of management budgetary and pe rsonnel requirements needed to make the entire us intelligence community operate as coherent whole27 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission also recommended establishing position of national intelligence director nid to oversee national programs but not joint military or tactical intelligence programs which would managed solely by dod furthermore senior intelligence community official larry kindsvater the dcis executive director for intelligence community affairs and s ubsequently deputy dci fo r community management argued the need to reorganize the intelligence community and proposed among other things to give the dci authority to transfer funding across agencies with congressional approval28 the publication of the 911 commission s report in july 2004 provided the impetus for congressional action in an election year the 911 commissions recommendations regarding the role of th new dni appear to have been based primarily on the perceived inability of the dci to ensure interagency communications and effectively control the allocation of intelligence assets the commission

2004that dci tenet was reported to have placed the intelligence community at war with qaeda in december 1998 but without being able to ensure that all agencies concentrated significant res ources on the terrorist group29 the commission also noted efforts in the 1990s to address th dcis perceived lack of personnel and budget authority over intelligence agencies it further pointed out the results of intelligence reorganization legi slation introduced in the 1996 the department of defense and its congressional authorizing committees rose in opposition to the proposed changes the president and the dci did not actively support these changes relatively small changes made in 1996 gave the dci consultative authority and created new deputy for management and assistant dcis for collection and analys is the reforms occurred only after the senate select committee on intelligence took the unprecedented step of threatening to bring down the defense au thorization bill indeed rather than increasing the dcis authorities over na tional intelligence the 1990s witnessed movement in the opposite direction throug h for example the transfer of the cias imaging analysis capability to the new imagery and mapping agency created within the department of defense30 nevertheless as former representative hamilton the vice chairman of the 911 commission testified i do not recall us finding failure of dod agency so far as we know but we certainly think that part of the problem has been an unwillingness to share the information that number of agencies had31 although some observers argued that th wall separating intelligence and law enforcement agencies may have been primary reason for the unwillingness to share information and that the wall had been effectively removed by the usa patriot act of october 2001 pl 10756 the r ecommendation of the 911 commission to establish dni with stronger oversight and management re sponsibilities for all intelligence agencies including compone

authorities in the inte lligence budget process it also enhances the reprogramming authorities of the dni th dni may transfer or reprogram funds within the national intelligence program w ith the

of intelligence distinctions among nip jmip and tiara programs are becoming indistinct as the intelligence resource managers guide noted as systems grow in complexity and capability and methods become more sophisticated increasing numbers of intelligence assets are capable of simultaneously serving both national and tactical purposes42 for example there has been for number of years program known as

intelligencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32508crs15 43 stephen cambone undersecretary of defense for intelligence testimony before house armed services committee august 11 2004 an irony of this sir is that we spent good deal of time at least during my tenure trying to merge and blur the line and distinction between what is strategic and tactical and what is national and military since its increasingly difficult to distinguish either in the product that is produced or in the capability that is applied so global hawks which are built by the air force are as significant and important as sigint satellites that are built by the national reconnaissance office and whose take is managed by the national security agency43 as result some observers argued that the three categories of isr programs cannot be meaningfully considered by themse lves they must be considered as parts of greater whole and accordingly the nip jmip and tiara categories are outmoded changing the statutes regulati ons and rules which tablished the three categories obviously would be difficult and would affect organi zational relationships in both executive and legislative branches one result of abolishing the system could mean devolution of acquisition to multit ude of program mana gers throughout the military services an approach that most observers would argue could have major drawbacks some have suggested that the growing interrelationships among nip jmip and tiara systems may complicate provisions in the intelligence reform act that establish separate respons ibilities for nip on one hand and jmip and tiara on the other arguably the act could complicate rather than facilitate effort to coordinate the acquisition and operation of isr systems major challenge for the office of the dni when activated will be to coordinate isr programs within the nip for which it is primarily responsible with those that are in jmip and tiara for which the defense department has pr imary responsibility the sa types of coordinative mechanisms that have long existed will undoubt edly continue to be required in any event congress will have major influe nce on isr acquisition it may also choose to determine whether the enhanced authorities of the dni in comparison to those of the dci permit more effective coordination of isr programs isr programming and budgeting procedures differ among agencies programming and budgeting of isr syst ems have been managed by the department of defense dod and its many components and by the intelligence community through the office responsible to the dci for interagency coordination the community management staff cms the office of management and budget omb also plays critical role in allo cating budgetary goals that can constrain intelligence spending proposals cong ressional responsibilities are spread among armed services intelligence appropria tions and other committees although it would be easy to question the number of entities

dci was responsible for facilitating the development of an annual budget for in telligence and intelligence related activities and for pres enting to the president an annual budget for the nfip he participated in the development by th secretary of defense of the annual budgets for jmip and tiara observers have argued that these responsibilities did not provide for the comprehensive management of isr programs that is needed although the 911 commission did not focus at length on the role of the dci in systems acquisition it concluded that there was an urgent need to restructure the intelligence community and establish stronger authorities for the dci or dni44 consideration of intelligence reform legislation in the 108th congress included extensive debate on the role of the ne w dni in developing budgets and overseeing their execution on one side was deter mination to ensure that the dni would be effectively in charge of the entire inte lligence community and able to direct its resources at the most critical threats on the other was determination to ensure that the combat support agencies of the departme nt of defense would not be diverted by nondod officials the language incorporated in the final version that became law requires that the dni provide based on priorities set by the president guidance to departments and agencies regarding their portion of the national intelligence program then based on budget proposals provided by agency and partment heads the dni is to develop and determine the annual nip budget funds appropriated by congress are to be

the components of dod in addition section 1018 requires that the president issue guidelines to ensure the effective implementation and execution of the dnis authorities in manner that respects and does not abrogate the statutory responsibilities of the heads of other departments some believe that this provision reflects separate even conflicting priorities and suggest that it may be as difficult to write the guidelines as it was to draft the legislation much of the media analysis of this stion tends to focus on turf battle and differences among key offici als although elements of

and uncertain approaches to wide variety of possible conflict situations this evolution may make it even more difficult to reach consensus on isr requirements in future years how the provisions of the

isr systems the act provides the dni with an opportunity and staff the community management staff is to be transferred to the office of the dni to assess whether governmentwide isr requirements ar being effectively addressed some observers believe that past failure s to satisfy congre ssional concerns about coordination resulted in significant measure from the lower relative influence of the dci and the community management staff compared with that of the secretary of defense and dod the dci was arguably at disadvantage in any dispute withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32508crs23 dod because of the latters size influence and prestige similarly questions have existed regarding the relative influence of intelligence and armed services committees and some members have suggested that certain intelligence matters should receive oversight from other committ ees the intelligence reform act did not specify procedures for congressiona l oversight but congress may choose to develop new approaches to reviewing isr programs some observers go so far as to argu that longstanding distinctions among national joint military and tactical systems have outlived their usefulness and that more comprehensive approach should be attempted since these distinctions are provided for in statutes and have been recently been included in the intelligence reform act any major changes woul d require further congressional action there is widespread sense that the optimal mix of isr systems has not yet been determined admittedly it would be almost impossible to design analytical processes that would identify definitive options for isr systems readily acceptable to all interested parties the diverse nature of the systems the multiple customers for data the number of intelligence agencies and the dynamics of everchanging isr technologies make multiyear roadm ap extremely difficult yet more disciplined assessment of the potential advant ages and disadvantages of different isr options could be required for review in the executive branch and in congressional committees given the potential for the need for futu re budgetary restraints on isr programs with or without new procedural frame

appropriate mix that provides optimal collection capabilities while avoiding unnecessary duplication or wasted resources satellite imagery has long been one of the most valuable tools of the intelligence profession the need for to obtain accurate estimates of soviet military forces in the mid1950s led the united states in order to avoid highly dangerous overflights by conventional aircraft to deve lop special planes that coul d fly at very high altitudes and ultimately to build rec onnaissance satellites that c ould identify small objects from space satellite imagery became the corn erstone of arms control efforts in the cold war and coupled with the availab ility of precision guided munitions became the key to those postcold war defense tactics that rely on highly selective targeting to destroy selected targets with minimal collateral damage satellite programs are among the most expensive intelligence efforts with individual satellites costing billion dollars each the

capabilities of reconnaissance satellite s could be realized by relying on less expensive highaltitude unmanned aerial vehicles such as global hawk which has recently become available for operational missions and has been used during operation iraq freedom pr oponents of global hawk s which have been estimated to cost some 57 million per unit maintain that these vehicles could provide considerable porti on of the imagery that coul d otherwise be obtainable by satellites that cost many times that figure69 there are advantages and disadvantages to both satellites and uavs as well as manned aircraft which can also be used advantageously in some circumstances satellites have been considered invulnerable to attacks from all but the most sophisticated adversary and can be launched from us territory70 they are in orbit for years and can be shifted from target to target as needs change on the other hand they are expensive and there are inevitably limited numbers in the us inventory global hawks on the other hand can be unched when needed and can be targeted by local commanders they do not however have the capability to remain overhead for lengthy periods sometimes termed longdwell capability and they may be vulnerable to attack while inexpensive in comparison with satellites they are far too costly to be considered expendable as is the case with some tactical uavshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32508crs27 71 us congress house permanent select committee on intelligence intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2003 107th congress 2nd session hrept 107592 july 18 2002 pp 2122uav acquisition has been as heavily criticized as fia hpsci in particular has pointed out problems with global hawk procurement the committee is very concerned about the management and cost growth of the global hawk endurance uav program because of air forceinitiated upgrades 10 million per copy global hawk platform has become at least 3040 million aircraft and the cost will increase substantially further as additional and improved sensors and corresponding powerpayload upgrades are added in fact the air force projects th at the average total unit cost including all program costs will exceed 75 million per copy there is now an effort to flood the gl obal hawk program with money there are ad hoc plans for rapid major upgrades before requirements have been established and sign of serious ex amination of where and how global hawk fits into an overall collection architect ure dod has taken serious steps to be able to relay and process the huge amounts of data from global hawk or to process exploit and disseminate all th data that fleet of 51 global hawks with highly capable sensors will generate71 satellites are budg eted under nip and operated by the nro global hawk uavs on the other hand have been budgeted under jmip and operated by air force components of regional commands these parate paths have made the possibility of potential tradeoffs between space nd uav collection vastly more difficult observers sense that current procedures to integrate intelligence acquisition efforts have not led to comprehensive assessment of major issues relating to satellite and uav programs if uavs can do at least part of the work of sate llites then arguably considerable budgetary savings might be r ealized on the other hand failure to take advantage of us satellite technologica l superiority could limit intelligence gathering capabilities for decades to come and prompt the decline of an important us industry
