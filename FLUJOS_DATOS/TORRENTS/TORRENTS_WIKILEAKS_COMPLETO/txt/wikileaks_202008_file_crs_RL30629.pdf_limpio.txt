specialist in income security domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30629older workers employment and retirement trends summary as the members of the baby boom generation people born between 1946 and 1964 approach retirement the demogra phic profile of the us workforce will undergo substantial shift large numbe r of older workers will be joined by relatively few new entrants to the labor fo rce according to the census bureau while the number of people between the ag of 55 and 64 will grow by about 11 million between 2005 and 2025 the number of people who are 25 to 54 years old will grow by only 5 million this trend c ould affect economic growth because labor force participation begins to fall after age 55 in 2007 91 of men and 75 of women aged 25 to 54 participated in the labor force in contrast just 70 of men and 58 of women aged 55 to 64 were eith er working or looking for work in 2007 the rate of employment among persons age 55 and older is influenced by general economic conditions eligibility for social security benefits the availability of health insurance and the prevalence nd design of employersponsored pensions labor force participation among people 55 nd older may for example be affected both by the trend away from definedbene fit pension plans that offer monthly annuity for life to defined contribution plan s that typically pay lumpsum benefit the declining percentage of employers that offer retiree health insurance also may result in more people continuing to work until they are eligible for medicare at 65 census bureau data show that the pe rcentage of men and women age 62 and older who work in paid employment has rise n over the past several years in march 2008 52 of men aged 62 to 64 were empl oyed compared with 43 in 1995 and 42 in 1990 of men aged 65 to 69 33 were employed in march 2008 compared with 27 in 1995 and 26 in 1990 among women 62 to 64 years old 41 were working in march 2008 compared with 32 in 1995 and 28 in 1990 whereas among women 65 to 69 years old 27 were working in march 2008 compared with 17 in 1995 and 1990 there also has been trend toward more fulltime employment among older americans who work in march 2008 82 of employed men aged 62 to 64 were working full time compared with 77 in 1995 and 1990 seventytwo percent of men aged 65 to 69 who were working in march 2008 were employed fulltime compared with 57 in 1995 and 56 in 1990 among working women aged 62 to 64 65 worked fulltime in march 2008 compared with 60 in both 1995 and 1990 whereas am ong working women aged 65 to 69 55 were employed fulltime in march 2008 compar ed with 43 in 1995 and 44 in 1990 as more workers reach retirement age employers may try to induce some of them to remain on the job perhaps on part time basis this is sometimes referred to as phased retirement several appr oaches to phased retirement job sharing reduced work schedules and rehiring retired workers on parttime or temporary basis can be accommodated under current law the pension protection act of 2006 pl 109280 allows pension plans to begin paying benefits to workers who have not yet separated from their employers at the earlier of age 62 or the pension plans normal retirement age which in most plans is 65 some employers would like to be able to pay partial pension distributions to workers who have reached the pension plans early retirement age this would require change in federal lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30629contents the aging of the labor force 2005 to 2025 2 l n g t r m t r n d s i n l b r f r c p r t i c i p t i n r t s 3recent

their personal economic circumstances and the nations economy the number of people retiring each year affects the size of the labor force which has direct impact on the economys capacity to produce goods and services ot her things being equa l fewer retirements in any given year would result in greater supply of experienced workers available to employers and fewer people relying on sa vings pensions and social security as their main sources of income conseque ntly changes in the ageprofile of the population and the average age at which pe ople retire have implications for both the growth of national income and the size and composition of the federal budget to understand the factors that affect the retirement decision one must first know what it means to retire retirement is most often define d with reference to two characteristics whether an individual participates in the paid labor force and whether he or she receives income from pension or social security an individual who does not work for compensation and who receives income from pensions or social security would be retired according to both parts of this definition while one who works for compensation and receives income from pensions or social security would not be retired accordin g to either part of the definition between these two extremes however there are many people who might be considered to be retired ba sed on one part of the definition but not the other for example individuals who have retired from careers in law enforcement or the military both of which typically provide pensions after 20 years of service often work for many years at other jobs while also receiving pension from their prior employment in such cases having re tired from particul ar occupation does not necessarily mean that one has retired fro m the workforce on the other hand many people who retire from fulltime employment continue to work parttime to supplement the income they receive from pe nsions and social security if the majority of their income is provided by social security pensions and savings economists typically classify them as retire d even though they continue to engage in paid employment as these examples suggest not everyone who receives pension income is retired and so people who work for pay actually are retired this report begins by describing the ch ange in the age distribution of the us population that will occur between 2005 and 2025 and by summarizing the historical data on the labor force participation of ol der workers this discussion is followed by an analysis of data from the

members of the baby boom generation people born between 1946 and 1964 reach retirement age the demographic profile of the american population will undergo profound change ccording to the census bureau the proportion of the us population aged 65 and older will increase from 124 in 2005 to 182 by 2025 the agedistribution those 25 to 64 years old already is undergoing substantial shift toward gr eater number of older individuals and relative scarcity of young pe ople entering the labor force the data presented in table 1 show how the age profile of the us population will change between 2005 and 2025 according to the census bureau there were 193 million americans aged 25 or older in 2005 by 2025 this number will increase by 22 to almost 236 million however th number of people 25 to 54 years old the ages when labor force participation rates are highest will increase by only 38 at the same time the number of people between the ages of 55 and 64 is projected to increase by 11 million or more than 36 in other words while the number of people between the ages of 25 nd 64 is projected to increase by about 16 million between 2005 and 2025 more than twoth irds of the increase is projected

employment and earnings longterm trends in labor force participation rates the labor force participation rate is the percentage of the population that is either employed or unemployed and looki ng for work it varies by age and sex moreover labor force participation rates have changed over time as people have responded to economic incentives and as the norms and values of society have changed with respect to the employment of women and the retirement of older workers also as the united stat has moved from an economy based on smokestack industries such as minin g and manufacturing to servicebased economy there has been an increase in demand for highlyeducated workers and relatively less demand for workers who ar able to perform physically demanding labor at the same time that the economy has been producing jobs that can be done by workers of more varied physical abilitie s the twoearner couple has become the rule rather than the exception it was 30 or 40 years ago finally with near universal coverage by social security and about half of all workers participating in an employersponsored pension or retirem ent savings plan many workers now anticipate retirement as an opportunity for isure and recreation rather than as time of financial depende ncy on their children men who are over the age of 55 are less likely to participate in the labor force today than their counterparts of half century ago according to data from the bureau of labor statistics in the 1950s 5 out of 6 men aged 55 to 64 participated in the labor force that is they were ither working or actively looking for work1 see table 2 by 1985 only 2 out of 3 men in that age group participated in the labor force most of the decline occu rred over relatively brief period from about 1970 to the mid1980s among men 65 and older the decline in labor force participation began earlier but it also appears to have ended around 1985 between 1950 and 1985 the labor force pa rticipation rate among men 65 and older fell from 46 to about 16 since 1995 the labor fo rce participation rate among men aged 55 to 64 has risen from 66 to 70 while th labor force participation rate for men aged 65 and older has increased from 17 to 21 from 1950 to the present womens labor force participation rates have steadily increased among women aged 55 to 64 the labor force participa tion rate rose from 27 in 1950 to 45 in 1990 and to 58 in 2007 among women aged 65 and older however the labor force particip ation rate fell from 11 in 1955 to 73 in 1985 since then the labor for ce participation rate of wo men 65 and older has slowly but steadily risen reaching 126 in 2007httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30629crs4 table 2 labor force participation rates 1950 to 2007 yearage groups 25 to 54 55 to 64 65 and up men 1950

data in this section are from the march supplement to the cps and show employment in the week prior to the cps interview the march cps files were used for this analysis because they include detailed data about sources of income in the previous year crs used in formation about current labor force status rather than information about labor force status in the previous year because an individual who reported that he or she both worked and rece ived pension income during the previous year might have worked and received pension income consecutively rather than concurrentlyrecent employment trends among people aged 55 and older factors that influence the rate of empl oyment among persons aged 55 and older include the state of the job market the availability of health insurance eligibility for social security benefits and both the pr evalence and design of employersponsored pensions labor force participation am ong people 55 and older might for example be affected by the trend away from defi nedbenefit pension plans which often include earlyretirement subsidies and pa guaranteed benefit for life toward defined contribution plans which are agene utral in design and often pay out single lump sum at retirement relatively few employers offer retiree health insurance and so some workers may choose to remain em ployed until they become eligible for medicare at age 65 data collected by the census bur eau indicate that between 1990 and 2008 employment remained generally steady among men 55 to 61 years old and rose among women in this age group2 see table 3 and table 4

retirement plans are not counted as income on the cps to the extent that indivi duals take lumpsum distributions from these plans and deposit the funds into nonretirement account from which they make

veterans pensions and periodic payments from annuities insurance policies individual retirement accounts 401k accounts and keogh plans for the selfemployed3 not surprisingly the proporti on of men and women who receive income from pension or other retirement plan increases with age in 2007 only 17 of men aged 55 to 64 received income from pension or other retirement plan among those aged 65 or older 42 had in come from pensions or retirement savings plans the patterns among women were similar only 11 of 55 to 64yearold women received income from pensions or retirement savings plans in 2007 whereas 28 of those aged 65 or older received such income the 17 of men aged 55 to 64 who were receiving pension income in 2007 represents decline from 23 who recei ved such income in 1990 and 1995 over the same period the proportion of men aged 65 or older receiving pension income also fell declining from 49 in 1990 to 42 in 2007 the proportion of women aged 55 to 64 with pension income fell slig htly from 13 in 1990 to 11 in 2006 among women 65 or older 28 received income from pensions and retirement savings plans in 2007 little changed from 28 in 1990 and 27 in 1995 to study the relationship between employment rates and receipt of pension distributions we grouped the men and wome n into two age categories 55 to 64 and 65 and older and calculated the correlation coefficient between the percentage who were employed and the percentage who received pension income among men there is negative correlation between receipt of pension income and employment over the period from 1994 to 2007 the correla tion between current employment and receipt of pension income was 087 for men 55 to 64 years old and 084 for men 65 and older however th statistics do not tell us why employment has risen among men 55 and older while the receipt of pension income has fallen one possible explanation is that each year smaller percentage of workers are covered by defined benefit plans which often have generous early retir ement subsidies and pay monthly benefit that is guaranteed for life workers whose main retirement plan is defined contribution plan such as 401k might be choosing to delay retirement in order to build up larger account balances or to make up for pa st investment losses among women the percentage who were employed and the percentage who received pension income were not str ongly correlated over the period from 1994 to 2007 014 for women aged 5564 and 016 for wo men 65 and older this is partlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30629crs9 due to the fact that the rate of labor force participation among women under age 65 has been rising steadily over many years thus one reason that the percentage of all women 55 and older who receive pension income has not fallen along with that of men is that an increasing percentage of women have earned retirement benefits through their own employment this coul d mask decline in the percentage of working women who are or

percentage points lower than in 1995 decline that coin cided with the rising employment rates among men in this age group see table 4 the decline in the percentage of 62 to 64yearold men receiving

retirement worker moves from fulltime employment to complete withdrawal from th labor force in single step in fact however many workers choose to continue wo rking after they have retired from their career jobs the process of retiring often occurs gradually over several years with some workers retiring from yearround full time employment and moving to part time or partyear work at another firm of ten in different ccupation the data in table 6 for example show that 37 of men and 35 of women aged 55 to 64 who received income from pension in 2007 were employed in march 2008 as members of the babyboom generation begin to retire millions of skilled and experienced workers will exit the labor force as this occurs employers may find it necessary to alter their employment pract ices and pension plans to induce some of those who would otherwise retire to remain on the job perhaps on parttime or part year schedule this process is sometimes referred to as phased retirement statutory definition of phase d retirement exists but one analyst has described it ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30629crs14 5 testimony of wilma k schopp on behalf of the association of private pension and welfare

reduced schedule as transition into full retirement it may also include situations in which older employees receive some or all of their retirement benefits while still employed5 prior to enactment of the pension pr otection act of 2006 ppa pl 109280 an employee could take distributions from an employers defi ned benefit pension only after having separated from the employer or after having reached the pension plans normal retirement age which by w cannot be greater than 65 section 905 of the ppa amended the employee retiremen t income security act of 1974 erisa such that distributions from qualified re tirement plan to an employee who has not separated from the employer can begin at ag 62 even if this is younger than the plans normal retirement age some em ployers have suggested phased retirement would be embraced by more firms if pension distributions could be paid to employees at the plans early retirement age employers could offer inservice distributions to employees who have reached the plans early retirement age but who have not separated from the em ployer only if the internal revenue code and erisa were amended to allow such early distributions current approaches to phased retirement employers have devised number of st rategies to retain the services of employees who are eligible to retire and who might be lost to the firm if the only options available to them are fulltime em ployment or fulltime retirement some firms allow retirementeligible employees to work fewer days per week or fewer hours per day some also permit employees to reduce their workload through job sharing firms sometimes rehire retired employees on parttime or temporary basis or bring them back as contractors or cons ultants rather than as regular employees two of these arrangements hiring retired former employees on parttime or temporary basis and hiring retirees as cont ractors require the individual to separate from the employer before returning under an alternative work arrangement this introduces considerable uncertainty into the process for both the retiree and the employer because once the employment relationship is severed neither party is legally bound to renew it phased retirement and pension distributions unless an employee has reached the earlier of age 62 or the pension plans normal retirement age the plan cannot pay retirement benefits to the indi vidual while he or she remains employed by the firm even if only on parttime basis in order to qualify for the favorable tax status granted to taxqualified pension pl ans the plan must pay benefits only on condition of death disability rmination of employment pl an termination or at the normal retirement age6 plan that pays benefits to an employee who has not

earnings on those contributions are counted as income to the employee in the years that they occur instead pensions are taxed as income when th benefits are paid to plan participants in retirement usually retirees are taxed at lowe r marginal tax rate than when they worked 8 if plan participant continues to work for an employer beyond the plans normal retirement age the plan must meet the statut ory requirements for continued benefit accruals see 26 usc 411b1h 9 vivian fields and robert hutchens regul atory obstacles to phased retirement in the forprofit sector benefits quarterly volume 18 3 third quarter 2002 10 requirements for qualification of pension plans are defined at 26 usc 401areached the plans normal retirement age could lose its taxqualified status7 an employee who has reached age 62 or the pension plans normal retirement age can begin to receive distributions from the pl an even if he or she continues to be employed by the firm8 likewise an employee who has reached the plans early retirement age can begin to receive dist ributions from the plan upon separation from the firm provided that he or she has completed the required number of years of service stipulated by the plan if par ticipant has separated from the employer and has begun receiving distributions from the plan at the early retirement age he or she can continue to receive these distributions ev if at some future date the participant becomes reemployed by the plan sponsor in order to retain th plans taxqualified status however the employer may be re quired to demonstrate to the internal revenue service that both bona fide retirement or other termination of employment and legitimate rehire have occurred9 one way for firm to offer phased re tirement to these workers under current law without jeopardizing the taxqualified status of its pension plan would be for it to lower the normal retirement age for example if the normal retirement age under the plan is 62 and the early retirement age is 55 the firm could reduce the normal retirement age to some age between 55 and 62 from the employers point of view there would be at least two potentia l drawbacks to such an approach first it could result in an unintended exodus of workers into retirement because all eligible plan participants would be able to receive full pension benefits at an earlier age than previously second it could incr ease the cost of funding the plan because full benefits would be payable at younger age rather than reduce the normal retirement age in their pension plans some employers would prefer that congress amend the internal revenue code to allow in service pension distributions to employees who have reached the plans early retirement age or some age between the early retirement age and 6210 s m observers believe however that such polic would be contrary to the main purpose of pension plans which is to replace wage income during retirement if employers were permitted to pa pension benefits to individuals still engaged in gainful employment the benefits would become taxsubsidized supplement to wages permitting inservice distributions to curre nt employees who have not reached age 62 or the plans normal retirement age might allow employers to compensate current employees with pension funds effectiv ely reducing their operating expenses by shifting some costs to the pension fund th at would otherwise be paid as wageshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30629crs16 11 it might also seem reasonable that if legislation were passed to allow inservice distributions from an employers defined benefit plan at the plans early retirement age then distributions from the employers defined cont ribution plan should be permitted at the same age perhaps with lower limit of 55 howeve r such policy would suffer from at least two drawbacks first the minimum age fo r inservice distributions from defined contribution plans which is now the same for ll such plans would differ from firm to firm thus making the retirement planning process even more confusing for workers and their families second it would be administrativel difficult and in some cases perhaps impossible to tie the minimum age for inser vice distributions in the defined contribution plan to the early retirement age specified in the employers defined benefit planamending the internal revenue code to permit inservice distributions at the early retirement age would alter incentives to work or retire as well as how much to work and for whom to work consequen tly it would affect both labor force participation and hours worked among olde r employees the net effect of these changes in labor force par ticipation and hours worked w ould be almost impossible to predict some workers who otherwise w ould have fully retired before the plans normal retirement age would choose instead to continue working for their current employer on reduced schedule because they would be able to take partial pension distributions while still employed this would tend to increase labor force participation other workers who would have taken early retirement and then sought other employment might choose instead to remain with their current employer on reduced schedule the effect of this ch ange in behavior on hours worked might be close to neutral depending on the wages available from alternative employment and the income received from pension distributions finally some employees who otherwise would have chosen to continue working until reaching the plans normal retirement age might instead reduce thei r work schedule and supplement their earnings with partial distributions from the retirement plan this would tend to reduce total hours worked distributions fr om 401k plans inservice distributions from defined cont ribution plans that occur before the participant reaches age 59½ are subject to 10 tax penalty in addition to ordinary income taxes distributions may begin as early as age 55 however if the employee separates from his employer under an ear ly retirement plan some advocates of phased retirement arrangements have suggested that the minimum age for inservice distributions from defined contribution plans should be lowered from 59½ to 5511 the effect on labor force participation of such change in tax policy would likely be very similar to the effect of allowing inservice distributions from defined benefit plan at the plans early retirement age some workers who might have fully retired from the labor force earlier than age 59½ so that they could begin taking distributions from the plan w ould be induced to work longer others who would have taken early retirement and then sought work elsewhere would remain with their current employers because they would be able to combine wages from parttime work with distributions from the retirement plan finally some employees who otherwise would have chosen to conti nue working until age 59½ or later would reduce their work schedules and supplement their earnings with distributions from the retirement plan
