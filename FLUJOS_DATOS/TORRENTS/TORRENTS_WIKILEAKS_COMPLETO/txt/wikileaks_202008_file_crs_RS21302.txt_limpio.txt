firefighting activities are traditionally the responsibility of states and local communities as such funding for firefighters is provided mostly by state and local governments during the 1990s shortfalls in state and local budgets coupled with increased responsibilities ie counterterrorism of local fire departments led many in the fire community to call for additional financial support from the federal government while federally funded training programs existed and continue to exist through usfas national fire academy and while federal money has been available to first responders for counterterrorism training and equipment through the department of justice1 there did not exist dedicated program exclusively for firefighters which provided federal money 1 for list of federal programs providing assistance to state and local first responders see crs report rl32348 selected federal homeland security assistance programs summary by shawn reese crs2 directly to local fire departments to help address wide variety of equipment training and other firefighterrelated needs authorizations the fire act and the safer act during the 106th congress many in the fire community asserted that local fire departments require and deserve greater support from the federal government in response hr 1168 the firefighter investment and response enhancement fire act was introduced on march 17 1999 by representative pascrell the bill authorized the director of the federal emergency management agency fema to make grants to fire departments for the purpose of protecting the public and firefighting personnel against fire and firerelated hazards in the senate the fire act was introduced by senator dodd s 1941 and senator campbell s 1899 ultimately fire act language was agreed to in the senate by unanimous consent as an amendment offered by senator dodd to the fy2001 national defense authorization act pl 106398 signed into law on october 30 2000 title xvii of pl 106398 amended the federal fire prevention and control act httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21302 pl 934982 to establish new office in fema to administer grants to fire departments and fire prevention organizations for variety of purposes including hiring and training personnel prevention programs equipment and facilities and public education the law stipulated that volunteer departments receive proportion of the total grant funding that is not less than the proportion of the us population that those departments protect meanwhile fema was directed to conduct an 18month study in conjunction with the national fire protection association on the need for federal assistance to state and local communities to fund firefighting and emergency response activities the study entitled needs assessment of the us fire service was released in january 2003 and found that many fire departments particularly volunteer companies in rural communities report shortfalls in facilities equipment and training of personnel for firefighter assistance pl 106398 authorized 100 million for fy2001 and 300 million for fy2002 however in the wake of the september 11 2001 terrorist attack on the world trade center and the pentagon the senate amended the fy2002 department of defense authorization act s 1438 to include language providing increased authorization levels for the assistance to firefighters program an additional increase was inserted during the housesenate conference on the defense authorization bill authorizing the program at 900 million per year through fy2004 and expanding the scope of the grants to

firefighter assistance is codified as section 33 of the federal fire prevention and control act of 1974 15 usc 2229 crs3 administer the program additionally hr 4107 sought to increase the current award caps for grant recipients while reducing required costsharing nonfederal matches of perhaps greatest controversy was provision which would prohibit grant recipients from discriminating against

11 2004 the senate version of the fire grant reauthorization was introduced by senator dodd s 2411 the assistance to firefighters act of 2004 sought to authorize the fire grant program through fy2010

the total request for firefighter assistance was 55 below the fy2007 level for fire and safer grants combined the fy2008 budget proposal would have eliminated grants for wellnessfitness activities and modifications to facilities for firefighter safety the budget justification requested funding for applications that enhance the most critical capabilities of local response to firerelated hazards in the event of terrorist attack or major disaster the budget justification also stated that the requested level of funding is an appropriate level of funding given the availability of significant amounts of funding for first responder preparedness missions from other department of homeland security dhs grant programs which are better coordinated with state and local homeland security strategies and unlike afg are allocated on the basis of risk the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 pl 110161 provided 560 million for fire grants and 190 million for safer grants total of 750

fy2009 the administration proposed 300 million for fire grants in fy2009 46 cut from the fy2008 level of 560 million funding was proposed for safer grants the total request for firefighter assistance was 60 below the fy2008 level for fire and safer grants combined according to the budget justification the administration believes that 287 million is an appropriate level of funding given the availability of significant amounts of funding for first responder preparedness missions from other dhs grant programs which are coordinated with state and local homeland security strategies and unlike afg are allocated on the basis of risk priority will be given to applications that enhance capabilities needed for terrorism response and other major incidents funding will only be available for critical response equipment training and personal protective gear and will not be available for wellnessfitness activities or modifications to facilities for firefighter safety on june 19 2008 the senate appropriations committee approved the fy2009 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21302 appropriations bill for the department of homeland security s 3181 srept 110396 the bill would provide 750 million for firefighter assistance including 560 million for fire grants and 190 million for safer grants this is the same funding level approved for fy2008 the committee directed dhs to continue the present practice of funding applications according to local priorities and those established by the us fire administration and further directed dhs to continue direct funding to fire departments and the peer review process additionally 3 million was made available for foam firefighter equipment used in remote areas on june 24 2008 the house appropriations committee approved its version of the fy2009 appropriations for the department of homeland security the committee would provide 800 million for firefighter assistance consisting of 570 million for fire grants and 230 million for safer grants the committee directed fema to continue granting funds directly to local fire departments and to include the us fire administration during the grant administration process while also maintaining an allhazards focus and not limiting the list of eligible activities the committee would continue the requirement that fema peer review grant applications that meet criteria established by fema and the fire service rank order applications according to peer review fund applications according to their rank order and provide official notification detailing why applications do not meet the criteria for review the committee also directed fema to encourage regional applications issues primary issue in the 110th congress is how appropriations for fire grants should compare with the authorized levels of 1 billion for those years the administrations budget proposals have typically recommended significant cuts for fire grants as well as zero funding for safer grants opponents of the cuts have argued that the reduced levels are inadequate to meet the needs of fire departments while the administration has cited the availability of other riskbased dhs first responder grant programs and has argued that reduced levels for afg are sufficient to enhance critical capabilities in the event of terrorist attack or major disaster aside from budget issues an ongoing issue crs6 has been the focus of the fire grant program administration budget proposals have sought to shift the priority of the fire grant program to terrorism preparedness firefighting groups have questioned this proposed shift arguing that the original purpose of the fire act enhancing basic firefighting needs should not be compromised or diluted similarly in recent years the house and senate appropriations committees have directed the afg program to maintain broad allhazards focus s 608 the riskbased homeland security grants act of 2007 would direct dhs to conduct study analyzing the distribution of fire grant awards and the level of unmet firefighting equipment needs in each state related issue is the role of the us fire administration in the administration of the fire grant program at its inception the program was administered by the usfafema and focused on enhancing the basic needs of fire departments across the nation in the fy2004 budget request as part of its effort to consolidate terrorism preparedness grants under single entity the administration proposed to relocate the fire grant program within the office for domestic preparedness odp whose mission was to provide state and local governments with assistance to improve their readiness for terrorism incidents the fy2004 dhs appropriations act pl 10890 acceded to the administrations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21302 request and relocated the fire grants to odp the conferees directed that dhs shall continue current administrative practices in manner identical to the current fiscal year including peer review process of applications granting funds directly to local fire departments and the inclusion of the united states fire administration during grant administration on january 26 2004 thendhs secretary ridge informed congress of his intention to consolidate odp including the assistance to firefighters program into the office of state and local government coordination preparedness oslgcp the fy2005 homeland security appropriations act pl 108334 placed the fire grant program within oslgcp however the assistance to firefighters grant program reauthorization act of 2004 pl 108375 designated administration of the fire grant program to usfa according to the fy2006 budget request the fire grant program would be administered by the oslgcp in cooperation with the usfa on july 13 2005 dhs secretary michael chertoff announced restructuring of dhs effective october 1 2005 under the restructuring plan the fire grants as well as the safer grants were to be administered by the office of grants and training in the new dhs directorate for preparedness however legislation considered in the 109th congress sought to restructure fema within dhs with the result that fire and safer grant programs would be transferred back to fema ultimately title vi of the conference agreement on the dhs appropriations bill pl 109295 hrept 109699 the post katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 transferred most of the existing preparedness directorate including fire and safer grants and the usfa back to an enhanced fema
