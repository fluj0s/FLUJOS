the fifth anniversary of jeanclaude duvaliers flight into exile president aristide was faced with some of the most serious and persistent social economic and political problems in the western hemisphere after eight months in office aristide had received mixed reviews he was credited with curbing crime in the capital reducing the number of employees in bloated state enterprises and taking actions to bring the military under civilian control but some observers questioned his governments commitment to democracy opposition leaders and others criticized him for not establishing cooperative relationship among the democratic elements failing to consult the legislature in appointments as required by the constitution and for manipulating the judicial system in the prosecution of duvalierists his record in the area of respect for human rights was also mixed he was criticized for appearing to condone mob violence but was also credited with significantly reducing human rights

contributed to political polarization within haiti by refusing to condemn violent acts of retribution and holding out the threat of mob violence against those who disagr eed with him on september 30 1991 days after speech in which some contend aristide threatened the bourgeoisie for not having helped his government enough aristide was overthrown by the military some maintained that the elite business class financially supported the coup leaders most human rights monitors credit aristides first administration with being the first haitian government to address the need to improve respect for human rights and the needs of the poor majority they also asserted that progress made during his term was undone by the military regime that followed most sources credit aristide with creating much greater sense of security in haiti during his first term than there had been in years according to the state department human rights reports for 1991 and 1992 there were reports of disappearances during aristides eightmonth term and dozens in the months following the coup the state department estimated couprelated deaths at 300500 at the time while amnesty international estimated them to number over 1500

leaders of the military coup faced stronger international sanctions than did previous coup leaders in haiti mainly because democratic government had been overthrown for over three years the military regime resisted international demands that aristide be restored to office us policy consisted of pressuring the facto haitian government to restore constitutional democracy to haiti under the administration of president george h w bush measures included cutting off assistance to the haitian government imposing trade embargoes as called for by the organization of american states oas and the united nations and supporting oas and diplomatic efforts while some observers believed that the administration of president william j clinton intensified pressure on the haitian regime and helped advance negotiations to restore democracy to haiti others felt it did not apply enough pressure after the collapse of the governors island accord which called for the military regimes resignation and aristides return to power by october 30 1993 8 critics increased pressure on the clinton administration to change its policy the administration then took tougher stance toward the military regime imposing everstiffer sanctions and ultimately ordering military intervention to remove it on september 18 1994 when it learned that us military intervention had been launched the military regime signed an agreement with the united states providing for aristides return it also called for the immediate unopposed entry of us troops legislative amnesty for the military and the resignation of the military leadership president aristide returned to haiti on october 15 1994 under the protection of some 20000 us troops on march 31 1995 having declared that secure and stable environment had been

whose democratic practices were in trouble and asked the oas to try again to help negotiate solution to the crisis the oas had been mediating onagain offagain talks between the aristide government and the opposition alliance democratic convergence in oas mediated talks in july 2001 the aristide government and the opposition agreed to hold new elections for local and most parliamentary seats but could not agree on schedule tensions and violence in haiti increased dramatically after aristide assumed his second term in office supporters of both president aristides lavalas family party and the opposition coalition convergence reportedly engaged in cycle of violent revenge in january 2002 the oas permanent council passed resolution 806 establishing an oas mission in haiti and calling for the haitian government to do all it could to ensure climate of security and confidence necessary to hold free and fair elections in july 2002 the oas released report stating that december 2001 attack on the national palace was not an attempted coup as the aristide administration had claimed and that the political opposition did not participate in the planning or in the execution of the attack it also said that the government and lavalas party officials gave arms to militants who plundered and burned the homes and offices of opposition members after the palace attack 13 also in july 2002 the opposition proposed that presidential elections be reheld as well all the oas member states recognized aristide as haiti s legitimate head of state however and the oas secretary general said that the november 2000 elections have never been the subject of an oas or summit of the americas mandate meaning that only the disputed may 2000 parliamentary elections were within the oas mandate to negotiate solution 14 in september 2002 the oas passed resolution 822 that tried to break the political impasse by recognizing the governments constitutional electoral prerogatives in other words it removed the obstacle of having to complete negotiations with the opposition before elections could be held consensus resolution negotiated by member states and voted for by haiti stated that legislative and local elections were to be held in 2003 on date to be set by new provisional electoral council cep an autonomous independent credible and neutral cep was to be established by november 4 2002 haiti failed to

effect aristides claim and his call for his supporters to resist the international occupation would have on efforts to restore order and stability in haiti concerns were also raised about the civil opposition as represented by the democratic platform in haiti some observers questioned the right of the civil opposition to participate in an interim government given their rejection of political

political persecution by the interim government in the end elections were held in 2006 and fanmi lavalas participated many observers expressed concern over the actions of former members of the haitian military after aristides departure many former military personnel demanded reinstatement of the haitian army which was disbanded by president aristide in 1995 following period of multiple military coups and gross violations of human rights carried out under military rule the us government and human rights organizations have objected to armed rebels being given any formal role in haitian security forces the interim government increased concerns in april 2004 when prime minister latortue called the rebels freedom fighters and haitis top police official in the northern region met with former paramilitary leader louis jodel chamblain and guy philippe to negotiate roles for their fighters in the police force21 chamberlain had been convicted in absentia for killing justice minister and chief financier of former president aristide guy philippe was accused of leading coup attempt against president préval during his first term in office in june 2004 latortue assured us officials that former soldiers would be subject to the same criteria and human rights vetting procedures as other applicants for joining the haitian national police nonetheless some observers were concerned noting that government discussions of disarmament focused more on former aristide supporters than on armed rebels and former members of the army in addition the government presided over rushed retrial of chamblain in which he was acquitted of the 1993 political assassination he had been convicted of in absentia some critics described the latortue government as weak and partisan they noted the interim governments difficulties in organizing elections and voiced concern that ongoing violence and human rights violations created an intimidating atmosphere that inhibited political participation

another us concern has been the protection of human rights and the improvement of security conditions within haiti during his first term in 1995 president aristide took steps to break with the pattern in which militarydominated police force was associated with human rights abuses haiti with us assistance demobilized the old military established an interim police force of selected exmilitary personnel and began to train professional civilian haitian national police force the level of reported violence flight of refugees and alleged assassinations dropped markedly from very high levels during the facto military regime following the return to civilian rule in 1994 haiti made progress in the protection of human rights but the gains made were fragile and threatened by political tensions and problems with impunity during president aristides second term increases in political violence renewed concerns over security and police effectiveness in 2001 president aristide announced zero tolerance policy toward suspected criminals according to various human rights reports this announcement was followed by numerous extrajudicial killings by the haitian national police and lynchings by mobs the governments respect for freedom of th press continued to deteriorate according to the state departments february 2004 human rights practices report the haitian governments human rights record remained poor with political and civil officials implicated in serious abuses after armed rebellions led to the departure of president jeanbertrand aristide in february 2004 an interim government took over but security conditions remain tenuous the destruction of prisons and subsequent escape of prisoners in the turmoil of early 2004 and the governments granting of amnesty to convicted criminals in january 2005 further added to instability gangs

aristide supporter antoine izmery chamblain had been convicted in absentia the state department called on the interim haitian government to ensure that trials involving accusations of gross human rights violations and other such crimes be conducted in credible manner 44 philippe who was also police commissioner in cap haitien fled into exile after being accused of involvement in coup attempt against president préval in 2000 philippe said he wanted to reconstitute the haitian army and declared himself its head in march 2004 he then ran for president in the 2006 elections both men appeared to have high degree of popular support the haitian army which had long history of human rights abuses was disbanded in 1995 former soldiers have staged protests demanding the restoration of the army and 10 years of back pay presidentelect préval has said he will promote constitutional amendment to finalize the dissolution of the army although some aristide supporters have allegedly committed

haitians are economic migrants and should therefore be returned to haiti or whether they are refugees with wellfounded fear of persecution who should be allowed to stay in the united states while applying for political asylum some members and human rights advocates express concern that haitians are not given the same treatment as other aliens seeking asylum in the united states president bush
