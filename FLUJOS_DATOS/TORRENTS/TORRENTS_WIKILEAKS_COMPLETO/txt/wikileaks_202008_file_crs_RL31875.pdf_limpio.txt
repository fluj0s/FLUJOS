the mid1980s certain employero riented groups and individuals have urged amendment of the fair labor sta ndards act the flsa to alter current overtime pay requirement s in part they have soug ht to broaden opportunities for private sector employers to offer to their employees workhours flexibility legislation to effect this end was introduced at least as early as the 99th congress and has been reintroduced in various forms up to and including the 109th congress the format has changed somewhat the vari ous bills have not yet been adopted under the flsa the standard work w eek is normally 40 hours after 40 hours of work in single week payment for dditional hours of work is at the rate of time andahalf ie 1½ times workers regular rate of pay within single work week any combination of hours can be wo rked however once the total hours of work exceeds 40 in single week the pre mium rate timeandaha lf must be paid the various proposals differing some what from one congress to the next would have allowed an employer to offer to his or her employees the option of trading time off compensatory time off or comp time for cash payment for overtime hours worked instead of being paid in cash for extra hours of work those in excess of 40 per week the employee would have been allowed to take time off with payment usually proposals vary on this on the basis of 1½ hours of paid leave for each hour of overtime worked the legislation provides that the arrangement would be voluntary for each of the parties either worker or his or her employer could opt out of the program nd if worker so desired the accrued and unused comp time could later be converted to cash earnings under federal law employers that are public agencies now have the option of granting to their employees within reas on flexible work hours however public employees work under diverse pr otections for example civ il service rules that are not available to private sector employees through the years number of questions have been and continue to be raised with respect to these proposals for exam ple how flexible is current law where private sector workhours practices are c oncerned what level of choice would workers have under the proposal what imp act would it have on the basic wagehour protections of the flsa at large would comp time assist or hinder working parents as they attempt to meet th eir dual responsibilities of home and work the legislation has been contentious speaking generally employers have supported the concept often in the na of working mothers conversely organized labor and

for overtime hours worked has been intermittently befo re the congress for nearly 20 years as various proposals to give effect to comp time have been introduced they have been redefined in ways intended to make them more palpable to workers and to their representatives but without dimin ishing their essential thrust the most recent standalone legislation emerged during the 108th congress on february 5 2003 senator judd gregg rnh introduced s 317 the family time and workplace flexibility act an umbre lla proposal that d ealt with several workhoursrelated initiatives in addition to comp time1 action was taken on s 317 on march 6 2003 representative judy biggert rill introduced hr 1119 the family time flexibility act th biggert bill was referred to the house committee on education and the workforce and on april 9 2003 the committee voted to report it without change the vot was along party lines with democrats voting against the measure 22 nays nd republicans 27 yeas voting in support though hr 1119 was placed on the union calendar further action was taken and the bill died at the close of the 108th congress through its most recent history the concept of workplace flexibility has appeared within the context of debate over the federal minimum wage although significantly scaled back it has been used by critics of an expanded minimum wage as an offsetting measure particularly in the interest of working women notably of soccer moms in march 2005 senator edward kennedy dma as part of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and c onsumer protection act of 2005 s 256 proposed an increase in the minimum wage immediately senator rick santorum rpa proposed his own but lower minimum wage amendment but combined it with the workplace flexibility act at that point enhanced by series of unrelated of proindustr proposals on march 7 2005 both the kennedy and santorum proposals we re rejected by the senate2 in october 2005 during considera tion of authorization for

act again enhanced with unrelated proindustry proposals as counter to the kennedy bill on october 19 2005 each of the amendments was defeated3 finally in june 2006 during consideration of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007 further kennedy proposal was introduced that would have raised the minimum wage senator enzi countered with his own minimum wage increase l ower than proposed by senator kennedy and associated with the workforce flexibility act and with series of unrelated proindustry measures on june 21 2006 the several proposals were withdrawn4 some may have viewed the workplace flexibility proposal which organized labor and various womens advocacy groups strongly oppose as poison pill amendment others may have seen the amendment as an effort to assist working women in coping with their responsib ilities and assisting employers in paying higher wages to minimum wage workers in either case the result was the same and the bills died number of proposals have surfaced dur ing recent years to amend the overtime pay provisions of the fair labor standards act flsa this report is limited to consideration of comp time following brief introduction of the general issue this report examines the gregg and biggert proposals and assesses the questions that have been raised pro and c on with respect to compensa tory time essentially the substitution of comp time for payment of cash wages for hours worked beyond the 40hour weekly standard under the flsa as noted above the various proposals ma have changed in some particulars though their essential thrust has remained the same here for purposes of analysis this report examines the biggert bill hr 1119 and the appropria segment of the gregg bill s 317 from the 108th congress the last attempt to deal with the issue in single legislative format introduction the legislation and the issue here deals with private sector employment only state and local government workers fall unde r separate provision of the flsa 29 usc 207o those federal workers who fall under the flsa are subject to somewhat different regulatory standards administered through the office of personnel management both groups are also subject to body of public sectorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31875crs3 5 not all workers are covered under the over time pay requirements of the flsa for example executive administrative and prof essional employees are normally exempt and there are other specific exemptions that have been written into the statute by the 1990s just over 76 million nonsupervisory employees were covered by the overtime pay requirements of the act see us depa rtment of labor em ployment standards administration minimum wage and maximum hours standards under the fair labor standards act section 4d report washington 1993 p 25 6 an employer can negotiate away his workhours scheduling rights through collective bargaining agreement with union where ther is union in the shop but in the first instance the right and responsibility to sche dule work rests with the employer however in certain cases employers are restricted in the number of hours that can be assigned as matter of public safety for example certai n truck drivers may not be given hours to work in excess of specified standards but thes restraints are not part of the flsapersonnel law and relate d employee protections that do not apply to workers in the private sector in addition under s 317 and hr 1119 employees working under collective bargaining agreement are treated differen tly from those employed in establishments in which there is union presence thus given the relative decline in union membership it may be more nearly useful to deal with the entire body of private sector worker as union the structure of the issue to begin it may be useful to review the terms used in this report and to define the relative positioning of the parties involved what is overtimethe fair labor standards act of 1938 as amended establishes basic workweek of 40 hours when covere d nonexempt empl oyees work hours in excess of 40 per week they must be paid at least timeandahalf 1½ times their regular rate of pay for those hours worked in excess of 40 there is statutory cap on the number of hours that can be assigned by an employer if an employee is needed through 50 or 60 hours each week he or she can be required to work through that time period but when th number of hours worked per week exceeds 40 the higher pay rate timeandahalf is required 5 who schedules the hours employees are required to work who determines whether overtime hours are to be worked at all and if they are when they will be worked scheduling work hours is the prerogativ of the employer he or she can mandate straight 40hour work week or the employer can mandate work week that is either shorter or longer than th generally standard 40 hours the employer can also determine when those hours will be worked and by whom ie to whom overtime hours with overtime pay w ill be assigned6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31875crs4 7 the total number of hours worked in given week can of course exceed 40 hours but when they do overtime rates must be paid for those hours worked in excess of 40 there may be other leave options available to worker in some cases annual leave or leave without pay which would normally require employer approvalwhat about flexibility can the employer institute flexible scheduling if he or she chooses to accommodate the non work requirements of his employees under current law an employer can institute flexible work schedules and even comp time in some cases if he c hooses to do so within the context of 40hour workweek any arrangement of workhours is allowable for example an employer could establish compressed schedule of four days of 10 hours each as the regular work week allowing for threeday weekend each week many employers have adopted such schedule further an employer can unilaterally permit system of flextime flexible scheduling under which employees vary thei r arrival and depart ure times should an employee under current law want to work 10 hours on tuesday and 6 hours on friday that is permissible there is extra payment timeandahalf required worker can so far as the flsa is concer ned vary his or her arrival and departure times from one day to the next and from one week to the next the flsa does not establish daily minimum or maximum hours of work suppose working mother or father needs to take 4 hours off on tuesday to take child to the doctor under the flsa this does not present problem she or he can work extra hours on any other day of the week to make up for the time taken off extra pay is required for the makeup hours the comp time so long as the total hours of work per week does not exceed 40 each workweek is separate unit7 if congress has built flexibility into the flsa then what governs whether workers can use flextime intraweek co mp time compressed scheduling etc again the scheduling of hours of work is the prerogative of the employer the employer can permit flexible sc heduling if he or she chooses to do so but he is not required to do so and many dont there ar variety of reasons why many firms operate on fixed schedules one is the natu re of the work process where workers are collectively engaged as on assembly line work it may not be practical to have employees set their own arrival and departure times similarly in an office setting where an employee may be needed through specific periods doctors nurse teacher flexible scheduling may not be practical or if one thinks in terms of production blishment garment factory poultry processing plant with substantial workforce flexibility may be deemed too complicated eg managing dozens of different schedules keeping tr ack of workers merging processes and making sure that systems are covered denying scheduling flexibility and comp time to workers may also be reflection of the personal choice of an empl oyer and that is the employers optionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31875crs5 8 in general see marion c cahill shorter hours study of th movement since the civil war new york

generations9 following world war i and increasingly during the great depression the impetus for reduced hours of work seemed to shift while social and humane considerations continued to be empha sized by trade unionists and reformers economic factors took on greater weight high levels of depressionera unemployment made some measure of work sharing achieved through restraints upon the hours of work eg overtime pay requirements seem more desirable various legislative initiatives daily hour s restrictions 30hour workweek etc were urged until in 1938 congress adopted the fair labor standards act under the flsa congress dropped the concept of daily hours restraints and opted instead for what would become 40hour standa rd workweek with overtime pay where covered workers were employed in excess of 40 hours per week10 by the end of world war ii the 40hour workweek had largely become the norm in the context of the flsa hours reducti on was seen as both of social and of economic value overtime pay requirements were viewed by congress as penalty imposing cost upon employers who found it more convenient or cheaper to pay timeandahalf rather than to hire additional workers the penalty was not supposed to be without an element of ec onomic pain rather it was intended to be deterrent to inordinately long hours of work since excessive hours of workhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31875crs6 11 see pl

workplace hazards it was argued workers were not expected to bargain away the protection afforded by the 40hour workweek even though it might appear to be temporarily expedient imposition of an overtime penalty was not always quietly embraced by employers among some employers th ere was continuing opposition to such government restrictions upon wages and hours some view ed such restraints as an infringement upon managements right to manage others had broader more philosophical objections as they had ar gued against the flsa in the 1930s they would oppose any expansion of the stat ute and would continue through subsequent decades to seek through am endment to limit the scope and impact of wagehour requirements changing workforce psychology with the passage of time fewer persons were employed who had directly experienced either the adverse working conditions of the late 19th and early 20th centuries or the economic turmoil of the great depression for younger workers wagehour protections afforded by the flsa came increasingly to be taken as given as standard and accepted practice gradually the demographics of the workforce changed the percentage of workers who were trade union members co mmenced its decline and even where membership persisted both ra nkandfile and the union leadership were arguably of different orientation from those of the first three decades of the 20th century more workers were better educated and women had begun to have enhanced labor market attachment by the 1960s new movement had begun for humanization of the world of work and for flexibility legislation was approved that allowed alternative work practices for federa l employees and for enhanced workhours flexibility for employees of state and local governments11 in the private sector significant number of employers instituted flexible and compressed scheduling both as benefit for their employees and because it seemed useful tool for recruitment worker retention incr eased productivity and efficiency12 some mainly older workers and trade unions in the industrial fields viewed the movement for alternative work scheduling as an erosion of labor standards that had been developed through years of bargaining and legislative effort others especially younger workers public sector unions and nonunion womens advocacy groups however argued that the changing charact er of

inviolate flexibility became the new byword ie advocacy of alternative work patterns or of new ways to work to legislate new standards almost immediately the question was raised if flexibility is appropriate for federal and state and local public employees why not extend it to workers in the private sector13 gradually both longtime critics of federal wagehour regula tion and some younger advocates of reform adopted the rhetoric of the alternative work patterns advocates since the mid1980s various initiatives have been introduced that would restructure the overtime pay requirements of the flsa to permit private sector employers to institute some form of compensatory time off14 proposals varied as did the motivation behind them gene rally they proposed trade working extended hours when an employer was busy with extra pay and taking compensatory time off with pay when work was slack some proposed an even trade an hour worked and an hour later of leav others sought to honor the timeanda half principle by offering 1½ hours off for each hour worked15 speaking generally such proposals would have set aside or significantly modified the overtime pay requirements of the flsa

legislation with similar alignment of witnesses pr and testimony and comment followed now well defined lines proponents largely from indus try or from shrm pressed the need for reform flexibility for working mothers and restructuring of the flsa for the 21st century workplace they noted the influx of more women into the regular workforce and stressed the complexity of their dual roles as

of the issues through the 105th congress both by william g whittaker 24 statement or chairman charlie norwood subcommittee on workforce protections at hearing on hr 1119 mar 12 2003 sen gr egg expressed similar thoughts when introducing s 317 it gives working families choice he affirmed the bills comp time provision allows employees the option of taking time off in lieu of overtime pay and the senator concluded the family should have the right to choose see congressional record feb 5 2003 p s1999remedies and sanctions each of the bills contains section devoted to remedies and sanctions for violation of the proposed comp time option though they differ in certain respects public notice each bill provides that within 30 days after enactment the secretary of bor will update the regulations governing implementation of the proposed changes made through the legislati on and s imilarly update related explanatory information sunset provision each bill provides that the legislation will terminate after five years issues in the debate proposals to amend the flsa to permit employers to institute comp time option have triggered strong opinions pro and over the past two decades through that period the issues and the respective positions of protagonists have remained generally consistent comp time would mean essentially trading cash earned by working overtime hours for more leisure time an option attractive basically to those who can afford it for seasonal employees if they were to qualify the arrangement could mean remaining on the payroll through slack periods enjoying prepaid employment rather than being laid off but still the bottom line would be cashfortime tradeoff23 matter of choice in his introductory comments at the march 12 hearing on hr 1119 chairman charlie norwood rga cosponsor of the legislation affi rmed that it would allow private sector employees to choose at their option to select either paid time off or cash payment for overtime hours worke d the bill he said offers employees the choice at the employees option nd concluded the bill guarantees that the choice is in the hands of the employee 24 that perspective has frequently been reiterated by propone nts of comp time critics of the proposal however appear to be unconvinced what specifically does the bill provide first the legislation allows an employer to offer comp time option to his employees but it does not require that such ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31875crs13 25 here we are speaking of comp time as proposed under hr 1119 and s 317 not intra week comp time as is currently permitted under the flsa 26 similar provision exists in section 7o 5ab of the flsa with respect to comp time for state and local governmental employees the terms in that context have been defined through rulemaking and litigation denial of the use of comp time normally must not be rooted in whimsy nor re convenience of the employer 27 its not clear how compensatory hours alread accrued by the employee would be treated in such circumstances the employer could cash out all hours earned in excess of 80 how the first 80 hours would be treated whether the worker could insist that it remain as comp time is unclear though the employee may request payment in cashprogram be instituted if the em ployer does not choose to offer comp time then the issue is moot25 thus in the first instance the right of choice rests with the employer if an employer decides to offer comp time option then the worker has choice to accept the option or to opt for cash wage see discussion below second if the employer agrees to offer comp time option there is requirement that it be offered to all employees it would appear that he has the choice of design for the program and of establishing rules specifically to address the requirements of his particular business third if the employer opts to institute comp time program and the employee participates the particulars of the use of the compensatory leave must be agreed to by the employer request by the employee to use his accumulated comp time must be honored within reasonable period after making the request if the use of the compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer bold italics added an employee cannot simply announce on friday afternoon that he or she wants to take comp time for that afternoon and be sure the request will be granted if its convenient and does not unduly disrupt the operati on of the business fine but the request can be denied and us of the leave postponed to another time that choice rests not with the employee but with the employer26 fourth although the worker may have systematically accrued compensatory time for use for specific occasion honeymoon the birth of child study for bar exam the employer may upon 30 days notice unilaterally convert any accrued comp time in excess of 80 hours to monetary compensation thus the choice of an employee who wants to accumulate large block of comp time can be reversed by an employers decision fifth just as the employer has the right to institute or to refrain from instituting comp time program at his choice so does he have the right to discontinue such policy upon giving employees 30 days notice27 some may argue that more nearly absolute guarantee of employee choice with respect to the use of comp time would be difficult to fashion were one to attempthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31875crs14 to do so it might serve to discourage em ployer participation in the program operating business with employees arriving and departing at will as they utilize accrued comp time might disrupt the operations of the enterprise and be viewed by some as an unreasonable intrusion upon manage rial prerogatives still the several provisions of the proposed legislation woul d constrain workers freedom to choose the comp time option and to utilize accrue d compensatory hours how important such constraints may be is an issue of policy flexibility under the fair labor standards act as noted above congress has built flexib ility into the flsa like the proposed comp time option it operates at the choice of the employer ordinarily under the flsa the employee is expected to work 40hour week the purpose of the statute is to hold the hours worked per week to not more than 40 after which the employer is pe nalized by being required to pay timeandahalf for any hours worked in excess of 40 within 40hour work week any arrangement of workhours is permitted without penalty the employer can be as flexible or inflexible as he or she wishes flexible schedules irregular hours of commencing and ending the days work are permissible under the flsa similarly compressed schedulin g can be instituted ie four days of 10 hours each three days of 12 hours with 4 hours on fourth day etc even comp time is presently allowed under the flsa within the context of 40 hour work week worker desirous of ta king couple of hours off to attend his or her childs soccer game on thursday afternoon can do so with his employers agreement making up the time beforeha nd on monday tuesday or wednesday or afterward on friday the employer can allow such flexibility many do or deny it if the worker can be spared there is statutory reason why he or she can not be given the time off if an absence wo uld unduly disrupt the operations of the employer the worker can be told but the worker could also be told under the proposed comp time gislation hr 1119 or s 317 what the worker cannot do under the flsa is to come in on given afternoon ask for time off and make up that time the following week or several months later the workweek is treated as unit of 40 hours within that unit if the employer is willing there can be flexibility further under current law the worker cannot accumulate blocks of comp time to be held in reserve for use several weeks or months after it has been earnedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31875crs15 28 s 317 is somewhat broader and in separate section provides for flexible credit hour program under such an arrangement jointly agreed upon by the worker and the employer the employee may work extra hours each week in excess of the basic work requirement of the employee to be banked for future use the flexible credit hour programs does not appear to be based upon the specific need of the employer but rather upon the convenience of the worker with limited accrual of 50 credit hours at any given time the program is detailed and is merely noted here 29 in introducing s 317 senator gregg identified the target groups of workers in need of comp time option who are these workers who are currently covered by the flsa but do not have the ability to exercise workplace flexibility they are some of the hardest working americans sixty percent of thes workers have only high school education eighty percent of them make less than 28000 great percentage of them are single mothers with children see congressional record feb 5 2003 p s1999 30 under section 207a of the flsa the workw eek preovertime is defined as period of 40 hours thus person normally scheduled to work 30 hours week but asked to work 6 extra hours one week would presumably be eligible neither for regular overtime payment at timeandahalf nor for comp timeworker eligibility and participation under hr 1119 here as an example if an employer needs to have his employees work hours beyond 40 per week th question is one of payment cash at timeandahalf or paid time off comp time calculated on timeandahalf basis the comp time provisions of s 317 are similarly structured28 assuming that the employer embraces the comp time option under hr 1119 or s 317 the question may be raised bout employee eligibility for participation the bills approach the issue somewhat differently29 each bill includes provision that compensatory time off may be provided to employees by mutual agreement where there in formal trade union presence where there is recognized union presence the comp time can be provided only in accordance with applicable provisions of collective bargaining agreement between the employer and the labor organiza tion that has been certified or recognized as the representative of the employees thus in such cases the question of comp time becomes matter of bargaining between labor and management and if agreement is not reached comp time can not be implemented each bill defines overtime as it is otherwise defined in section 207 of the flsa ie hours worked in excess of 40 in sing week persons employed to work less than 40 hours week for example part time employees or persons whose regular work period is less than 40 hours would not be eligible to accrue comp time until after they had worked full 40 hours during the week30 the bills although on somewhat differe nt terms provide vesting limitation hr 1119 provides employee may receive or agree to receive compensatory time off under this subsection unless the employee has worked at least 1000 hours for the employees employer during period of continuous employment with thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31875crs16 31 under current law the timeandahalf pa requirement applies only to hours worked in excess of 40 in single work week part time employee whose regularly scheduled work period is 20 hours week could be asked to work 30 or 35 hour week and would not be eligible for overtime pay timeandahalf until in excess of 40 hours in that week had been worked 32 testimony of john dantico of shrm before the subcommittee on workforce protections mar 12 2003 hereafter cited as dantico testimony mar 12 2003 33 ibid it would also alleviate financial pre ssures for employers he suggested that might result were the end of year cashout of unused comp time to occur all at onceemployer in the 12month period before the date of agreement or receipt of compensatory time off s 317 sets the requisite number of hours for eligibility at 1250 and mits the provision for continuous employment durin g the 12 months prior to agreeing to participate in the comp time program or recei ving comp time off if one assumes that the prequalifying employment will be on fulltime or near fulltime basis 40hour week then an employee must be empl oyed for roughly between six and eight months with any single employer prior to eligibility if the hours worked are less than 40 per week the period could be l onger thus under hr 1119 intermittent workers those with breaks in service would be ineligible for the comp time option most seasonal workers those in hight urnover industries nd parttime employees would also likely be ineligible in practice31 to the extent that comp time is family friendly option the eligibility of persons employ ed on parttime or partyear basis most frequently women may be an issue with respect to the vesting requireme nt john dantico of shrm testifying before the subcommittee on workforce prot ections observed required hours of service represent practical and reasonabl balance between the employees need to become comfortable with his or her new employing organization and their personal financial situation it satis fies he continued the employers need to gain some assurance that the employee contemplates remaining with the organization for at least the near term future however if comp time is beneficial both for workers and their employers as proponents suggest providing both with fl exibility improving worker morale and productivity and reducing absenteeism so may question why coverage should be subject to length of service requirement32 bureaucracy and paperwork the 1000 workhours requirement of hr 1119 john dantico of shrm explained to the workforce protections subcommittee would produce staggered effect as workers individually became eligible in an age of electronic payroll systems he observed most employers have the resources and abilities to notify nonexempt employees when they beco eligible to accrue comp time33 on the other hand some sm all businesses larger th an mom and pop firm may find that keeping track of eligibility precise numbers of hours worked throughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31875crs17 34 both hr 1119 and s 317 would recognize the primacy of collective bargaining agreement with respect to regulation of the comp time option thus most of concern here are workers who are not covered by collective bargaining agreementsa series of months and length of tinuousservice could present problems so might tracing the number of overtime hours worked and converting them into paid time off the program however would be entered into voluntarily by the employer more complex may be the personal equation dealing fairly and equally with individual workers in granting or denying entry into the program or use of comp time to which they may assume incorrectly that they have right that can be exercised as they determine best of greater concern may be compliance actions by the department of labor with limited staff enforcement of wage and hour and related laws is already difficult compliance officers do not aud it firms on monthly basis or even on regular basis nor do all firms operate under the same accounting systems with comp time component to be factored in compliance officer would need to assess for each employee whether he was comp time eligible met the workhours and continuous employment re quirements whether the hour s worked were accurately recorded and whether comp time credit had been drawn down andor cashedout appropriately where employme nt is stable the employer is scrupulous and the firm remains in business year after year reasonable system for tracking comp time might be developed that would lend itself to eas compliance however the option would also apply to thinlycapitalized firms in industries with large numbers of workers often poorly paid sometimes semiliterate in glish frequently uncertain of their rights as workers where violations of wagehour and child bor standards may be more or less frequent to deal with complexities of diverse work environments and employerworker relationships in the private sector which is arguably quite different from that of public agencies the department coul d be expected to develop extensive implementing regulations and to impose reporting requirements some may view private sector comp time option as win win situation others may see it as unduly cumbersome and costly both likely would urge that it be kept as simple as circumstances will permit to intimidate threaten or coerce the view is often held that workers as individuals because of their economic vulnerability are rarely in position effectively to dissent from the clear wishes or preferences of their employers34 this disparity of power may be especially great for lowwage workers with family responsibilities during c onsideration of the various comp timeflexible workhours proposals of recent congresses concerns have been voiced that the legislation would provide flexibility for employers but could lead to various abuses of workers especia lly of those who are paid low wages in each bill there is provision that st ates that an employer who provides compensatory time off to an employee sh all not directly or indirectly intimidate threaten or coerce any employee for the purpose of participating in or nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31875crs18 35 hr 1119 does not define intimidate thre aten or coerce but s 317 does promising to confer or conferring any benefit such as appointment promoti on or compensation or effecting or threatening to effect any repr isal such as deprivation of appointment promotion or compensation 36 as in the case of state and local government one might expect to have rulemaking by dol followed by possible litigation involving th several parties at interest unlike the state and local governmental experience however the private sector is more diverse and less controlled potentially with more opportunities for dispute 37 when introducing hr 1119 rep bi ggert explained my b ill contains explicit penalties if an employer directly or indi rectly intimidates threatens or coerces an employee into taking comp time in lieu of overtime and the penalties are more severe than under current law employers who engage in such behavior will be liable for double damages plus attorneys fees and costs in addition the other remedies included under the flsa including civil and criminal penalties and injunction relief still will apply the employee may respond through private right of action or the labor department may sue on behalf of the employee see congressional record mar 7 2003 p e401participating in the comp time program or b requiring the employee to use such compensatory time each bill also has provision that the employee shall be permitted to use his accrued comp time within reasonable period after making the request if the use of the accrued compensatory time off does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer 35 bold italics added although the terms used here may em obvious and selfexplanatory some issues could arise could an employer establish threeday or sevenday waiting period for use of comp time period fficient perhaps to arrange for replacement worker and still be within reasonable period what constitutes an undue disruption given the diversity of the american wo rkplace could precise criteria be established it could mean one thing for construction contractor pouring wet concrete but so mething else entirely for universitys economics department at midsemester are the ope rations of the employer to be defined broadly or more narrowly if there is dispute about any of thes definitions to whom would an employee turn36 each bill provides remedies and sa nctions although some of these may be beyond the reach in practice of an aver age lowwage worker some may question whether denial of use of comp time r intimidati on coerci on etc would be of sufficient magnitude to cause an employee to seek legal redress or to cause him or her to complain to the department of labor other considerations aside the real or imagined employment cons equences of any vigorous challenge to an employers determination might reasona bly prevent employee action37 on the other hand would it be useful or feasible to attempt to define such concepts as reasonable peri od or unduly disrupt or operations of the employer in statute the number and variety of workplaces could present major challenges but absent close definition the protections implied through the intimidate threaten or coerce provision may be less than fully effective workhours flexibility could be left unilaterally to the employer which presumably would not be in keeping with the spirit of the proposed legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31875crs19 38 with the comp time option some argue th employer would have cost incentive to schedule overtime hours more often 39 in his mar 12 testimony dantico of shrm stated employees are limited to accrue more than 160 hours of compensatory time off during 12month period the proposed legislation imposes such restriction ra ther it seems clear that 160 hours is an account limit not an annual limit this raises the question of whether comp time can be carried from one year to the next if workers annual cashout date were feb 1 for example would all comp time accrued during december and january have to be used by feb 1one reason for instituting comp time thoug h longer central to the debate has been employer convenience during an especially busy period an employer garment manufacturer food processor logger or construction contractor may need to have his staff on duty throug h an extended period well beyond 40 hours per week in nonunion environment which is where the worker protection provisions of the proposed legislation woul d be most critical the employer could encourage his workers to accept comp time in place of overtime this could have several implications first many workers perhaps most might be reluctant to say to their employer if it were clear that the comp time option was the employers preference second while comp time could be used to smooth out the irregularities of seasonality it could also alleviate the necessity for the employment of additional workers one of the initial justifications for mandating overtime pay under the fair labor standards act38 finally would the definition of intimidat threaten or coerce cover denial of overtime work assignments to employees who prefer cash to comp time scheduling work is an employer preroga tive part of the employers right to manage so is the assignment of extra hours of work overtime but some have expressed concern that employees who decline comp time and demand cash payment for overtime hours worked where the preference of the employer is for comp time could be viewed as uncooperative and not be considered for any subsequent ove rtime assignment the economics of deferred income under each of the bills an employee woul d be allowed to accrue not more than 160 hours of compensatory time off at th end of each year which can be any time agreed upon by the parties any unused leave must be cashedout39 how many hours an employee might accrue or how quickly will vary but reasonably one could accrue the full 160 hours through the first three months of the year and thereafter retain continuing balance in eff ect this would be one months pay deferred until drawn down or cashedout at the federal minimum wage 515 per hour that would be the equivalent of 824 dollars in the account it could be more depending upon the workers rate of pay if paid as wages when earned the funds would rest with the workers to be used when and how they might choose in stead under hr 1119 and s 317 the money would be banked with the employer in an account providing interest to the worker

flexibility act modernizes an outdated 1938 law50 indeed the flsa is over 65 years old many argue on each side of the debate that the act needs to be updated though their prescription for modernization may take somewhat different approaches but the act has not been static some of its provisions date back to 1938 with roots fro m still earlier periods some are of more recent vintage since its enactment th flsa has undergone general amendment on eight separate occasions in 1949 1955 1961 1966 1974 1977 1989 and 1996 on other occasions there have been na rrowly focused changes in the act the hearings record over the 65year history of the statute is massive and in addition to continuing modernization of the act by congress it has been subject to ongoing updating by the department of labor through the rulemaking process further there has been substantial body of litigation wh ich has influenced the manner in which the statute has been applied including application of the section 207o comp time provisions of the act to state and local government employees51 concluding comment the issue of comp time has produced an interesting alignment of advocates and critics the case for flexibility usually argued in behalf of the worker especially in behalf of working women single mothers soccer moms is most frequently made by employers and management interests the case for the status quo flexibility under the flsa and cash payment for over time hours worked is most often made by organized labor and by workeroriente d womens groups in each case there have been exceptions with variet of individuals arguing pr and but at large the pattern has held through the past decade what would be changed by the proposed legislation on the one hand the 40hour work week overtime pay requi rement under hr 1119 and s 317 would have been set aside to allow the worker the option if the employer is willing to create revol ving reservoir of up to 160 hours ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31875crs23 52 when introducing hr 1119 rep biggert stated i also want to stress that this bill in way affects or changes the standard 40hour workweek and later again i want to reiterate that this legislation has effect on the traditional 40hour workweek or the way in which overtime is calculated see congressional record mar 7 2003 pp e401 and e402 53 for the employer there is potential advantag of preserving crew or body of workers intact rather than laying them off having them migrate to other employers or collect unemployment insurance and having to recruit new workforce during subsequent busy season the various employmentrelated costs could offset for the employer the costs of providing comp time even on timeandahalf basis for the workers the arrangement could result in more stable employment and balanced income which many may prefer to the irregularity of intermittent cash wages for overtime hours worked 54 where the workers were seasonally employed to the extent that seasonal workers would be eligible under the proposed legislation they could take prepaid leave before being laid off or having their employment terminated it is the permanent employee it appears at whom the proposed legislation is focused 55 if one assumes that the worker would be laidoff during subsequent period were there not prepaid comp time to hold him to his empl oyer then it could be argued that the worker would come out even in financial terms m inus any interest on the banked earnings arguably the worker would fare just as well financially and possibly better were overtime paid for in cash up front the worker would still have time off when it would not unduly disrupt the employers operations and woul d be free to accept alternative employmentcompensatory time already worked52 it is prepaid leave and it can be drawn upon within reasonable period when it will not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer the employer determines what is reasonable period and when workers absence would be unduly disrup tive even had the legislation been approved the employer would still be under obligation to adopt comp time plan with the 40hour work week limitation having been set aside unlimited overtime hours of work would be allowed til up to 160 hours of comp time had been accumulated until that 160hour accumu lation had been reached there would be limit and penalty upon the number of overtime hours that an employer might assign thus in theory the empl oyee could be assigned 60hour work weeks for two months 8 weeks or variation on that theme then as the worker drew down hisher comp time hours additional hour s of overtime work could be assigned flexibility for the employer would be significantly expanded since the overtime hours worked would be essen tially without immediate financ ial costs to the extent that there is seasonality in the production sales processes th comp time at time andahalf could likely bein g taken during slack season53 the concept of comp time would normally mean wage reduction for the workers involved since they would be trad ing cash wages otherwise earned through working assigned overtime hours fo r time off at some later date54 it would be tradeoff in practice the worker would be buying more time away from work in both cases under the proposed comp time option and under current law the opportunity of the worker to buy time off dir ectly as leave without pay or by drawing down prepaid comp time hours would be at the discretion of the employer55httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31875crs24 there would of course be overtime work at all unless the employer assigned it and without such extra hours of work opportunity under hr 1119 to accumulate comp time hours under each of the bills split system is permitted payment of cash to those who want cash payment for overtime hours worked or payment through comp time for those who pr efer that option the employer would have the option the flexibility to assign overtime work either for comp time where the workers were agreeable or for cash wages at premium pay were workers to become dissatisfied with the comp time arrangement they would be free to drop out of the system and to request payment for accrued hours in cash similarly the employer could terminate the program at will cashingout the hours of comp time accumulated by participating workers at least those in excess of 80 hours while there would seem to be some increased recordkeeping and reporting for employers and possibly some additional burdens for the compliance staff of the department of labor it has been argued that with computer accounting such burdens need not be great the comp time option likely would enc ourage employers to experiment with irregular hours of work and to assign more hours of overtime wor k it could facilitate new attitude on the part of employers ma king them more receptive to the general concept of workhours flexibility some wo rkers may find such irregular scheduling attractive especially if the result is real flexibility both for the employer and for the workforce others whose nonwork liv involve fixed schedules educational classes child or elder care might find comp time system to be disadvantageous it would appear to be an option appealing to those who are able to afford to trade cash income for time off and for thos whose personal lives can accommodate workhours flexibility central argument of proponents of co mp time and of simila r alternative work patterns is that the workplace and the workforce of the 21st century is dramatically different from that of earlier decades how different at root remains to be tested proponents and cr itics of the comp time
