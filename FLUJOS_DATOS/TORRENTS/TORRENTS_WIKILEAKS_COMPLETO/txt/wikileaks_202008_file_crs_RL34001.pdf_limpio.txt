and office furn iture and fittings another 26 billion however the furniture industry is hi ghly segmented and patterns of growth have not been experienced equally by all sectors of the industry since 2000 also in most product classes manuf acturing employment has fa llen and has not recovered to the peak years around 2000 domestic manufacturing employment has been most severely affected in the wood household fu rniture product class case goods where total manufacturing employment has fa llen by almost half from 130000 to 70000 since 2000 large consolidators acquired many traditional manufacturers closed and rationalized domestic plants and shifted the focus to distribution and retail activities this product class has been severely ffected by imports which now account for more than 50 of us consumption by contrast employment in upholstered furniture has not declined nearly as mu ch about 20 or 20000 jobs in part because imported products have been much less of factor in the third major product category under household furnishings wood kitchen cabinets and countertops there has been boom in both output and employment hardest hit by job losses in residential furniture manufacturing has been the largest producing state north carolina which lost about 19000 jobs between 2000 and 2005 about 28 of total em ployment in the industry other states especially california the number two producer have so suffered high job losses on the other hand mississippi major center of upholstered furniture production and the thirdbiggest producing state s seen more modest job losses china has become the major import supplie r of furniture products during the last decade and more than third of total imports from this source are wood household furniture products an antidumping order was imposed on wooden bedroom furniture from china and many us manufacturers are receiving disbursements of the collected duties under the terms of th byrd amendment continued dumping and subsidy offset act 19usc 1675c af ter being found to c ontravene the rules of the world trade organization the law was repealed by congress effective october 1 2007 future trade remedy cas may be less likely as many wood furniture manufacturers are also heavily involved in importing us office furniture manufacturing has been less affected by import competition but was seriously affected by the dotcom bust in the recession of 2001 job losses were particular ly severe in michigan the center of the industry and in california the number two state over all the prospects of the office furniture

shipments of 485 billion in 2005 according to the latest av ailable data in the census bureaus annual survey of manufactures california ranked sec ond in shipments at 48 billion while mississippi was third at 37 billion but whereas north carolina predominantly supplies wooden case goods such as dining room suites and bedroom furniture mississippi specializes mo re in upholstered furniture as will be shown below north carolina has been far more heavily affected by job losses and plant closings than mississippi in recent years the predominant state in manufacturin g office furniture the second major product group is michigan it shipped 63 billion out of us total of 263 billion in 2005 here also the number two stat is california at 23 billion other state shipped significantly more than 1

sustained major job losses in residential furniture manufacturing unlike the residential furniture market the office furniture market was much slower to recover from the recession of 2001 in which the dotcom bust had major impact on office furniture sales in terms of output and sales us fu rniture manufacturing as whole has been large and growing industry since 19901 after the recession of 1991 the gross output of furniture and re lated products grew steadily from about 40 billion to 74 billion over the next ten years output fell with the recession in 2001 but buoyed by the boom in residential

areas includi ng wooden household furniture which has been heavily impacted by imports and ffice furniture where imports are not such major factor the only product segment within naics 337 to exhibit employment growth since 2000 has been wood k itchen cabinets and countertops with respect to competition from abroad the key development over the past decade has been the emergence of china as the dominant supplier by 1997 china was already number two to canada as the l eading exporter of furniture of all types to the us market by 2006 chinese exports of 144 billion to the united states were more than three times the value of imports of 4 billion from canada now in second place mexico at 15 billion was the only other import source greater than 1 billion italy the traditional european leader in furniture exporting ranked next at 892 m illion china is the leading import s upplier in most major product categories but its role in wooden residential furniture is particularly notable more than third of the imports from china 51 billion in 2006 apparently were in this category the only residential product in which china was not the leading import source was wooden kitchen cabinets and countertops relatively minor trade category in which china ranked distant second to canada the growth of china as the dominant source of us furniture imports is shown in figure 3 source us

both us furniture manufacturing output and consumption in 2005 the latest data year in the annual survey of manufactures household furnishings including institutional products accounted for 485 billion of the 843 billion in shipments reported for naics 337 575 within household furnishings naics 3371 three product classes have accounted for the bulk of product output and shipments they are wood kitchen cabinets and countertops naics 337110 upholstered household furniture naics 337121 and nonupholstered wood household furniture naics 337122 sometimes also referred to as case goods the last category would include for example dining room chair sets even though the backs and seats may contain some upholstering while these are the three largest cla sses of products within the category of household furnishings their r ecent histories with respect to us production and manufacturing employment have been radically different as illustrated in figures 4 and 5 the domestic manufacture of wood kitchen cabinets and countertops has benefitted from the recent boom in residential construction and remodeling along with that custom kitchens are frequently made to measure discouraging production shipping and delivery from overseas sources so most of the market has been captured by domestic producers also this product class wa s relatively li ttle affected by the recession of 2001 product shipments increased from 85 billion in 1997 to more than 11 billion in both 2000 and 2001 and to 183 billion by 2005 employment was 124000 in 1997 it stalled around 149000 in the first three years of the new century but then grew again to 177000 by 2005 domestic shipments of nonupholstered wood household furniture were more than 10 billion in 1997 almost 2 billion higher than cabinets and countertops in that year but they fell more than 1 billion in 2001 and have not substan tially recovered since in 2005 shipments of these products 92 billi on were barely half the level of cabinets and countertops em ployment has fallen from peak level of abou t 130000 in 2000 to 70000 in 2006 loss of nearly half of all jobs the key developmen t in this part of the industry as will be discussed more below has been the closing of many production facilities nd transition to more of retail and distribution mode based on hi gh rate of im ported products manufacturers of upholstered furniture which includes sofas and living room suites have not enjoyed the extended boom of the cabinet industry but have seen shipments stabilize around 10 billion per year after moderate growth in 19982002

manufacturing about 20000 jobs have been lost since 2000 decline of about 20 as one s ource explains it bulky upholstered furniture costs more to ship long distances than wood furniture this may absorb most of the labor cost differential with china for readymade lowercost products for higher end products customers appear to prefer to c hoose and customize covering fabrics which places premium

companies from the peoples republic of chin not investigated by commerce was nearly 200 based on surrogate thirdcountry costs of production since china was defined as nonmarket economycompetition from imports the worst loss of employment in us household furniture manufacturing has been in wood furnitu re and case goods and it is this product class that has been especially affected by imports such produc ts can be shipped pa rtially assembled and stacked flat in containers according to one estimate by 2004 at least 54 of the wood household furniture consumed in the united states was imported3 in the last decade the predominant business model in the industry has been characterized by industry cons olidators who have bought up domestic brands rationalized us production facilities nd focused instead on the retail and distribution end of the business they have used tr aditional brand names to target particular price levels and market segments in large singlebrand stores the largest of these consolidators has been furniture brands international which has acquired such oldline furniture manufacturing brands as lane broyhill thomasville henredon drexelheritage and others4 as result of such changes for example the american furniture manufacturers association changed its name to the american home furnishings alliance thus reflecting the shift in focus of many members from the manufacturing to the distribution end of the business5 china has been the principal source of im ports in this product class as has been noted earlier one independent industry analyst using data from the commerce department reported imports of wood hous ehold furniture from china at 52 billion for 2006 that was 35 of total imports of 144 billion from china in naics category 337 reported by the us intern ational trade commi ssion trade dataweb by comparison the i ndustry analyst re ports imports of upholstered furniture from china at 16 billion for the same year6 one antidumping case has been broug ht against wooden bedroom furniture imported from china on january 4 2005 the commerce department announced final determination in the case of dumpi ng margins of 665 against most chinese producers for the us market that it investigated for two other companies the rate was somewhat higher7 the levels of antidumping margins is under review in 2007 with the new industry business model

china s furniture and wood products trade is the source of wood for chinese products according to an expose in the washington post official chinese concerns about the imp act of deforestation led to much tighter restrictions on timber cutting and majo r replanting effort in 20002005 as consequence imports of logs to support chinese wood products i ndustries have risen to more than 5 billion annually the post reports that much of this wood comes from burma and russia where in both cases it may be harvested illegally the private sector forest stew ardship council operates pr ogram to

in any case the amount of wood certified by the program appears to be only fraction of that used by major re tailers 4 in the case of ikea and other companies do not participate in the program at all9 employment impact by state the impact of these trends in the household furniture industry have been particularly significant for north carolin and to lesser degree the neighboring states of virginia and tennessee according to an analysis of furniture industry plant closings published by two academic authors in the forest products journal north carolina had by far the most plant closin gs in the furniture industry between 2000 and 2003 according to data derived from nonoffi cial sources that state saw total of 73 plant closings during the period vi rginia was second with 15 closings and tennessee reported 10 califor nia which was noted abov as the secondleading state in household furniture produc tion had nine plant closings10 these plant closings include all type s of furniture production but it should be noted that the three leading companies in terms of plant closures were also reported in furnishings digest as among the leading residential furniture industry consolidators

journal article state companies such as fbi and lazboy had reported in their annual stockholder reports that closing of plants resulting from consolidating or reorganizing and offshore outsourcing were sometimes their only viable options to remain competitive much of the production of companies such as fbi has shifted to offshore locations due to the leverage of manufacturing costs and the search for competitive advantage such as outsourcing12 the following table summarizes the changes in level of employment and production in household furniture manufacturin g in the leading producer

thirdranking producer of residential furniture in the nation did report loss of 2200 jobs 8 that was much lower than the other leading states as was mentioned earlier this may be due to mississippis

although california and north carolina are two major outliers the recovery of output in the sector overall from the recession of 2001 has not yet seen signifi cant increase in employment although the two key product classes w ood and nonwood office furniture have at least showed an end to declines in employment prospects and outlook as stated in the introduction the us furniture industry is highly segmented not only between office and residential produc ts but also among different classes of products within each of these sectors in general industry analysts appear to be somewhat pessimistic with respect to the prospects of residential furniture manufacturing in the united states but more positive with respect to office furniture manufacturing wood household furniture manufacturing is not only under serious pressure from import competition especially from china but also is in transition as the owners of major domestic bra nds have transformed their business models in response to perceived globalization of the industr in the early 2000s some industry observers suggested that these challenges could be met by strategy of mass customization wherein domestic manufact urers could take advantage of closer location to the customer to bundle orders in specialized products that still catered to individual tastes and measurements somewhat similar to the strategy that has worked well with respect to kitchen cabinets and c ountertops such strategy might have offset us competitive disadvantages such as higher labor costs and more restrictive therefore higher cost forest management practices21 whatever the merits of such alternative strategies in terms of revealed competitiveness they do not appear to have reduced the effective threat of foreign competition or saved domestic jobs more pessimistic assessment of the current situation views that the worst in terms of plant closures and job sses may be yet to come number of manufacturing plants may currently be tinuing to operate with skeleton crews only so that the owners who may include the large consolidators discussed above can continue to collect customs disbur sements under the byrd amendment once the benefits of that program are terminated plant operators may move to completehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34001crs15 22 crs interviews with wallace w epperson april 16 and may 2 2007 23 gazo and quesada

chinese competitors in upholstered furniture as they develop stra tegies to gain larger shares of the us market in that product class as well22 gazo and quesada in their article reviewing manufacturers strategies conclude that it appears that companies in the kitchen cabinet and office furniture sectors are far less prone to be outperformed by as ian manufacturers the possible critical success factors for these sectors is service23 but even cabinet manufacturers insulated from foreign competition because cabinet products come with design service to integrate the cabinets in the total kitchen design24 may see fall in growth prospects owing to recent declines in home sales and the general cooling off of the residential real estate market gazo and quesada contrast the experience of the office and residential furniture industries the office furniture industry often prov ides wholeoffice organization systems increasingly office furniture customers re quire solutions that are ready to use including design planning production delivery and installation on the other hand the household furniture industry tends to focus on the product itself25 evidence for this assertion can be found on the bifma website where statistical table lists office furniture production by product categories seating desks storage files tables systems and small residual other category the share of annual production for each category has been relatively stable for the entire period 1990200526 while office furniture manufacturing also saw an employment decline following the recession of 2001 there is evidence that industry employment has stabilized this prospect may be enhanced by the continuing strong growth in non residential construction the re latively low share of imports in the product sector and the industrys own forecast of solid consumption growth in 200708
