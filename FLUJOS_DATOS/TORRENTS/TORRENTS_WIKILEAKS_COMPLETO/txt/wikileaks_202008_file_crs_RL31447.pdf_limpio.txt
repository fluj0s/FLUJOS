this act created the national wilderness preservation system reserved to congress the authority to designate wilderness areas and directed the secretaries of agriculture and of the interior to review certain lands for their wilderness potential the act also designated 54 wilderness areas with 9 million acres of federal land congress began expanding the wilderness system in 1968 and today there are 709 wilderness areas totaling more than 107 million acres in 44 states numerous bills to designate additional areas and to expand existing ones are introduced and considered in every congress the wilderness act defined wilderness as an area of generally undisturbed federal land but did not establish criteria or standards to determine whether an area should be designated because of differing perceptions of wilderness and because of the varying purposes of wilderness in general wilderness areas are undeveloped and commercial activities motorized access and roads structures and facilities are generally prohibited in wilderness areas however in response to conflicting demands congress has granted both general exemptions and specific exceptions to the general standards and prohibitions the federal government owns about 29 of the land in the united states although the proportion in each state varies widely four federal agen ciesthe bureau of land management national park service and fish and wildlife service in the department of the interior and the forest service in the department of agriculturemanage most of the federal lands these agencies manage the 107 million acres of designated wilderness as well as many other lands they are also protecting lands as possible additions to the wilderness system and are reviewing the wilderness potential of additional lands in total more than 17 of all federal land and nearly 5 of all land in the united states has been designated as wilderness alaska because of its size and relatively pristine condition dominates wilderness statisticsmore than 53 of designated wilderness is in alaska in total nearly 16 of all land federal state private and other in alaska has been designated as wilderness in contrast 3 of all land in the

initial federal policy was generally to transfer ownership to states and private ownership but congress has also provided for reserving certain lands for federal purposes and over time has reserved or withdrawn increasing acreage for national parks national forests wildlife refuges etc 1 the general policy of federal lands disposal was changed to general policy of retaining the remaining lands in the federal land policy and management act of 19762 beginning in 1897 management of the national forests emphasized conservationprotecting and developing the lands it did not take long for some fs leaders to recognize the need to preserve some areas in natural state acting at its own discretion and at the behest of an employee named aldo leopold the fs created the first wilderness area in the gila national forest nm in 1924 in the succeeding decades the agencys system of wilderness wild and primitive areas grew to 146 million acres however in the 1950s increasing timber harvests and recreation use of the national forests led to public concerns about the permanence of this purely administrative system the fs had relied on its administrative authority in making these designations there was law guaranteeing the future of wilderness in response to these concerns congress enacted the wilderness act 3 in 1964 the act defines wilderness and prohibits or restricts certain activities in wilderness areas while permitting other activities to occur the act also reserves to congress the authority to designate areas as part of the national wilderness preservation system the wilderness system was initially endowed with the 91 million acres of national forest lands that had been identified administratively as wilderness areas or wild areas the wilderness act also directed the agriculture secretary to review the agencys 55 million acres of primitive areas and the secretary of the interior to evaluate the wilderness potential of national park system and national wildlife refuge system lands the secretaries were to report their recommendations to the president and to congress within 10 years ie by 1974 separate recommendations were 1 see crs report rl34267 federal land

by 1991 the blm submitted its recommendations to the president and presidential recommendations have been submitted to congress the 90th congress began expanding the wilderness system in 1968 as shown in table 1 five laws were enacted creating five new wilderness areas with 792750 acres in four states wilderness designations generally increased in each succeeding congress rising to peak of 608

recommendations for 44 areas allocated to nonwilderness uses with the court decision substantially upheld on appeal in 19827 the reagan administration responded in 1983 by directing reevaluation of all rare ii recommendations except in states with wilderness laws containing certain provisions known as release language 8 tensions between the administration and congress and among interest groups led to particularly intense debate during the 98th congress 19831984 compromise version of release language achieved in may 1984 led the 98th congress to enact 21 wilderness laws designating 85 million acres of wilderness in 21 statesmore laws and more acres outside of alaska than any congress since the wilderness system was created since the wilderness act created the national wilderness preservation system in 1964 congress has enacted 115 additional laws designating new wilderness areas or adding to existing ones as shown in table 1 the wilderness system now contains 709 wilderness areas with more than 107 million acres in 44 states managed by the four federal land management agencies as shown in table 3 the agencies have recommended additional lands be added to the wilderness system these lands are generally managed to protect their wilderness character while congress considers adding them to the wilderness system additional lands are being studied by the agencies to

management of areas that some believe should be designated as wilderness and others believe should be available for development the clinton administration moved to protect many of the remaining national forest areas that could be designated as wilderness initially in january 1998 with temporary moratorium on road construction in roadless areas and finally with rule that prohibited most road construction and many other activities in inventoried roadless areas ie the remaining undesignated rare ii areas the clinton rule was enjoined twice and the bush administration promulgated new rule that has also been enjoined the status of roadless area protection rules continues to be disputed9 questions also persist over blm wilderness study areas wsas these wsas are the areas the blm studied as potential wilderness under 603 of flpma under 603b the blm is required to protect the wilderness characteristics of all wsas including areas not recommended for wilderness until congress determines otherwise congress has designated some blm wsas as wilderness included in table 3 and generally in the same statutes congress has released the blm from the requirement to protect the wilderness characteristics of certain other areas however release language in blm wilderness statutes has generally been more controversial than for national forest areas 10

in contrast with those areas where man and his works dominate the landscape is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man where man himself is visitor who does not remain an area of wilderness is further defined to mean an area of undeveloped federa l land retaining its primeval character and influence without permanent improvements or human habitation which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural conditions and which 1 generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature with the imprint of mans work substantially unnoticeable 2 has outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive and unconfined type of recreation 3 has at least five thousand acres of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition and 4 may also contain ecological geologi cal or other features of scientific educational scenic or historical value this definition provides some general guidelines for determining which areas should or should not be designated wilderness but there are specific criteria in the law the phrases untrammeled by man retaining its primeval character and mans work substantially unnoticeable are far from precise even the numerical standard5000 acresis not absolute smaller areas can be designated if they can be protected and the smallest wilderness area wisconsin islands wilderness in the green bay national wildlife refugeis only 2 acres 9 for more background information on and the current status of these rules see crs report

perceptions of what constitutes wilderness to some wilderness is an area where there is absolutely sign of human presence traffic can be heard including aircraft roads structures or litter can be seen to others sleeping in van or camper in 400s ite campground in yellowstone national park is wilderness experience complicating these differing perceptions is the wideranging ability to get away from it all in various areas in densely wooded area getting away might be measured in yards while in mountainous or desert terrain human developments can sometimes be seen for miles in an attempt to accommodate these contrasting views of wilderness the wilderness act provided certain exemptions and delayed implementation of restrictions for wilderness areas as will be discussed below at times congress has also responded to the conflicting demands of various interest groups by allowing additional exemptions for certain uses especially for existing activities in particular wilderness designations ultimately wilderness areas are whatever congress designates as wilderness regardless of developments or activities which some might argue conflict with the definition of wilderness

and roads structures and facilities in wilderness areas specifically 4c states except as specifically provided for in this act and subject to existing private rights there shall be commercial enterprise and permanent road within any wilderness area designated by this act and except as necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area for the purpose of this act including measures required in emergencies involving the health and safety of persons within the area there shall be temporary road use of motor vehicles motorized equipment or motorboats landing of aircraft other form of mechanical transport and structure or installation within any such area this section prohibits most commercial resource exploitation such as timber harvesting and motorized entry via cars trucks offroad vehicles aircraft or motorboats except in emergencies however 4d provides numerous exceptions including possible continued use of motorboats and aircraft b fire insect and disease control measures c mineral prospecting conducted in manner compatible with the preservation of the wilderness environment d water projects continued livestock grazing and f commercial recreation activities in addition to these exemptions the wilderness act extended the mining and mineral leasing laws for wilderness areas in national forests for 20 years through 1983 new mining claims and mineral leases were permitted for many wilderness areas and exploration and development were authorized subject however to such reasonable regulations governing ingress and egress as may be prescribed by the secretary of agriculture11 despite this authority permits for onsite 11 most lands in the national park system and the national wildlife refuge system have been withdrawn from access under the mining and mineral leasing laws while extensive blm wilderness designations were apparently not contemplated until flpma was enacted in 1976 thus the wilderness act addressed mining and mineral leasing only in the national forests

the interior in 198112 litigation halted drilling application in montana that year and congress enacted moratorium on wilderness area leasing and exploration in the department of the interior appropriations laws for fy1983 and fy1984 pl 97394 and pl 98146 respectively however mineral rights existing on or before december 31 1983 or before the area was designated remain valid and can be developed if the rightholder chooses under reasonable regulations determined by the secretary of agriculture and some mineral expl oration has occurred in designated wilderness areas under such regulations 13 the wilderness act also directs that the act not alter existing federalstate relationships with respect to state water laws or state fish and wildlife responsibilities specifically 4d as codified at 16 usc 1133 states 7 nothing in this act shall constitute an express or implied claim or denial on the part of the federal government as to exemption from state water laws 8 nothing in this act shall be construed as affecting the jurisdiction or responsibilities of the several states with respect to wildlife and fish in the national forests however the extent and nature of federal water rights that might arise from wilderness designations continue to be an important issue for congress14 finally as noted above congress has also enacted numerous exemptions to the wilderness acts

shows the area managed by the four major federal land management agencies16 the data are not directly comparable across agencies however because of differences in accounting practices the agency data also differ from the data maintained by the us general services administration gsa17 differences occur in part because official ownership status often differs from managerial responsibility for example th fs administers 462678 acres in oregon that are officially blm lands another complication is partial ownership such as split estates with the federal government owning only the surface r the subsurface and another owner for the subsurface or surface rights similarly some lands are managed by the federal government under easements and longterm leases without federal ownership thus the agency acreage statistics in table 2 may overstate actual federal land ownership the data in table 2 are from agency sources agency data rather than gsa data were used because they most closely match the agency wilderness data the acreage shown in table 2 is generally limited to the lands owned by the federal government ie excluding easements and longterm leases and administered by the agency or
