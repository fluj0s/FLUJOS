assessing 3d lecture given on 13 december 1961 all right this is 13 dec ad 11 right oh dear how sad some of these people are and how bright some others look well they go up and they go down and some go up and some go down and it hadnt anything to do with the auditing well anyhow i want to give you little more data here about putting 3d package together now at the time im speaking to you there is cinch nothing on this criteria should be taken as leadpipe cinch in this stuff im about to give you these are indicators and as soon as weve got leadpipe cinch figured out why ill give you the leadpipe cinch but until that time let give you what thinking there is on it 3d package is as good as it is assessed and thats all it is its as good as it is assessed you get an assessment on pc which is well done youyou get your list you bleed down for any other items on the meter you make sure there are further items on the meter and you make sure that the reaction on your question are there any more items is not an arc break you know more people have gotten hooked with that you know they can stack up to thousand terminals with the greatest of ease by simply saying each time are there any more terminals and the pc is arc broke gets an arc break reaction on the needle and then flounders around and digs up some terminals and the auditor never says is this question an arc break at which time he would find out yes by god it sure is and then you get your list null that is that the meter then is bled down the only thing that gets in the road of that however is that arc break reaction therefore you get complete listbe sure when youve bled down the meter that your list is complete and that is your complete list now your pc from time to time will want to add another item or two this is fine and if he wants to add them you put them down now as you assess this it assesses quite mechanically if your rudiments are in you will get reaction and if the rudiments are in you will get the item and it doesnt take any long egyptian dream of eternity to assess the thing out it just brrrrrrpang and youre taking muchyou must adjust your viewpoint of how long it takes to get 3d item the longest one is the goal why because you have nothing in view nothing it is just wide desert and you are staring across this uneven monotonous plain this is life and theres nothing showing and until you get goal you havent got handle onto the goals problem mass but as soon as youve got goalnow it may turn out to be the oppgoal but youve got goal youve got something that reacts you got something that stays in now get that make sure its the only one make sure its right and take off from there get your next item if this item does not pan out rapidly and there seems to be lot of trouble concerning this particular item and it seems to be all tangled up try for another item just dont keep beating the pc to pieces well look youve got ayouve got goalwe dont care what goal it islets get goal in opposition to it terminal unknown if we cant get the oppterminal lets try to get the oppgoal all right and maybe we couldnt get the oppgoal at lick and promise and quickly you see we cant get that oppgoal either itapparently every time we speak of opposition to this pc the pc goes zzzz see well lets get something on the pcs side then weve got goal were fairly sure its the pcs goal at least at this stage of the game we can assume that its the pcs goal so lets get his modifier and finding his modifier is very simple proposition if the pc is bogged down on finding his oppgoal or oppterminal he will pep up on finding his modifier and if he doesnt pep up on finding his modifier youve already got the opposition goal thats why you couldnt find it hehheh simple so anyway if weve got his goal and modifier and we havent got an oppterm and an oppgoal yet do you know we can find his terminal and then find the opposition terminal to that terminal see how many ways we can weave this thing we dont care how many ways were going to weave it dont get the idea that you can spend session after session after session after session looking for 3d item this is balderdash this is complete nonsense it does not take very long to find 3d item it takes about one hour once the goal is found so you just might as well settle your sights on that particular target and realize that if you cant get full 3d package on somebody after youve got the goal if you cant wrap this up in about ten hours that you certainly are bucking the tiger in some way or another and the usual way it is is because you have been too optimistic and you have taken the pc before the pc was prepared for an assessment that is the first biggest fault your next fault on the thing is that you are looking for items youve got now thats the next biggest error that auditors are making theyre looking for items they already have now how is that they have found goal only it turns out to be the opposition goal so when they try to find the opposition goal theyve got it so of course they cant find it see theyve got terminal but they keep looking for the opposition terminal to the goal or something of the sort only theyre looking for it on bias you see theyve got the oppterm they havent got the terminal so you look and look and look and look and look and look for an item if you already have it and you wont find it its there youve already got it itsthere it is you see what im talking about now all right now you play this thing crisscrossed in other words and if something starts giving you trouble you find something else and itll start clarifying but remember youre taking apart piece of black porridge thats full of string that has been made with the best quality glue and its horrible mess and it is just lucky as the devil that the goal sticks out that is just lucky because thats the only handle youve got thats why you must try to get the original goals list of pc the first one he ever wrote thats why you must take any terminal that ran well earlier on the casethe first terminal that ran well on the case and assess from there thats in patching up cases and getting cases that have already been run on routine 3 and so forth you must use these items because you arent going to find another one youre going to find another subordinate package that will never collide with goals problem mass and you can run the pc practically forever if youre not using the original items thats something to know so when patching them up you say well what was the goal found on you to shoot cats all right thats fine now what was the terminal that was run cat shooter all right that so far as youre concerned is the entrance to the 3d package that was the first goal and the first terminal that was the entrance to the 3d package this has been run on somebody dont you see this persons already come up to free needle with goals problem mass still floating around in their vicinity ready to key in someplace up the track see so those are the things you use and you try to put 3d together now you will find that most of your routine 3 cases which failed and which did not go clear were being run on their opposition terminal possibly with the opposition goal and this must be great number of them must be lot of them were found wrong way to all right therefore although youve taken the persons goalthis person has been audited to clear lets go that extreme or not audited to clear we dont care but hes been previously assessed and audited lets take those items which have already been done on the case of course if hes gone clear its prima facie evidence the fact that you had the right goal and the right terminal now youve got goal and audit it so as to find goals problem mass so youve got to have the oppterm and the oppgoal and the modifier and the rest of this package and youre liable to wind up here with somebody who has had beautiful floating free needle and just about the time you looked for the modifier it all went clank again in other words you keyed it in you didnt stand around waiting for life to key it in so it goes clank so now youre going to find the goals problem mass and youre going to shoot it full of holes and this person then will come out at the other end if you do any kind of good job at all and the needle will go free again and this clear will stay stable and he wont be clear on just one dynamic you see all right now the person who has been audited endlessly on routine 3 but has never gone clearah this is another proposition by the rules of the game just fluke you might have his right goal and his right terminal but somehow or another it hasnt stacked up right or something or other or something or other but the high probabilities are that you were auditingthey were auditing the wrong side but you still take it because its probably part of the 3d package now you dont take it as complete evidence that it is the 3d package see you dontyou dont take that as complete evidence but you know the person was audited on it and maybe it was bad job of assessment and maybe its lot of things and maybe the reads arent very big on it and maybe theres going to be lot of trouble about it well thatsyoure an auditor thats what you inherittrouble all right so this situation then integrates on the basis that you take this unsuccessfully run 3 case routine 3 case and those are simply conditional those are nothing but conditionals it was the probable goal it was the probable terminal thats all and then try to check out 3d from there well now you could crisscross 3d from there you can probably arrive at the goals problem mass and you will eventually perhaps even lose the original terminal they were run on how do you do that you find the opposition terminal the opposition goal and then you find modifier and then you go back and you findyou take their terminal and now you try to find an opposition terminal to it and if its not the one you found for 3d package it wasnt right see so you could check this thing out now you can do other things you can take the terminal find the opposition terminal to it and then find goal for the oppositionopposition goal for the opposition terminal or goal for it check back find out if this matches against the goal and then find modifier and then find new terminal the old terminal disappears it was simply used as leader do you see how you could do that but when you finally get through you should have all five items of the 3d package checking out uniformly they all ought to tick the same way click click click click click and incidentally for your amusement your first prehav level ticks exactly the same as the rest of the package and if you havent got package on 3d that goes click click click click click five times there is something wrong with it so what do you do you get the rudiments in you straighten it all out and you check it across it isnt that the whole package is wrong some of that package is probably right but some of the package will null and some of the package will stay with you so you take the package that stayed with you and you get crisscrosses you get what would oppose cat shooter you see and then you put in new terminal you do new assessment there and get new somethingorother in there and you keep working it on crossplay dont you see until youve finally got five items that will stand up and stay in and then youve got 3d package but even then youre not sure the package is in proper ordered now having 3d package and having one all arranged for the pc are two different things you can have five items and they all stacked up beautifully youve got them all assessed all the items nulled they all read the same but you havent found yet who is the pc now when i first entered into this it seemed to to be very easy thing because i simply asked the pc and there was one doubt in the pcs mind as to which one the pc was but since running it and since its been in your hands theres apparently considerable doubt and argument as to which one the pc is so piece has gone astray here so we need regulator for this thing now once youve got the package that simply means that all the parts of the package check out and there isnt one part of it going null and coming back and going null and coming back now mind you you can get bouncer modifier the only thing that is wrong with all of this is you can get bouncer modifier thatll make the whole package flicker if you had modifier but always be late youre liable to get the whole package on quarterofasecond latent read did you know that thats quite amusing i mean the package is obeying the modifier so there isnt any great certainty there but look the chances of your getting five items that all read quarterofasecond late are so remote it is the package see the modifier has lot to do with the behavior of it now if you want to get rid of modifier all youd have to do is deintensify it just chant the bouncers and denyers and so forth to the pc very crude operation but it can be done that crudely leave leave leave leave leave leave leave leave leave leave leave leave leave leave everything leave everything leave everything leave everything leave everything leave everything and all of sudden the thing will read of course it wont read very long because you havent pulled the bottom off of it yet and itll charge up again but you can at least get it discharged to point where you can make it read and if you can make modifier read that way you can make whole package read for short time interesting isnt it it wont be until you run it that you actually get charge off of it now those are criteria of selecting package it does require bit of auditor skill but less skill ordinarily than you would imagine its basicallyselecting each one of the items is simple mechanical job of getting the list complete and then getting it all null with the rudiments in now ill give you check to find out whether or not the rudiments are in at any given time if you have proven part of 3d package you can say that to the pc if you get reaction the rudiments are in if you dont get reaction the rudiments are out period very quick way to find out if your rudiments are straight very very quick all right therefore if youve got part of the 3d package that has been proved out why you can always find out if the rudiments are in or out and you can always find out what the rest of the package ought to look like well now will you please get clever and when youre nulling list down look for the reaction of the provedout part of the package where is that reaction on the list dont be knucklehead see the thing has tiny rock slam and when youre busy nulling list you notice theres tiny rock slam on this and you notice theres tiny rock slam on that and tiny rock slam on thatyou bleed down the list very carefully are there any more items there are more items so therefore youve got it its in one of those rock slams go ahead and null out the list but you know what its going to be before the pc finds out then youre proving by nulling youre not finding with nulling you give the original list of couple of 3d items i can run down them with an emeter withif ive got one proven item and i can tell you what it will be itll be that one or itll be that one and thats it wont be any of the others one of these two is locked on the other one sometimes youre unfortunate enough to have pc whos so jammed and hes got five eight ten items locked on one of course theyre all locked onto the goals problem mass but you have to be awfully close to the middle of it to get an actual exact reaction to the goal you got the goal the goal is small theta bop lets saythey seldom are but well say its theta bopand youre going down this list and you see thea rat that goes and cage goes well use your head rats have cages cages will blow off leaving rat you usually know the 3d item before youve assessed it you go down that list oncepangif you know what your goal reaction was now you dont force this on the pc this is just to make you sure you dont force it on the pc you dont bother to tell the pc anything about it at all its none of his business after all its just his bank all right but theres ways that you can spot this thing and if you cant wind up with five items all of which have an identical reaction on your needle you havent got 3d package and thats all there is to it but let us say weve gotten to that stage by the standard assessments which you are doing and we now find ourselves in this interesting position who is what which is what now in some large percentagemuch much better than threequarters of the cases you audityou will have difficulty with this whatsoever but the remainder have the opposition terminal is so close to the terminal and the opposition goal is so close to the pcs goal that these things flip around like merrygoround theres always something happens to destroy the serenity of our ways and that is what is happening at this particular moment therefore as i mentioned to you in the last lecture i have been on the track of this and ive gone little bit further onto the track of this and what imwhat is not absolute about this lecture is about what im about to give you right this minute apparently this is the way it fits here is test you can make you can take the probable terminal of the pc and the opposition terminal the probable opposition terminal and you put them down on sheet of paper and you write down you term oppterm you see whatever they are see you waterbuck tiger all right now all you have to do is say to the pc how would youor what would you do to solve problems or what would you use to solve problems and i suppose what would you use to solve problems or how would you go about solving problems or what would you do to solve the problem and you write this down under you see and you write downhell give you four five six seven eight ten of them we dont care how many all right and then we take the terminal and then we say what would waterbuck do to solve problem or how would waterbuck solve problem whatever registers so that you can get prehav leveltype words out of the pc and we make long list eight ten ways the waterbuck would be solving problems and then we take tiger now how would tiger solve problems and we make long list here of how tiger solves problems now weve got three lists we ignore you that simply made it interesting we put it in there so the pc will start differentiating amongst these things dont you see this isits very good auditing action its one of these little oneshot things the pc says hey what do you know you know thats the end of it i mean it doesnt go any further than that you dont use these things for anything youre not making up your prehav scale dont do that because he would never think of the proper words to solve problems if you ask pc at any given moment if you made him memorize the prehav scale and then rattle it off to you he would leave out all of those levels on which he should be run see weve tested that it was very interesting peter and mary suefirst time i came down with the prehav scale for thefor the course down in joburgi handed it over to them and theyd remembered it you see from something id given them the night before and they told the students all about it and they both left out protect isnt that interesting both had left protect out of the thing and protect was hot on both of their cases so this is action then by which you get prehav scale you could probably blow it up to that point with meter bleed and you could be very very upset and i imagine some place if you found yourself in arcturus and you didnt have prehav scale and textbooks and that sort of thingyou did this to several people and bled thema meter down each time or strained at it terribly you would finally wind up with something like prehav scalean auxiliary prehav scale that would be one way to get one but lets look this over now and lets find out that the pcs terminal is the lowest on the tone scale not the highest but the lowest now the earliest work i did in routine 3 is quite interesting in the way the assessment is done and you still have relic of this in some of the early descriptions of assessing and it says you go up the scale until you start to get rising needle remember this one audience mmhm yes you go up the scale until you start to get rising needle and you come back down again because theres sense going any higher now that one is quite interesting because the oppterm is always highertoned the tiger to your state of mind is ravening treacherous lousy verminous tramp see but to the pc the tiger is knightly charming beautiful sleek lovely what would tiger use to solve problems diplomacy and it frankly will be at such variance with anything you might have proper picture of the beast and you also might have properimproper picture of the beast who cares but its just very hightoned now i found this out empirically ive looked around and iveive gotten some of the reactions on it and theyre always very hightoned the oppterm is hightoned thats very interesting isnt it ill tell you the why of this in just moment but its really crazy you have theit doesnt mean that its highertoned terminal that is to say the oppterm might well be drunken bum on skid row see that doesnt prove anything by the name of the terminal but drunken bum on skid rowhow would he solve problems by being sweet to everyone by being friendly by being interested in other peoples problems and itll be wild show let tell you man its going to be hightoned this is an empirical guesstimate right at this time about how this thing goes all right and the pcs terminal waterbucka waterbuck uses treachery meanness sets traps is socially unacceptable in general how does he solve problems how does he solve problems by being vicious by biting tigers now youll be peculiarly struck by the fact that these three lists are so different and that is really what makes the goals problem mass goals problem mass because these terminals as you first look at them in the pc are in violent disagreement and remember that meter reads disagreement so goals problem mass of course is piled up because you doesnt agree with waterbuck because waterbuck doesnt agree with tiger because its all complete mishmash mess and they useand the first indicator is is they use entirely different mechanisms of solving problems so of course theres agreement amongst them at all and youll see that mirrored in those three lists its aquite an amusing action it is sufficiently amusing that the beginning of your next session im going to ask you to do this little action just for fun if your pc is beinghas got 3d package or even if the pc only has terminal and an oppterm as part of the package do this one and you will see what im talking about itll sound goofy even to the pc so theres the methods of solving problems now the pcs terminal is the one the pc has the most reality on now this has gotten mixed up over the years and some of the data given out by routine 3 about the terminal being highesttoned should be interpreted this way the terminal is highertoned than the pc we dont know what the pc is we havent got clue what he means by you and he sure hasnt either you is just something which is just up in seventh cloud nine itits some kind of combination of terminals or something or other but it certainly had nothing to do with the thetan it doesnt mean you thetan it just is you lord knows who you is its some kind of crisscross combination and mishmash and saintly idea of what he should be doing or shouldnt be doing but the thetan actually is on the minus tone scale otherwise he wouldnt have false identity sitting in your auditing chair called bessy ann or something like this see that thetan wouldnt have false identity if he werent on the minus tone scale he would be standing up throwing flitter around the room thats about that thetan who could be interested would be pretty close to visible thats very high see thetan who all by himself without any dependency on any mest or anything else could exert control directly hasnt been seen on the track since merlin see so your pc is lying actually as thetan is down in the minus tone scale and the pc goes up scale as you run the goals problem mass out and the pcs terminal goes down scale and the oppterm tends to remain more or less the same the oppterm is simply the oppterm and it doesnt have too much to do with anything except it sure has an influence on the goals problem mass now well go into that in moment ill give you some more of this conjectural material the height on tone scale then is we know the thetan is going to be on the minus tone scale so were not going to worry about you because that doesnt mean anything but as far as the terminal is concerned its going to be fairly low on the actual tone scale the oppterm is going to be fairly high on the tone scale somatics if you run 3d levels on the pc and you are running the pc properly as his own terminal you are going to develop somatics somatics are going to developrough ones bad onesenough to make any pc cut and run it may take him long time to move up to the point of feeling that much but hes going to feel them and theyre rough well why are they rough well thats the reality of the case that is how come the terminal is fixed there the terminal is fixed there because any time it shifts it hurts so the pc doesnt let it shift so he holds it in place because if it ever moved itd hurt now in view of the fact that he doesnt want this to hurt some pcs would rather not run their own terminal you get condition there of pc rather protesting against this and not really wanting to run his own terminal because it hurts hell scream like banshee on the thing now the somatics are developed out of masses and these masses may at first be invisible to the pc or not really directly sensed by the pc but are actually resident inside the pcs body because they surround the thetan the thetan is mass of energy and mass thats why he cant go anyplace and why he cant do the things anymore hes in trap of his own making and this we call valence but it is mass package and as you run the person this somatic area should move closer and closer in to the body and finally take up residence in the body it gets worse before it gets better believe running goals problem mass always gets worse and worse and worse before it gets any better the pc then healthwise does not necessarily appear to get better at all but on the contrary appears to get worse but theyre more cheerful about it all right now that is an indicator now if youre runningif youve chosen the opposition terminal and youre running the pc as the opposition terminal the pc appears to be blown upon the pcs sort ofwell their eyebrows sort of tend to vanish you know and they sort of so on and they get wateryeyed and so on it doesnt mean that they wont get roughed up running their own terminal theyre going to get roughed up badly but its peculiarpeculiar set of things great peculiarity is connected with this because its something out there which is pushing them here the winds of spacea very good descriptive thing because this could bewell it starts to make their body disappear let tell youlet say that the front of their body starts disappearing as far as the sensory perception goes i know that occurs instead of getting somatics in their body their body starts to vanish theres different sensation involved in the thing and when you get some reality on it its better than my describing it to you the next thing is the sec check responses oh you didnt think that one would come up and root if you look over the old seventyfive hour sec checks of the pc the pc is always answering on the mores of his own terminal that is little law when sec checked before 3d is run the pc only answers on the mores of his own terminal and you can look that over and decide whether its thewhether theyouve got waterbuck well has the pc been giving you the mores of the waterbuck or has the pc been giving you the mores of tiger and you can look that over you could also differentiate the goal and the oppgoal the same way thesethis requires judgment but it is check you can check up on this and youll find it is an interesting thing to check up on youll find that uniformly this pc has been telling you now im tiger im tiger thats what i am of course us tigersus tigers always are very very rough people and i am tiger and theres doubt about this well if you miss the fact that his head is being pushed off backwardsif you miss this fact because it might be missed by youyou can look it up on his sec checks have his crimes been the crimes of tiger or have his crimes been the crimes of waterbuck youll find that its very hard pickings and so forth but once you get the pattern and once you get the thread of it now that you know these two terminalsyou wouldnt be able to make any sense out of it before that but you know youve got two terminals you know youve got one as an oppterm and one as terminal if you go through their old sec checks youll find that their sec check answers agree with one of the terminals and that is the pcs terminal thats quite fascinating if you look that over and i think youll find out thatsthats more or less correct quite amusing they would be giving you the kind of answer while they were being sec checked that that terminal would give and they wont ever give the oppterm kind of answer they just wont ever give it you just dont see it ill tell you why that is in moment too next the pc doesnt like his terminal this is quite normal at first the pc is very intrigued and very interested and thinks this is fine but on careful check of this type of terminals you will find thereve been periods in his life when he didnt like this terminal that is fairly true now more importantly as the pc is run the pc will get into giddy hatred of the terminal they will think that terminal is just something they want nothing to do with that terminal is just good that is the end of that the terminal just isnt worth beans or buttons they dont like it now it dependsthe degree of overwhelm has lot to do with this but sooner or later either at the beginning with very little overwhelm pc says well all right so im waterbuck all right yeah well thats very interesting waterbuck well thank heavens we got it straightened out yeah i always have been sort of prancing around yeah yeah i always have alwaysalways was interested in waterbuck so on its fine fine fine hell run it everythings fine sessionfirst session well i dont really think much of waterbuck you know i never have you know well the auditor could be shaken at this one says what this person is waterbuck and doesnt like waterbucks well that doesnt make sense but he goes on and he runs it few days go by at the outside with any terminal and the pc says this is lousy terminal you know it is just good waterbuckthis is good they go around drinking water drinking water drinking water i dont think theyre so hot myself hell finally come up with this as an adjudication now it sometimes runs through from the beginning and sometimes sets in after several sessions but at some time or another this one sets in and its quite normal for them to have real reaction toward the oppterm the oppterm is just something that is there it isjust is but they have real emotional reaction oh theyve been mad about oppterms theyve been upset about oppterms from time to time yes theyll tell you thats my whole troublethe oppterm and then never amplify it at all its the most amazing thing youll ever listen to yes thats my whole trouble and thats all the trouble i had been in and yes ive been terribly emotional about this oppterm tigers have just been the bane of my existence since time immemorial thats right okay you put it in the auditing commands they never make any comments on it at all you get some kind of an auditing response like tell problem with awith tiger the oppterm oh how to find place to sleep well how might you solve that problem you know whatever it is thinking about it or whatever the level is thats it that theres emotional adjustment over here in the area of the oppterm but the waterbuck goes up and down all right tell problem about waterbuck how to kill one of the goddamn things all right how might thinking about it solve that problem well id get him thinking about dying and hed die heh how would waterbuckwhat problem would waterbuck have whatever it is um well sitting feeling lonely someplace and how to have friends youre getting emotional changes on the terminal so you canyoure running pc on the wrong terminal youre going to getyou tend to get monotone response you know nono real change of emotionalism on the subject of the terminal all the same kind of problem all about at the same emotional tone thats just tendency but the terminalthe oppterm doesnt shift around but the terminal sure does all right the next item here if youre running the pc on the oppterm you get nothing but motivator motivator motivator motivator motivator motivator motivator you just get motivators nothing but motivators theyve never done anything theyve just been run over youre running this guy on tiger and i tell you tigers have just been eaten up by waterbucks and theyve been shot by waterbucks and theyve been scalded by waterbucks and theyve been dragged all over by waterbucks and its just terrible what those waterbucks have done that waterbuck is just the lousiest brute that you ever heard of and hes specially mean to tigers and thats kind of going to be your response level now that isnt any leadpipe certainty but its an indicator if youve got that responses all right now why would pc give you the wrong terminal now lets get into the guts of this situation why would the pc give you the wrong terminals you got the oppterm he says thats my terminal well the pc attempts to withhold his terminal and there is large secret contained in it all it all it all and thats why you find the terminal last its best actually to find the terminal last because the pc tends to withhold his terminal and ill go into more on that isnt withholding the oppterm but is withholding his terminal this is why sec checks are so vital as preparatory maneuvers it tells you at once why you should have sec checks because what is it its giving up withholds giving up withholds and if youve got person whos obsessively withholding they will cover their terminal all right now lets go into long drawnout story of what it probably is all about huh well once upon time there was thetan and hetrying to do something or other and had some kind of an activity going he got tired of standing outside certain types of clouds looking at the change of light colors in them he began to think that was dull and he found there was something wrong in the universe and thats his terminal so he up and decided to make that thing right and he decided to eradicate that thar item and he decided to make nothing of it like he was and he decided to abolish that terminal now theres probably little prior step to all this before he started to abolish it he probably had common goal with it he probably had some association with it of some kind or another that was very pleasant association before he decided it was all bad that got him pinned in good but we wont bother with thosethe early history of that for the moment we will just say that he did decide because man is basically good that this thing was basically evil and that he must end it so he went on career and he has had career ever since of ending this terminal and of course the more overts he got against it the more he got away from it the more he snapped into it and he eventually wound up with complete ow package and total interiorization into the terminal now it works like this that thing which you have overts against you must originally have had some basic agreement with so you were pals with this thing at some time or another but you werent it but you could coexist with it very nicely and then you developed bunch of overts on it and differentiated from it and you committed overts to ensure your differentiation you began to be worried about being it you decided this thing was pretty evil so you developed some overts and you did overts to differentiate so that you could get away from it you decided this was the bad thing to be you didnt want to be around it anymore and you decided to kick it off and skip it and so you developed overts you didnt just do this just accidentally for the hell of it you really started developing overts and that made you move away from it and that at one time or another on the past track was the method how you didnt become something see thats how you prevented yourself from becoming something you developed some overts and you withheld from it and that differentiated you from it well that of course was cure and as we always have cures for cures for cures what happened after that is is after person had done sufficient overts and sufficient withholds he snapped into it and became it and that is the exact cycle agreement with it overts and withholds against it to differentiate and when differentiation could longer be totally established snap into it and become it now that is the condition the pc is in with regard to apparently his own terminal it is the one thing that he has the most overts against on the track man there are times when he has walked up and down main street of hooklaville carrying banners saying down with waterbucks down with waterbucks the trouble with this whole civilization is totally assignable only and entirely to waterbucks i can prove it to you conclusively in fact weve got one in captivity over here so he goes over and tortures it to death bum bum thing these waterbucks hes going to fix everything up well so hes gone on kind of an inandout cycle on this thing and it depends totally on the individual how often hes gone into it and how often hes come out of it and how often hes decided now if iif i pick up body in northern mongolia where there arent any waterbucks of any kind whatsoever and if i carefully dont think of waterbucks at all i will be all right hell get to that stage you see and then the war comes along and somebody drops magazine out of an airplane and theres picture of waterbuck see theres alland suddenly he feels sort of strange he feels sort of more massy than he did before but he cant tell what it was hadnt anything to do with that see its totally unknown situation see his withholds against it amount to withholding it hes trying to keep this thing from operating so hes withholding it so hes withholding it from operation in life hes withholding things about it hes withholding things against it hes doing overts to it hes differentiating from it and eventually he gets to point where he withholds it and he doesnt even remember it and is it all the time some kind of horror story you know you couldthis thetan has finally wound upthe one thing in the universe he wanted nothing to do with he is quite game so anyway at the other end of the spout you ask him for this thing one of his first reactions may be to withhold it so im tiger us tigers us very noble tigers who are so calm and serene and who are always right well now why does he do this the oppterm is actually the ally of the thetan in the destruction of the terminal and thats what makes the package look so dizzy he is not the oppterm but he and the oppterm at one time or another were pals but then because hes used the oppterm to destroy the terminal see hes used the tiger to destroy the waterbuck so often he also has trouble with tigers now so he has trouble with waterbucks and tigers now when you pick him up see but him and tigers have tried like mad to destroy waterbucks and he is right in there pitching on the subject of tigers hed hate to see tigers wiped out because they really do nice job of destroying waterbucks you let niceli lot of tigers loose and theyll destroy an awful lot of waterbucks but at the same time hes saying waterbucks should be protected from tigers because he is waterbuck so what dizzy situation now that dizziness of that situation is why it makes it difficult for you to pick out the waterbucks from the tigers but of course the oppterm is the pcs strongest ally for the destruction of the terminal and dont think at any time the pc has any other goal than the destruction of the terminal the terminal however has so overwhelmed him that some of its goals and thinkingness towards survival have overwhelmed his desire to destroy it so he goes on flickerflicker he comes in for session well lets wipe this waterbuck out this session you know rroww lets get in there at it lets damn waterbucks and so forth lets get in there and square it around and so forth he comes in the next session us waterbucks boy weve gotta get those tigers its pretty sad but weve gotta get them the last thing in the world the pc will do is wipe out the oppterm so youre just in for theit wont necessarily damage the pc itll blow his head off and ruin his eyesight and few things like this temporarily and upset him and so on but the main thing youre doing is just wasting auditing because he isnt going to do anything to the tiger he isnt going to do thing to the tiger tiger is going to stay right there when you finally get the goals problem mass all torn apart that tiger is going to be in the same state he was in before you started auditing waterbuck which is quite remarkable in spite of all the questions you have about tigers in your command sheets just realize that those questions are going exactly place except to straighten out waterbucks thats the only reason you brought the tiger in there at all is to straighten out waterbucks now if you know that anatomy of the package itll make more sense to you about all this but him and the oppterm is really pals theyre bosom buddies in spite of how he natters about it you can taketake period in his lifethis pcs lifeor her life ten years ago and youll find her in tremendous amount of trouble with tigers tigers were offensive tigers were upsetting ten years ago they were very upsetting they kept picking on her always motivators tigers picked on her tigers upset her ten years ago yes shes very happy to have run this terminal tigers because they were so upsetting all during her early career tigers day and night nag nag nag if it hadnt been for tigersif it hadnt been for tigersshed amount to something today see these long scratches look at that look at that look at that see now how could i have won the miss america beauty contest with these long scratches hm answer that youre talking to hundred percent waterbuck thats all youre not talking to the pc next day the pc has kind of gotten up little bit you see get an entirely different story about this thing damn those waterbucks and we dont hear anything about tigers at all see never hear word about it so they oscillate between being their terminal and damning their terminal and of course while theyre being their terminal theyre against anything that is against that terminal and while being themselves they are against the terminal now you have to sort this out thatsits all because thats it youre trying really on the sheetthe 3d formapparently to find the opposition terminal and if you havent got the reactive mind straight and what this is all about straight you of course will think youre asking for the opposition terminal to the pc see thats vastly different thing the opposition terminal to the pc is the pcs terminal the opposition terminal that you want to get hold of is merely the opposition to the pcs terminal the pc is hardly there at all but the pc has long history of the destruction of waterbucks and man can the pc find problems and incidents on the subject of waterbucks and let tell you they just run out of answers on the subject of tigers just truths problem with tiger well problem with tigerfind place to sleep all right thats good yeah theyd think about it thats right good well problem with tiger well umhow to rest more theyd think about it yeah thats the answer thats the way this foolishness would run see but you could actually on the 7 december commands while running it listening to the pcs answers eventually decide hey wait minute ive got this thing all backwards you could eventually come cropper straight into it because youve got pc versus the oppterm and pc versus the term all in there and the pc says ohh uhproblem about waterbuck uhnuhduh waterbuck uhhow to knock one off cliff yeah you get him to thinking about something else thats right and he wouldnt watch where hes going and go off the cliff ah yes yes hehhehhehhehheh thats nice splash thats very nice thats good all right all right now im talking about tiger well how to pare his nails all right good and hedyoud get him thinking about his appearance and thatd make him pare his nails thats right all right now problem about waterbuck problem about waterbuck problem about waterbuck well uhmhow to dry waterbuck meat yeah how to dry waterbuck meat yeah you get some very bright man thinking about it and hed figure out way to do it yeah i got that one all right now problem about tiger well how to uhhow many stripes he has and you listen to this and youll realize that youre looking over at some this is vast calm vista that has nothing to do with the pc the oppterm is some vast vista has nothing to do with the pc but every once in while the pc will give you nice answer like problem about waterbuck well how to just get him eaten alive by tigers you see because thats actually what hes been trying to do for trillennia hes been putting up this waterbuck and saying tigers any tigers any tigers here waterbucks look waterbucks you wonder why deer manage to grow white tails that make themselves very visible across the landscape well theyre 3d package too well now this gives youas another aside as part of the storyit gives you very very interesting view of humanity all of the people they natter about are their best friends and theyre trying to destroy themselves and that is not cynical but quite accurate picture of man why is it that all you have to do is put up recruiting poster and have just millions of men swarm in for pay volunteering to go up against electronic cannon dive off to other planets plunge to the bottom of the sea why why at pay so on should tell you should tell you lot it has puzzled greater men than we because edward gibbon says courage must be the cheapest possible commodity in human values because its so easily hired in such vast armies so quickly well thats paraphrase ithe actually missed the boat he didnt even get downhe not only didnt drive onto the dock he didnt even get down near the pier there wasnt even water where he was had nothing to do with courage it had to do totally with selfdestruction you advertise war all the waterbucks take those waterbucks up and put them in uniform and take them right over there and give them firing machine gun someplace theyll just stick that waterbuck up and theyll say well here i am dying in the service of my country well theyre missing i may have to move over there thetan is basically good this is good action which he has undertaken all the way down the track this was good action hes been trying to rid the world of these lice he actually has been working at it very hard and he should get medal but there it is there it is thats man not circa now its circa then and back then and back then and back then and back then hes always been operating this way guy joins upyou can alwaysyou can always spot this well you can spot things like this about men thattelling what theyre doing and so forth persons on post first few days there on post they look all right and after few days they start looking sort of dazed and after few days start developing eye difficulties and after few days more theya little cough in the chest so forth hharrmm after theyve been on the job three or four months they look like somethings been parting their hair with bullet you know theyve been hired see by their opposition terminal while being their terminal but occasionally theyre their terminal so theyre on the side of the opposition terminal against themselves you follow this out theyre on the side of the oppterm see what they did was join up and are continuously confronted by their opposition terminal see thats the corporation lets say they got job in corporation their oppterm maybe is corporations big businesses see so while theyre there they turn the winds of space on themselves you see theyve just got it turned on to high roar and at the same time they of course had joined the corporation in order to destroy whatever terminal they are being so while theyre being the terminal they are fantastically destructive to the corporation except on the end of the week at which time they are the corporation being fantastically destructive to terminalsto their own terminals see so much soso much so that you possibly could go into some large corporation call in large number of employees look at those that look rather flatwhistle up those that look pretty flatand say would you like reduction in wages well sign contract by which we guarantee to reduce your wages and in two and half years you will go broke and those people would sign it and they wouldnt sign now were going to pay you ten thousand pounds year and so forth they wouldnt sign that contract theyd sign the other one everybody thinks wages are striking fori mean unions are striking for higher wages and shorter hours unions are striking in an effort to wipe out working men and if you give them good opportunity they could wipe out working men you wouldnt have sane employment union organizational structural picture at any time ever until you got all the 3ds out of all the employees and you got it all straight and then all of sudden why itd all straighten out and itd all run all right up to that time its going to be this weird one of this fellow who has every reason in the worldyou keep looking at it this wayyou say but hes got every reason in the world to do his job and mind his nosekeep his nose clean and mind his own business and so forth hes got every reason in the world to do this and every reason in the world why he shouldnt go in the opposite direction yet there he is in the opposite direction you say to people now take this crosswalk with the white lines on it now you always go across the street at this white line and then theyre going to walk down the street half block and go across where there are white lines even though its out of their road you stand and watch whiteline area sometime youll see people pass by the white line and go down the street about quarter of block or half block and wait until the traffic is good and heavy and then without looking to the right or left cross at slow walk to the other side they got waterbuck theyre going to say who wants to hit him and its always such shock to the thetan to find out that it hurts them see this is an awful shock to themthat they didnt kill waterbuck they killed themselves this is always the surprise if you catch failed suicide he is always in state of fantastic surprise you get fellow who almost made it you know and you got him just by the last beam as he was departing from the body and stuffed him back in his head again or something of this sort and youll have somebody who said but why did i commit suicide you know and life is so wonderful and so beautiful and so forth and they go through some kind of resurgence of some kind or another well of course what they found out is that they didnt kill their terminal they killed themselves and this was vast shock to them theyre always getting shocked this way and always getting upset this way but anybody who has terminal has been trying to get rid of this terminal for very long time and you can say that his basic dedication and mission on the whole track was to dispose of the thing which youre going to run as his terminal and of course if you get the terminal hell cooperate like mad and if you run the opptermif you run the oppterm youre not going to get cooperation youre not not going to get cooperation theyre just not going to not not why whatwhats this well its all right hell ride along he feels safer on that side so theres every reason in the world thetan would give you the wrong item but lets go back and look at what was true about it and we find out that the oppterm is usually the highhigh on the tone scale higher than the terminal that when run the terminalif the pc is run on the terminal it turns on somatics the sec check responses always agree with the terminal not the oppterm the pc shows reality and like and dislike and disgust and this or that or the other thinghes got some misemotional connotation with regard to his terminal and when you run the oppterm you get the winds of space you get real somatics you just get discomfort you get kind of disappearance of the pc of course its theits the thing which is versus the terminal so then its mission is to make the terminal disappear so of course you do get kind of disappearance of the mass and everything else if youre running on the wrong side and if you run the oppterm as the pcs terminal by mistake they give you just motivator motivator motivator look at what those waterbucks did to us look at what those waterbucks did to us tigers man now you cannot decide on the basis of what you think is good or bad because the pc may have entirely different ideas on the subject what you think is good or bad has nothing to do with it this pc has terminal called bum so there are two items here one is bum and the other one is saint and you say immediately well naturally the pc would dislike bum more than he would dislike saint so therefore by the quality of the item the pcs terminal is bum oh man that just does not work if you put bum and saint and you down on the tone scale and saint was the pcs terminal you would be absolutely fascinated at how saints will solve problems they solve them by chicanery treachery by knifing people theyre really characters man these saints huh but bumhes nice hes sweet he never gets in anybodys road he never bothers anybody thatd be the kind of weirdit justit just doesnt add up see so it isnt the quality of the item and i think basically most of your trouble comes perhaps from deciding that you can decide which this pc is is he bum or is he saint is he waterbuck or is he tiger because hes got the attributes of both thats what makes it all so goddarn confoundedly confusing see hes inbeen in the middle of this fight so long that hes allied himself to the oppterm and hes been against the oppterm and hes always been the terminal but hes sometimes been for the terminal and sometimes against it hes just all mixed up see so the goal that you get for the pc could turn out to be the opposition goal and the pcs terminal could turn out to be the opposition terminal and the pcs modifier turns out to be the modifier for the opposition goal and its just all thuthuthu so getting 3d package doesnt mean that youve got straight 3d that you can run at all you now have to set that 3d up and set it together and you have to use certain adjudications by which to do this now you are not going to hurt pc by running the factual and true 3d package on the 7 december command series why if you look it over very carefully youll find out theres as much oppterm in it as there is term itll be little upsetting to the pc and so on but it will run it will run and that could fool you too that could fool you too because it wont run anywhere near as well as if you have it in the right direction but its not going to damage the pc youre going to get something done youre going to get something done one way or the other because youve got that command package which is designed to take care of this error but because the command package is designed to take care of the error you can of course make an error you could be fooled because its running well into believing youve got it right and sooner or later its going to be all wrong and it just isnt going to run right and the pc isnt going to make good gains and so forth now you can run the 7 december 1961 3d commands and actually wind up with all of the needle phenomena that you wind up with with the proper terminal while running the oppterm you can run the oppterm as the pcs terminal and you can have the tone arm go up stick and so on so theres nothing to adjudicate on the meter itll run the same way but it wont do much for the pc it wont do as much for the pc not by long ways so its good thing to sort it out now in the first place pc who is running wrongwayto is running under misconception and sooner or later theyre going to find out that they are telling themselves lies and its the way theyre lying to themselves that damages them rather than the commands they keep saying to themselves well us tigersus tigersand them waterbucksand us nice tigersand those waterbucks and this is the other thing that is wrong you get the wrong level chains let tell you something about wrong levels if you were to carelessly jump level and without getting levels in sequence if you were just suddenlyskip level and run something else you know and just make up your mind suddenly without assessing it that the pcs trouble was drainage and you say how might drainage solve that problem it doesnt register on the meter or anything else you run the pc on this for little while and the pc starts getting pretty upset it will turn on the pcs psychosomatics as opposed to the somatics if you run the wrong level on the pc you turn on the psychosomatics of the pc now what is psychosomatic that is chronic pain which amounts to physical illness with which the pc has been afflicted for very long time they turn on and they dont turn off now thats what happens when you run the wrong level so lets say we just picked it out of our head and said drainage and this pc ishas had peculiaritytheyve had susceptibility to sties and as we run this theyre going to get sties theyre going to get sties thats all there is to it so if you run the oppterm you turn on the psychosomatics of the pc you tend to turn on the psychosomatics of the pcyou wont necessarilybecause youre running wrong levels you see youre assessing the oppterm and not assessing the terminal and the terminal goes by different series of levels if you dont believe this take your pc at any given moment and assess him on the prehav scale or some little section of the prehav scale assess him on the terminal and then assess the opptermdont use itand youll find out itll come out an entirely different level so you can run wrong levels doing this now running the terminal doesnt turn on psychosomatic which is chronic pain which amounts to an illness or rough thing with the pc that the pc has always been afflicted with that isnt what does that you get another thing here you get another thing you get brandnew somatics and if the pc continually gets brandnew somatics and the somatic picture is different and the things the pc has never had before are turning on and the chronic somatics may be flickering in and out but arent necessarily getting very much concentration then youre running the right levels and youre running the right terminal but itsthe only thing that would be upsetting to the pc is if you run the oppterm on the 7 december 1961 commands you of course are running the wrong levels on the pc because itsit has entirely different assessment value it isnt that its going to kill the pc but its not going to make very much fast response you get pc this pc is always always always oh ill give you good one the pc years ago got rid of their terror stomach got it early auditing did good job terror stomach and they havent had terror stomach for years thats one thing that theyre cheerful and happy about and youre busyyoure busily happily running the terminal see youre running the terminal they havent been bothered with this for years see and you run the wrong level see you just pick out drainage at will see nothing with any response it shouldnt have come up at this time you just theyre going to run drainage and the pc goes for this because you see drainagethat explains great deal to them thats where you got it off of the pcs been selling you drainage you see and you run this and their terror stomach comes on they say but i got rid of this years ago mind you now youre running the terminal and everything fine youre just running the wrong level terror stomach comes on and till you go back and get the right level and bring it on up to date the terror stomach tends to stay on and then the terror stomach fades out and washes away you see that is an experimental action thats an experimental action all right so therefore running the oppterm of course youre getting the chronic somatics on but youre not getting new somatics on now were running the terminal and were running it by proper level the pc remembers having had neckache when they were sixteen and havent had much of neckache since and now theyve got neckache which is maybe in that place and maybe in different place but its one awful horrible neckache and they dont remember having neckache exactly like that neckache and it turns on and its much stronger and its much harder than they ever had neckache on before and before you have chance to sympathize with them very much why its all changed you ask them toward the end of the session hows your neckache and they say neckache what neckache oh oh what neckache well just that neckache that you had early in oh that one well that wasnt anything god you should feel this backache youre getting changing somatic pattern so running the oppterm you find the somatics and they stay on the same session after session after session or intensify or increase and running the terminal you get shift shift shift shift now you can normally expect the somatics to materialize inside the pcs bodies and at the back of the pcs bodyparticularly at the back of the pcs bodyin the back of the neck in the back of the head and inside the head and inside the stomach and all that you can expect somatics to materialize in the most unlikely places thats running the terminal and running the opposition terminal you tend to get fixed somatics its onyou only get the fixed somatic because youre running the levels out of sequence thats the only reason im stressing running levels out of sequence it isnt that youre going to find bunch of bum levels for the pc you can you can get level thats little bit corny or little bit off or something like that and your pc isnt going to get into any trouble on it its picking out something like i know whats the matter with this pc drainage you know and you run drainage yeah thats whats the matter with the pc thats absolutely right that is so true only it belonged twenty levels up the line and you picked it now see youve jumped it wildly out of sequence and itll turn on the pcs chronic somatics the like of which you never heard of and if its good levelit really applies to the terminal that youre running you seethe oppterm or the terminalreally applies if its good level this is very logical boy itll pull that goals problem mass justoh man itll just rip it up and marvelous you know leave the pc sitting in somatics that then dont move until you catch up with them with proper assessments so youve unnecessarily put your pc in misery for couple of more weeks than you should have thats what happens when you run an outof sequence level and thats what happens when you run the oppterm and thats all that happens when you run the oppterm now what ive been talking to you about is in the basis and state of flux lot of thethis material however was based on very good observation and i give it to you apologetically only for this reason is i have not had time or the data to codify you up perfect card which when you put the pointing arrow to zero it says down at the bottom waterbuck terminal tiger oppterm and i havent been able to do that but i have i think you will see accumulated an awful lot of indicators which can serve you very very well they are quite true indicators but you have to know the story of this and you have to know it very well you have to know what the thetan was doing and how the thetan got into this horrible mess this thetan may be sitting there telling youtrying to be proud about it allbut telling you well ive been waterbuck for long time and us waterbuck were really really quite the thing you know us waterbuck are except sometimes uhand uhi seem to keep remembering shooting waterbuck one time or another down in south africa i mean we kept shooting waterbuck and yeah we just slaughtered waterbuck all over the place yeah the river was just running with waterbuck oh waterbuck boy there were lot of dead ones see there shameful isnt it you have to realize that hes of mixed mind that he must preserve this thing because hes been overwhelmed bybecause of his overts and he must get rid of this thing and his attention is so confoundedly fixed on it that he isnt going to get his attention on much of anything else not in life his thinkingness and educational restrictions by the way are all contained in the terminal you say whatwhat skillswhat skills are you mainlyhowwhat skills do you really consider yourself good at and this is another test by the way i just happened to think of this one you could say what skills are you really good at and what can you really do and how does that compare to waterbuck the terminal and uhlet see tiger what skills could you really do with tiger well i dont like to spring dont have too much to do with springing and so on i dont like red meat i never eat any red meat as matter of fact um and so on dont uhi sure dont like sleeping in wet woods ive never been able to do that and springingin high school the broad jump i neverjust could never pass the broad jump i just never could pass the broad jump and so on yeah just dont think id have too much to do with tigers but i can swim i swim very well and im pretty good at dodging dodge extremely well yes remember playing football usedthat was what i was really good atdodging yeah i was really good at dodging and swimming swimming yes i was captain of the swimming team uhyes as matter of fact got the statewide medal till i broke my neck so forth itll be that kind of story his skill pattern will also fit with his terminal and will not fit with his oppterm you say well what kind of tiger would you make tiger thats new thought oh well yes id make very good tiger always have been very very good as tiger doesnt mean anything at all so the only real danger youre running is the running of the wrong level and the only thing that will do is give you another package that youll have to run at some time or another on the other level so it is not killing the pc now you think it might become clear on auditing but it very often doesnt now how long does the pc dramatize his terminal during run how long can you expect pc to be dramatizing his terminal or his oppterm or his goal or his oppterm or his oppgoal or something like that well i cant give you any figures but actually itsits couple three weeks of auditing anyway auditing on levels theyll come up withbecause what the devil youve got the whole educational pattern of the pc the whole experiential pattern of the pc and its all composed of these various factors so theyll keep manifesting themselves but the pc will try to withhold his terminal as youre auditing him and thats what makes your rudiments go out the pc will become very sensible during run ofall of sudden oh wait minute thats skill of waterbuck id better not do it see im really not waterbuck and the visible withhold of the waterbuck comes up and makes the pc stack up withholds and then the thing wont read you wont get read on the thing all the pcs doing is withholding his terminal because thats all the pc has been doing for trillennia is trying to withhold this terminal from action if this pc could go off in corner someplace and be absolutely sure that never thereafter would waterbuck ever breathe or jump on earth the pc would probably sit there for millennia perfectly happy in accomplishment of having utterly restrained this waterbuck from ever functioning again and his mission would have been totally complete he wouldnt be happy sitting in the corner but his concept of good and his duty and that sort of thing is sufficiently high that that is exactly what he would do hed feel very selfsatisfied about the whole thingwithholding his terminal i would say offhand that the terminal is not necessarily harder to get than the opposition terminal but the terminal is more chronically withheld youre liable to find the pc in the present life associating with his oppterm on friendly scratchtheeyesout basisactually very closely associating with his oppterm but not associating with his terminal you wont find him very often associating with his terminal kind of wanting to be his terminal had goals to be the terminal and so forth but if anyanyone stood uphehed be more likely if the waterbuck walked in the room you know hed say well i guess ill be going now guess ill be going now didnt realize you had such low tasteto the hostess you see sort of to himself i didnt realize you associated with criminals of this particular typewaterbucks association with the terminal association with the oppterm close association with the oppterm intimate always swinging into its perimeter hate like hell to be there too the whole time horrible you know thats somethingsomething we wouldnt associate with if we possibly could help it so we associate with it all the time but actively not really associating as general rule with the actual terminal actual terminal is something else and it is over there and we dont have too much to do with that kind of person do we if the pc had children you can just hear the pc say well now thats fine but lets not go off in the direction of studying waterbuckery for myself of course i couldif i had to i could study waterbuckery i could and so forth ive as matter of fact often been active in that particular field but notnot you children not you children thats for us hardened sinners thats for something else but of course i never would be one you understand that those are the general attitudes and i hopei hope in some way that helps you sort some pcs out maybe well have little indicator that well pin on the side of the emeter someday and you feed the terminal in on slip of paper and it instantly comes upif its blueif it comes out blue it is correct and if it comes out red it is incorrect or something of that sort we dont happen to have that gimmick right now we have to depend on you and your good sense if your pc is running painfully you are probably right if your pc is good and in pain and is miserable its terrible and the tone arm is going up and hitting clank and so forth its probably all right on the other hand if the pc is just getting sort of invisible and getting nowhere and they dont have any somatics except their chronic somatic of the pain in the end of their ear or something is now on much harder than its ever been on before and theyve had that pain for long time and so on and they just and theyre running lots of motivator motivator and so on well with the data im giving you today you should actually be able to look at your pc during run or after run or something like that and be able to tell whether the pc is running the right terminal or the wrong one but right now i tell you its in the lap of the gods and the judgment of auditors thank you
