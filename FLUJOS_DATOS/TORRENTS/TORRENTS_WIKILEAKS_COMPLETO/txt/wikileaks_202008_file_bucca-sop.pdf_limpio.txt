soldiers and 3 hmmwvs the irf teams will be distributed throughout the if during each shift at the front of the compounds near the cct tents b when the use of the irf is nec essary the sog will contact which team is needed via radio to have that team report to the designated area or compound c the irf will be assigned 24 hours day as directed by shift to assist each security shift d the sog will ensure the irf is properly instructed to react to all possible emergence response situations the sog will ensure all team members are thoroughly familiar with their duties and responsibilities the sog will ensure the accountability and serviceability of all irf equ ipment 2 the irf team is intended to be used primarily as force extraction team specializing in the extraction of detainee who is combative or resistive to being removed from compound it is not intended to be used on every detainee who is to b moved to isolation but on those who indicate or demonstrate an intention to resist the move to isolation or another location unless it is an emergency situation the battalion operation center is the only element authorized to move detainee 3 if disturbance occurs within the facility and the irf is ordered to respond the sog will determine which teams will be needed and how they will be used the sog will control their efforts until the disturbance is neutralized and area is secure if it becomes necessary to use more force the rovers will be utilized 4 the rover teams will be utilized in the same manner as the irf teams except for the fact that they are in constant motion around the entire compound area 5 the irf will provide securit by checking all concertina wire and gates while driving around each compound they will also drive around the immediate outside fence to ensure it is properly secured also this will be done at minimum of once an hour they will be logged in and out on the ecp staff journal the irf will also provide non lethal back up support when an irf has to go into compound they will also check all kbr conex boxes to ensure they are properly secured at end of the civilian duty day 6 before the use of an irf team is used to subdue detainee the mayor of that compound should be aware and had an opportunity to attempt to stop the disturbance with the cct it may be at times necessary for the irf to be deployed immediately depending on the seriousness of

213 military working dogs mwd general mp dog handlers must learn good safety habits and must practice them at all times some people believe mwds whether on leash or loose are walking safety hazards safety conscious handlers can prevent mwds from committing unsafe acts and thereby dispel such misconceptions safety practices must begin the minute handler enter s the kennel area b procedures in and around kennel areas 1 at time will any unauthorized personnel be allowed access to the kennel facility personnel other than mwd handlers will only be authorized accompanied access at the direction of the ke nnel ncoic veterinary and maintenance personnel will be accompanied at all times while working within the facility 2 handlers must refrain from running or engaging in any type of horseplay in or near the kennel area such actions tend to stimulate the dogs and can create situation wherein dog might break out of its kennel andor cause injury to itself person or another dog 3 handler must use caution to maintain control over his dog when moving it from one place to another in the kennel rea safety leash will be used at all times in the kennel area 4 there are number of safety precautions to observe while in and around the kennel area when dogs are inside their runs secure all gates and doors to the runs b use caution to avoid sudden movement around the kennel area c use extreme cautions when cleaning feeding and watering all dogs d in the event loose dog appears in the area the first person to notice the animal must give the alarm loose dog and everyone in the area except the dogs handler must freeze the dogs handler must immediately secure the dog handlers must take up short leash upon approaching anyone with their dog to allow safe distance between their dog and the personnel in the area f handlers with dogs on leash must give oral warning upon entering or leaving the kennel area and at any time there is an obstructed view by calling out dog coming throughinoutbyetc whichever is appropriate g personnel should never turn th eir backs on dogs never kick slap or hit dog except when directed in training as training aid c procedures during movement 1 while moving to and from designated training areas and during break and grooming periods handlers must always keep their dogs on leash 2 safe distance must be maintained between other teams and other people as rule there should be at least fifteen feet between dogs or between dog and another person when it becomes necessary to approach other dog teams dogs must be held on short leashes greater distance must be allowed during break periods because this is the time for the dogs to romp and play at the end of the leash 3 when accompanied by his dog the handler should not sit or lie down because he would be in an extremely awkward position to control the dog if it suddenly lunged 4 to pass an article to another person the handler will place the article on the ground and take his dog from the immediate area the other person can then safely ret rieve the article 5 the handler will not tie his dog to any object with the leash for any extended period of time since the dog may chew through the leash break it gain freedom and perhaps cause injury to itself or others 6 dog will never be st aked out unobserved or left unobserved with muzzle on 7 the handler will never tie his dog to vehicle or other movable object the dog might receive serious injury if the vehicle is moved 15 8 many dogs have natural desire to fight other dog s when they are brought together it is important to follow safe procedures when breaking up dog fight to begin with breaking up dog fight is two man job one should attempt to accomplish it alone fighting dogs should never be pulled apart pulling them apart may cause ripping or tearing of the flash andor disable the dogs in breaking up dog fight the handler should keep his leash taut as he gradually works his hand toward the snap of the leash b firmly hold the leash one in ch from the snap with his strong hand and slip his weaker hand underneath the dogs neck c grab the throat of the dog with the weaker hand at point below the lower jaw d choke the dog until the air supply is cut off thus forcing the dog to relea its hold repeatedly command the dog out during the entire procedure 9 if handler is bitten by dog he uses the same procedure to affect release as used to separate two fighting dogs never attempt to jerk away from the dog since this action may cause serious wound 10 an alert handler can avoid being bitten by his own dog if the dog attempts to bite grab the leash close to the dogs neck hold the animals front feet off the ground extend arms to push the dog away and at the same time slowly turn in circle to keep the dog off balance this serves two purposes it keeps the dog from seriously harming its handler and it is means to correct his dog from trying to bite him the handler will repeatedly command the dog out during the procedure 11 until dog has received all of its initial training most of its time is spent in either the kennel area or the training area therefore it is important that the handler be especially aware of his safety responsibilities whi in these areas 12 dogs will not be agitated in the kennel runs support buildingsareas or in the area immediately surrounding kennel s d procedures around veterinary treatment facilities 1 the opportunity for violation of good safety practic exists when the handler presents his dog to the veterinarian for examination or treatment the handler must keep in mind that his dog is in strange surroundings among strange people for treatment that is unusual and sometimes painful this is an abnormal situation for the dog and its behavior may not be what the handler expects therefore the handler must always be alert and prepared to control his animal at all times while medical care is being given 2 because of the flow of animal traffic dur ing clinical hours the distance between dogs prevents safety problem dog must always be kept safe distance from other dogs handlers and vet personnel dogs must be muzzled and kept on short leash at all times while in the vet clinic 3 the handler must be familiar with and utilize the appropriate safety precautions as set forth in this sop when the situation mandates patrol safety 1 handlers must warn personnel who attempt to approach their dog that the dog will attack you without c ommand 2 handlers will not allow their dogs to be left unattended in their patrol vehicle for an extended period of time 3 handlers will ensure that when patrolling with the dogs in the front of the vehicle that the right side passenger window is rolled up sufficiently so that the dog cannot escape or jump from the window while riding in the vehicle f mwd procedures for detainee operations 1 the primary function of patrol dogs in the if area is detecting unauthorized personnel and warning t he handler once the handler has been alerted it becomes the responsibility of the handler to cope with the situation in the most appropriate manner 2 the secondary function of mwds in the if is to pursue attack and hold any escapee releasing the dog constitutes the application of physical force and is governed by use of force requirements 3 it is required before releasing an mwd that all lesser means of force have been attempted when it is reasonable to do so it is the duty of the handler t apply the minimum amount of force necessary to prevent escape before releasing an mwd the handler will give the command halt three times handlers must avoid releasing the mwd to attack until the risk to innocent persons is eliminated or minimized 4 the mwd is the most effective when the team is on foot patrol dog used during daylight hours provides good psychological deterrent to escape an mwd team will periodically patrol the if during daylight hours mwds will also patrol the if at ght and during hours of reduced visibility 5 when the need for tracking arises personnel who are on scene should avoid the area and keep other personnel from entering the area to reduce contamination of the area mwds will always precede the search party the search party should maintain sufficient distance from the dog team to reduce distractions 6 mwd teams will not be used in the if for crowd control or direct confrontation with detainees unless determined absolutely necessary by the respons ible commander use of patrol dog teams for direct confrontation with demonstrators is not recommended the decision to employ mwds must be weighed carefully by the responsible commander to be sure that if mwd teams are committed that all lesser means f force have been reasonably attempted and failed the use of mwd teams comes only as an alternative to the use of deadly force to gain control of the situation if the commander directs employment of mwds for riotcrowd control the following procedures must be followed during peaceful stages of confrontation mwd teams will be held in reserve out of sight of the crowd as the situation worsens dog teams may be moved forward to within sight of the crowd but away from the front lines b when on the front lines dogs are kept on short leash and allowed to bite only under specific circumstances authorized by the responsible commander dogs will never be released into crowd c other riot control personnel should be positioned approximately 10 feet from mwd teams to avoid unintentional injury d mwd may be used to help apprehension teams catch and remove specific individuals in group of detainees in this role the dog team is used only to protect members of the apprehension team 7 mwd teams may be posted around holding areas and processing centers to prevent escape of prisoners 8 mwd teams may be used to guard detainees while in transit and assist in the search for escaped prisoner 9 mwds will stay out of inner perimeter of compounds unless doing riotcrowd control extractionprotection of personnel or command directed search of the tents for contraband 10 mwds will not be used to coerce or menace detainees during interrogation or any other similar circumstances 11 the k 9 ncoic will ensure at minimum there is dog team on duty every night from 2000 0400 when both handlers are working one team will randomly work 8 hours between 0400 2000 handlers are encouraged to occasionally have dogs bark and cond uct aggression training within the if area to demonstrate mwd capabilities it is recommended that handlers do both foot and vehicle patrols within the if area g training of non k9 personnel about mwd teams 1 applicability these instructions app ly to all personnel who may encounter mwd teams while on camp bucca 2 general mwd teams employed in security and combat operations constitute an important element in protecting installation resources and enforcing law and order it is important to u nderstand mwd behavior when encountering military working dog team while they are on and off duty 3 behavior around mwds the best thing to do when around mwd team is to keep your distance and ignore the dog do not stare directly into the dogs eyes they may perceive this as challenge for dominance and it could provoke an attack b do not approach an mwd team suddenly or aggressively mwds are trained to attack without command when they perceive their handler to be in danger remembe r this is the dogs perception not yours running and horseplay should also be avoided c do not ask or attempt to pet working dogs they are not pets and are limited in the amount of socialization they receive 16 d an mwd team always has the right of way if you cross paths with mwd team ensure you give the handler at least 10 feet of distance between you and him 4 effect of wind on how dog works the wind plays an important role in the mwds ability to detect unauthorized personnel normally an mwd team will begin to scout an open for an individual from the downwind side b during high winds it is important for an mwd team to be alerted quickly c in desert environment there is nothing for scent to stick to and it is quickly blown away d light steady wind is ideal for scouting and tracking scent is blown steadily and usually stays within cone 5 your position when dog is scouting or tracking when mwd is scouting or tracking it will always precede the sea rch party individuals on the search party should stay close enough to back up the team without distracting them the distance will vary from one dog team to the next b it is also important to stay out of thee area before mwd is there this will prev ent contraindication of the area by extra scent 6 what should you do if handler becomes hurt or unconscious notify another handler immediately to take control of the mwd 7 training with k 9 personnel k9 personnel train almost everyday to keep up proficiency levels nonhandler personnel are authorized and encouraged to act as decoys c mwd teams are also available to do realistic law enforcement scenario based training that would be productive 17 chapter 3 detainee security escort pro cedures 31 detainee security escort

set up to provide the maximum amount of prot ection for all vehicles within the convoy the fact that enemy forces generally attack the last half of the convoy should be taken into consideration when planning movements m1025m1026 preferably m114 escort vehicles escort vehicles provide over all security of the convoy during movement the formation use in this operation is scout 300 meter in front if avail lead and trail other escorts are assigned as middle security as needed the number of middle escorts is dependent upon the number of buses escorted the middle escorts are distributed evenly among the buses with the greatest escort presence toward the rear of the convoy in the event of an uneven number of buses see figure 32 b buses buses will be stacked more than three deep without an escort being present this is due to convoy length the length of the buses and the inability of the buses to defend themselves guards remain at the front of the bus at all times detainees are seated completely to the rear of the bus allowing buffer zone of one to two empty seats see figure 33 one empty bus will accompany the convoy in case of breakdown as determined by the convoy commander 2 convoy speed and spacing convoy speed convoy speed is determined upon sever things road conditions weather conditions visibility civilian presence and the top speed of the slowest vehicle upon taking these factors into consideration the convoy commander determineschanges convoy speed as appropriate 18 b convoy spacing distance between vehicles is determined by the type of environment generally vehicle intervals are 50 meters in the city and 100 meters in open terrain intervals should be increased or decreased during inclement weather or poor visibility 3 refu eling all vehicles and fuel cans will be full prior to sp and will refuel along the route as designated in the opord detainee missions have priority at refueling sites to minimize the wait at time will detainees exit the bus

or complies with orders and has assumed position appropriate for restraining before attempting to apprehend the detainee the irf team should remember that oc affects different people in different ways and to different levels the incapacitating effect of the oc pepper spray is expec ted to eliminate or significantly reduce the detainees ability to struggle and minimizes the amount of physical force needed by the irf to physically restrain and maintain security of the detainee 5 once the detainee is secured he will be decontamina ted by at minimum having the affected areas exposed to airflow and washed in water this should be done in secure area with access to water airflow these decontamination actions will be documented 6 based on the detainees behavi or the sog will determine whether the

judgment are preferred ways to resolve situations employm ent of taser 1 used to regain control only not as punishment 2 confrontational avoidance this is the first step that must be used ipc skills are essential in daily operations ideally 5 to 10 minutes using good ipc skills should be attempted when feasible since more then likely an interpreter will be used one must know how to properly use an interpreter 3 implied intent while using ipc skills you see that this is showing progress the cct team sog will then draw the taser and stat in clear authoritative tone that if compliance is not shown the taser will be used the taser will be aimed at offender but will remain on safe with finger alongside the trigger 4 employment of taser i f taser is used it will be used only until detainee complies and offers resistance to mps aim proper aim will be used with taser you will aim at the largest portion of the body at time will you aim at the head of detainee b shoot once you take aim and shoot hold the t rigger until the countdown display reads 00 release the trigger if you need to shoot again re squeeze the trigger squeeze only until detainee shows compliance then immediately stop c once compliance is demonstrated and further resistance is s hown approach detainee remove probes place detainee in restraints and have medical examine detainee f the taser is not toy it is device used
