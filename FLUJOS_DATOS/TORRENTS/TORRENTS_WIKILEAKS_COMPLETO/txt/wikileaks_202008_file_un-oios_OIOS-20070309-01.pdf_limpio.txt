007 are reflected where appropriate in the final report the representation accepted to undertake the implem entation of the recommendations overall assessment oios initially rated the unhcr operation in sierra leone as below average during the audit oios was unable to obtain supporting documentation for various decisions made and unhcr personnel were unable to clarify actions taken to nsure effective internal controls were in place this was due to the absence andor nonavailability of key staff at the representation and sub office even though adequate notice was given of the audit and the timing was agreed by the representative subsequently in the followup to ios draft communications management provided copies of most of the missing documents an d initiated positive action to address many of oios preliminary recommendations taking this i nto account the rating has been revised to average the implementation of the recommendations outlined in the report will further strengthen internal controls programme management the representation had complied with unhcr audit ce rtification requirements but with improved planning audit certificates could be subm itted earlier the representation took action and has contracted the auditors in timely manner project monitoring had been improved since oios 20 04 audit however it could be further enhanced to provide reasonable assurance to managem ent that partners are complying with unhcr subproject requirements and if not recommen dations are made to ensure projects objectives are achieved the representation has taken action to improve proj ect monitoring oios questioned the integrity performance and leve l of project implementation by local partner bpda considering the number of negative f indings reported doubtful procurement practices and nonimplementation of projects unhcr should reevaluate its relationship the representation stated they were not aware of any re ason to doubt the integrity of the partner in 2007 the representation is longer working with the partne r the lrrd project funded by the european commission was not implemented as planned several posts were not properly filled or were empl oyed on nonproject related activities and the reports were not available locally for review report covering the 2005 activities has been finalized and is being submitted to european c ommission oios is longer in position to verify the adequacy of the content of t he report asset management the internal controls over the safeguarding and use of assets could be improved given the phasingdown of the operations uptodate and reli able information is required to ensure there is proper decisionmaking on the redeployment ando r disposal of assets the representation provided assurance that internal controls have been improved cases of theft were reported to the local asset man agement board after significant delay compensation from one partner was still pending the representation will submit the case to headquarters asset management board workshop and fuel management from oios discussions unhcr and partners staff we re in general dissatisfied with the quality and timeliness of the work carried out by g tz oios analysis found large number of assets had remained in the workshop for more than 3 0 days many assets had broken down within days of repair and 39 assets were sent to th workshop more than 20 times in one year the representation provided assurance to oios that they are now satisfied with gtzs performance at the time of the audit oios could not obtain gtz s cost estimates that enable sound decisions to be made it appeared that gtz embarked on significant repairs costing up to us 15600 without prior authorization for 2005 there were 60 vehicles where the cost of repairs exceeded us 5000 copies of instructions and cost estimates for repai r have been provided the representation will endeavour to continue to im prove its monitoring of the gtz workshop gtz had good stock management system for spare p arts but the available information was not adequately used to identify slow moving or obso lete stock oios noted that stock valued at us 300000 had been in stock since january 2004 t he sale andor the deployment of this stock could generate significant income the representation is reviewing the spare parts inventory to ensure they are dealt with accordingly security and safety at the time of the audit there were unhcr secur ity staff in freetown although the post of field security advisor had been redeployed from ken ema to freetown the appointed staff member had not taken up the assignment unhcr depen ded on the department of safety and security to liaise with the host government on security issues the newly appointed fsa took his post in january 2007 administration administration and finance functions could be impro ved there were still control weaknesses over payments made by so kenema the representation made an inordinate number of payments and adjustments at the end of 2005 errors were found in the settlement of travel claims and significant number of receivable acco unts were still unreconciled the representation considers it normal practice to make adjustments and clear errors at the year end the representation will continue efforts to r econcile receivable accounts the representation was not fully complying

in 2004 that review focused on 2002 and 2003 activities covering expenditure of us 50 million oios assessed the operation as below average the audit revealed significant deficiencies in the management of programme supply and administration in addition project control was not effective local procurement procedures were defici ent and asset management required considerable improvement 3 the main objective of the operation was to provide protection and assistance to approximately 87000 1 persons of concern care and maintenance assistan ce was provided to liberians living in eight camps in kenema district and repatriation efforts were underway from 2003 to 2005 unhcr also implemented large r eintegration project for sierra leone refugees in various districts the findings and re commendations contained in this report have been discussed with the officials responsible for t he audited activities during the exit conferences held on 31 august and 2 september 2006 the comments which were received in december 2006 and february 2007 respectively ar reflected where appropriate in the final report the representation accepted to undertake the implem entation of the recommendations ii audit objectives 4 the main objectives of the audit were to evaluate t he adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subproject agreements iii audit scope and methodology 5 the audit focused on 2005 and 2006 programme activi ties under projects 05abslecm200 05abslerp300 05abslerp35 0 and 05abslels401 with expenditure of us 135 million our review concent rated on the activities implemented by deutsche gesellschaft fur technische zusammenarbeit gtz expenditure of us 36 million peace wind japan pwj expenditure of us 1 million national commission for social action nacsa expenditure of us 832000 and bopujehun development association bpda expenditure of us 594000 ios also reviewed activities directly 1 as of 31 december 2005 implemented by unhcr with expenditure of us 18 llion 6 the audit reviewed the administration of the office of the representation in freetown and so kenema with administrative budgets totalling us 2 million for 2006 and assets with an acquisition value of us 96 million and curre nt value of us 36 million the number of staff working for the unhcr representation in si erra leone was 131 this included staff on regular posts and united nations volunteers 7 the audit followed up on findings and recommendatio ns made in the 2004 oios audit regarding programme monitoring asset management p rocurement and financial management 8 the audit activities included review and assess ment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records the audit focussed on risk s related to the closing down of the operations such as disposal of assets closure of p rojects etc iv audit findings and recommendations programme management audit certification 9 oios reviewed the audit certificates issued by the external audit firm for 2004 and the draft for 2005 and had discussion with the audit ors oios assessed that the work had been competently performed and generally complied with u nhcrs rules and procedures on audit certification 10 there were delays in the initiation of the audit ce rtificate process the external auditors commenced their work only in june 2006 oios suggested that to accelerate the process which is now even more important consideri ng the introduction of new three month deadline the audit work be divided into two phases the first phase conducted prior to the end of the subproject period to conduct field visits and review expenditures would be followed by second phase after the liquidation pe riod to review the remaining transactions this would result in the more timely submission of audit certificates and would have the advantage of reviewing ceps in the course of implem entation instead of six months after the end of the projects the early issuance of managem ent letters would allow early corrective action the representation informed oios that the audit eng agement letter for 2006 audits was signed on 14 december 2006 the audit is in pr ogress and reports are expected by 31 march 2007 oios is pleased to note the positive action taken b financial project monitoring 11 oios assessed that project financial monitoring had improved since the 2004 audit verification visits were planned and generally re port was issued on the work done the partners indicated to oios that they appreciated th support and guidance given by the programme unit in developingimproving their accoun ting and internal control systems partners also welcomed the training sessions organi zed by unhcr on financial requirements and procedures 12 oios suggested that project monitoring could be fur ther enhanced in terms of frequency and coverage for instance for partners in field locations there was only one review in november 2005 and in 2006 none until september it was oios view that it would have been more effective to conduct the review early on so that remedial action could be taken in the case of major deficiencies the representation was of the opinion that november monitoring was geared towards streamlining performa nce to enable smooth project closure at the end of the liquidation period 13 oios had recommended in its 2004 audit that monit oring checklist be developed to coordinate the verification work carried out by var ious units to ensure key areas had been covered and to ensure the work was systematically nd consistently documented the representation indicated that financial monitorin g checklist had been developed and used as guide during the project monitoring review oios takes note that financial checklist has been developed oios would also suggest that to further enhance project monitoring other key activities assets fleet management of v ehicles and fuel staffing matters and comparison of project objectives against actual ach ievement should be included 14 oios appreciates that the programme unit in freetow n cannot be responsible for performing all monitoring functions and therefore h as to rely on reviews carried out by other units and offices the programme staff at so kenema could assist in project monitoring given their proximity to partners and to the activities b eing implemented while oios was informed that daily visits to camps were made this was not documented and therefore could not contribute to the formal project monitoring process as documentary evidence of the participation of the field staff to financial monit oring the representation attached copies of some sitreps these reports although useful for management purpo ses do not aim to report on the performance of each implementing partner as result all the necessary information may not be collected systematically 15 oios recommended that the representation improve pr oject monitoring of implementing partners to ensure there is sufficient coverage of all the activities undertaken monitoring tools should be developed and disseminat ed to field offices to enable them to contribute in more meaningful way to project moni toring and to ensure consistent approach the representation has since disseminated the proje ct monitoring tools to all concerned staff c budgetary process 16 oios assessed that the representation should improv its budget process oios could not obtain information on the basic budget componen ts for major items such as fuel workshop expenditures and hospital referrals it wa s not clear therefore how the budgeted provisions were developed for example for fuel oi could not be provided with an official list of vehicles and their average consumption eve n though the information was readily available from gtz the representation explained that the initial budge ts were needs driven but because of financial constraints the revised b udgets were resourcedriven this is why the components of the budget had lost pertinence oios recognizes that the budget has to be adapted to the level of available resources howeve r the basic data for building the initial budget should have been available operational data is available and has been used to gether with the subproject agreement details for monitor ing daytoday activities in reply to oios recommendation the representation provided list of vehicles showing fuel consumption and repair costs d linking relief rehabilitation and development proj ect 17 in early 2004 the european commission ec initiat ed the linking relief rehabilitation and development lrrd project and an mou was signed in july 2004 the eus contribution was 567000 us 720000 of wh ich 407000 us 518000 had been received in 2005 and 2006 the objectives of the pr oject were to ensure closer coordination and harmonization of programmes offered to the loca l community and the refugee population and to compensate the local population for the land provided to refugees the project was co funded by the ec swiss development corporation sd c and unhcr unhcrs activities were for two years ending on 30 june 2006 and rela ted to the technical cellule unit 18 due to the lack of staff the was not fully effe ctive it was foreseen that there would be 15 posts in the but some of the posts including those at the professional and national officer levels were either never filled or remained vacant for considerable period at the general service staff level from the six po sts provided only one driver had been assigned to the project the administrative assista nt recruited was generally assigned to other functions the lack of staff available to the proje ct was not communicated to the ec and there was evidence that the mou was revised acco rdingly 19 even though the project ended on 30 june 2006 ther was still final report prepared for submission to the ec oios also noted that there was limited information on the implementation of activities and the minutes of coo rdination meetings were only available starting in july 2005 oios recommended that the representation in cooperation with the desk ensure that the relevant reports are submitted to the donor as of 31 december 2005 and 30 june 2006 the representation should ensure that the activities carried out and the associated expenditures incurred are properly recor ded if it is not too late the revised role of unhcr should be agreed in writing with the europ ean commission and the budget revised accordingly the representation has now provided oios with cop of narrative and financial report covering the 2005 activities oios does not any longer have access to the representation project records and therefore is not in position to verify the content of this report oios will accept the representations assurances th at they have complied with the european commissions reporting requirements community empowerment projects cep 20 the cep projects were initiated in 2003 and unhcrs participation ended on 31 december 2005 in 2005 521 projects had been i mplemented costing us 63 million as the cep activities were completed and were implemen ted in locations not visited by oios our review focused on the available field monitorin g and technical reports additional information requested from nacsa the partner respo nsible for coordinating activities and from the representation has not been forthcoming 21 in several of the reports reviewed reference was m ade to the difficulties encountered in the ceps implementation in particular with the partner bpda for further details see paragraphs 24 to 28 in oios opinion there was lack of timely action by unhcr to follow up and resolve the difficulties encountered this may have resulted from the unclear roles and responsibilities among the various unhcr programme units and staff as well as from inadequate coordination by the representation also procurement activities were delegated to partners without assurance that they h ad sound procurement practices the partners reviewed bpda and pwj located in bo reque sted price lists on quarterly basis from the same three local vendors when oios compar ed them the price for cement quoted to bpda by the three vendors was usually higher by approximately 10 per cent than that quoted to pwj in 2005 bpda made number of purc hases for cement and other materials totalling us 134000 from supplier who quoted higher price for cement than the supplier chosen by pwj at the same location during the same period this in oios opinion is unacceptable and warranted further review the representation could not corroborate the statement made by oios and therefore did not reach the same conclusion oios noted that the representation had not reached the same conclus ion because it assumed that bpda had always purchased cement from the supplier that prov ided them with the lowest quote which was not the case in 2005 22 the representation ended the cep projects as of 31 december 2005 but measures had been established to ensure they would be proper ly completed in order to ensure the smooth continuation of these activities proper han dover procedures to the local community should have been done consideration should have be given to dedicating programme officer to oversee the closure of projects the han dover to the local community and the recovery of any unspent balances according to the representation there are hando ver procedures as they are already community owned proj ects the representation agreed to resolve any outstanding issues and will deploy the programme officer for followup as appropriate b review of implementing partners 23 taking into consideration the work already done by the external auditors oios audit strategy was to review areas not covered by the ext ernal auditors to avoid duplication and to follow up on their recommendations to ensure intern controls had been strengthened oios concluded that overall there were improvements by p artners in their maintenance of project records and the internal controls they established bopujehun development association 24 bpda is local partner and in 2005 and 2006 was legated responsibilities under the care and maintenance projects and in 2005 also impl emented reintegration projects for sierra leonean returnees 25 under the 2005 subproject agreement for reintegrat ion bpda was provided with us 194000 to develop and improve water systems in february 2006 the district programming team dpt which included unhcr condu cted an independent assessment of these projects dpt reported problems with some of the wells many of them were not functioning during the dry season and two sites lected for the construction of wells had been abandoned without completion on questioning t he quality and quantity of the implementation oios was informed by unhcr staff th at bpda had taken action to address the concerns oios visit to the bpda office in bo found however that some action had been taken but that not all the nonfunctioning wells h ad been made fully operational bpda disagreed with dpt on some of its findings with reg ard to the status of the wells this disagreement had not been formally communicated to unhcr and bdpa had only verbally told unhcr that corrective action had been taken u nhcr accepted this without verifying the status of the wells the representation confirmed that action has yet been taken but indicated that further followups will be done to micably resolve the issue considering the passage of time oios was of the opinion that the p lanned followup will not be fully effective 26 under the community service sector budget of us 1 18000 bpda should have provided sports equipment and support in the constr uction of sports and youth facilities the external auditors report confirmed dpts findings that the correct sport equipment had not been supplied and sports pavilion had been const ructed it was reported that the community members expressed dissatisfaction with th implementation of the project and their complaints were publicized through radio anno uncements and by formal letter from councillor of the community to several agencies inc luding unhcr oios was unable to obtain copy of the letter but bpda claimed that the allegations of poor implementation were false oios urged bpda to correspond in writin g to unhcr especially where they disagree with the dpt report andor the external au ditors report bpda agreed to do so but oios has not received any feedback to determine if this has been done the representation is not aware of these complaints 27 oios found discrepancies in the narrative spmr subm itted by bpda for example the statistics showing wells constructed and rehabi litated did not agree with table provided by bpda to oios the representation assured oios that they were sati sfied that appropriate action had been taken 28 overall there was concern with the integrity of bp das performance in project implementation and the procurement practices it ado pted as well as the number of negative findings reported by dpt the external auditors and oios in view of the findings made oios recommended that the representation review its working relationship with bpda and consider whether it has the capacity to be an effec tive unhcr partner the representation assured oios that appropriate followup on all matt ers arising out of monitoring of the project activities implemented by partners was unde rtaken the representation stated that in line with downsizing of the operation bpda is not i mplementing 2007 subprojects b deutsche gesellschaft fur technische zusammenarbei t 29 the external auditors issued qualified opinion on the 2005 subprojects due to the nonavailability of supporting documents for expend itures for spare parts internationally procured and international staff salaries althoug h after the 2004 oios audit assurances were given that copies of relevant documents would be kept locally to verify the expenditures this had not been done if this continues the repre sentation should request an audit certificate from gtzs external auditors this is allowed under the conditions stipulated in the unhcr audit certification guidelines the representation has requested an audit certifica from gtzs external auditor 30 at the time of the audit gtz had not liquidated 20 05 subproject commitments number of significant advances charged as expenditu res had been made to field locations which had not been settled oios noted that as of 1 february 2006 after the liquation period gtz had paid advances to its field project managers of sll 364 million us 125500 for which sll 31 million us 10700 had not been spent as of 30 august 2006 immediate action should be taken t resolve this as gtz will soon close its offices in sierra leone the representation has resolved the issue gtz has revised the spmr for 2005 the expenditures already charged to unhcr were redu ced by us 34000 c national commission for social action 31 oios visited nacsas office in kenema to review the monitoring files maintained on the ceps implemented by gtz nacsa had concluded th at gtz had performed very well despite the remoteness of the location in kenema most of the communities had received monthly visit from nacsas field monitoring team t hese reviews were adequately documented 32 the host community projects included the constructi on of community centre built in 2003 and market initiated in 2004 in 2005 the nnual budget for each activity was sll 15 million us 5200 this was insufficient t start new project and was used instead to complete projects initiated in 2003 and 2004 t he community awarded construction contracts without involving nacsa in the selection process and without competitive biding nacsa was not aware of its responsibilities in this area and should be reminded that they are accountable for the efficient use of unhcr funds d sierra leone red cross 33 in 2005 slrc was delegated responsibilities under care and maintenance repatriation and reintegration activities for both 2004 and 2005 projects the external auditors issued qualified audit opinion assurance coul d be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed by slrc in acc ordance with the subproject agreements the main finding was the inadequacy of documents supporting the payments made slrc indicated that they were dealing with ppliers on the local market with formal invoices thus slrc gave the vendors book of receipts which they were requested to use 34 the project control officer and the programme assis tant visited slrc in bo in november 2005 it was the first field visit in 2005 given that qualified opinion had been issued in 2004 more indepth review earlier in t he year would have been more beneficial the monitoring review identified that the accountin g system was inadequate and it was impossible to reconcile the expenditures recorded i n bo with the spmr submitted by slrc headquarters in freetown the representation provi ded slrc with accounting software but they did not install it the representation confirmed that there were seriou s management problems with slrc and this was the reason that unh cr discontinued the partnership 35 oios was concerned about the major component of slr c project expenditure incurred in the bo district relating to hospital r eferrals of sll 400 million us 136000 due to weaknesses in internal control assurance could be taken that all charges reported by slrc corresponded to assistance provided to genu ine beneficiaries there was documentary evidence that the referrals were duly uthorized verification to ensure that patients were living in camp documentation at testing the authorization of the referral and the beneficiaries identity was not attached to the invoices submitted by the hospitals given that the problems with slrc had been previous ly identified oios suggests that the activity be closely monitored by the unhcr medical coordinator c supply management asset management 36 the controls over the management of assets continue d to be weak and data was incomplete and unreliable in view of the downsizin g of the operation and the considerable investment unhcr has made over the past years oios stressed the importance of the representation being in position to properly acco unt for all assets it is only on the basis of reliable information that proper plan can be deve loped for the disposal transfer sale or redeployment of assets the representation stated that they have endeavoured to improve asset management and physical inventory was done in 2005 and another undertaken in 2006 and assettrak is being updated to incorporate the r esults 37 assettrak data entry was centralized in the office of the representation information was not systematically provided on assets to so ke nema nor did the so ever request it both offices were unaware of what their asset management responsibilities were oios suggested that dedicated focal points be assigned to each off ice to improve communication and sharing of information the representation has now assigned focal points an example where oios noted insufficient communication was with the purch ase and delivery of 40 laptops to so kenema the representation did not adequately follo w up on the transferdelivery to ensure they had been delivered and received by the intende d persons in good order at the time of the audit only four of them were recorded in the edp i nventory the so was not aware of the consignment and whether it had been received either by so kenema or any other fo under its responsibility oios was concerned about the lack f action taken to look into this apparent loss of assets and requested it be followed up up on oios enquiry the location and custodians of 36 of the laptops were found four ptops remained missing this identified serious weakness in internal controls the representation informed oios that the matter of the four missing laptops has been referred to the i go oios is pleased to note that the matter has been referred to the igo and is hopeful that in ternal controls have been strengthened to ensure that unhcrs property is not easily open to theft 38 the procedures for assets on loan to partners shoul d be improved right of use agreements were not systematically updated the lis ts of assets attached to the agreements were incomplete and not all partners submitted det ails of unhcr assets with the spmr action is being taken by the representation to comp lete and update right of use agreements bpda and irc had two outstanding cases of reimburse ment to unhcr as two vehicles on loan were involved in accidents in 2001 and 2004 re spectively in december 2005 unhcr requested irc and bpda compensate for the depreciat ed value us 25000 but at the time of the audit payment had been received the representation has made several followups with the partners and irc reimbursed us 5978 in september 2006 for bpda the representation inferred that reimbursement would be forthcoming and will submit the case to the headquarters asset management board for action 39 the documentation to support the local asset manage ment boards lamb decisions needed to be improved documents were not filed in an orderly manner and the theft of assets was not systematically reported to the mb or were reported with significant delay for instance the theft of over 20 pieces f telecommunications equipment in december 2004 was not submitted to the lamb until j une 2006 oios was also informed that there were several thefts such as laptops l and motorcycle although requested by oios during and again after the audit the represen tation did not furnish oios with copies of all the relevant reports requested the representation stated that they were of the opi nion that cases of losstheft were reported in timely manner and they were also reported to igo as required recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone should sub mit to the headquarters asset management board for decision relating to vehicle at depreciated value of about us 19000 that was involved in an accident while on loan to the implementing pa rtner bopujehun development association rec 01 40 oios takes note of the followup done in response t the draft report and has amended the recommendation accordingly the recommendation will remain open pending confirmation that the bpda case has been submitted to hamb and decision has been made to write off the unrecoverable amount b workshop management 41 for 2005 and 2006 gtz was allocated budget of us 3 million for the repairs and maintenance of unhcrs vehicles and generators gt z had two workshops one in kenema and the other in freetown wellington in 2006 gt z closed the wellington workshop and all repairs were transferred and dealt with in kene ma gtz used its workshop management system wms to record maintenance activities oios obtained copy of the information and analysed the wms files for the kenema workshop for the year 2005 and the first seven months of 2006 42 unhcr did not adequately manage and monitor repair costs incurred and charged by gtz and only requested information on the costs of repairs of its administrative assets to apportion the costs to the abod for programme ass ets details of the total repair costs per asset their downtime or frequency of repair were r equested as consequence there was assurance that unhcr was getting value for money an d repair work was cost effective the representation will continue to work to improve thi s situation in the so it was confirmed that measures were in place to track and monitor th repairs and maintenance of admin assets and gtz had been requested to provide cost estimates before embarking upon major repair activities to vehicles generators and motor cycles under so kenema administration oios would like to stress that so kenema should ext end its monitoring role over programme assets and not just limit it to administrative asse ts 43 both unhcr and the implementing partners indicated that the services provided by gtz were not satisfactory but the complaints were not documented and formally communicated to gtz the repair work usually took long time and on some occasions soon after the repair the vehicle acquired new pro blems oios analysis of the wms data collaborated this in 2005 232 assets trucks lig ht vehicles motorcycles or generators remained in the workshop for more than 30 days and 39 assets had more than 20 visits to the workshop moreover at the time of the audit an i nordinate number of assets according to gtzs records were in the workshop or outside in th compound for repair in number of instances the asset broke down within daysweeks f the repairs and was sent back to the workshop this happened despite gtzs claim that thorough inspection was conducted each time an asset was in the workshop gtz believed th frequency of repairs of some assets could be attributed to the poor road conditions as well as the quality of parts purchased the representation stated that due to gtz not closing i ts job cards the number of assets under repair as recorded in their system was not correct the representation submitted documentary evidence of the verification done 44 at the time of the audit oios was not presented wi th any evidence that cost estimate was requested before embarking on repairs so that decision could be made as to whether or not the repairs would be cost effective oios found that the cost of one repair was us 15600 in 2005 and there were 60 vehicles repa ired at cost exceeding us 5000 also although gtz maintained history of the repa irs per vehicle this information was not requested by or shared with unhcr this informatio n is of particular importance given the decisions that will have to be made regarding the s ale redeployment andor retention of vehicles considering that unhcr is downsizing its operations it may not be cost effective to perform all the repairs the representation provided assurances to oios that they had asked for cost estimates before repairs were undert aken by gtz this requirement had been communicated to gtz in march 2006 and reminder nt in july the representation will continue to follow up on this issue recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone should obt ain from gtz the list of assets currently being repaired togethe r with the reasons for any delays in completing the work based on this in formation and with gtzs assistance unhcr should decide on the ppropriate action to take rec 02 45 the representation has requested gtz to provide inf ormation on the assets that were in the workshop at the time of the audit in august 2006 together with explanations of why there were delays in completing the necessary work oios takes assurance from the fact that the representation has confirmed that they are sati sfied with gtzs performance and that cost estimates are requested prior to repair work b eing undertaken nonetheless oios will keep the recommendation open until information has been provided as to cause of the delays as seen at the time of the audit to the timely re pair of vehicles in the workshop c physical inventory of spare parts 46 although the information was available the represe ntation did not ask gtz to provide relevant management information for monitor ing purposes such as the results of physical inventories undertaken stock ageing repor ts and details of obsolete items oios noted that in august 2006 of the 2500 spare part types in the workshop 1400 types 56 per cent had not been used during 2005 and 2006 the v alue of this unused stock in kenema was about us 300000 36 per cent of the value of the stock on hand gtz confirmed that there were still spare parts kept in freetown but was ble to provide oios with the stock listings immediate action is required to identify spare part s that will longer be required and are suitable for redeployment or sale before the closin g down of the operation recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone should reg ularly review relevant stock management information reports such as stock ageing reports and take appropriate action to ensure effec tive stock management decisions are made all unused and possi ble obsolete stock estimated at over us 300000 should be red eployed or sold as soon as possible this could result in considerable income andor cost savings for unhcr rec 03 47 the representation was of the opinion that their mo nitoring of gtzs activities was done regularly the representation stated that the unused obsolete stock of spare parts estimated at us 300000 could not be corroborated and following discussion with gtz it was thought that this figure included spare parts p urchased with bmz funds and held for use by gtzbmz projects after discussion with the division of operationa l support oios is of the opinion that under the unhcr gtzbmz agreem ent these spare parts are part of the unhcr project and should be managed as such the pr oject expenditures paid directly by bmz to gtz are recorded by unhcr as bmz contribut ion the representation is reviewing the spare parts inventory following trans fer of the workshop to regional fleet management in liberia the usable parts will be tra nsferred to liberia and the remaining obsolete parts will be disposed of d fuel management 48 there had been an improvement in the internal contr ols established by unhcr for the management of fuel for administrative vehicles the fleet managers in freetown and kenema closely monitored this gtz had taken over r esponsibility and had established system to monitor fuel issuance and consumption per vehicle the effectiveness of this was questionable gtz stated that the speedometer was b roken in about 60 per cent of the vehicles and therefore heavy reliance was placed n the fuel attendant considering past experiences the risk associated with this was high oios suggested that further tightening of internal controls was necessary 49 for implementing partners although each asset eg vehicle and generator had monthly fuel quota unhcr did not have complete l ist of approved quotas per asset and did not monitor the total fuel taken per vehicle in month to ensure the quota was observed also unhcr had authorized higher quotas for some p artners but did not review the quota sufficiently regularly there was risk therefore that unhcr did not readjust the quota downwards when activities decreased the representation provided assurances to oios that there was now complete list of fuel quotas per as set this was revalidated and issued in november 2006 local procurement 50 there had been significant reduction in local pro curement since oios last audit it amounted to us 18 million and us 786000 for 200 5 and 2006 respectively 51 most of the local purchases were for fueldiesel an d lubricants despite the value involved regular competitive bidding to select the supplier was not done until the end of 2005 while three companies were invited to submit an offer only two offers were received and the winning company was the supplier unhcr had been using for many years as one company did not apply it would have been prudent f or unhcr to follow up to determine the reasons for it not replying to ensure more compet itive and transparent process in the future the representation explained that the selected comp any had been providing fuel after competitive bidding process in 2000 and the next nder was done in 2005 management did indeed follow up with the company that did not appl and they were informed that they had not yet invested in fuel containers around the coun try as had its competitors and could not have produced competitive bid 52 for the procurement of spare parts gtz addressed i ts request to so kenema and for fuel to unhcr logistics unit in freetown unhcr app roved the purchase orders for spare parts without having adequate management informatio n such as stock on hand oios suggested that this information is provided to ensu re more informed decisions are made in addition unhcr procured lubricants at gtzs reques t and similarly unhcr did not have any relevant information of the stock on hand or fo recasted requirements to justify the need for the quantities requested the representation informed oios that internal cont rols have been strengthened and justifications for purchases are now requested 53 oios would welcome copy of the instructions sent to gtz to ensure that unhcr is properly included in the decision making process 54 the logistics unit was involved in small transactio ns less than us 1000 that should have been done by the requesting unit in ot her cases oios saw that transactions exceeding us 1000 were not channelled through the logistics unit policy established by the representative in june 2006 also competitive biding was made when it was not necessary for lowvalue and recurring transactions these could have been sourced under frame agreement oios suggests that the procurement processes adopted by unhcr in sierra leone be reviewed to become more cost effect ive the representation was of the opinion that the procurement process was effective and also that decentralizing procurement to requesting units will significantly weaken the i nternal controls recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone should rev iew its procurement activities to ensure the process is cos t effective formal competitive biding should be done only when require d with low and recurring purchases sourced under frame agreements rec 04 55 the representation was of the opinion that appropri ate internal control mechanisms have been established suitable to the prevailing co nditions in sierra leone the representation will however explore the possibiliti of establishing frame agreements for frequently purchased items oios will keep the recommendation open until conf irmation that the establishment of frame agreements have been exp lored to ensure the procurement process can become more cost effective d security and safety 56 the office of the representation and so kenema were generally moss compliant the united nations department of safety and securit dss carried out assessments on regular basis the last review took place on 4 augu st 2006 57 there are four unhcr security posts with the field safety advisor based in kenema responsible for supervising three field safety assi stants in freetown unhcr relied on the services of security company and dss review of the office of the representation by the former unhcr field safety advisor fsa identified some weaknesses and recommended improvements to the reporting structure infrastruc ture of the unhcr buildings stronger access controls to unhcr premises and limiting ref ugees access within unhcr to name few the report also stated that the administrative assistant in freetown who acts as the security focal point was not able to properly execu the assigned responsibilities due to other official commitments 58 the security focal point in freetown was unable to provide oios any security incident reports for 2005 and 2006 oios discussions with u nhcr staff and partners revealed several cases of theftsuspected theft involving hcr staff and external parties during 2005 and 2006 the office of the representation could on ly provide oios with two security incident reports one relating to 12 june 2006 in f reetown the other in kenema in october 2005 the representation stated that the new incumb ent of the post was expected to assume functions as of 1 january 2007 59 the representation stated that all the critical rec ommendations of the former fsa have been implemented the representation shared w ith oios reports of security incidents involving unhcr oios is pleased to note that all critical security recommendations have been implemented administration 60 in the areas of administration and finance the unh cr offices in sierra leone should take action to improve internal controls to ensure compliance with unhcrs rules and procedures the representation indicated willingness to ensur that they fully complied with unhcrs rules and procedures weaknesses in internal controls 61 oios 2004 audit identified significant financial c ontrol weaknesses oios was of the opinion that further action was required to ensure there was sound internal controls over administrative functions there were still cases wh ere expenditure was authorized and approved without adequate supporting documentation the representation was of the opinion that the examples disclosed by oios were exceptions rather than common practice oios can confirm that number of omissions were found and therefore further strengthening of internal controls is required 62 in december 2005 so kenema recorded all the expend itures incurred since may 2005 by the three field offices fos under its res ponsibility several advances totalling sll 60 million us 20500 were made to each offic during the year without the required budgetary and financial controls manual voucher was prepared by fos but coded by so kenema on settlement of the advances instead of by the fo the recipients of the advances did not submit documents to substantiate that the p revious advance had been disbursed when requesting replenishment this did not allow reconc iliation of individual advances made against the balance still on hand this occurred according to the representation as result of the staffing structure of the sub and field offi ces only one staff member is available to do all the finance related functions in kenema also there has been backlog of work in 2005 despite staffing constraints progress has been mad in settling operational advances beginning 2007 the advances will be liquidated on monthly basis oios is pleased to note that this issue has now been resolved 63 attention was required by both the representation nd the so to improve cash and financial management the bank reconciliation for cash book in so kenema had showed unreconciled items for number of years this shou ld be resolved and corrected prior to the transfer of data to msrp the unreconciled items in so kenemas cash book hav been cleared 64 so kenema prepared payment voucher for each pett cash transaction this was time consuming considering the large number of tran sactions for example 81 payment vouchers were issued for each individual payment of sll 15000 us 5 to casual workers list of payments duly authorized and approved sh owing the signature of the beneficiaries and the date of the payment is sufficient oios so identified that the petty cash of so kenema was improperly used for payments such as ds advances that should have been made by cheque the representation stated that the practice will be discontinued 65 oios recommended that the representation closely pervise financial transactions made by so kenema due to the identified repeated ncompliance with unhcrs rules and procedures and the fact that the accounting functio n was not competently performed the representation agreed to undertake supervisory miss ions to kenema 66 at the office of the representation there were l arge number of payments and adjustments made at the end of 2005 there were so several errors made in the settlement of travel claims for which the representation could not identify the cause efforts were required to ensure that receivables were cleared in timely manner 67 contrary to the controllers instructions costs re lating to the private use of unhcr communication facilities were initially recorded as receivable therefore large portion of the transactions in the receivable account was rela ted to the recovery of personal telephone calls as recommended by oios the controllers instructions are now implemented 68 oios observed that the number of unreconciled items was increasing monthly and if this continues these accounts will become more dif ficult and time consuming to clear for instance from an fmis printout 80 items required settlement however in msrp the number of transactions was much higher correspondi ng to 4300 lines although headquarters will have to reconcile these in the f uture as msrp is rolled out the responsibility for this will lie with the field more proactive approach by financial resources services frs in headquarters is necessa ry to ensure the representation improves its accounting practices further guidance and assi stance may be required from frs to ensure that this accumulation of receivables is not repeat ed the representation stated that considerable number of adjustment entries were made in relation to subaccounts that had not been reconciled the representation was of the opinion that subaccounts were cleared in good time but there were number of outstanding is sues dating back to 2000 considerable resources are required to clear these recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone with the assistance of financial resources service at headquarters should take action to settle the vf accounts open items rec 05 69 the representation is following up with the desk an d frs to get assistance to clear old outstanding items dating back to 2000 as for the new items the controllers instruction on the recovery of private telephone calls has been implemented and other newly recorded items are regularly reconciled and cleared oios is pleased to note that assistance has been sought from frs and has amended the recommendation to monitor the process on the action taken to settle the vf accounts so that they are re duced to manageable level b missions to freetown 70 for two days every month unvs working in field loc ations travel to freetown due to the travel time they were absent from the office for three working days the representation explained that unvs came to freetown every month to collect their living allowances the reasoning behind this was not clear given that there were banking facilities in the field locations oios recommended that the r epresentation make the necessary arrangements with undp to transfer funds to the fie ld the representation did not agree with oios recommendation and was of the opinion t hat they should not diverge from undps practices they were also of the opinion tha t the administration of unv personnel should follow undps procedures and practices oios accepts that this may be local practice but doubts that unhcr is obliged to follo w it such procedure which results in regular loss of manpower 15 per cent of working da ys on monthly basis is questionable particularly as alternative arrangements could easi ly be established c medical evacuation 71 oios found two cases where the office of the repres entation paid 100 per cent dsa approximately us 8500 without proof that the st aff member stayed in hotel therefore 50 per cent of the applicable dsa rate should have been paid oios discussions revealed that the administrative assistant dealing with this was not aware of this rule and had not advised staff members accordingly oios was pleased to note that immediate action was taken to circulate the established rules to the fin ance and human resources personnel in freetown and kenema to prevent similar oversight in future the representation should follow up with the relevant staff members and reque st them to submit the appropriate receipts the representation should initiate recoveries where appropriate oios recommended that the representation provide documentary evidence that l staff in receipt of 100 per cent dsa had provided proof that they resided in hotel dur ing the relevant period the representation provided oios with some of the hotel receipts for t he two staff members receiving 100 per cent dsa d mip payments 72 the human resources assistant was administering mip instead of the administrator designated by dhrm in geneva oios noted that the n umber of mip claims reduced significantly after the mip fraud cases of 2004 an d claims were submitted or approved during 2004 in 2005 mip claims totalled approxim ately us 13000 which was significantly lower than the us 108000 in 2003 t he number of claims has also reduced from 362 in 2003 to 67 in 2005 73 some physicians and pharmacies were blacklisted and more stringent rules were imposed before mip claims were reimbursed for ins tance mip claims must be cleared by the designated physician and invoices could not exceed period of oneweeks treatment and had to be submitted within 30 days the represe ntation did not comply with these conditions when processing the mip claims for 2005 and 2006 dhrm had also requested that the representation should establish list of doctors and physicians and to obtain price lists from hospitals doctors and pharmacies the mip administrator could not provide us with this list or evidence that these measures had been implemented 74 according to the mip administrator the conditions stated in dhrms memorandum of october 2004 were only applicable for processing of the backlog mip cases from 2004 dhrm confirmed to oios that these conditions should be applicable to all sierra leone cases until further notice recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sierra leone should com ply with the conditions established by the division of human resources management and should seek clarification when in doubt and inform dhrm the reasons for designating different mip administrator rec 06 75 the representation stated that the conditions intro duced in dhrms memorandum such as the 30 days time limit for submission of p claims contravene staff rules 10315 and the mip statue and have sought clarific ation from dhrm the representation explained that there were difficulties in establish ing the price list for doctors physicians hospitals and pharmacies however they have manage d to obtain price lists from some pharmacies and doctors oios will maintain the recommendation as open til the appropriate procedures to follow are clarified by d hrm v acknowledgement 76
