pras is to provide persons likely to exhaust their unemployment insurance ui benefits choice in the type and source of reemployment services and to induce ui claimants and exhauste to speed their reemployment by providing bonus equal to the balance in their personal reemployment accounts when they obtain new jobs pra recipients would have to pay from thei r accounts for some reemployment services now available free at onestop centers if they chose to utilize those services eg training the bush administration initially proposed the accounts in its 2003 economic stimulus package and included pra demonstration in its fy2005 budget request in march 2005 the house passed hr 27 bill that would reauthorize the workforce investment act wia and authorize pra demonstration during the 108th congress the house passed hr 444 which included pra provisions identical to those in hr 27 the us department of labor announced in october 2004 that seven states had been selected to participate in pra py2004 demonstration funding for the demonstration was not included in fy2005 appropriations and the administration did t request pra funds for fy2006 in september 2005 it proposed recovery accounts for workers displaced from jobs as result of the gulf coast hurricanes that appear to be much like pras hr 3976 introduced in october 2005 similarly would create worker recovery accounts for those who lost jobs due to hurricanes katrina and rita proponents of the concept point to the results of experiments conducted during the 1980s as support for the efficacy of reemployment bonus the experiments produced mixed results only one of six bonus designs in washington significantly reduced the length of unemployment and the amount of ui benefits while all but one of the designs in pennsylvania significantly sped reemployment in both states the costs of the bonus experiments exceeded their benefits to the ui system based upon data from the two experiments it was subsequently estimated that targeting bonus offers to likely ui exhaustees yielded somewhat better outcomes than untargeted bonuses and that varying the value of the bonus could affect the number of weeks ui benefits must be paid as well as the bonus receipt rate another pra simulation involving likely ui exhaustees in georgia estimated that 59 would not have qualified for bonus it suggested that pra recipients might reduce their use of feebased reemployment services to maximize the bonus value the design of the experiments differs from the pra demonstrations in hr 27 and the py2004 project in ways that could affect the applicability of the experiments results for example those eligible for the demonstrations would be more disadvantaged than experiment participants the experiments bonus amount generally was fixed amount while the demonstration participants could affect its value based on their use of feebased services further experiment participants had to remain employed for given time before qualifying for bonus demonstration participants would receive portion of their pra balances immediately upon reemployment this report will be updated as warranted

proposed personal reemployment accounts pras the secretary of labor testified in february 2003 before the house committee on education and the workforce that the accounts are intended not only to speed reemployment into stable jobs through provision of cash bonus to unemployment insurance ui claimants that states determine are likely to exhaust their benefits but also to give the targeted individuals an opportunity to choose the type of services eg retraining child care and transportation and the source of services ie onestop delivery system or other service providers they believe will be mo st useful to them in their pursuit of new jobs proponents of the accounts point to the results of experiments conducted in four states during the mid to late 1980s as support for the efficacy of offering newjobs bonus to ui claimants in her testimony the secretary stated that experiments in washington pennsylvania and new jersey showed that reemployment bonus of 300 to 1000 motivated the recipients to become reemployed reduced the duration of ui by almost one week and resulted in new jobs comparable in earnings to those obtained by workers who were not eligible for the bonus and remained unemployed longer 1 further she noted that in an experiment that took place in illinois reemployment bonus of 500 reduced the duration of unemployment by more than week and did not lead to lower earnings at the workers next job this report begins by briefly summarizing the relevant provisions contained in legislation pending before the 109th congress it then compares the design elements

3000 per eligible individual the initial account balances must be the same for participants within local area or within state eligible individuals primarily would be ui claimants identified through worker profiling as likely to exhaust their benefits and in need of job search assistance to obtain new employment4 eligible entities could at their option extend accounts to individuals who had exhausted their benefit entitlement and are in training for which completion requires additional support or b were laid off from an industry or occupation with declining employment or which longer provides jobs in local area individuals could use the account funds at their own discretion to purchase variety of employmentrelated services ie intensive services training and support services and assistance with buying or leasing car on feeforservice basis from the onestop delivery system or other service providers recipients could only receive training intensive and support services on feeforservice basis during the oneyear period from the date of establishment of their accounts core services provided by onestop centers would remain free to account recipients eg access to job listings and assistance with writing résumés individuals with pras who obtain fulltime jobs within 13week qualification period dating from initial receipt of ui benefits for those still eligible for benefits and from the accounts establishment for those who had exhausted their benefits would receive any funds remaining in their accounts as bonuses the bonuses would be dispensed in two installments 60 upon reemployment and 40 six months thereafter these features are similar to an 8 million pra demonstration for which the us department of labor dol announced awards to seven states on october 29 2004 5 for fy20005 the president had requested 50 million under the authority of wia section 171 for pra demonstration funding for the demonstration was not included in fy2005 appropriations pl 108447 the administration did not request pra funds for fy2006 as part of the administrations response to hurricanes katrina and rita it proposed recovery accountsseemingly like prasfor workers displaced from their jobs as result of the natural disaster hr 3976 introduced in october 2005 similarly would create worker recovery accounts for workers who lost jobs due to the gulf coast hurricanes and who are likely to exhaust the benefits they are receiving under the disaster unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance programs action has been taken on this approach to aiding workers displaced as result of the hurricanes 4 pl 103152 which amended the social security act required states to develop systems of profiling new ui claimants in order to identify those likely to exhaust their benefits after states screen out initial claimants on recall status including in some cases persons laid off from seasonal industries and those who exclusively use union hiring halls the states use statistical models or characteristic screens to identify potential ui exhaustees measures taken into account include previous occupation industry wages and job tenure educational attainment and other claimant characteristics local economic indicators and the individuals ui weekly benefit amount states are not permitted to include such equal opportunity characteristics as age race gender and disability status 5 the seven states are florida idaho minnesota mississippi montana texas and west virginia for more information see httpwwwdolgovopamediapressopaopa20042248htm

jersey and illinois this report omits the new jersey experiment because it had very limited eligible population ie dislocated workers who were defined as persons having worked for the same employer for three years before filing for ui benefits as result the findings from the experiment are not generalizeable to bonus program having broader eligible population such as the one currently proposed new jerseys bonus experiment had mandatory jobsearch component as well 6 the experiments in washington pennsylvania and illinois had number of elements in common differences between the design of the experiments and the current bonus proposal will affect how well the results from the former can be applied to the latter

services and to one or more treatment groups that received in addition to existing services timelimited offers of bonuses which they were awarded after specified period of reemployment accordingly treatment group memb ers did not differ from typical ui recipients in any particular way eg they were not more likely to exhaust their benefits in addition participants in the experiments excluded persons who already had exhausted their ui benefits on both counts then individuals in the bonus experiments were likely to have better reemployment prospects than the eligible population of curre nt legislation and dols py2004 demonstration even among persons profiled as most likely to exhaust ui benefits pra simulation utilizing employment service records of georgia ui claima nts found that 59 would have been ineligible for bonus given their reemployment histories bout twofifths found jobs within 13 weeks and consequently would have qualified for an initial 60 bonus payment little more than one fourth remained employed long enough to have received both bonus payments7 6 the experiment also does not provide much guidance for policy because bonus offers were made only after seven weeks of insured unemployment and the pending offer was unk nown to the selected participants prior to that time such situation could not be replicated in real program as knowledge of the pending offer would be available to all claimants from the start of their benefit year and probably prior to that this knowledge can be expected to critically affect jobsearch behavior during the first seven weeks of the benefit year as well as during the period in which the bonus was available walter corson and robert g spiegelman introduction and background of the reemployment bonus experiments in philip k robins

value of the bonus offer was multiple of an individual claimants weekly benefit amount wba the dollar value of bonuses therefore differed from one claimant to another because of the claimants varying benefit entitlements the bonus offers were the same however in terms of the opportunity cost of employment to claimants ie reduction in one or more weeks of unemployment cost each pe rson one or more weeks of ui benefits as described in current proposals and the py2004 demonstration there is link between the value of bonus and the value of an individuals ui benefit instead variability within state in participants bonuses ie in their pra balances would depend upon their differing utilization of feebased reemployment services while persons in the experiments could not control the size of their bonuses individuals in the proposed program could do so through their decisions about expenditures from the accounts some might try to maximize their potential bonus by relying only on the free services that still would be available to them at onestop centers those in areas with relatively low unemployment rates or with signs of an improving economy could be more likely to think they need few if any feebased reemployment services some information on the possible utilization of different reemployment services can be gleaned from the pra simulation of likely ui exhaustees in georgia the study found that relatively few persons drew upon training and supportive services during their first 13 weeks of benefit receipt in contrast about twofifths utilized two intensive services namely customer service plans and counseling the researchers estimated that the intensive services cost 356 and 712 respectivelymuch less than the littleused options of training and supportive services 1424 and 1068 respectively the implementation of pra program might affect this usage however as participants would be faced with having to pay for some services the analysts further estimated that if individuals spent the entire pra amount of 3000 to buy services because they believed doing so would speed reem ployment or help get higher paying jobs the unemployed workers must expect either earnings to be nearly 14 percent higher or that employment will occur at least 6 weeks sooner as they noted that earnings and employment gains of this magnitude are not supported by prior research pra recipients might therefore reduce use of services in hopes of receiving larger reemployment bonuses 8 another difference between the experiments and the currently proposed design with regard to the value of the bonus is the amounts available to treatment group members were below the 3000 maximum value in 1989 dollars the year when the experiments mostly took place 3000 was equivalent to 2040considerably more than the 3001000 range of bonuses in the experiments 9 of course eligible entities would be free unde r the pra provisions in hr 27 and in the py2004 demonstration to set bonus amount below 3000 which would in turn allow them to make offers to larger share of eligible ui recipients however while 3000 might appear to be generous bonus amount it might not seem so in terms of covering the cost of reemployment services for which account funds could be used the adequacy of the pra amount would vary by 8 oleary and eberts personal reemployment accounts pp 34 9 paul t decker

thought that the optimal qualification period should not be so l ong that many ui claimants could obtain bonuses without altering their behavior ie receive bonuses without increasing their job search effort in order to become reemployed sooner than they otherwise would have alternatively it was thought that the qualification period should not be so brief that it discouraged claimants from attempting to intensify their jobseeking activities treatment group members generally received the same bonus amount eg six times their wba regardless of when within the qualification period they obtained new jobs it was estimated that the one experimental treatment in pennsylvania that provided declining bonus amount over the qualification period did not significantly hasten an individuals reemployment as currently proposed bonus amounts would decline over the 13week qualification period if individuals draw upon their pras individuals effectively would control the rate at which their bonuses decreased it thus appears that under the currently proposed design participants could themselves determine whether they faced constant or declining bonus offer

was chosen to avoid providing bonus for unstable seasonal work and to reduce an individuals inclination to take any job just to qualify for bonus as currently proposed individuals would get 60 of their bonus amounts immediately upon reemployment those in the state experiments got none of their bonuses until completion of the reemployment period the reemployment period was about four months in each experiment which is two months shorter than the reemploym ent period required in hr 27 and the py2004 demonstration to obtain the remaining 40 of the bonus immediate receipt of large share of substantial bonus might be greater inducement to speedy reemployment and acceptance of lowpaying job compared to the experiments designs the longer reemployment period for receipt of the remaining portion might be comparatively less of an inducement for remaining in the new job particularly if the value of the bonus were fairly small in other words the actual amount of the bonus could influence whether the ming of its receipt makes any difference to the individuals job search and retention beha vior the researchers who conducted the pra simulation of georgia ui beneficiaries noted th at while the reemployment earnings of those 10 ibid 11 jobless persons on recall status generally could not obtain bonuses if they subsequently got back their previous jobs at the employers who laid them off this also typically was the case for jobless persons who obtained employment through union hiring halls because in both instances the bonus offer did not cause them to change their behavior instead of the bonus offer prompting them to accelerate their job search in order to obtain employment sooner than they otherwise would have they continued to rely on the actions of others ie former employers and referral unions to determine the timing of their reemployment

ui claimants were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups or to control group the treatments involved variations on the size of the bonus offered and the length of the qualification period

unemployment and the amount of benefits in 2003 the average wba in washington was about 324 the highest bonus level in current dollars thus would be equal to 1944 on average which is almost twothirds of the proposed 3000 maximum for pras that are meant to go toward both reemployment services and bonuses the highest bonus level and the long qualification period had the largest impact namely 075

limited differences in the job search responses of subgroups within the treatment groups for example older workers ie age 45 or older with high earnings ie in the top third of the earnings distribution or at least 17366 experienced among the largest effects in terms of shortened unemployment and reduced ui benefits the evaluators speculated that this might have been the case because older highearning work ers could have become discouraged from looking for work after they had been let go from jobs they had held for many years these individuals thus had room to improve upon their job search efforts for all dislocated workers however only those with the broadest definition used by the ev aluators ie individuals continuously employed for three years prior to filing for ui and who were offered the largest bonus had outcome measures that differed substantially from others in the treatment groups similarly the effects of the experiment on unemployment duration and ui payments differed according to economic conditions the evaluators found stronger responses to the bonus offer in areas within the state with low unemployment rates ie below 5 workers in those areas might have thought that increasing their job search efforts could well elicit more job offers workers in areas with higher unemployment rates might have thought that employer demand was too soft to generate additional opportunities regardless of their job search intensity this finding suggests that bonus offer could have limited impact during cyclical downturn of the economy or in an area experiencing longterm decline the evaluators looked at whether the experime nt conferred net benefits or costs from the perspective of the ui system all government society as whole and selected population groups it was assumed that in an actual bonus program the bonuses would come from the ui trust fund therefore the cost to the ui system was considered to be bonus payments and administrative expenses while the benefit was considered to be savings in ui payments due to earlier reemployment the ui system was estimated to experience net costs because the reduction in benefits was smaller than the bonuses paid 14 in other words the experiment did not pay for itself 14 the administrative expenses of the experiment were quite low at 3 per eligible claimant

that source other than the ui trust fund would have to be found to fund it eg wia the experiment was slightly more beneficial to all government than to the ui system because benefits in addition to reduced ui payments included the income tax on earnings that reemployed workers owed the government from societal perspective the reemployment bonus was estimated to produce large net benefits because the increase in earnings of those who responded to the bonus offer far outweighed the sm all increase in administrative costs associated with bonus program 15 the net benefits to society estimated for the experiment could be overstated if the bonus receipt rate were higher in an established program up to onethird of the individuals in the experiment who were entitled to bonuses did not collect them16 in terms of bonus offer to subgroups within the population of ui recipients the evaluators found that program directed at older highearners had large net benefits for the ui system government and society

claimants were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups or to control group the treatments involved variations on the size of the bonus offered and the duration of the qualification period as shown in table 2 18 as in the washington experiment the bonus offers made to persons assigned to the treatment groups were expressed as dollar amount although the bonuses were calculated as multiple of each claimants wba qualification period aside the lower bonus amount averaged 500 the higher 1000 the reemployment period was set at 16 weeks unlike in washington all treatments in pennsylvania included the option of attending job search workshop treatment 6 did not include access to the workshop in order to isolate its impact however participation in the workshop wa s so low 26 that it prevented estimation of its impact and resulted in there actually being five rather than six approaches the evaluators speculated that participants lacked interest in attending the workshop because of the states low unemployment rate and to the workshop being offered early in an individuals jobless spell 15 transfer payments ie ui benefits and bonus amounts cancel each other out when computing costs and benefits to society as whole because they represent benefits to some ie ui recipients and costs to others ie taxpayers 16 the net benefits of the experiment also could differ from the longrun results of an ongoing program for reasons other than an increased takeup rate for example persons offered bonuses to speed their reemployment might take jobs that other jobseekers would have taken because the formers reemployment would come at the expense of longer unemployment among the latter the net benefits of bonus program would be lower in addition because bonus offer could increase the value of filing claim for ui benefits it ght prompt more uieligible workers to register with the system and thereby increase the number of persons receiving ui benefits and potentially receiving bonus payments 17 unless otherwise indicated this section is derived from us department of labor the pennsylvania reemployment bonus experiment final report unemployment insurance occasional paper 921

pennsylvania treatments yielded reduction in the duration of ui payments of 05 weeks on average and reduction in benefits of 80 on average pennsylvanias treatment 4 also was the only design that

groups were found to have exited the unemployment rolls sooner than control group members during the qualification period as the differential in ui exit rates tended to be widest right before or at the end of the qualification period many treatment group members appear to have escalated their job search activities just before their bonus eligibility expired there was evidence that the comparatively faster reemployment of treatment group members meant they accepted less desirable jobs in order to get bonus very little difference was found in the job search response to bonus offer among subgroups within the treatment groups the impact of the treatments on ui receipt was substantial and significantly greater among claimants from manufacturing industries than from other industries by more than 15 weeks however the evaluators looked at whether the experiment co nferred net benefits or costs from variety of perspectives the findings from the pennsylvania experiment were similar to those from the washington experiment despite the bonus offer producing significant decrease in ui receipt the experiment was not costeffective because the reduction in benefits did not outweigh the cost to the ui system of paying bonuses the outcome for the government was somewhat better with

on ui recipients with high likelihoods of benefit exhaustion models of the probability of benefit exhaustion were developed for the two states they were similar to the worker profiling and reemployment services wprs systems that states use to identify ui claimants expected to experience long spells of unemployment the researchers examined the effects of limiting bonus offers to individuals with varying probabilities of benefit exhaustion they found that very narrowly focusing bonuses on those most likely to exhaust benefits eg claimants in the top 10 of the exhaustion probability distribution was not necessarily the most effective approach neither the washington nor pennsylvania experiments produced greater reductions in weeks of ui receipt when they were targeted at the top 50 rather than the top 25 of persons most likely to exhaust their benefits the savings in ui benefits were larger for the top 25 or the top 50 of potential exhaustees than for all bonus experiment participants conversely bonus and administrative costs were higher in the targeted design than in the nontargeted designs from the perspective of the ui system net benefits of the combined treatments were greater or net costs smaller for the targeted design than for the nontargeted designs 20 among the various bonus treatments in washington and pennsylvania the researchers estimated that low bonus amount with long qualification period eg three times the wba and 12week qualification period that is focused on the 50 of ui claimants most likely to exhaust benefits was the most costeffective treatment they concluded that while the original findings from the nontargeted experiments did not generate overwhelming suppor t for reemployment bonuses some degree of targeting based on worker profiling improves the appeal of the reemployment bonus program 21

wprs were offered 3000 bonus 31 would qualify for and receive the first installment equal to 60 of the accounts balance this exceeds the bonus receipt rates of the state experiments not only because of the pras relatively greater value but also because reemployment under hr 27 triggers immediate payment of 60 of the accounts balance compared to the experiments requirement that individuals retain their jobs for 16 weeks before they receive bonuses in contrast lower pra amount should yield lower receipt rate because it reduces peoples incentive to try for the bonus thus 2000 bonus could reduce the receipt rate of the first installment to 27 for ui recipients generally and 30 for those targeted for wprs if the bonus were lowered to 1000 about the amount in real terms offered in the state experimentsthe receipt rates 20 and 29 respectively could still be above the actual rates in the experiments similarly the researchers estimated that the effect on the length of ui receipt would somewhat exceed the impacts in the state experiments the latter ranged between 026 weeks to 082 weeks per person offered bonuses with qualificat ion period of 11 or 12 weeks alternatively 3000 bonus was found to reduce the length of ui receipt by 166 weeks per account recipient 2000 by 138 weeks and 1000 by 109 weeks the reason for the potentially superior performance of the pra visavis the state expe riments is twofold th pra amount would be higher which should accelerate reemployment and thereby reduce the benefit period and the pra would be focused on those expected to have long durations of ui receipt which should increase the average contraction in benefit weeks for persons who find jobs during the bonus qualification period

assigned to one treatment and one control group the treatment involved the offer of 500 bonus for reemployment fulltime within 11 weeks of filing for benefits and after having been in the job for four months the bonus amount was equal to about four weeks of ui payments the 11week qualification period represented about 40 of the ui potential benefit entitlement in illinois regular program ie 26 weeks the 500 bonus was estimated to have produced large and statistically significant effect on job search behavior by reducing the average length of unemployment by 115 weeks the bonus also lowered ui benefit receipt significantly the average benefit of those in the treatment group was 158 or 194 less than received by those in the control depending on whether federal supplemental compensation fsc benefits were included the fsc program ended during the illinois experiment which meant about half the claimants had 26 weeks of ui eligibility under the states regular program and about half had 38 weeks because of the supplemental program it was determined that the two groups had very different responses to the bonus offer the 115week reduction in ui benefit receipt was the product of 178week reduction among fsceligibles and 071week reduction among fsc ineligibles the response of the latter group more closely resembles the results from the washington and pennsylvania experiments which suggests that the illinois results overstate the reduction in unemployment 23 unless otherwise indicated this section was derived from stephen woodbury and robert g spiegelman bonuses to workers

states regular ui programs24 relatively more individuals assigned to the treatment group than to the control group exited the ui rolls during the qualification period and relatively fewer treatment than control group members exhausted their benefits as in the pennsylvania and washington experiments the comparatively faster reemployment of treatment group members in illinois was not accompanied by lower earnings it was estimated that the experiment conferred large net benefits from the perspective of the ui system this outcome greatly differs from those of the washington and pennsylvania experiments the discrepancy was due to the much larger reduction in weeks of ui receipt found in illinois as noted above however when illinois treatment group is made more comparable to the other two states by limiting its claimants to those in the regular ui program the decrease in duration of ui receipt more nearly matches the experience in washington and pennsylvania
