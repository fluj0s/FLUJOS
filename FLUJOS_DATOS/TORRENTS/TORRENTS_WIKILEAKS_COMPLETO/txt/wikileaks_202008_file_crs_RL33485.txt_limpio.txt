worldwide on each day of 2007 some 1000 children worldwide became newly infected with hiv due in large part to little access to drugs that prevent the transmission of hiv from mother to child an

to who each year there are about 300 million acute malaria cases5 which cause more than one million deaths annually in 2004 the disease killed about 2 million people health experts believe that between 85 and 90 of malaria deaths occur in africa mostly among children6 killing an african child every 30 seconds7 3 tuberculosis is contagious disease that is spread like the common cold through the air only people who are sick with tb in their lungs are infectious when infectious people cough sneeze talk or spit they propel tb germs known as bacilli into the air person needs only to inhale small number of these to be infected left untreated each person with active tb disease will infect an average of between 10 and 15 people every year however people infected with tb bacilli will not necessarily become sick with the disease the immune system walls off the tb bacilli which protected by thick waxy coat can lie dormant for years when someones immune system is weakened the chances of becoming sick are greater for more information see who tuberculosis fact sheet march 2007 at httpwwwwhointmediacentrefactsheetsfs104en visited on december 3 2007 4 who global tuberculosis control

large part for the extremely high malarial mortality in the region people contract malaria through bites from infected mosquitos an infected mosquito spreads the malaria parasite through the blood stream once in the blood stream the malaria parasite can evade the immune system and infect the liver and red blood cells mosquitos can also contract malaria if they ingest blood from an infected
