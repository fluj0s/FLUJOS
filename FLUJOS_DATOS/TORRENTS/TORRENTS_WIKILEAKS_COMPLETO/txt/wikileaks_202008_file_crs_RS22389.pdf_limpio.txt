crs report rs22917 the lowincome housing tax cr edit program the fixed subsidy and variable rate by mark p keightley overview the lihtc was created by the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 to provide an incentive for the acquisition excluding land and development or the rehabilitation of affordable rental housing these federal housin g tax credits are awarded to developers of qualified projects sponsors or developers of real tate projects apply to the corresponding state housing finance authority for lihtc allocations for their projects developers either use the credits or sell them to investors to raise capital or equity for real estate projects the tax benefit reduces the debt andor equity that the developer would otherwise have to incur with wer financing costs tax credit properties can potentially offer lower mo re affordable rents the lihtc was originally designed to liver 10year subsidy equal to 30 or 70 of projects cost dependent on the nature of project rehabilitation and federally subsidized construction is intended to receive the 30 subsidy whereas new construction is supposed to receive the 70 subsidy over time the annual credit rate that has delivered the 30 rehabilitation construction subsidy has approximately equaled 4 of the projects qualified basis although the rate has fallen as low as 3331 at the same time the annual credit rate implied by the 70 new construction subsidy has approximately equale d 9 with range of 789 to 9272 the method used to determine the actual credit rate project recei ves depends in part on the prevailing market interest rate at the time the project is comple ted because the market interest rate changes monthly so do the lihtc rates3 the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 hera pl 110289 changed the method used to determine the credit ra for new construction projects completed before 2014 under the new law the credit ra assigned to new construction will not be less than 9 if the interest rate that prevails at the time project is completed is such that the credit rate as determined under the prev ious method is greater than 9 then the project will receive the higher rate on the ot her hand if the market interest rate is such that the lihtc rate is less than 9 then the project will be assigned credit rate of exactly 9 hera made changes to the credit rate that rehabilitation and federally subsidized construction projects receive the allocation process the process of allocating awarding and then claiming the lihtc is complex and lengthy the process begins at

bond proceeds5 tax credits that are not allocated by states are added to national pool and then redistributed to those st ates that apply for the excess credits to be eligible for an excess credit llocation state must have allocated its entire previous allotment of tax credits state allocation to developers state housing finance agencies hfas allocate credits to developers of rental hous ing according to federally required but state created qualified allocation plans qaps federal law requires that the qap give priority to projects that serve the lowest income households and that remain affordable for the longest period of time many states have two allocation periods per year developers apply for the credits by proposing plans to state agenci on average one project out of five may receive an allocation of tax credits developers of housing projects compete for tax credits as part of the financing for the real estate development by submitting pr oposals to the hfa types of

an incentive to developers to invest in more distressed areas areas where the need is greatest for affordable housing but which can be the most difficult to develop8 in these distressed areas the lihtc can be claimed for 130 instead of the normal 100 of the projects total cost excluding land costs this also means that available credits can be increased by up to 30 pl 110289 allows an hfa to classify any building it sees fit as difficult to develop and hence eligible for the enhanced credit developers and investors upon receipt of lihtc allocation developers typically exchange the tax credits for equity forprofit developers can either retain tax credits as financing for projects or sell them nonprofit develope rs sell tax credits taxpayers claiming the tax credits are usually real estate investors not developers the tax credits cannot be claimed until the real tate development is complete and operable this means that more than year or two could pass between the time of the tax credit allocation and the time the credit is claimed if for example project were completed in june of 2008 depending on the filing peri od of the investor the tax credits may not begin to be claimed until some time in 2009 trading tax credits or selling them refers to the process of exchanging tax credits for equity investment in real estate project s developers recru it investors to provide equity to fund development projects and offer the tax cr edits to those investors in exchange for their commitment when credits are sold the sale is usually structured with limited partnership between the developer and the investor and sometimes administered by syndicators who must adhere to th complex provisions of the tax code9 as the general partner the developer has very small ownership

lihtc upon the introduction of the lihtc in 1986 public partne rships were the primary source of equity investment in tax credit projects but d iminished profit margins have driven some syndicators out of the retail i nvestment market although th ere are individual tax credit investors in recent years the vast majority of investors have come from corporations either investing directly or through private partnerships10 neither individuals nor corporations can claim the lihtc against the alternative minimum tax different types of investors have different motivations for investing in tax credits an estimated 43 of investors are subject to the community reinvestment act cra and investment in lihtcs is favorably c onsidered under the investment test component of the cra11 other investors include real estate insurance utility and manufacturing firms many of which list the rate of retu rn on investment as their primary purpose for investing in tax credits tax sheltering is the secondmost highly ranked purpose for investing12 the lihtc finances part of the total cost of many projects rather than the full cost and as result must be combined with othe r resources the financial resources that may be used in conjunction with the lihtc incl ude conventional mortga ge loans provided by private lenders and alternative financing and grants from public or private sources individual states provide financin g as well some of which may be in the form of state tax credits modeled after the fe deral provision additionally some lihtc projects may have tenants who receive
