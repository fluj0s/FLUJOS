with department of defense dod and congressional mandates is to produce new longrange strike aircraft to be operational by 2018 air force plans fo r acquiring new bomber aircraft have been accelerated by about 20 years from earlie r projections because of combination of the air forces desire to retire tion of its b52 fleet and dods perception of developing bomber capability gap defense analysts have estimated that it will cost between 8 billion and 10 billion to develop new bomber using current or soontomature technologies the air force expects the 2018 bomber to serve as an interim fix to bridge bomber capability gap allow it to retire portion of the current bomber fleet and position itself for development of followon bomber with more advanced technologies such as hypersonic faster than mach 5 drive engines while the air force has yet to release formal bomber request for proposal defense and industry experts expect the 2018 bomber program to call for the acquisition of around 100 stealthy bomber aircraft capab of highsubsonic flight and delivery of both nuclear and conventional munitions it remains to be seen if portion of the next generation 2018 bomber fleet w ill be designed to be unm anned both congressional and dod mandates however point in the di rection of at least portion of the planned new fleet being unmanned the air force has not finalized the requirements for the 2018 bomber and has called for flyoff between potential ai rcraft in the 2010 timeframe boeing and lockheed martin have already teamed up and are working to develop bomber design for consideration northrop gr umman the only other potential competitor may also join in the competition given its experience with the b2 and ongoing work on the navys new unma nned strike aircraft

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34406the next generation bomber background oversight issues and options for congress introduction the 2006 quadrennial defense review qdr began laying the groundwo rk for the development of new longrange strike platform to either replace or augment the current fleet of 180 longrang heavy bomber assets b1s b2s and b52s prior to the 2006 qdr the air force had indicated that its current bomber fleet would suffice until 2037 when advanced technologies such as hypersoni c cruise vehicles would potentially reach maturity and be incorporated into followon bomber aircraft the office of the secretary of defense osd responding to the air forces desire to retire 38 b52hs and concerned about the air forces ability to successfully execute longrange bombing missions in the future accelerated air force plans for fielding new aircraft by almost 20 years to 2018 the 2007 national defense authoriza tion act pl 109364 120 stat 2111 sec 131 acknowledging osd and air force desires to retire portion of the b52 fleet mandated the fielding of new l ongrange strike platform by 2018 before additional reductions to the current b52 fl eet would be allowed current air force plans call for fielding new bomber by 2018 but many outside the air force have noted that current funding and program velopment appear to be behind schedule for meeting the 2018 mandate there is currently consensus within dod or among military analysts on the capabilities needed in next generation bomber or even whether an interim bomber is needed this lack of consensu s and direction has cau sed some to speculate that the air force is not supporting an interim bomber devel opment program because it might threaten the acquisition of more advanced system in the late 2030s in addition the air force has host of other acquisition programs that will compete for limited dollars during the same timeframe during its oversight hearings and re view of budget requests congress will assess the need for potential interim longrange strike capability and review what force structure funding adjustments would be needed to bring the acquisition program to fruition in the 2018 timeframehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34406crs2 1 for more on the prompt global strike mission and status see crs report rl33067 conventional warheads for longrange ballistic missiles backgr ound and

longrange strike lrs prompt global strike on the one hand is us strategic commands effort to strike any target globally in matter of minutes or hours1 there are number of options currently being analyzed ranging from longrange missiles to spacebase d assets to meet the respons timing goals of prompt global strike longrange strike on the othe r is the usaf air combat commands current efforts to field an air breathing bombe rstrike aircraft in 2006 there was push within osds program analysis and evaluation office to combine the two efforts but osd eventually determined that lrs and pgs analyses would remain separate with separate sets of requirements general moseley the air force chief of staff noted that longrange strike is about persistent survivable penetrating capability with significant weapons load s bomberlike aircraft while prompt global strike could be achie ved with very fast sta ndoff weapons missiles2 this report focuses only on the potential evolu tion of new bomber aircraft to meet dods goals for longrange strike by 2018 defining long range there is consensus definition for th term long range further some studies confuse the terms range and comb at radius treating them as synonymous the following definitions will be used for range and combat radius3 range the distance an unrefueled aircraft can fly or is permitted to fly with specified load oneway flight radius the approximate distance an unrefueled aircraft can fly from base and return without interm ediate landing out and back to the point of origin it should be noted that most studies re ferenced in this report use the term range to define what would be mo re appropriately called combat radius outandback distanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34406crs3 4 us congressional budget office alternatives for longr ange ground attack systems by robie samanta roy and david arthur march 2006 summary p x 5 the b58 and fb111 are examples of medium rangeregional bomber aircraft 6 maximum loiter time is based on flying at an airspeed and aircraft configuration that will allow the maximum time over target area before having to return to base otherwise known as maximum endurancewhile number of studies use various di stances to differentiate medium from longrange this report uses the congre ssional budget offices cbo unrefueled distance milestones as delineation of distance categories4 mediumrange range 30005000 nautical miles nm radius 15002500 nautical miles nm longrange range 5000 nautical miles nm or more radius 2500 nautical miles nm or more there is however drawback to adhering too closely to this yardstick while most would agree that b1s and b2s ar longrange platforms cbo noted in this study that the b1b bomber has an unref ueled full combat payload combat radius of 1800 nm while the b2s combat radius is 2000 nm using these numbers would result in both of these aircraft being labeled as medium range or regional bombers5 however the usaf bomber cept of operations assumes aerial refueling which moves the bombers back up to longrange indeed with aerial refueling the b2 flew against targets in serbia taking off and recovering at whiteman afb in missouri adding to the difficulty of defining nd comparing rangeradius values is that these values are highly dependent on th conditions in which they are measured altitude of flight aircraft configuration etc aircra ft loaded to maximum weight or having external weapons hung on th wings or fuselage will have shorter rangeradius than lighter aircraft flying in clean configuration external weapons these caveats need to be ta ken into consideration when comparing aircraft capabilities while aerial refueling gives current and future weapon systems range only limited by crew endurance unref ueled range is still an impor tant variable the real value in unrefueled range is the bombers ability to reach deep into an adversarys interior safely strike high value targets without the n eed for support aircraft such as tankers and fighters and return to base outside the reach of the enemy if travel distance to the target is not factor longer unrefueled rangeradius translates to longer loiter time6 over target area without the need for aerial refueling support current bomber fleet currently the usaf has 181 bomber aircra ft in it inventory of b52hs b1s and b2s the following table pr

almost every military campaign since joining the active force in 1955 the b52 however suffe rs from number of agerelated issues that may cause some to question its future viability as an effective and survivable weapon system structurally the service life of the b52 was examined and extended in 2007 from 32000 flight hours to maximum of 39000 flight hours8 this service life extension should carry

intercon tinental range the air force hoped to procure sufficient number to replace the b52 fleet14 initially osd was skeptical about the b1 program given the backdr op of an evolving surfacetoair missile sam threat and enhancements to the united states intercontinental strategic missile systems as alternativ to manned bombers in addition events such as the shootdown of u2 over russia and the hi gh development and operational costs of supersonic aircraft at the time led to the cancellation of the mach 3 xb70 bomber and early retirement of the mach 2 b58 midrange bomber the carter administration terminated the b1 program in 1977 in favor of fielding airlaunched cruise missiles on the b52 but the reagan administration resurrected it in 1981 as part of its defense buildup program the new program the b1b reached operational status in october 1986 one hundred b1bs were built and delivered to the air force between 1985 and 1988 t oday 67 b1bs are still operational the b1b was

processing systems based on the intel 286 processor are limited in their ability to be upgraded to interoperate with other dod systems this limitation makes realtime mission changes more difficult in comparison to more modern aircraft like the f22 or f35 the b2s current processing capabilities also limit the aircrafts ability to incorporate the latest enhancements sensors that would enhance its

fleet by an additional 20 bombers it goes against the 2008 ndaa guidance to keep b52 force structure of 76 aircraft issues for the air force the need for new bomber by 2018 the air force has acknowledged its need for new longrange strike system given expected advances in air defense systems the issue will be whether the air force can afford new bomber or will have to sustain and improve the bombers it currently has the overall average age of the current bomber fleet is 309 years and will reach over 40 years at best case before new bomber will take to the air there is considerable debate whethe r new bomber is needed or can be delivered to the air force by the 2018 mandate the current fleet of longrange bombers is structurally sound and should be available to fly we ll into the 2030s and 2040s barring any unforseen major structural issue36 as recently at 2007 the air force extended the b52s and b1s service lives while the b 2s service life was last analyzed in 2004 more of an issue however is the current bomber fleets viability in medium or highthreat environment during recent longrange strike assessment seminar hosted by the center for strategic and inte rnational studies csi s one participant noted that the bomber fleet will be largely relegated to standoff engagements because the threat of double digit advanced surfacetoair missiles fighters and next generation integrated air defense systems will be too difficult to penetrate37 the latest air force bomber white paper simply states that the b1 and b52 are not survivable under the 20152020 ex pected threat picture38 the air force believes that anticipated advances in defensive systems will leave only 21 now 20 b2s with the capability to penetrate and survive in highthreat environment however some analysts have noted th at advocacy from the relevant combatant commands particularly st rategic command and pacific command seems weak and ambivalent39 another analyst noted that the ai r force has

bomber is expected to fill is the focus of the interim bomber going to be lowerend missions such as close air support for ground forces engaged in i rregular warfare or highend missions penetrating deep into peer adversarys heavily defended territory one analyst following the longrange strike seminar s at csis questioned whether bomber focused more on the lowend threats would even qualify as next generation bomber because it would reduce the need for revolutionary capabilities required for survival in higherthreat environment42 in addition the air force will most likel need to reexamine

actually along in its efforts to field new bomber airc raft then commander of air combat command general ronald keys stated in 2006 that he felt the new bomber program would start out as black meaning number of the capabilities of potential new aircraft would be kept classified53 besides potentially limiting programs scrutiny and oversight black programs have been known to st reamline the acquisiti on process and allow fielding of new weapons system without the typical hurdles of their unclassified counterparts many point to the f117 st ealth fighter as successful acquisition program because the program remained cla ssified however some have noted that when the b2 went from black to white unclassified the sticker shock undermined pport even among defense supporters that would normally be allies54 while it is possible that the air force is farther along in development of the next generation bomber than is publically know n number of defense analysts are concerned that keeping the program classi fied will in the end undermine its political support55 2018 bomber capabilities there has been tremendous amount of discussion and debate about what capabilities should be included in the next bomber industry and the air force are currently weighing tradeoffs between speed and persistence range and weapons load and manned versus unmanned f light although it has yet to precisely define the requirements for the 2018 bomber the ai r force has identified nine desired capabilities of new longrange strike system56 responsive strike remote targ ets quickly hours to minutes

observable im proved stealth technology manned cockpit nuclearcapable technology reaching maturity by 2009 demonstration flight by 2011 speed versus persistence most analysts agree that one of the major tradeoffs the air force might have to make to meet the 2018 mandate is the speed of the aircraft while dod is pursuing the development of hypersonic engines capable of accelerating an aircraft beyond m ach 5 they are unlikely to be ready for 2018 bomber further there is an obs ervability penalty that stealth design incurs at speeds above mach 2 the air force would need to develop new types of radarabsorbing materials to operate at higher airspeeds in addition dod will need to overcome manufacturing issues in creating an affordable ramjet engine for hypersonic speeds dod however is poised to unveil new program called blackswift the blackswift program will be the followon to the defense advanced research projects agencys darpa falcon force application and launch from the continental united stat falcons goal was to develop vehicle capable of delivering 12000 lb of payload across distance of 9000 nautical miles in less than two hours58 consequently blackswift and other programs like it addresses more the issue of prompt rather than persistence on the other hand the air force will likely be able to develop an aircraft with speed below mach 2 by 2018 initially both lockheed martin and northrop grumman expressed interest in offering designs with at least supersonic dash capability short duration flight above mach 1 as with all design features there will be tradeoff in range payload or airc raft size in order to support higher than mach 1 speeds currently it appears that th need for range and persistence relying on stealth for increased survivability is driving highsubsonic speed requirement not to mention the added cost of higher than mach 1 travel george muellner president of boeings advanced systems noted the materials used for

13 reduction get stressed bove mach 2 and you have to get much faster if you are going to rely only on speed to survive59 one final note on the concept of persiste nce persistence can be achieved number of ways in addition persistence c ould mean different things in different operational environments normally one equates long loiter time to persistence and this concept is wellsuited for today s operations supporting troops on the ground however one might argue that the air force need is for weapons system that is able to attack targets deep in enemy rritory over continuous period persistence in this case might focus more on persistent intelligence and an ability to strike promptly ones view of persistence could alter the quantities needed of the next generation bomber it would be difficult to replicate the operational construct of northern and southern watch over iraq during the 1990s in which numerous fighter aircraft flew watch over the region with only handful of bombers it is not that anyone is expecting the next generation bomber to be procured in numbers capable of supporting roundthe clock coverage over large landmass however one must take into consideration the impacts on persistence if the buy profile is too small dual role conventionalnuclear capability with the b1 removed from the nuclear mission in the 1990s the bomber portion of the nuclear triad consists of 76 b52s and 20 b1s while the b52 currently has service life well into the 2030s the air force has been tryi ng to retire the venerable bomber for number of years both the b1 and b 2 initially were conceived as replacement platforms for the b52 if the air fo rce were to retire the b52 without replacement aircraft designed to assume its nuclear delivery role the strategic portion of the bomber fleet would then resi in 20 b2 aircraft some defense analysts point to this issue as the key reason why the next generation bomber needs to be nuclearcapable those supporting th need for new nuclear bomber also see it serving in counterprolif eration role one analyst noted that an airbreathing longrange strike system will be more cred ible in terms of deterring countries such as iran than the threat of intercontinental ballistic missiles60 however others have argued that making the next bomber dualcapable decreases the likelihood of it actually be ing fielded opponents of new nuclear bomber note that protecting th aircraft against electromagnetic pulses emp is very expensive proposition and could increas the cost of the bomber by up to 25 3061 the costs to harden the next generation bomber against emp will depend on the degree of hardening the designers deem necessary while some have noted that some level of empha rdening will be necessary the ability to operate in an environment in which multiple nuclear detonations have occurred could greatly increase costs moreover c ountries such as china could view new us penetration nuclear bomber as threaten ing and respond

bomber fleet should remain structurally sound until the 2030s or 2040s however the viability of the b1 and b52 as effective weapons syst ems coupled with the air forces desire to retire 38 b52s prompted dods 2018 manda many have questioned the air forces efforts towards fielding new bomber while facing the challenge of recapitalizing numerous other aircraft63 further the timeline is going to

experienced significant cost growth and schedule slippage it remains to be seen whether the joint strike fighter will suffer the same fate it currently appears that the initial planned acquisition program for the next generation 2018 bombe r will be about 100 aircraft program development delays or additional costs resulting from changing requirements could drive corresponding increase in unit cost for the ne w bomber this in turn could result in decreased buy and repeat of the acquisition difficulties previous aircraft programs have encountered what also remains to be seen is whether the air force will establish firm set of requirements for the bomber and avoid adding technological advances to the program during its development if ther is potential for future 2037 bomber to be delayed or abandoned complete ly the air force may feel pressure to enhance the 2018 bomber as much as possible creating final solution instead of the planned interim fix some have noted that the air force

aircraft it has been over 20 years since the last bomber aircraft the b2 was in development one must add another 20 years to capture the developmental period for the b1 bomber in its initial form

advances in one program such as the f22 and f35 can be applied to another to reduce co sts the rand corporation however noted that expertise at designing and developi ng complex aircraft systems comes only from the direct experience of design ing and developing such systems70 while rand notes some interchangeability of ex perience across military aircraft types there is great potential for developmenta l problems stemming from lack of recent bomber design experience this potential for development difficulties will only increase as time passes before the next concerted effort to build followon bomber aircraft the results of the competition am ong the primary industrial leaders for the 2018 bomber will most likely have prof ound effect on the competition for the 2037 bomber issues for congress how many bombers do the air force need defense analysts and industry are anticip ating an air force acquisition program of about 100 aircraft it is unknown how ma ny b52s and b1s the air force would retain if and when it fields next ge neration bomber the number of bombers procured with this program will be depende nt on the viability of the remaining legacy fleet the cost of the new bomber and the timeframe in which the air force could be expected to field followon to the 2018 bomber again the procurement objective will depend on whether one views this program as an interim fix or final solution advances in the prompt global strike ar ea of analysis could also have an impact on the required bomber numbers missile dvances could increase the longevity ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34406crs21 the current fleet by allowing those bombers to remain out side the range of potential threats finally aircraft procurement numbers could depend on the current debate between longrange and shortrange attack aircraft deep cuts in the joint strike fighter program could generate an incr ease in requirements for advanced bomber aircraft when will the air force need these bombers while the air force has agreed to veloping and fielding new bomber by 2018 this date appears to have been di ctated to the air force from osd and congress the need for new bomber is dependent on where and how conflicts between 2015 and 2040 will be fought if one views conflict in the far east as either most likely or most dangerous the need for this bomber increases if one feels future conflicts will be simila r to ones currently being conduc ted in iraq and afghanistan basically over uncontested airspace then there is potential for the air force to delay its fielding of new bomber while keeping up with modernization efforts of its current fleet what capabilities s hould these bombers possess the technologies the air force truly want s in its future bomber aircraft will not have matured in time for incorporation in 2018 bomber number of industry representatives and defense analysts note that stealth will be needed to allow operations in highthreat environments if hypersonic speeds are unattainable while combination of speed and stealth should have an exponential effect on survivability it appears that they cannot both be available in an affordable 2018 bomber therefore it currently appears that speed above mach 1 and below mach 2 will be driven more by cost and payl oad tradeoffs and not by industry limitations another issue that will most likely be debated is the need for the bomber portion of the nuclear triad if the next generation bomber is touted as replacement for the b52 then one would assume then that it needs to be nuclearcapable also if one agrees with the direction of the 2002 nu clear posture review and apparent emphasizingof the nuclear triad then one might conclude that the next generation bomber need not be nuclearcapable geopolitical issues such as the potential for nuclear iran will play role in this decision process should the next generation bomber be unmanned or optionally manned current congressional direction will drive the air force to make at least portion of the new bomber fleet unmanne d or optionally manned optionally manning the bomber that is having seat for pilot when needed will most likely increase the cost of the new bomber additional factors will be whether there will be need for one or two pilots again the decision on whether the aircraft will be nuclearcapable because of nuclear w

rstated given dods other ground attack capabilities and the unified commanders in chief plans for using bombers90 gao agreed with dods desire not to proc ure additional b2s but felt reduction or elimination of the b1 fleet was warranted with minimal risk91 1997 quadrennial defense review dods 1997 quadrennial defense review qdr the first followup to the bottomup review of 1993 produced major

would help the united states in the initial halt phase early in an operation it was not costeffective to pr ocure additional b2s in light of other pressing needs93 congressionally ma ndated

notes that the longrange bomber fleet is ideally suited to the demands of the new security environment and that longrange air power will be more important than ever in the decades ahead95 simply put the scowcrofts independe nt bomber force reviews analysis concluded that current plans for the longrange air power force we re woefully deficient and at minimum called for congress to fund at least

paper are 16 aircraft less than the 112 combatcoded aircraft noted in the 2001 qdr the air force noted that savings from the retirement of the b1s would be reinvested in the remaining b1s in addition the air force reiterate d that it is far more cost effective to upgrade current bombers than it is to procure new aircraft101 finally the 2001 white paper noted the service life conclusions about the current fleet may longer be valid because of operational and force structure changes102 noting that b52s longer fly regularly at lowlevel and that bombe r fleet reductions would provi funding for fleetwide improvements the 2001 white paper might lead some to conclude that requiring bomber by 2037 is premature the 2002 nucl ear posture review while echoing the requirement for 76 b52s and 21 b2s
