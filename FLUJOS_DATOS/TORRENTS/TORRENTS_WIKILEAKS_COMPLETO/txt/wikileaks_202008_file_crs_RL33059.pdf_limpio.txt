should not in replying to committee questioning signal how they might rule on case that could come before them on the court such constraint on the part of nominees appears called for by judici ethics

questions that are reasonably calculated to elicit meaningful responses the questioning process can and has provided useful insights into the general thinking of nominees on important constitutional

constitutional concern and pursue those concerns with nominees with the hope that once confirmed the new justices will remember the importance of the core values urged on them by the senators or at least feel bound by th assurance they gave during their hearingshistorical background in 1955 hearings on the supreme court nomination of john m harlan marked the beginning of practice continuing to the present of each court nominee testifying before the senate judiciary committee the principal business of these hearings is the questioning of the nominee by committee members with the committee thereafter also hearing the testim ony of other public witnesses speaking either in favor of or in opposition to th nominees confirmation the subject areas covered by those questions have often included the nom inees legal qualifications private backgrounds and earlier actions as public figures other questions have focused on social and political issues th constitution particular court rulings current constitutional controve rsies constitutional values judicial philosophy and the analytical approach nominee might use in deciding issues and cases for members of the judiciary committee questioning of the nominee may serve various purposes for senators who ar undecided about the nominee the hearings may shed light on the nominees professional qualifications temperament and character and hence on how th ey should vote on confirmation2 other senators as the hearings begin may already be reasona bly certain about voting to confirm the nominee yet also remain reasonably open to counterevidence and thus use the hearings to pursue line of questioning designed to probe the validity of this initial favorable predisposition3 still others however may come to the hearings having already decided how they will vote on the nomination and accordingly use their questioning of the nominee to try t secure or defeat the nomination4 for some senators the hearings may be vehicle through which to impress certain values or concerns upon the nominee in the hope of in fluencing how he or she might approach issues later as justice5 the hearings also may represent to some senators an opportunity to draw the publics attention to certain issues to advocate their policy preferences or to associate themselves w ith concern about certain problems last but certainly not least senators may hope to glean from the nomin ees responseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33059crs3 6 watson and stookey shaping america p 155 7 illustrative of such concern was the fo llowing statement by

justice or lower court judge all senators one news analysis has generalized agree that nominees should not signal how they might rule on cas that could come before them on the court11 such agreement it can be assume d is founded in large part on judicial ethics canons most notably canon 5a3d ii of the american bar associations model code of judicial conduct this canon provides that judge or judicial candidate shall not with respect to cases controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court make pledges promises or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of the office further senators on the judiciary committee as well as the nominee would be aware that comment by the latter about pending case at the confirmation

some may be sympathetic and consider nominees refusal to discuss certain matters as of relevance to his or her fitn ess for appointment others however may consider the nominees views on certain subjects as important to assessing the nominees fitness and hence regard unresponsiveness to questi ons on these subjects as sufficient reason to vote against confirmation13 protracted questioning occurring over several days of hearings is likely especially if the nominee is relatively controversial or is perceived by committee members to be evasiv or insincere in responding to certain

roberts refused to answ er questions seeking his views on particular supreme court decisions or asking him to single out particular supreme court rulings with which he might disagree series of questions for example asked roberts what is your position on roe v wade 16 the 1973 supreme court decision that found in the constitution right of privacy protecting womans decision to terminate pregnancy at one point and consistent with his replies to similar questions regarding the abortion issue roberts replied that roe v wade is the settled law of the land ther nothing in my personal views that could prevent from fully and faithfully applying that precedent17 prior to the hearings committee members written question had asked roberts to identify three supreme court cases that had not been reversed with which he disagreed roberts declined to res pond citing for support the remark of the late washington dc attorney lloyd cutler th at judicial candidates should decline to reply when efforts are made to find out how they would decide particular case18 roberts elaborated on this position at the hearings maintaining that judge ruth bader ginsburg at the 1993 hearings on her supreme court nomination on numerous occasions said it would not be proper for her to comment on particular supreme court precedents19 later in the hearings in similar vein roberts replied to senator with respect senator youre getting back to the area of asking to criticize particular supreme court precedents justice ginsburg thought that was inappropriate because it would be harmful to the supreme court i think its inappropriate because it would be harmful to the independence and integrity of the federal judiciary the reason i think key to the independence and strength of the federal judiciary is that judges come to the cases before them unencumbered by prior commitments beyond the commitment to apply the rule of law and the oath that they take i think that is essential and if you

chairman of the judiciary committee provided an overview in newspaper oped piece21 of the kinds of questions he anticipated would be asked of john r oberts at his confirmation hearings in september in this battle the central issue remains roe v wade which established womans right to choose both sides are looking for assurances that judge roberts will side with them some senators have stated their intention to directly ask the nominee if he would overrule roe v wade while senators may ask any question they choose the nominee may answer or not as he sees fit the confirmation precedents forcefully support the propriety of nominee declining to spell out how he or she would rule on specific case abraham lincoln is reputed to have said pretty much the same thing we cannot ask man what he will do and if we should and he should answer us we would despise him therefore we must take man whose opinions are known this of course does not foreclose pr obing inquiries on the nominees general views on jurisprudence for example it would be appropriate to ask how to weigh the importance of precedent in deciding whether to overrule supreme court decision some legal scholars attach special significance to what they call superprecedents which are decisions like roe v wade that have been reaffirmed in later cases beyond the range of social issues the hearings for judge roberts will doubtless focus on other key matters like first amendment rights presidential authority congressional power under the constitutions commerce clause judicial restraint civil rights environmental law eminent domain and the rights of defendants in criminal cases while praising judge roberts for his outstanding character and admirable record of achievement which senator specter said had disarmed

vote for robertss confirmation28 advocates that judge roberts should express his views on court rulings or constitutional issues have rejected the notion that to do so would be prejudging or making commitment as to how he would vote if the issues or rulings came up before the court in the future in newspaper oped piece29 for example walter dellinger law professor and former acting solicitor general in the clinton administration characterized as unpersua sive the standard objections to asking supreme court nominee directly what he or she thinks about contentious social and legal issues explaining it is said for example that judge should be openminded and that it is inconsistent with the obligation to answer question such as whether roe v wade was rightly decided but having views doesnt preclude an open mind nor does hiding your views make them go away why would it be inappropriate to know as much about robertss views on controversial legal issues as we know about justice john paul stevenss views what is wrong with asking nominee whether he or she agrees with justice antonin scalias dissenting opinion in planned parenthood v casey when we know that scalia agrees with it and scalia will be able to take part in future related cases without anyone suggesting that to be problem there are legitimate concerns that should make some questions off limits such as question about an actual case coming before the court more generally nominees should answer questions about pa st cases and not future ones and everyone involved in the process should make clear that by answering

demands of some senato rs that supreme court nominee roberts announce his positions on constitutional questi ons that he may decide as judge after he is confirmed th demands the statement stated were improper for the following reasons making such demands threatens to radically politicize the confirmation process turning judicial nominees into mere candidates who must make political promises in order to be confirmed judicial nominee should be co mpelled to answer any question that would force him or her to pr ejudge or signal future conclusions regarding any case or issue any demand that

seeking any express or implied assurances concerning your position on such case issue or questionsenator schumer of new york provided to judge roberts earlier in advance of the confirmation hearings senator cornyn said any of our colleagues can of course ask whatever questions they want but the notion that judge roberts puts his confirma tion at risk if he does not answer the questions on the list from the senator from new york is contrary to the traditional practice of this body nearly every single one of the questions on that list involves an issue that is likely to come before the supreme court during justice robertss tenure every single justice confirmed in recent memory has declined to answer questions of the sort contained on that list33 joining this side of the debate legal commentator has criticized pressuring nominees to answer long lists of questions this he maintains poses five grave dangers to judicial integrity and independence first candor could be fatal second nominees like politicians making campaign promises would be powerfully tempted to misrepresent their inner thoughts third this dynamic would favo r people of malleable integrity fourth once on the court they would feel pressu re to conform to the insincere views expressed in their testimony34 worst in the commentators view exp ectations of demands of full disclosure from senators would encourage judicial candidates to make secret commitments to the white house in order to be nominated in contrast to the understood white house practice of avoiding asking potential nomin ees questions about their views on current constitutional controversies35 conclusion when the senate judiciary committee begins its confirmation hearings for supreme court nominee john roberts set for september 6 2005 substantive issue likely will be the proper scope of questi ons for committee member s to pose to the nominee recurring interest underlying the questions of many senators at the hearings likely will be to shed light on how the nominee if confirmed might as the newest of the courts nine justices aff ect the philosophical balance of the court and the future direction of its

objectives as prospective supreme cour t justice the nominees objectives at such points might be pragmatic in na ture for instance to provide responses calculated not to offend committee members andor principled and constitutionally based for instance to take care that answers not call into question his integrity his ability in the future to judge cases impartially and his commitment to the ideal of judicial independence the nominee for his part it can be argued may want to temper his understandable inclination to be reticent about divulging personal views concerning current legal and constitutional issues with an appreciation that many of the committees members will be seeking to use th hearings to reach important insights about the nominee insights not only about the s oundness of his professional qualifications but also about what special presence or in fluence he will bring to the court if confirmed
