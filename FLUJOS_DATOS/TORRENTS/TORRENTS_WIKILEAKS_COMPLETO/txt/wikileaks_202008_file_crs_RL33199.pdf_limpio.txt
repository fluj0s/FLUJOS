security breaches are being reported with increasing regularity during the past few years there have been numerous examples of hackers breaking into corporate government academic and personal computers and compromising computer systems or stealin g personal data such as so cial security bank account credit card and drivers license numbers as well as medical and student records these breaches occur not onl because of illegal or fraudulent attacks by computer hackers but often because of careless busine ss practices such as lost or stolen laptop computers or the inadvertent posting of personal data on public websites recent infamous example occurred in may 2006 when 265 million veterans and their spouses were in danger of identity theft b ecause veterans affa irs data analyst took home laptop computer contai ning personal data includi ng names social security numbers and dates of birth whic h was later stolen in burglary1 depending on the definition the most co mmon type of identity theft is credit card fraud and there is evidence that the ex tent of credit card fraud has increased due to opportunities provided by the internet2 although some aspects of identity theft have been known for many years it is vi ewed now primarily as product of the information age particular crime of identity theft may include one or all of these stages stage 1 acquisition of the identity through theft computer hacking fraud trickery force redirecting or intercepting mail or even by legal means eg purchase information on the internet stage 2 use of the identity for financial gain the most common motivation or to avoid arrest or otherwise hide ones identity from law enforcement or other authorities suc h as bill collectors crimes in this stage may include account takeover

surance fraud stealing rental cars and many more stage 3 discovery of the theft while many misuses of credit cards are discovered quickly the classic iden tity theft involves long period of time to discovery typically from six months to as long as several years evidence suggests that the time it takes to discovery is related to the amount of loss incurred by the victim3 identity theft is rarely one crime but is composed of the commission of wide variety of other crimes such as check and card fraud financ ial crimes of various sorts various telemarketing and internet s cams auto theft counterfeiting and forgery etc the difficulty in studying identity theft is investigating what portion of the long list of identity theft related crimes is related to the classic type of identity theft that results in repeat victimization for exam ple common type of credit card fraud is to steal an individuals credit card the offender makes quick purchase of an expensive item then discards the card has the victims identity truly been stolen the event clearly fits within the definiti on above but it is not the wholesale theft of the victims identity however should th offender be working with an accomplice the card could be turned over several times and even sold on the street finally should the victims drivers license and othe r identifying documents such as health card with social

article discussing this landmark and questioned the usefulness of computing such data breaches the bigger picture here may be that we are now slicing and dicing the niceties of data breaches against running tally so large that it has lost nearly any meaning at all the threat of iden tity theft from data losses is being greatly exaggerated fred h cate the director of the center for applied cybersecurity research at indiana university in bloom ington told this newspaper not long ago and thats because lot of people have fa llen into the trap of equating data loss with identity theft whether or not that is true is open to debate but what all this data loss does represent however is the potential for identity theft one that will never go away sure its game of odds there is only so much crook can do with few hundred thousand name s and social security numbers but once they are out there they are out there for good names dont change neither do social security numbers or date s of
