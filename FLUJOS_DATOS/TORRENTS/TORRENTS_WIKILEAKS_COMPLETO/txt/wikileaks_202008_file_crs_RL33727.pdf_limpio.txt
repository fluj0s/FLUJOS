rights implementation act of 2006 passed the house in september 2006 and may if the senate acts move forward during the 2006 lameduck session the bill combines process and substance the process provisions would ease or eliminate four current hurdles to federal takings or substantive due process claim being adjudicated in federal court on the merits in those cases where government interference with property righ ts is alleged those hurdles are abstention the takings ripeness requirements that the plaintiff mu st first obtain final decision from the landuse control agency and exhaust state court remedies and cer tification of state law questions to the state courts the b ill does not affect the property owners access to state courts which are also available to vindicate such claims the bills limitations on federal court abstention would allow the plaintiff to preclude abstention by not including any cl aim of state law violation the bills elimination of the current state exhaustion prerequisite for ripe takings claim may well be beyond congresss aut hority if as sound argument suggests that prerequisite is constitutionally based the final decision definition in the bill involves tradeoff between easing the procedural burdens on the property owner on the one hand and the routine giveandtake of local landuse negotiations and informational needs of courts for applying the takings test on the other the substantive provisions of the bill provide clarification of takings and substantive due process constraints on gove rnment interference with property rights as for federal takings claims the bill declares that the supreme courts test for when exaction conditions on development constitute takings shall apply broadly to both exactions and other conditions on developmen t to both adjudicatory and legislative conditions and exactions and to both land dedications and monetary fees also when taking claim involves subdivided lot recognized as an individual property unit under state law that lot shall be deem ed the parcel as whole in the takings analysis as for substantive due process claims the bill says that the criterion is whether the government action is arbitrar capricious an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law the key issue with the substantive provisions is whether they are constitutional suggesting unconstitutionality is the principl that it is the responsibility of the courts not congress to define the substance of constitutional guarantees but there are plausible counterarguments eg that the bill is merely statutory overlay to constitutional guarantees not redefinition of them leaving aside the constituti onality question the provisions expand th circumstances in which property owners can prevail on taking s and substantive due process claims for example in requiring substantive due process claims to be assessed on not in accordance with law standard the bill significantly lowers the bar relative to existing judicial standards for such violations which are ty pically more deferential to governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33727contents p r v i s i n s f t h b i l l 2 p r c s s p r

alleges that the governments action either physical invasion of his property or severe regulation of its use or an exaction conditi on on development approval is tantamount to taking and thus should be compensated even though the government has not formally sought to take the property substantive due process claim has somewhat different focus it aims to prevent government power from being used

enactment although hr 4772 has previous incarnations2 the current congressional interest in the bill largely stems fro m the supreme courts 2005 decision in kelo v city of new london 3 that decision dealt with re lated but very different matter although hr 4772 seeks to facilitate taking s lawsuits by land owners aggrieved by government interference kelo addressed the permissibl public purposes underlying direct condemnation suits by governments seeking to acqui re land yet to be sure both supreme court decision and bill speak to property rights and aspects of the fifth amendment takings clauses protection of property rights and public concerns about property rights kindled by the decisi on plainly have enhanced interest in the billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33727crs2 4 28 usc 1343 provides federal district c ourts with jurisdiction over actions brought under 42 usc 1983 explained in the following footnote 5 42 usc 1983 the civil rights act of 1871 provides that every person who under color of any stat ute ordinance regulation custom or usage of any state or territory or the district of columbia subjects or causes to be subjected any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights privileges or immunities secured by the constitution and laws shall be liable to the person injured though originally intended to secure federally guaranteed rights for the newly freed slaves the broad terms of this act have lead to its be ing used in wide diversity of situations such as fifth amendment takings claims 6 the term person in 42 usc 1983 has been held to cover municipalities monell v new york city dept of social services 436 us 658 1978 and other political subdivisions of state that are not arms of the state but not states themselves will v michigan dept of state police 491 us 58 1989 thus hr 4772 does not change the situation of property owners when it comes to ac tions against states in practice of course the large majority of land use controls in the united states are imposed by political subdivisions of states such as municipalities this report comments only on the legal and legally related policy issues raised by hr 4772 provisions of the bill hr 4772s process features as noted seek to facilitate access to the federal courts by property owners with certain federal constitutional claims the process features do not affect the property owners access to state courts for adjudicating those federal claims which courts remain generally available rather they offer the property owner second forum for federal cl aims the key process features of the bill are as follows 1 section 2 in an action under 28 usc 13434 in which the facts concern the uses of real property limits when federal district can abstain from deciding the action requires that the court exercise jurisdiction even if the plaintiff has not first pursued his statecourt remedies and limits when the court can certify related question of state law to the state courts asking the state court to clarify point of state law and report back to th federal court and 2 sections 24 provides that takings actions brought under 42 usc 19835 against political subdivisions of states6 or under the tucker acts against the united states shall be ripe for adjudication upon final decision which exists if the government makes definitive decision as to the permissible uses of the property and b one meaningful application to us the property has been denied and the property owner has applied for but been nied one waiver and one appeal unless unavailable or futile these process features closely track approaches used in the earlier bills there are host of small changes however for example hr 1534 105th congress

continuedfinal decision to require the property ow ner to seek but be denied one waiver or one appeal in contrast hr 2372 106th congress and hr 4772 require one waiver and one appeal seemingly more demanding ripe ness standard hr 4772s substantive features are as follows 1 sections 56 takings actions brought under 42 usc 1983 against political subdivisions of states or under the tucker acts against the united states are subject to two clarifications 1 conditions or exactions on land development approvals shall be subject to the applicable takings test regardless of whether legislative or adjudicatory in nature or whet her in the form of monetary fee or land dedication and 2 each subdivided lot in subdivision shall be regarded as separate parcel if so tr eated under state law and 2 sections 56 substantive due process acti ons under 42 usc 1983 against political subdivisions of stat or against the united st ates where based on property deprivation are subject to clarification the judgment shall be based on whether the government action is arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law these substantive provisions have counterpart in the earlier bills both hr 2372 106th congress and hr 4772 impose duty of notice to owners requiring federal agencies when they limit the use of property in manner that may be affected by the bill to give notice to property owners explaining their rights under the bill finally only hr 4772 contains severability clause stating that if any of the bills provisions or their applications are held invalid other provisions and their applicati ons shall not be affected process provisions limitations on abstention abstention is discretionary doctrine under which federal j udges may decline to decide cases that are ot herwise properly before them grounded in principles of comity and cooperative federa lism abstention holds that federal courts should not intrude on sensitive state issues unless necessary rather say proponents of abstention those controversies should be settled in the state courts thus abstention is an exception to the otherwise virtually unflagging obligation of the federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction given them7 abstention is an option for federal j udge when local land use regulation is attacked in federal court as taking8 the federal judge may defer to the state

proceeding except in exceptional circumstances11 courts are known to blend the various types of abstention hr 4772 directs that federal courts ad judicating civil rights claims involving real property shall not abstain if the plain tiff does not allege state law violation and parallel proceeding is pending in state court this narrows the grounds on which abstention currently may be invoked moreove r it is likely that this would preclude abstention in most cases since plaintiff to ensure that abstention does not occur would have only to delete any claims of state law violation from his complaint elimination of state exhaustion requirement in 1985 the supreme court announced that fifth amendment takings claim against state12 is ripe for federal court adjudi cation only when the plaintiff has exhausted his state court remedies if available and not futile13 the court reaffirmed this state exhaustion prerequisite in several later decisions14 the requirement has been perennial bete noir of real developers and other property rights advocates who contend that state courts in many states are less friendly to their interests than federal courts some scholars perceive lesser institutional competence or neutrality in state courts to handle federal constitutional claims though we are unaware of any authorita tive empirical study on this point15 in any event property owners and developers argue that notwithstanding the availability of state courts for vindicating their fifth amendment takings claims there is right given the federal nature of the claim to being able to file in the first instance in federal forum as well httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33727crs5 16 28 usc 1738 17 the rookerfeldman doctrine named after th supreme court decisions that gave birth to it bars review of state court judgments by the lower federal courts it stems from the proposition that district courts lack appellate jurisdiction and therefore cannot hear appeals of state court judgments 18 san remo 545 us

state exhaustion requirement it said s tems from the fifth amendments proviso that only takings without just compensation infringe that amendment id at 734 landowners further complain that once th state exhaustion prerequisite is met relitigating the takings claim in federal court has been barred under any of several legal doctrines these doctrines based on federalstate comity and considerations of judicial economy by avoiding duplicativ litigation are the federal full faith and credit act16 res judicata claim preclusion colla teral estoppel issue preclusion and the rookerfeldman doctrine17 the net effect of each is the same the landowner gets second bite at the apple in federal court nor says the supreme court does this offend any notion that pe rsons asserting federa l rights must have access to federal courts in recent takings case raising this issue the court noted that it has repeatedly held that issu actually decided in valid statecourt judgments may well deprive plaintiffs of the right to have their federal claims relitigated in federal court and that this is so even when the plaintiff would have preferred not to litigate in state c ourt but was required to do so 18 hr 4772 proposes to eliminate the stat exhaustion requirement so that takings claimant could go initially to federal court bypassing the state courts the question however is whether state exhausti on is mandated by the terms of the fifth amendment takings clause in which cas congress cannot eliminate it by statute the alternative is that the requirement is merely prudential imposed as matter of judicial discretion in which case congress can nullify it by statute the supreme court has come down on both sides of the constitutional versus prudential issue in the 1985 supreme court decision announcing the state exhaustion rule the court explained that property owner aggrieved by state property use restriction has not suffere d violation of the just compensation clause until he unsuccessfully seeks co mpensation through state procedures19 and further that the nature of the constitu tional right requires state exhaustion first20 and in 1999 the court noted that had an adequate postdeprivation remedy been available the property owner would have suffered constitutional injury from the taking alone21 in direct contradiction of these statements the court in 1997 referred to the state exhaustion requireme nt in dictum as merely prudential22 neglecting to mention contrary precedent later in the same opinion however the court arguably suggested the opposite23 most recently in 2005 fourjusticehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33727crs6 24 san remo v city and county of san francisco california 545 us 323 348 2005 25 williamson cty 473 us at 186 emphasis added 26 macdonald sommer frates v yolo cty 477 us 340 353 n9 1986 27 said the court in palazzolo v rhode island 533 us 606 620 2001 once it becomes clear that an agency lacks the discretion to permit any development or the permissible uses of the property are known to reasonable gree of certainty takings claim is likely to have ripened dissent opined that the courts adoption of the state exhaustion requirement whether constitutional or prudential may have been mistaken24 on balance the courts statements favoring constitutional rather than prudential basis for state exhaustion may be weightier raising doubts as to whether hr 4772 may validly dispense with it concededly the fourjustice dissent in 2005 raises the possibility that onejustice ch ange in the court might produce change in the law someday this report however analyzes the law as it stands right now definition of final decision the same supreme court decision th at debuted state exhaustion in 1985 imposed second ripeness requirement on fe deral takings claims claim that the application of government regulations effects taking is not ripe until the government entity has reached final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue25 the following year the court made clear that obtaining final decision might requi re the landowner to submit more than one development proposal rejection of exceedingly grandiose development plans does not logically imply that less ambitious plans will receive similarly unfavorable reviews26 for example just because developer is prohibited from building 100 houses on its tract does not necessarily mean that some lesser but still profitable number of houses may not be pe rmitted later decisions of the court appear to relax the requirement of formal development pr oposals by the land owner recognizing that in some circumstances it is clear how much development can occur and thus the taking claim is ripe without mu ltiple or indeed any proposals27 the final decision requirement is seen by courts as essential to the courts ability to adjudicate taking claim evaluation of taking claim they note demands that court know how much development is be ing permitted on the property so that the factintensive balancing test applied to most regulatory takings claims can be applied on the other hand property owners accuse landusecontrol agencies of exploiting the final decision concept to get landow ners to abandon politically unpopular or otherwise unpopular development by re quiring multiple submissions from the landowner each prepared at substantial ex pense with assurance that the proposal will ever be deemed satisfactory hr 4772 as noted seeks to define final decision it would stipulate that final decision has occurred when 1 definitive decision regarding the extent of permissible uses on the property s been made and 2 one meaningful application to use the property has been submitted but denied and the propertyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33727crs7 28 the and between items 1 and 2 arguably makes more sense if read as an or 29 it should also be noted that in almost all the pertinent cases submitting at least one meaningful application for development appr oval is prerequisite for invoking the futility exception to the final decision requirement for ripeness in hr 4772 the criterion is applied to establishing the final decision itself 30 macdonald 477 us at 348 internal quotation marks omittedowner has applied for but been denied one waiver and one appeal to an administrative agency unless unavailable or futile28 the two key concepts in the definition definitive decision and one meaningful application are undefined and raise the spectre of much litigation before their contours are known still it is clear that the final decision definition would benefit landowners and developers by increasin g the likelihood that the initial development proposal unless patently unreasonable will upon denial and denial of waiver and appeal create ripe taking claim that the court must address the court would not have the option of sending the landowner back to the landuse agency for further presumably scaled back proposals andor negotia tions such giveandtake between developer and regulatin g authority is currently routine part of the land use control process in this country perhaps fo r this reason the standard in the takings ripeness case law is at least one meaningful applicati on for development approval not as in the bill one meaningful application29 hr 4772 reduces the possibility that municipal authorities set on discouraging particular project could drag out the velopmentapproval pro cess and argue that as result the development proponent re mains short of final decision hence viable taking claim there are occasional reports that such bad faith dealing occurs though again we know of definitive studies however the bill also raises the legal issue of whether court can competently assess the economic impact of the governments action central component of takings analysis given that an initial denial does not necessa rily convey clear sense of what property uses will be allowed in the supreme courts famous phrase court cannot determine whether regulation has gone too far unless it knows how far the regulation goes30 from the municipalitys point of view the bill cr eates pressure to accept the firstsubmitted development proposal knowing that denying it may land the munici pality in federal court defending taking claim

365 2001 citing city of boerne 34 hrept 109658 at 7 n7 2006 35 it is unclear whether an analogous argument could be made in connection with section 6 of the bill which applies to claims against the united statessubstantive provisions threshold matter congressional clarification of constitutional provisions it is longsettled law that under the constitution and the paration of powers it embodies it falls to the judiciary not the congress to set forth binding prescriptions as to what constitutional provisions mean plainly congress routinely interprets the constitution in the course of determining what legislation it may enact but laying down binding rules for the judiciar ys use is another matter in the classic words of chief justice john marshall it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial branch to say what the law is31 more recently the court has reaffirmed that the power to interpret the constitution in case or controversy remains in the judiciary32 and similarly that it is the responsib ility of this court not congress to define the substance of constitutional guarantees33 hr 4772 arguably lays out such imper missible congressional prescriptions for judicial interpretation of the constitution sections 5 and 6 of the bill do not use the language of mere suggestion they say with apparent reference to the takings clause that the government is liable if certain circumstances obtain and that the case shall be decided based on certain parcel as whole see below those same sections instruct that an alleged depriv ation of substantive due process shall be judged by particular review standard nor do the above judici statements appear to leave room for such cong ressional clarification as the bill labels it when constitutional provision has not been explicated by the courts indeed there are few if any constitutional provisions that could not benefit from furt her clarification so that an exception to the general prohibition where the law is unclear would easily swallow the rule the committee report accompanying hr 4772 views section 5 addressing section 1983 actions against political subdi visions of states in different way34 rather than imposing reinterpretation of the constitution as posited above the committee report notes that 42 usc sec tion 1983 which section 5 amends already states that cases can be h eard in federal court for deprivation of any rights privileges or immunities secured by the constitution and laws all that section 5 does the report says is further define what is deprivation of any rights privileges or immunities secured by the laws35 further though not raised by the committee report wellsettled principle of statutory construction says that where one reading of statute raises constitutional issues court should construe the statute to avoidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33727crs9 36 see eg debartolo corp v fl orida gulf coast trades council 485 us 568 575 1988 quoting hooper v california 155 us 648

amendment is relevant here because among its guarantees in section one is that state shall deprive any person of property without due process of law this due process requirement includes both substantive due process protections and by incorporation from the fifth amendment the takings clause protection against government taking of property without just compensation 41 city of boerne 521 us at 519 congress does not enforce constitutional right by changing what the right is prior to city of boerne congresss power under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment to define the substan ce of rights guaranteed by section 1 of the amendment was closer question see id at 527528 discussing supreme courts earlier decision in katzenbach v morgan 384 us 641 1966 which could be interpreted as acknowledging power in congress to enact legislation that expands the rights in 1 of the fourteenth amendment city of boerne however rejected that reading of the decision 42 see eg board of trustees 531 us at 368 2001such problems unless such reading is plai nly contrary to the intent of congress36 it is unclear whether the committee report statement would be sufficient to deflect court from the possibly unconstitutional read ing in the preceding paragraphs given what seems to be the more comfortable fit between that reading and the text of section 5 another possible circumvention of the constitutionality issue is offered with respect to property rights claims against the united states only section 6 by congresss constitutional pow er to pay the debts of the united states 37 the supreme court has held that the term d ebts includes not only legal obligations of the united states but also those debts or claims that rest upon merely equitable or honorary obligation38 further congress may recognize its obligation to pay moral debt not only by dir ect appropriation but also by waiving an otherwise valid defense to legal claim against the united states39 it would seem possible that court might regard section 6s expansion of takings and substantive due process claims against the united states as in the nature of or analogous to waiving an otherwise valid defense congresss authority under the fourteenth amendment section 5 to enforce by appropriate legislation the guarantees of that amendment does not alter the analysis40 as the court has made clear c ongresss power under section 5 is to enforce those guarantees that is prevent or remedy violations not to redefine their substance41 nor has congress shown history and pattern of unconstitutional actions by the states here the state courts predicate for invocation of fourteenth amendment section 542 nor would it seem that sections 5 and 6 of the bill can be hung on congresss authority in article iii of

chevron usa ltd 544 us 528 546 2005 both nollan and dolan involved adjudicative landuse exactions specifically government demands that landowner dedicate an easement allowing public access to her property as condition of obtaining development permitunder that article as the titles and text of sections 5 and 6 make clear those provisions seek to address the meaning of constitutional provisions not in any direct sense the jurisdiction of article iii courts to hear them moving past the constitutionality issue in sections 5 and 6 the following compares the three prescriptions therein with existing takings and substantive due process caselaw to indicat the degree to which hr 4772 changes the law clarification of status in takings law of conditions and exactions on development local governments in the united states routinely impose conditions on allowing the development of land some of these c onditions take the form of requiring the proponent of development to transfer something to the public on the rationale that he has some duty to offset the burdens imposed by the proposed development on the community such exactions may be either dedications of acreage by the landowner or payment of monetary equi valent typical exaction might require before development is approved that the developer dedicate acreage for public roads or walkways or open space such exactions not to be takings must both 1 have an esse ntial nexus to the purpose of the development approval re gime to which they are attached43 and 2 impose burden on the landowner that is roughly proportional to the impacts of the proposed development44 the burden of showing r ough proportionality rests with the government and requires an individualized determina tion this supreme court test for exaction takings is generally considered to be more friendly to the property owner asserting taking claim than the default regulatory takings tests for that reason the property rights bar has long sought its expansive application hr 4772 seeks to further this effort by property owners45 first it would apply the exaction takings test to conditions as we ll as exactions by contrast the supreme court applies its exaction taki ngs test only to exactions46 in bringing in conditions generally hr 4772 makes that landownerfriendly test appli cable to vast array of development prerequisites such as building code requirements httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33727crs11 47 see eg wisconsin builders assn v wi sconsin dot 702 nw2d 433 448 wis 2005 48 in lingle v chevron usa inc 544 us 528 546 2006 the court described nollan and dolan as each beginning with the premise that had the government simply appropriated the easement in question this would have been per physical taking emphasis in original if limited to physica lly invasive conditions the exaction takings test in nollan and dolan plainly would not apply to monetary exactionssecond hr 4772 would make the governme nt liable regardless of whether the exaction or other condition was imposed ad judicatively by ruling specific to the landowners parcel or legislatively thr ough generally applicable ordinance lower court decisions on whether the suprem courts exaction ta kings test applies only to adjudicatively imposed exactions or to legislative exactions also remain divided however twice since announcing the test the supreme court has suggested that it is not to be extended beyond the f actual context of the cases in which it was announced ie adjudicative exactions47 thus there is distinct possibility that future case law may veer toward the adjudicativeonly view third hr 4772 would make the governme nt liable regardless of whether the exaction or other condition took the form of dedication require ment or monetary assessment as above the lower courts are divided on the reach of the exactions takings test here some sa ying that only physical dedi cation exactions are covered others that monetary assessments are c overed also but also as above recent supreme court caselaw hints at the ultimate resolution if the issue were presented the court might exclude monetary assessments48 clarification of status in takings law of subdivided lots takings law dictates that court in d eciding whether regulatory taking has occurred must look at the property owners loss relative to the value she retains requiring the court to define the parcel as whole for assessing that residual value courts definition of the parcel as whole in given case can easily determine whether taking occurred when the parcel as whole is defined tightly around the developmentrestricted portion of the tract the relative loss to the takings plaintiff is calculated as quite large thus possible taking when defined more broadly the relative loss is calculated as small almost certainly not taking property owners and develope rs often contend that on subdivided tract of land each individual subdivided lot should be deem ed separate parcel as whole on this view when landuse agency bars development on wetlands occupying portion of the tract taking of the subdivided ts within that portion will likely be found since each such lot suffers very large percentage of value loss the tract owner thus would be compensated for the restricted portion hr 4772 adopts this approach instructing the courts to decide covered takings claims with reference to each subdivided lot regard less of ownership whether an individual subdivided lot though surr ounded by other lots in common ownership should be seen as the pa rcel as whole in takings case has not been

aware on the subdividedlot question holds that individual subdivided lots are not to be regarded as separate parcels as whole at leas t where the landowner is seekin g to develop several lots as part of unified development plan50 thus the bill differs from existing case law more generally the courts in defining the parcel as whole in each case have adopted an ad hoc approach the effort said the court of fe deral claims must be to identify the parcel as realistically and fairly as possible given the entire factual and regulatory environment51 by contrast hr 4772 ma kes one single factor the owners drawing of subdivision lot lines c onclusive of course this does promote greater certainty than exists under the constitutional ad hoc analysis clarification of when property deprivation violates substantive due process for the most part federal judges have endorsed very defe rential substantive due process standard for scrutiny of state and local landuse restrictions52 n example is recent decisi on for the third circuit by thenjudge alito adopting the strict shocks the conscience of the court test for such challenges53 the f irst circuit has said that even an arbitrary denial of permit in violation of state law even in bad faith does not rise bove the due process threshold 54 rather substantive due process should be available to reign in local land use controls only in truly horrendous situations55 these standards appear to be stricter than the classic arbitrary and capricious standard hr 4772 would lower the bar for fede ral substantive due process claims involving property facilitating their being brought in federa l court it does this by adopting verbatim the standard for judicial review of federal agency action prescribed by the administrative procedure act arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law56 use of this standard would lower the current unconstitutionality threshold both by adopting arbitrary capricious

whether every action of local landuse agency or the united states that is not in accordance with any law even state and local ones should be tr ansformed into fe deral constitutional violation true enough not all courts have adopted handsoff standards in due process challenges to local zoning57 still our research rev eals none that has declared any unlawful action unconstitutional mo reover the decisions that are highly resistant to involving the fe deral courts in local landus matters are more recent and more numerous58 the supreme court too has been resistant to expanding the use of substantive due process outside the c ontext of socalled f undamental interests which currently do not in clude property interests overarching issues hr 4772 like its precedents raises so broad issues of legal policy the first arises from the aversion of federal judges expressed in numerous decisions in recent decades to inserting th emselves into local landuse disputes for example the eighth circuit cautioned that we are concerned that federal courts not sit as zoning boards of appeals59 the ninth circuit has said the supreme court has erected imposing barriers in its leading takings ripeness decisions to guard against federal courts becoming the gr and mufti of local zoning boards60 and the eleventh circuit echoed with federal cour ts do not sit as zoning boards of review61 there are many other such judicial statements quite recently the supreme court suggested sympathy with this view notin g that state courts undoubtedly have more experience than federal courts do in resolving the complex factual technical and legal questions related to z oning and landuse regulations62 as this report shows the federal judici aversion to involvement in local land use disputes may be manifested through use of several legal devices abstention certification of state law questions to state courts in the hope of clarification that avoids the federal question in the case d eclining

same unobstruc ted access to federal courts as other federal cons titutional claims such as those under the first or fourth amendment they argue that federal court would never turn away free speech claim under section 1983 on the ground that its constitutiona lity had not first been tested in state court and as noted th ey contend that federal forum should be available for the adjudication of federal constitutional right whether or not the constitution requires it whether this equating of the takings clause and other constitutional guarantees takes full cognizance of textual differences is another question however the broader issue is federalism and the occasional congressional rhetoric to the effect that the federal government shoul d minimize its involvement in local matters hr 4772 runs contrary to this ideal but in doing so has much company congress in recent d ecades has fostered greater federal court involve ment in formerly state court matters in such areas as product liability criminal law and class actions63 in the land use area at issue here congress has articulated its own standard enforceable in federal court for the application of local land use restrictions to religious facilities64 finally hr 4772 is likely to prompt charges that it will add more cases to an already overburdened federal judiciary it is beyond the scope of this report to address the merits of this potential criticism nor has it st opped congress from approving new avenues for federal court litigation in the past
