in which copyrighted musical works and sound recordings may be reproduced distributed and publicly performed copyright owners broadcasters and music vendors have become increasingly concerned that the various compulsory licenses applicable to sound recordings result in different treatment for entities offering similar services s 256 the platform equality and remedies for rights holders in music act of 2007 the perform act represents one legislative approach to resolving these concerns at least as they apply to digital public performances of sound recordings the perform act would amend 17 usc 112 to require that webcasters pay copyright owners compulsory license fee based on the fair market value of their works when making ephemeral recordings it would similarly change the terms under which transmission services obtain compulsory licenses for digital public performances of copyrighted sound recordings under 17 usc 114f by 1 providing for compulsory licenses for all types of transmission services under the same statutory provision 2 setting license fees for all types of transmission services based on the same three criteria and 3 using the fair market value of the works licensed as the standard for determining all compulsory license fees the perform act also strengthens the requirements of 17 usc 114d to ensure that transmission services cannot rely on compulsory license for digital public performance in order to distribute sound recordings to listeners it further adds concept of reasonable recording to 17 usc 114j under which transmission services in order to qualify for the compulsory public performance license must employ technologic measures to limit copying or recording by listeners finally the perform act requires that the register of copyrights convene meeting between owners of copyrighted sound recordings and transmitting services later than 60 days after its enactment to discuss the creation of new category for limited interactive services and set appropriate compulsory license fees for these services

copyright law protects are sound recordings material or digital embodiments of performances of mu sical works and musical works musical compositions consisting of musical notation and any accompanying words 1 owners of copyrighted sound recordings have exclusive rights to reproduce adapt or distribute their works or to perform them publicly by digital means2 normally anyone who wants to exercise any of the copyright owners exclusive rights must obtain the copyright owners permission to do so typically by negotiating private licensing agreement 3 however copyright law also provides several types of compulsory licenses for sound recordings these licenses allow third parties who pay statutorily prescribed fees to use copyrighted sound recordings under certain conditions without having to negotiate private licensing agreements4 among other things compulsory licenses currently are available for ephemeral recordings reproductions of sound recordings made by webcasters or radio stations to facilitate the streaming of their content on the internet5 as well as public performances of sound recordings by digital transmission services such as webcasters and satellite digital audio radio

musical works and sound recordings may be reproduced distributed and publicly performed copyright owners broadcasters and music vendors have become increasingly concerned that the various compulsory licenses applicable to sound recordings result in different and inequitable treatment for entities offering similar services webcasters object to paying compulsory license fees for ephemeral reproductions and public performances when terrestrial amfm radio stations do not 7 they also are concerned about paying more in compulsory license fees than existing satellite radio services whose license fees are separately established based upon factors that recognize their infrastructure investments and seek to minimize disruption to their business models8 copyright owners worry that satellite digital services are impermissibly stretching the compulsory public performance license in order to distribute sound recordings because they have developed portable devices that allow users not only to record musical programming but also to save and resequence selected songs from such recordings9 satellite radio services on the other hand note that they face more expenses in transmitting public performances than webcasters do because they must purchase spectrum and launch satellites prior to transmitting music10 they argue that listeners recording from satellite radio are different than listeners recording from terrestrial radio and thus are covered by the audio home recording act ahra pl 102 56311 the perform act represents one legislative approach to resolving these concerns

temporarily reproduce copyrighted sound recordings while publicly performing them eg creating cache or buffer copies prior to or during streaming13 under the current version of 17 usc 112e4 if the webcasters and copyright owners fail to negotiate fee for these ephemeral recordings the us copyright offices copyright royalty judges are to determine fee corresponding to that which willing buyers and sellers would negotiate in the marketplace the perform act amends 17 usc 112e4 by replacing the willing buyerseller standard with standard based on the fair market value of the rights licensed the rationale for this change is unclear even the sponsor of s 256 senator feinstein notes that there is some concern about what fair market value means especially under government licensing scheme where there is not an actual competitive market 14 however one possibility is that the use of the fair market value in setting compulsory license fees may parallel its use in assessing actual damages for copyright infringement under 17 usc 504a115 g21g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g343g343g346g561g14g146g140g142g151g156g142g156g561 in amending the copyright act to grant owners of copyrighted sound recordings exclusive rights in digital public performances of their works the digital performance right in sound recordings act dprsra of 1995 pl 10439 also created compulsory license for digital

satellite services and all other eligible nonsubscription transmissions such as webcasters16 currently under dprsra as amended by the dmca only the preexisting subscription or satellite services17 have their rates set under standards that consider the services role in creating new markets and seek to minimize disruption of their industry18 new subscription or satellite services as well as eligible nonsubscription services do not have their rates determined under such standards their rate setting standards do not consider their role in creating new markets or seek to minimize disruption to their industries 19and their rates thus tend to be higher20 the perform act eliminates the dmca s distinction between preexisting subscription or satellite services and all other services by deleting 17 usc 114f1 instead it renumbers the current 114f2 as the new 114f1 and revises it to cover all transmissions21 the perform act further revises the new 114f1b to use the sa three factors in setting compulsory license fees for all transmission services two of these factors1 the transmissions impact on sound recordings sales or the copyright owners revenue stream and 2 the creative technological and financial contributions of the copyright owner and transmission providerare included in the current 114f2b however the perform act adds third factor that more directly addresses copyright owners concerns that public performance licences are being used to avoid negotiating distribution rights this factor is the degree to which reasonable recording affects the potential market for sound recordings and the additional fees that are required to be paid by services for compensation the perform act also changes 114f in the same way that it changes 112e by providing that compulsory license fees are to correspond to the fair market value of the works not the price that would be negotiated by willing buyers and sellers in the marketplace further the perform act revises the new 114f1c to allow owners of copyrighted sound recordings to seek recalculation of the compulsory license fee whenever services digitally transmitting public performances of c opyrighted sound recordings introduce new technologies or devices to the degree that the perform act applies the same statutory provision and ratesetting factors to all services that publicly perform copyrighted sound recordings by digital means it does promote parity however the perform act does not require absolute rate parity between all services publicly performing sound recordings by digital means under 114

performances to distribute copyrighted sound recordings currently under 17 usc 114d2 transmission services are eligible for compulsory licenses only if 1 their transmissions are not part of an interactive service24 2 they do not automatically and intentionally cause any device receiving the transm ission to switch from one program channel to another unless they are transmitting to business entity and 3 they accompany their transmissions whenever technically feasible with any information encoded into the sound recording by the copyright owner to identify its title performer or underlying musical work the perform act would add fourth requirement to this listing allowing transmission service to rely on the compulsory license only where it takes affirmative steps to authorize enable cause or induce25 the making of copy or phonorecord by or for the transmission recipient and uses technology that is reasonably available technologically feasible and economi cally reasonable to prevent the making of copies or phonorecords embodying the transmission in whole or in part except for reasonable recording language similar to the fourth requirement is currently in 114d2cvi although the perform act would remove this subsection presently 1142cvi applies only to new subscription services or preexisting subscription services using different transmission mechanisms than those they used on july 31 1998 it does not reach the activities of preexisting subscription or satellite services such as xm or sirius so long as they do not change their transmission mechanisms 26 moreover the perform acts proposed language for the new 114d2aiv is broader in terms of what transmitting service must do to qualify for continued from which the sounds can be perceived reproduced or otherwise communicated either directly or with the aid of machine or device 17 usc 101 23 congressional proponents of the perform act typically say that it will subject internet cable and satellite to the same rate standards not the same rates parity platforms statement of senator arlen specter chairman of the senate judiciary committee 24 the meaning of interactive service has been matter of some dispute as the sponsors of the perform act note see 152 c ong rec s351001 apr 25 2006 statement of senator feinstein under the dprsra an interactive service was defined as one that enables member of the public to receive on request transmission of particular sound recording chosen by or on behalf of that recipient the dmca amended that definition to one that enables member of the public to receive transmission of program specially created for the recipient or on request transmission of particular sound recording whether or not as part of program which is selected by or on behalf of the recipient many people have objected that in changing this definition the dmca replaced fairly straightforward and objective test with one requiring complex subjective analysis music licensing issues hearing before the senate comm on the judiciary 109 th cong 1st sess 2005 statement of rob glaser chairman and ceo of realnetworks inc 25 it is unclear whether the perform acts usage of induce here is intended to correspond to the meaning of induce in the supreme courts decision in mgm studios inc v grokster ltd 545 us 913 2005 which held that manufacturers of devices can face secondary liability for copyright infringement when they indu ce their customers to use their products illegally the verb induce is used in the current 114d2cvi which predates the grokster decision 26 new devices promoted by xm and sirius allow consumers to record segments of transmissions and then save only selected songs or resequence the songs from their broadcast order these would not fall within the category of transmission medium because they are devices for receiving not sending content see 17 usc 101 defining transmit some critics contend that the entir perform act is targeted at xm and sirius

service cannot rely on the compulsory license if it 1 causes or induces recipients to make recordings and 2 to the degree its transmission technologies enable it to limit the making of recordings fails to impose such limits under the new 114d2aiv service cannot rely on the compulsory license if it 1 authorizes or enables as well as causes or induces recipients to make copies or recordings and 2 fails to use technologies that are reasonably available technologically feasible and economically reasonable to prevent copying or recording by listeners thus under the perform act transmitting service must satisfy additional conditions to qualify for 114 compulsory license including potentially using digital rights management drm technologies to limit the recipients ability to reproduce distribute or perform the transmitted music 27 g6g142g143g146g151g146g157g146g152g151g561 the perform act adds new definition describing reasonable recording to 17 usc 114j under the perform act recording cannot be reasonable where an entity which is transmitting digital public performances under 114 compulsory license for private noncommercial use fails to employ technological measures incorporated into recording devices to prevent automated recording or playback of userselected sound recordings albums or artists separation of transmission into its component segments eg songs so as to permit their playback in different sequence and redistribution retransmission or exporting of phonorecord containing any part of sound recording licensed under 114 unless the destination device is secure inhome network complying with these requirements the perform act does not however prohibit automated recording or playback of userselected programs time periods or channels or noninfringing nonautomated manual recording and playback by consumers the perform act relies upon this definition of reasonable recording as one of the factors to be considered in setting compulsory license fees under the new 114f1b and in establishing when preexisting satellite digital audio radio service may rely on the statutory license under 114d

perform act renumbers as 114f1c from 17 usc 803b3b 27 some observers have noted that this requirement of the perform act may force webcasters to stream music to the public using drmenabled digital music file format such as microsofts windows media audio wma or reals realaudio ra format mp3encoded audio is not drmcompliant and thus webcasters may need to switch their internet radio streams to nonmp3 format such change may require additional license fees to be paid to the owners of those proprietary music file formats see fred von lohmann the season of bad laws part 3 banning mp3 streaming
