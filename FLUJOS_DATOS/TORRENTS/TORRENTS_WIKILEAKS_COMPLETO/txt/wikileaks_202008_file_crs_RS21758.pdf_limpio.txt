report based on its findings by march 31 2005 with specific recommendations membership requirements the membership requirements of fa ca are broad enough to allow great deal of discretion in determining the composition of commission therefore the membership of an advisory committee will depend upon its gislative or presid ential mandate faca does not provide guidance on the number of members commission or committee should have or their terms of appoi ntment the membership gene rally should be large enough to allow for representation of differing poi nts of view and to facilitate quorum for commission meetings advisory committees of shortterm existence usually keep the same members for the committee s duration with any vacancies filled in the same manner as the original appointments were made some advisory panels may have staggered membership terms so that only one portion of the members will be new at any given time thereby ensuring continuity in the committees

appears from feder law and regulation that one appointed to be member of federal advisory committee is required to file financial disclosure form by virtue of his or her being eith er regular federal

determinate factors of whether one is or is not federal employee an advisory committee member serving without compensation may not be required to file financial disclosure form if however pers on is appointed on an advisory comm ittee and is considered special government employee then such person must file either public or confidential statement depending on his or her compensation level and the amount of days in which he or she performs the duties of that position10 even though the members of the commission on the intelligence capabilities of the united states regarding weapons of mass
