shsbc 69 problems intensive assessment lecture given on 11 october 1961 thank you okay now we have before us on this eleventh of oct the little handy jimdandy the class ii auditors pride its called problems intensive for staff clearing and you notice it says staff clearing staff always gets the best okay october eleventh 1961 saint hill special briefing course and this is problems intensives for staff clearing this is the second lecture on this subject all right now we take this up we look it in the teeth and we find that we are looking at basically the preclear assessment form and youve been using this on preclears or should have been using this on preclears for very long time the earliest edition of this is 1950 elizabeth and angeles foundations 1950 so youre not looking at anything new this has come long way and all thats happened here is were now using it to resolve the case all right it is of vast information to you and vast importance for you to know what the devil your pc is all about i have seen an auditor believe it or not process pc for weeks on end and not find out that the pc was having dreadful time with court or child has been taken off by the authorities or something now youd say thatd show up in present time problems but it gets worse than this i have seen an auditor process pc forever and not know their right name not know if theyve ever been operated on not know they suffered from various ills not know whether they were married or single wed say that auditor was running big notknow now the basic part of this and the early parts of it right up to section but not including section if youll look it over simply consists of vital information on pc and that is all it is vital information on pc hco policy letter of october 10th 1961 problems intensives for staff clearing every organization has this under the guise of preclear assessment form right up to but not including section you notice the directions have been modified on this theyve just been deleted little bit so i had better say something about when you do this if you have new pc who is brandnew to scientology you certainly do one but if you have somebody you are going to give an intensive to that you have never done one of these things on you should do one it gives the pc some little confidence to know that his auditor knows something about him and that in itself is an interesting factor in holding pc insession all by itself now we see here that it starts out who does the assessment the auditor assigned to audit the preclear does the assessment now what does that mean it means thats his first action thats the first action the auditor undertakes he doesnt go in and run fifteen hours of create reactive mind thank you create reactive mind thank you he doesnt do that he sits down and he doesnt do rudiments and he doesnt do anything else he simply sits down and runs off this form and he sits there and makes out the form but it is auditing it is auditing it is done in the paid auditing time of the pc because it is auditing and when an auditor gets preclear that he has not had before he takes one of these forms and he fills it out on the pc now why is this the pc has sneaking feeling that the auditor doesnt know anything about him until this form is filled out and therefore you have hard time keeping the rudiments in but its because the pc is certain that there is notknow sitting in the auditors chair but as soon as youve filled out this form then the pc feels that the auditor knows something about him or her and is happier thereby feels more comfortable about this pcs always have certain things that they feel that somebody should know and those things are pretty well covered in this assessment form all right the assessment form is for information auditors reports are for information not your information they are almost never for the auditors information he knows so if you could read your own writing that would be for your information if you wrote that way but its for somebody elses information an auditors report form in central organization goes from the auditor to the director of processing goes from the director of processing very often is inspected by hco sometimes but is certainly forwarded into here or one copy of it and in class of this particular character you are if i ever see mary sue complaining about her eyes and so forth why im just going to go back and find all the badly written forms and put curse on you you want to know something and bad handwriting is just another method of running notknow on somebody it is withholding the information writing illegibly now some of these fellows in commerce that we occasionally do business with you look at their signatures look at their signatures can you read their signatures its bloourh and so forth and youll find that fellow has withholds you look over the letter he has written you and you wonder how much of that letter is true how much of it is false the fellow is withholding information from you ordinarily now thats true of all handwriting and you would be amazed how your handwriting improves after youve got sec check form 3 flat theres direct coordination so it is made to be read and if its illegible somebody trying to check up the case is denied information that might be of value now we look down the line here and we find out that we want information on the name of the pc the age of the pc and we want the tone arm position at the start of the assessment now this will give us some sort of an idea as we look this over whether or not this pc is going to respond to ordinary and routine auditing because as they give you the answers to this form they should get some tone arm shifts and if they get tone arm shifts talking about themselves of any kind whatsoever ohoh ohoh this is pretty desperate situation youre almost running into cch situation when youre doing that so that gives you that information if you carry your tone arm position notations throughout this form why youll be fine now we have the first questions are family and we want to know this data about father and mother and so forth and this gives us reactive personnel as you will see here at once im going to pull this microphone closer to okay you will see this at once that the individual had very bad relationships with his father and that youre going to be running into father father father father father and that he cant remember anything about his mother and so hes going to be trying to run into his mother his mother his mother throughout the auditing you see what we can divine from that at once now the next thing that we go into here is the other relatives who are in immediate line now at this stage of processing if this is the beginning of an intensive the first intensive the pc has youre going to have missing personnel here like mad well should you try to find them just let it ride let it ride the significant allies of the case are going to be missing always during the first preclear assessment form greataunt agatha uncle bill the fellow who made drunkard out of the pc you see he is never going to be mentioned at this stage of the game if he is aberrative now if it is known to pc it isnt wrong with the pc if the pc knows about it it is not aberrative someday you will hear and you will stop auditing all these big knowns and you will start making some progress with cases that is rapid thats one difference between my auditing and sometimes yours if the pc knows about it i pat him on the back shake him by the right hand cheer him up and go on hastily to something else and you all too often say well obviously look here his father was drunkard and jailbird and beat him he says every day and obviously weve got to spend lot of time on father and you do you waste lot of auditing time on father because father has nothing to do with the case how do we know that the pc knew about it if the pc knew about it it doesnt have anything to do with his aberrations the only time that crosses up is hidden standard but pc usually doesnt even know about hidden standard until you start interrogating him so this gives us all of the areas we dont have to monkey with in auditing you see its negative assessment were not going to have to worry too much about these its going to say family mother mother living yes and you dont then of course ask what was the date of her death and the pc makes statement of relationship with mother well mother was dear sweet person mother was always very good to much better than i deserved much better than i deserved she lives with us now and somehow or another she keeps the marriage from going on the rocks she tries shes nice nice person and so forth well you get trapped into this you see you say well what the hell is this some kind of an overwhelm here of some kind or another you see and just exactly how does this thing stack up you say to yourself mmmmmmmm tries to keep their marriage from going on the rocks ill bet see and you actually get trapped into this because you have little piece of knowingness that is intriguing well go ahead and be interested in it but the pc knows all about this well there are some things the pc probably doesnt know about it but that will turn up in the line of auditing but what the pc knows about we couldnt care about then we get into father and we same thing applies and the pc says oh yes well the old man died when i was eighteen and so forth and it was good riddance he used to beat every day and he shot on sundays and hes whats wrong with oh well thats one area we dont have to have anything to do with get the idea its just negative rundown if you were to shake that down you could find some surprising data in it and the pc sooner or later in this particular type of intensive will find very surprising data in it extremely surprising such as his father spanked him once very ordinary his father beat him every day and shot him every sunday and so forth and you find out the father spanked him lightly once thats the truth of the matter see hes got some kind of synthetic but this is something thats going to come up sooner or later and youre not going to have to worry about it too much particularly if he says that is everything that is wrong with him if the pc knows that is wrong with him and has known thats whats wrong with him for long time why has it continued to be wrong with him see thats the 156000pound question why has it continued to be wrong why hasnt it asised well it hasnt asised because it isnt there and it never was there but it gives us method of skirting these things were not going to take that up itll all come out on withholds sooner or later now relationships and there youre going to have missing personnel and married very often you find missing personnel now theres one thing that may possibly go haywire is numbers of times divorced on this that is important to know because the pc is very often holding this up and itll hold up his case but its the number of times divorced well maybe he didnt get divorced maybe he got married five times and only divorced once and that would be quite withhold wouldnt it so nevertheless you fill that in try to get the data on there any difficulties the pc presently has now that gives you some sort of an idea how many present time problems youre going to have to cope with in session and if divorced the reasons for the divorce and the pcs emotional feeling about divorces and you had better remember again that it doesnt say how many times he is not divorced or something of this sort there might be some sleepers back on the case of some kind or another that never get mentioned so you better get that question answered very very well and very thoroughly and then educational level this has some interest in the matter very often you will find pc squirming around and telling you that he is not educated and he has never been to school and so forth and it would actually turn out to be withhold if you didnt go over it slightly you every now and then find pc whos ashamed that he hasnt been educated and you very often find pc who is ashamed that he has you know i have lawsuit ive been very laggardly in filing its against the university of texas and so forth and these things do come up in education but i want to claim all of the german courses that mary sue had there i want to claim back the fee and considerable damages because every time were around germans shes had four years of german see and every time were around germans ive only had couple of lifetimes as german you see ive had courses on it and i have to order all the beds and breakfasts you see and so forth and i turn around to her and i say suzie ask the lady to sell us loaf of bread you see and suzie looks sort of blank you know and then finally i finally get brot lets see brot brot brot it restimulates hell out of after youve been killed in country few times you know and you try to talk its language you get restimulated so the university of texas is going to get sued sooner or later on this business but you run into oddball angles on education of some kind or another and if you were processing well i think probably if you were processing dear old mr jenner out here hes quite fireball hes our bricklayer and hes quite boy you go out there and if the materials are available and if the east grinstead merchants have been talked into letting go of something you go out there and you will see low wall of bricks low wall of bricks being put up and you go back about half an hour later you know and the wall is over your head you just never saw bricks throw themselves and plant themselves and get masonried into shape as fast as mr jenner can do it he is terrific right now i dont know how many cubic yards of dirt theyve moved out there this afternoon and bricks flying in all directions and that sort of thing but i dont know particularly that he has thing on education but he rather considers to slight degree that he is not educated and he is likely not to inform you on this subject and it sort of is withhold because you are processing him in some highly intellectual line see scientology and that would be intellectual and then he tries to kind of measure up to all this and he gets into some kind of an impressive fog you got the idea and it his relationship could be actually twisted and made poor with the auditor if this point wasnt straightened out with such pc other people theyve had twentynine years of education postgraduate courses and all that sort of thing and they cant write their name so theyre ashamed too and they try to say ive never been to school but you get lot of lies in this particular area and so youd better get that pretty well straight its not that it has anything to do with whether he can run the process or doesnt run the process but its fruitful subject of withhold and youll find most of this is all right and you ask him about his professional life and main jobs hes held and so forth you ask him about serious accidents and the date of such and any permanent damage and that sort of thing you ask about principal illnesses and now youre getting into an interesting zone because if you didnt know some of these things you could run into them headon you could keep running into engrams of one kind or another that you wouldnt have any information on whatsoever because he never mentions them and then you go into operations and thats one that you should do briefly accidents illnesses and operations are all subject to restimulation and you can restimulate the living daylights out of pc if you start auditing these things as he brings them up now how do you audit them all you have to do is ask about them just ask about them thoroughly and hell be in it you can throw him as an auditor straight into such an incident now you get somebody out in the middle west and you ask them if theyve ever had any illnesses or operations and of course there goes the intensive dont know if youve ever read any letters coming from the bible belt as ive mentioned before they read something like what was that quacks name that was arrested down in texas for practicing medicine without license and somebody awarded ten million dollars damages for his having morris fishbein of the ama morris fishbein the head of the ama this is all true about morris he was arrested for practicing medicine without license but they actually read like his primary textbook how to get sick and go to the doctor i think the textbook was called and you get somebody started on this and my god here we go you get some pcs started on this who have slight strain of hypochondria and man they will give it to you blow by blow and writhe around and run their havingness down and so forth and then start on their families illnesses and so forth and then they get to all the mistakes the doctor made and how the doctor had to open them up again in order to in order to recover his nurse or something and this can become far too windy so your ability to acknowledge is the only way you turn this off your ability to acknowledge in making out this form must be good and never better than under accidents illnesses and operations your ability to acknowledge wonderful and you can say to them if it doesnt turn off well you know well be taking up that sort of thing in processing in the direct processing well be taking that up more directly that shuts it off you will too because inevitably if theyre going to talk about it that much theyre sort of hung in it but this is not an auditing moment of running engrams this is not the engram situation that you are running into all right now what do we have here essentially what do we have as we go down this line but data and that data can be confused with the auditor isnt ordinarily auditors do well filling these things out but an auditors natural impulse is to take these things up with the pc well dont take them up with the pc while doing such form thats all just dont take them up thats all forget it acknowledge it and get off of it and get on to the next line you got the idea without creating an arc break now sometimes that is neat sometimes you have to be very neat in order to get off of subject and shut pc off because you see an arc break is composed of not able to talk to the auditor but if youve ever watched pc talk his havingness down youll agree with what i am telling you they can talk their havingness straight out the bottom just as nice as you please down it goes with dull thud they talk themselves right down the tone scale enthusiasm and the next thing you know theyre little antagonistic and the next thing you know theyre crying and the next thing you know theyre not talking you can watch them theyll slide right on down the tone scale if you dont hold up this so its best in entering these to tell the pc this is accidents illnesses and operations im still talking about f and g on this form it is best to say now i just want to know these things very briefly exactly what these things were very briefly and you sort of emphasize this very briefly and you wont run into him talking himself straight back into an engram and finishing his first auditing session with christawful somatic he didnt know where the hell it came from got the idea thats good prevention remember that pc can talk down his havingness if youre accustomed as an auditor to ever letting pc run on and on and on and never stopping him from talking you are doing him an unkindness and dont think youre doing him kindness because youre not youre doing him an unkindness the best thing you can do is to get on with the auditing but this can sometimes create an arc break and so you have to handle it carefully and the best way to handle it is to preorganize it dont try to handle it after the fact if its going to be difficult handle it before the fact so that part of your auditing statement is now in the next minute or so i want you to list for all of the accidents you have had you get that kind of trick in the next minute or so you see oh well hes put in sort of little games condition now and is how fast can he do it and he says well lets see there were fifteen automobile accidents and twentyfive bicycle accidents and seventeen times when i fell off of railway bridges i always seem to be falling off railway bridges and lets see and thats about all haha i beat you it didnt even take minute you see bang fine you got all your data you write it down any kind of trickery like that is better than letting pc talk his havingness down you got the idea so you get the data without the arc break present physical condition once more i refer you to the letters which you might see coming from the bible belt this is one of the marvelous subjects well i have misery its misery has been going on for long time and you very often will see pc very often just sit back and heave long sigh and youre just setting in for long chat this is going to be nice quiet afternoon were going to spend and thats not what were there for at all once more the briefly the this and that the inference that weve got to get this listed so that we can get on to the next item and the next item is something else and we dont care what the next item is you see briefly you know lets get this briefly so that we can get on to the next item now what is your present physical condition and they say long after oh he she she really wants to know terrible all right now how is it terrible all right where are the pains exactly inform exact what parts of the body and so forth oh well she says all over my eyes my head my back and i have athletes foot and so forth and so on and et cetera now you remember that the pc is on meter so at this point itd be an awfully good time to look at that emeter now were not interested much in the emeter except for the tone arm up to the point we get to this h is there withheld physical condition that were terribly interested in and so we read the needle and you can put right opposite that h that its little old needlereading stunt right here and you want to know if there are any illnesses the pc hasnt told anybody about if there are any worries about health the pc has not imparted to anyone pcs sometimes go around thinking theyre dying of some dreadful disease and they never let anybody in on it because itd be too terrible for others to know all that sort of thing and also and very very much to the point are there any diseases you would hate to have people know about ah and youre liable to collide with freight train where it can save yourself one godawful amount of dodged processing just get it right there just lets just get any possible withhold on the subject of present physical condition off of this case now and youll save yourself lot of trouble because withhold about present physical condition is one of the most serious withholds there can be on case all right we come to section i and section i is mental treatment and it says list any psychotic psychoanalytic hypnotic mystical or occult exercises or other mental treatment which pc has had the date of the treatment and the emeter reaction and you could very well add to that any treatment he is now receiving and you would get yourself something else now this too you want to shake down with the needle you want to get any withhold in the area of mental treatment off off off you know person who is withholding the fact that he has been adjudicated as stark staring insane is of course sitting on the one withhold that can stop his processing in its tracks and right here on this course there has been an instance or two of somebody continuing treatment while training and evidently this was not shaken down well because you find trace of it in their preclear assessment form in the beginning of their folder the auditor just did not find it those things are important those things are very important during auditing theyre very important in an hgc the person goes gets auditing all day and then has somebody cracking his spine all night while theyre hypnotizing him or something and youre going to get place man hes going to be out of session every morning going to have high tone arm every morning and then it takes about the middle of the morning to get the tone arm down and then the next morning he comes in and he has high tone arm again and about the third time this happens that he goes off with low tone arm and comes back with high tone arm you can suspect that theres withhold on present physical condition or mental treatment or current treatment that is the most fruitful source of that particular activity there is something wrong there is something going on here the person is doing something else and they dont want you to know about it although running prehav scales of course puts up the tone arm the usual cause of high tone arms its not that tone arm must not be high as matter of fact they cant run the prehav scale properly without getting high tone arms you understand but im talking about the mechanism of the pcs always showing up with high tone arm you know you process pc for week and then all of sudden for week the pc only has reading of five and half well theres just something wrong in this division the pc is either physically ill and doesnt want to tell you or the pc has some bug on the subject of the mind and doesnt want to tell you and so on or the pc is actually getting treatment in between your treatments and doesnt want to tell you so if you shake those things down during the preclear assessment form to get the withholds off now this is not chatty afternoon over cup of tea youre just going to go right to it and youre going to get the withholds off on this subject now he actually wont mind you getting the withholds off on this subject be kind of relief to him as matter of fact and if he does have withholds on this subject if he does have withholds on this subject and if he doesnt get them off you wont be his auditor thats it but if he does have withholds on this subject and you do get them off then you of course are his auditor obviously you know about these withholds and nobody else knows about them so therefore you must be his auditor follows doesnt it you know things about him now that other people dont know so therefore that follows then that you are the persons auditor youll find session insessionness increases very well if yoou do that now compulsions repressions and fears doesnt necessarily follow in that same category at all and we just couldnt care less its going to be of value to you to know of his compulsions repressions and fears to amount to anything except as gauge of how daffy he is or isnt and thats the only gauge youre going to get out of that its just measure and you can already read that off the graph so you go over that rather rapidly and you get down to criminal record and this too is matter of grave interest to us because people who have criminal records and dont want us to know about it that can make bad show in auditing so lets when we get to k lets once more bear down on the needle and lets examine that needle very carefully on this interrogation on the subject of crimes prison sentences and so forth and lets make sure that weve got that thing showing up its interesting that i had letter from preclear that has gone through london hgc on several occasions over period of time and hes complaining about his case gains he is hes not blaming anybody hes not mad at anybody or anything but hes just written letter and asked to please cant i tell him why or do something about it and the side note that appears on this thing of course is the man has record as long as your arm now we know that here but does his auditor know it there see that could just account for case gain right there in lump sum bang well now if each new auditor he has had has not done preclear assessment form then he feels he has withhold to some degree from that auditor and maybe nobody has ever dug this up in this particular fashion i havent followed back the other data concerning this but that is just an interesting point i very seldom get such letters my letters are usually quite the reverse theyre dear ron i just this and so on and wonderful processing and i feel better and so on but this chap hes just worried about himself thats all so we would also have found him under present physical condition and we would also have found him under compulsions repressions and fears and we might have found him under other mental treatment see it would all have dropped out of the hamper on the preclear assessment form had we done one properly and if every new auditor that had the case had done one for himself although i have said you have to write on this legibly remember it is for you the auditor to facilitate your auditing of the case all right now we get down to one that we couldnt care less about interests and hobbies this will have great bearing on case itd be very unusual once in blue moon he has the hobby of killing little girls in dark woods or something like that but it isnt often and it has very little case bearing it however can serve as cross index to his goals terminal not very important now we have previous scientology processing and this is far too specific when we list the auditors the hours and the emeter reaction and everything else in the hgc or the academy this is just too confoundedly specific and we dont have to be this specific there isnt any reason to be this specific the number of auditing hours he has had he will seldom recall the auditors you want to get to on the case will be buried for the purposes of this preclear assessment so we press him very lightly in this particular line very very lightly so you would do much better to ask him general idea general idea is what you want and thats all otherwise youre going to plow up all of his auditing restimulate all of his auditing youre going to have to take up all of his arc breaks youre going to have to take up all of his arc breaks and failures with past auditors youre going to have to take up all of his successes and youve got another afternoons activity all mapped out in level m unless you say well now briefly and just in general just give some sort of an idea when were you first processed something some date and yes and you had some organization processing and you had all right and field auditors so on all right thats good and so on thank you you know its very brief the best way to get this data is to run the arc break process on the pc and youre not running it at this time and youll find all their auditors and hell find the auditors that are aberrative and so forth but you just want to know how long this fellow has been in processing and this fellow tells you hes been in processing now for 8642 hours and so forth well you know hes lying he hasnt been he hasnt lived long enough i think it takes one lifetime to get that many hours of processing at some fantastic figure per week now when you say list briefly the processes run man thats grim one you take somebody thats been around since 1951 the number of processes run in the first place the pc almost never remembers them and youve got big hangup there and so forth so i would say instead of that instead of that sort of thing id want to know whats been run on you more or less that made change in your case oh theyll tell you those glibly and very rapidly they can remember those but those things that have made change on his case we couldnt care less but at the time this thing was first compiled it was important to know what engrams had been started and hadnt been started you see and then this was taken off the earlier form so it has arrived that way and list the goals attained from such processing well now youve asked him the same thing if you just asked the one i just gave you you said what processes have given you change you see well that just write them diagonally across the 2 and 3 all at once and goals not attained from such processing is an adventurous question to ask pc but should be asked and itd be very good thing to find out what he has not been able to do about processing cause youll be able to refer to that later on and its part of the section it gives you clue of coordination you want to know what hes been trying to do with processing that he hadnt done he might even give you hidden standard all right the present processing goals now hes going to give you some brief goals of one kind or another these are not very important at this particular stage but you want to know what hes trying to do with processing but very often at this stage of the game he just gives you social response well i would like to be better and that sort of thing well you dont want anything more than that now we have whole section here which is the ne plus ultra of the whole thing and we get to what makes this problems intensive we get to section now that was where we wanted to get that was whereat to we wanted to arrive and this we are going to do now with the greatest of care we are going to write this up ad infinitum and if there are not enough spaces were going to make some more here we have life turning points list each major change the pc has experienced in life and that means his whole life ever since he was very small boy or girl and of course youre going to have the pc giving you youre going to see the perfect example of cyclic recall as you do this so dont try to ask for certain period at any given time because youre going to get near present time ones then youre going to get middle range and then youll get early and then youll get near present time ones and then youll get early ones and then youll get middle and then youll get near present time and itll just go back up and down this way but you want to list each one of these carefully because you are now going to use these for assessment so they have to be listed with precision they have to be listed with great precision now what precision well its going to be so that you can say it easily on an assessment youre going to have to say this several times so we dont want it long lengthy and longwinded we want precise statement so thats what we keep asking the pc for major change the pc has experienced in life and the pc may want to know what you mean by major change well when you didnt any longer do what you were doing and started doing something else when you didnt any longer live where you were living and moved elsewhere when you didnt any longer have that state of health but had another state of health ah well oh well you mean you mean and hell tell you something else all right well well get those changes and you take that up very carefully and then get these changes this way well after i had an operation for goiter i found out that i couldnt go out as much so you put down operation for goiter thats all you write major change point then all right what was another major change point well um it was when i it was when i finished my first year in college i had to leave oh well did you go back never went back yeah first year in college so thats what you want so its leaving college is very very excellent way of expressing that see so thats expressed very briefly your next point express them briefly succinctly now each one of these is followed by date and his idea of the date is going to be the wildest scramble you ever heard of so dont press him for an accurate date particularly and dont go pushing on it because the person will do enough hemming and hawing here to last lot of people long time and the dates you get arent going to be very accurate unless you sit down with an emeter and go through timing exercise of putting the things on the time track and were not asking you to do that particularly so ten years ago is good enough but write down something like around 1948 see thats plenty good anything the pc tells you is the date and we go on down the line and we fill out all these major changes now you may find yourself needful of more space in order to get all these major changes and if you do you just clip another piece of paper up at the top of page five on this assessment form and you just keep writing them in the same wise pcs might have lots of them this would be fairly adequate for the usual case but you might find somebody with lot more now hes probably missed great many of these changes he probably hasnt looked at these other things as changes at all so you continue the list with specific requests you want to know when the pc newly joined any religious group thatll be major change point in persons life you see and the pc didnt all right he didnt now when did the pc start going to church again course thats major change point haha start going to church again well that tells us something if i had been doing this on an archbishop in northern greece one night down in athens if id been doing just this i would have pulled half of his aberrations by asking him why he joined the church when he was nineteen in new york city because his sole goal was to die and go to heaven he did have psychosomatic goal which was to keep himself from going blind but he gave the whole story about he was in terrible upset and so he joined the church and here he is at 70 or 80 or 205 or something like that there he was and hes still riding the same stable datum this by the way is interesting maybe in the national geographic sometime or another youve seen monastery picture of monastery in northern greece where the people cant ever walk in and out of the place they have to be lifted in baskets and theyre lifted up the face of the wall in basket this was the archmadrid larchimandritej i think of that particular monastery and he had come down to hed heard of scientology and they had couple of sisters with him i could have pulled his whole case right there clank interesting because the major when did he start going to church again would in this particular case have become when did he become member of the church well he became member of the church after long period of confusion back in his middle teens and that was almost sixty years before interesting and had been riding the same confusion and hed been he was sitting right there on the same chronic somatic fascinating when did the pc subscribe to fad now hes liable to give you anything and even insult you with saying dianetics is one or something like that we dont care what the pc said but when we say fad when we say fad we mean anything everybody else was doing with enthusiasm but we also mean food fads or clothing fads he joined the edwardians he became teddy boy anything like this you see he joined up into something or other but it will indicate change when did the pc begin dieting and the pcs normal first response is to tell you that he never did and you should be very careful about that particular point haha because after moment or two hell find dozen periods of his life when he had to change his eating habits well he was he was in the army and yes well he did start dieting if you want to call it that youll get that kind of response you see he couldnt stand spam he just couldnt stand spam and he stopped eating spam and he hasnt been able to eat meat of that compositetype ever since and he wont eat meat of that compositetype ever since thats it that if you want to call that diet fine all right thats diet but they just serve one more piece of spam and they would have had it that was diet its negative diet of course at that particular level you write down when it was and you want to know what it was so youd say 1943 spam that would be your notation all right what other what other diets have you started off on other diets im not dieting im vegetarian or food faddist or anything like that i have other unusual diets of any kind whatsoever well this one has to be followed up you have to get little bit clever so you have to ask question like this well do you eat differently or have you ever eaten differently from other people that were around you oh well you put it that way yes they eat these poisonous meats all the time and they eat these meats and they didnt care what meat it was and what meat it wasnt and so forth and actually for some years i havent eaten any meat but you see this to the pc is not diet he doesnt define it as such because that is ordinary that is usual and the thing he is doing ordinarily with food is the thing to do with food it isnt what everybody does on the subject of food he never notices that all right hes liable to give you some answer and say well i was out on the china coast and all the chinese were eating rice and who the devil could live on rice all the time but i managed to get some food and i was eating differently than other people then very differently from the other people who were around then they were all eating rice and i knew you couldnt live on rice and so forth and i had to eat other food from that and there was lot of trouble getting other food at that particular time you say when was that and you put down 1948 china not rice thatll all give you clues clues clues something was happening there something weird was going on his life was changed that wont be much of point but this is liable to liven up the next point you see well now did you are there any other any other food changes any other diets or anything like that and he all of sudden tells you for the first time well my family only eats kosher food when is the first time you had any difficulty eating kosher food or finding kosher food and so forth oh well you want to know that that was when i joined the army had lot of trouble had lot of trouble put down kosher food and some sort of date theres upsets associated with all this sort of thing but those are not as important as this one he said well i started to live on lettuce and muldeberries dried muldeberries and lettuce in um 1951 thats right out of the blue you see theres explanation to this of any kind whatsoever you dont say well you did you know you better write down dried leaves or dried muldeberries and lettuce 1951 right there bang because boy he must have run into freight train if you look back of this you see you look back here you wont find anything else happening in 1951 you dont think you know you look back here and mothers death fathers death 1951 where the hell is 1951 nothing happened in 1951 nothing that is just stroke out of the blue and youll get it on such things as diets and fads and that sort of thing much more rapidly than youll get it on something else all right when did the pc leave job and of course this may get very lengthy but you better take down every one of them much more important than the auditing hes had is how many jobs has he left how many how many how many how many how many and you get some sailors for instance and they never show you all their discharges but they were on ship in 1949 and they were on ship for two months in 1955 and they were on ship for one month in 1958 what have you been doing the rest of the time well ive been going to sea what the hell goes on you see theres holes all up and down the line dont you see and something going on during that period its all big notknow as far as youre concerned and as far as the pc is concerned its just all big withhold so when the pc starts to give you his job lines and theres something going wrong with this you want to start asking how long did you hold that job and get his job record so that its somewhat chronological find out his leaving points and at these leaving points he says well hell say i left job i left construction company in 1951 and i left the um yes and i left uh the um merchandising department of taylor sanfords in 1955 you say thats good now youve jumped made an unreasonable assumption you think that from 1951 to 1955 he was in the merchandising establishment at taylor sanfords he wasnt there had been about eight job changes in the middle of the thing see so always find out how long he kept the job that is the only keynote there find out how long he kept that job and then you will see where the missing links are now because the changes are sufficiently interesting in that particular line you had better emeter needle it any other jobs youve left blang what was that one any other jobs you left blang what was that one any other jobs you left what was that blang and so forth and you get pretty good employment record just as number 13s number of lines imply because every one of those he was in coaction with group and person who has too many jobs is having difficulty with coaction mutual motion hes having great difficulty with mutual motion and this lends itself peculiarly to the development of tremendous overts and withholds overts and withholds all stem from mutual motion that is the whole theory moves out of that particular field and job and employment and work are things which are notably milestone mans decline and aberration and that sort of thing its not that theyre aberrative in themselves but he is in mutual action with some group and then finds himself in violent disagreement with some group and then hes in mutual action with another group and finds himself in violent disagreement there well there must have been some confusions some hidden confusions are in that period and by getting job record you can spot lot of hidden confusions now supposing the person is not working person at all then you change the question over to when did the pc leave certain type of activity and youll find out she was housewife and then she was club member and then she was this and then she was that and youll get type of job record which is just an activity record but this whole number 13 of section is devoted to spotting departed or areas of co or mutual motion on the third dynamic you wont have much other record if you dont make full one here now again that all has to be written in such wise that you can easily assess it later because youre going to use this and use this and use this data unlike everything up to and including m and n youre going to use the section till you practically wear out the paper so do your best writing in this particular area make sure that you can read your own writing that would be good thing to be able to do because youre going to assess it and assess it and assess it and assess it all right when did the pc have to take rest ah thats splendid thats real good and those are marvelous because youre going to find those are the points just before which there were prior confusions of magnitude so youre going to find out all these points when he had to take rest and youre going to write all those down and when is the time the pc noticed body difficulty well youre going to write all those down but this is going to be awful commlaggy going to get all that straightened out now when did the pc decide to go away now of course you get wives husbands little children almost anybody subscribes to this one and of course it is always preceded by an area of confusion so heres very fruitful source of confusions now if these things are suddenly start about this stage of the game to be the same areas as youve already recovered dont worry about it just keep writing them down see dont call this to the pcs attention at this stage and say well i see that you left job in in june of 1955 you left job june of 1955 and you started going to church again in june of 1955 and you decided to take rest in july of 1955 well what about that well youre jumping the gun you are jumping the gun thats the sort of thing you do in section p so lets not take up anything here but data you just want data from the pc data from the pc and youll find out soon enough that it adds up and crosschecks and does all that sort of thing now the catastrophe for this whole procedure would be if the pc gave you nothing under the sun but the same date and the same incident of course pc doing that would be nuts but an institutional case would do that and you have one thing to assess all they talk about is when they brought them to the institution or some thing like this you see that would leave you with just one thing to assess but people that you ordinarily audit arent that daffy but remember that if you did that youd have to next time fill out another form if you havent got enough data on the form you fill out another form after youve handled p form all right when did the pc decide to leave and when now thats almost the same question but not quite decide to leave he didnt leave he decided to leave after youve got all the departures then you find out that there were eighteen periods of deciding to depart and not departing and what are you running youre running leave and then failed leave asking him questions about leave and then questions about failed leave simple now when did the pc start being educated in some new line that is doubled over with what have you taken up what have you taken up when did you take up course in this correspondence course in something else you see when did you start to study something else now i just i just had maintenance man out here suddenly take up pottery hadnt studied anything for years and hes suddenly taken up pottery i know theres been catastrophe and confusion in his life someplace isnt any reason for him to take up pottery hes had little connection with pottery around here to amount to anything but thats mr jenners job thats very interesting isnt it hes suddenly moving over into another field from carpentry over into masonry you know and whats happened well i also notice he looks little upset now i havent interrogated him in any way but im just giving you something there that is crossquestion now it isnt anything wrong with taking up new lines isnt anything wrong with studying something new but it might be an indicator it might be thats true of most of these things is the bulk of them are might bes now when did the pcs physical body change characteristics getting this out of women you will have to take the emeter and beat them over the head woman at 110 will never admit that her body changed anything from that of beautiful 16yearold girl or something like that you know its just things they wont talk about so you have to pull that the hard way go ahead and grab it now when did the pc collapse theyve probably omitted telling you anything about this up to that point and when did the pc start new life thats just the same question over again in some other line but this is with magnitude they may have omitted any of those and then when did the pc stop going to parties most girls tell you this they look very sad and they say well i met i met bill and he was stayathome type and so forth and so we stayed home thereafter well ill let you in on something that wasnt the reason they stopped going to parties youll run into it in the p section if this ever assesses out they did various things there were various things occurred about parties there were various heartbreaks and upsets because stopping girl going to parties is only done with sixteeninch guns you just mark big underscore under that they dont easily stop going to parties might have been last lifetime but they it took something to stop them now whos the pc never seen again now you notice this is down toward the end of the section so that if we have to send for the fire department and so forth and get them to dam up the grounds because of the resultant flood the end of this is very much in view because the pc is liable to spill grief charge because youve shaken the pc up considerably by this time you see you ask him for change change change change change youre auditing him like crazy all through this section now all of sudden you say all of sudden you say who have you never seen again and we finally finish up what does the pc now consider his or her major life change and we dont care what the pc said it was we just dont care but its good thing to ask all right let us go back now let us go back now to what we are going to do with all of this data we have now assembled the doggonedest potpourri of data that was ever recorded and if employment offices ever interrogated employment sheets to the degree that we have shaken this one down dont you see even though we did it fairly rapidly man would they know something about their applicants miss jones comes in applies for job as typist where did you work last miss jones lie uh where why did you leave lie here it is you see is there any reason you would not be able to continue long on this job miss jones well reason at all except the doctors only given two months to live you know youd have the lot so were going to take the section were not interested in any other part of this now except as review and cross coordination and were going to take the p section now if you are very wise you will have stopped the section at the end of the section you will have taken break because you didnt start this thing with rudiments and the p section has to be started with rudiments so you either finished that whole thing off and ended the session and that was the auditing for that day or something of the sort or that morning and you start up the p section again so it might take little bit of interesting timing to get this thing straight now this bluntly starts an assessment of the pcs major life changes but you start it in model session and you start right going here with model session and you want to clear the rudiments you want to know if anything upset them you know about what you just covered with them you kind of aim the rudiments you know little bit in the direction of what youve just been doing earlier and if youve only got fifteen minutes left of the session and i find out that you started p section with fifteen minutes left of the session i will be upset you could possibly get away with rapid assessment but you certainly couldnt bank on the assessment and so forth now if you had half an hour or an hour left of your auditing period well by all means do your assessment but dont go any further dont try to do anything with it and the best thing would be to have them in completely different assessment periods because youre going to shake this person up like mad doing an assessment theyre going to be in fit state to be audited let tell you now youre going back here to youre going back here to and i dont care how many doodledaddles or code marks or symbols you put on the side of this you could put 1 divi i mean 10 divisions you know fall or something like that you could make little notations but all youre going to do is read them this now you go down the line you make that notation fall rise dont ever note rise just fall theta bop whatever it is how much and youre going to make it and this time im going to ask you to get clever it doesnt matter much if you assess this wrong but this is wonderful opportunity to get clever on onepass needle judgment after youve finished up reading through this thing once your record and recall and so on are quite adequate to tell you which change point of the persons life registered most you just read it through once rapidly now of course you can do that by saying to the pc you dont have to say word while i am doing this you just sit there and hold those cans and i am going to read all of this off youve got him insession your rudiments are in and so forth and im going to see what this is all about and you simply read this thing off each one and note the reactions that greet each one of these change points when you get over here you will be able to say that it is number 13 something or other was what assessed thats good that got the most reaction on the needle now that completes step one step one consists of that reading it consists of your adjudication of picking out from the emeter reaction needle reaction which one of those life changes that you have gone over in produced the greatest needle response not just fall but what had produced the greatest needle response ordinarily that needle response will be much bigger than the remainder and it will not be unusual for it to be theta bop nice wide staggering theta bop if you found something like that youre right on his rock chain and it audits like mad all right youve got to note that down and square that around now this is disposable form this form p on page seven and you notice its just on one side of the piece of paper only and in mimeographing this thing and repeating its mimeographs that format should be followed because thats this is disposable this is additable after youve done this this gets added to the pcs record and then without throwing away anything from one to six pages you get another form p see and you just keep running new form p and its just on one page one side of the paper very well done here this mimeographing job and of course you look straight at the pc and you say to the pc very meaningfully now that youve got the point it was their leaving taylor sudrows biggest change in their life you see thats the most reaction and you ask the pc what problem existed this is very meaningful its just you plow that question right into him everything else has been rather conversational dont you see and this and that but you just plow this one into him hard and you say what problem existed immediately before you left taylor sudrows all right hes going to tell you now he may give you fact and if he only gives you fact you say yes yes all right thats fine good but state that as problem now what what was the problem connected with this what was the problem the problem connected immediately before you left taylor sudrows well it was that i did the accounts wrong yes good all right what was the problem oh ohoohoohoohoohooh ah i ah i i see i s i see what you mean you want to know what the problem was i didnt like my boss all right good thank you now state that as problem how to keep from going to jail blang you see thats problem but its the first problem they actually state as problem now they may be mystified as to why you wont accept these as problems because they seem good enough problems to them but you could even say to them problem is who when what where how theres some question about problem theres something undecided about problem we want the undecided thing you know the thing that was worrying you the thing you were anxious about before you left taylor sudrows oh well uhhuhhuuuuuuu well thats different ahhahahahaha oh well you ask that way i didnt like my boss you know yeah but what anxiety did you have about it how to keep from going to jail so you write it down now comes little bit of problem how to keep from going to jail now how do you phrase rudiments thing youve got to do shakedown on this sort of thing youve got to do little assessment here sometimes you got to find out what this was all about but its not much of an assessment because its obviously jail that is worry here so your with would have to be changed to about you see and youd say what was unknown about that problem what was unknown with that problem about jail youve got to change the about to with and change it around what was unknown with that problem about jail any such phrasing that gets it across to the pc so that youre running an unknown on it now if he gives you some significance how to keep from worrying oh man thats thats rough one because theres target youre not running any kind of terminal now how do you state this around so that you run about what was unknown about that problem with worrying man that is not going to be any process that makes any sense to anybody are you going to say just worrying worrying is that what it was worrying about what how to keep from worrying worrying about what oh just worrying boy youre really getting defeat here you see problem about just about worrying i just found myself worrying all the time i just found myself worrying and worrying all right in the last moment of defeat you can give up and say what was unknown about your worrying because thats as far as youre going to get in other words dont cave the pc in and dont abandon it just try successfully if possible to find proper terminal to add into this problem if you cant find proper terminal you can move off bit and say what it was because youve got to have the thing run as the pc has it there is sense in doing anything else and he could have problem just about worrying you see so if you cant get him to state noun or get him to state something else about this problem or if you dont get noun out of him you will have to use the exact thing that he said oh well worrying but this is liable to be your response how to keep yourself from worrying yeah well all right how do you keep yourself from worrying were you worrying about something specific well of course of course naturally bill well what is the problem then well how to keep from worrying about bill naturally naturally i mean this idiot you know that kind of reaction all right so your process is what was unknown about that problem with bill see youve gotten the terminal out of the thing but the pc could have problem about just about worrying the pc knows that people who worry go to pieces and the pc finds himself worrying and that is the most problem the pc has got and thats as close as he can come to any terminal and you actually would defeat your purposes by being too forceful about giving him terminal there are times to be reasonable about this sort of thing try to get terminal if you can if you cant get terminal run what hell run the condition and youll still make it but if you do you better watch your havingness and when you finish up that session with model session just hardly ask him if its all right with the room just run tr 10 because if youre running conditional problem his havingness is going to go down it can be done you understand but his havingness is going to go down and in end rudiments youre going to have to run some havingness all right lets take up the next brutal step here rapidly what was unknown about that problem has got to be flattened on the tone arm its got to be flattened on the tone arm and that may take long time and it may take short time but youre going to get the tone arm action out of it and get the twentyminute test on it and so forth because that problem youre really going to take it up and beeat it to death now hes in position to answer number 5 weve got to locate the confusion before that change as number above not before the problem but before the change and now youre going to list the persons present in the confusion and this is going to give you some difficulty because there will be innumerable persons missing so you got to shake that assessment down on the emeter needle were there any more people in that confusion and you keep reading that until you longer get needle reaction youve shaken all the people out of that and the most important person to the whole confusion will be the person who comes up last just take that as general running rule and youll be safe all right you make list of those persons and then lets just read that list off as youve written it right here on the form dont write it anyplace else than on the form and you run rapid assessment which just gets your most needle reaction not by elimination and you write down the name of the person who reacted most on the needle as you read that list and now youve got to get the withholds off from that person now that means that you might have an additional piece of paper that means that you might have written up an additional withhold section it might mean that you have used standard form to get the withholds off or it might mean that you just sat there and got the withholds off what were you withholding from that person what had you done to that person what were you doing at the time that you didnt tell that person about and we want to get the basic withholds off that person but were not going to do fantastic hourafterhour grind to get the withholds off of that person were just going to get the major withholds off of that person youre going to try to clean that person up till that person doesnt react and thats as far as we want it cleaned up we say the persons name we dont get an eneedle meter reaction and then were going to assess the list again leaving the persons name in we dont take names off as we clear them up we just keep leaving their names in because they will turn up again that tells you why were not being terribly thorough so you run down the list get the most reaction and you get the withholds off from that person you get what the person has done to them what the what he hadnt told them what he was unable to tell them remember the three classes of withholds see involuntary withhold the unintentional withhold rather all of those things we get that off and well find out that we ye eventually when weve taken care of all these people and none of these people react anymore on the needle well have cleaned up the confusion but the end of that is when the needle does not react while you read the list with the rudiments in and you dont get reaction all right great great thats the end of that confusion as far as youre concerned and that is it now youve just run that again and then you again as it says it in 9 and 10 you know just keep repeating the same thing till you get all that the people in the confusion off and now you return to the assessment and do all of p again which is to say that you take this p form as complete and you file it with the persons record and you make out brandnew p form in exactly the same way and you go over that thing exactly as you did before now that is the extent of problems intensive how long does it take i dont know how long itll take you to do this on how many pcs but i know that this is terribly productive and this will get out all the hidden standards and itll straighten up most of the present itll straighten up all the present time problems of long duration youll have all kinds of interesting things occurring as result of it it becomes better when you get the havingness and confront process of the pc and run at the same time you could do lot of things they could get lot more complicated and so forth but if you just do this just as it says through here and keep up and finish until you finish every one of these change points of persons life youll find the last ones are going just fast fast fast theyre just disappearing quickly he gets the problem he finds the confusion bang and he finds the withholds on it boom dont be too surprised if the person goes terribly backtrack let them go backtrack all they want to while youre running the problem but that they went back running the problem doesnt let that lure you into getting the confusion before the engram we want the confusion before the change in this life always and we never wander onto the backtrack from standpoint of getting off the confusion but they will of course run into engrams while theyre being audited on the problem and we dont upset them by trying to get them off of it we just audit them but we want the confusion prior to that change in this lifetime so that this thing we dont prevent them from going backtrack but this thing basically mainly handles and is only designed to handle the present lifetime okay well i wish you lots of luck with it i think youve got piece of dynamite in your hands that wont preexplode in your face i think itll do your pcs lot of good okay audience right mm thank you
