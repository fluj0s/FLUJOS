decem ber 2003 the audit included review and assessm ent of internal control system s interviews with staf f analysis of appli cable data and review of the available docum ents and other relevant records 10 during the biennium cms underwent s ubstantial structural staffing and managerial changes in an ef fort to im prove the quality and ef ficiency of the service provided by the registry to the judicial pro cess the overall conclusion is that cms is now providing m ore effective support services to their clients which has im pacted on the num ber of recom mendations m ade iv audit findings and recommendations governance and mandate 11 current arrangem ents for governance of cms activities were found to be adequate and in accordance with ictr rules and practices 12 cms had an approved mandate and missi on and oios was satisfied that the proposed am endm ents to the directive d ealing with rules and practice between cham bers and registry reflected current operating practices 2 b organisational structure and functions appeals unit based in arusha 13 oios is of the opinion that there is scope to reduce the size of the unit by one professional post which would generate savings of approxim ately us120000 per biennium the duties of the head of the appeals unit had recently been revised and involved fewer responsibilities than when the job was last classified in 1999 b review of the volum of work and the com plexity of the responsibilities of the two full tim professional staff m embers suggested to oios that the current shape and structure of the unit required review c the judicial proceedings unit perfor ms similar work and review of the work suggested scope for possible m erger of the two units recommendation to optim ise resources and im prove efficiency the registrar should consider the possibility of discontinuing at least one prof essional post with an estim ated saving of approxim ately us120000 per biennium through review of the work of appeals unit in arusha and the possibility of m erging the unit with the judicial proceedings unit rec 01 14 ictr commented that this recommendation would be reviewed by the registrar in the broader framework of the ongoing assessment of the systems pertaining to the provision of support services to the chambers and the parties by the court management section oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon receipt and review of details of costs savings arising from review of the m erger of the appeals unit with the judicial proceedings unit b appeals subunit based in the hague 15 the audit team noted that the head of unit was not providing legal and judicial supervision to the ictr appeals cham ber support unit in the hague and was not providing substantive legal support such as drafting judgem ents orders and decisions upon notification of this fact ictr took immediate action and the deputy registrar issued rem inder to the head of unit on his responsibilities and the deputy registrar icty was requested to monitor his perf ormance the newly recruited deputy registrar icty will be involved in the pas of the head of unit and the level of involvem ent and the form of m onitoring to be undertaken was under developm ent at the tim of the audit oios is satisfied with actions undertaken and recom mendation is raised 16 the num ber of appeals docum ents handled approxim ately two pages per day suggested that dedicated p2 staff was not warranted and the registrar should consider abolishing this post and consider alternatives such 3 as delegating the work to one of the five professionals within the ictr appeals cham ber support unit this would allow savings of approxim ately us 120000 per biennium recommendation to im prove utilisation of resources the registrar should review the continued need for the p2 post in the appeals unit in the hague and whether the work can be transferred to the appeals cham ber support unit at an estim ated saving of us120000 per biennium rec 02 17 ictr commented that this recommendation would be reviewed by the registrar in the broader framework of the ongoing assessment of the systems pertaining to the provision of support services to the appeals chamber by the registry oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon receipt and review of details of costs savings arising from review of the continued need for the p2 post in the appeals unit in the hague and whether the work can be transferred to the appeals cham ber support unit c judicial records and archives unit jrau 18 jrau has eight docum ent assistants four of whom have been assigned to other parts of cms on full tim basis at tim when sixty percent of their tim should be spent on the preparation of docum ents for transfer to the archives at united nations headquarters unhq the assignm ents have also not been accom panied with any clear docum entation on who is accountable for m anaging the staff recommendation to ensure that the judicial records and archives unit has the staff it needs to perform the duties allocated to it and to ensure that any staff assigned to different duties within cms have clear understanding of their reporting lines roles and responsibilities the chief cms should review whether the current reassignm ent of staff is preventing the unit from fulfilling its duties and if not whether the reassignm ent should be made perm anent and reflected in the organigram or the m anagers to whom the staff have been tem porarily assigned are m ade the first reporting officers for the pas to reflect that they have responsibility for over 50 percent of the staff m embers tim rec 03 19 ictr takes note of the recommendation and indicates that the situation depicted simply reflects the challenge the management of the section is faced with ie cope with increasingly high workload with an understaffed workforce in order to operate in such context management of the section has been trying to be as creative and flexible as possible solutions envisaged so far command job enlargement and job enrichment for staff concerned the ideal solution is the recruitment of additional staff members objectively in context of limited resources and increased demands some operations have to be sacrificed from time to time at this poi nt in time the ictrs priority is to 4 increase the number of active cases and to expedite the overall judicial process transfer of archives to the unhq is equally important and should have received more resources for its implementation in terms of priority one unfortunately has to choose the reporting lines currently in place are adequate however the issue is being reviewed and any corrective action that needs to be taken in the future will be done oios appreciates the additional clarif ication explaining the context in which staf f utilization is occurring and would suggest that there is need to rethink the structure and operation of jrau oios will close the recom mendati on upon receipt of the results of the review undertaken and notification that the pas of affected staff m embers has been changed to reflect actual reporting lines and work carried out or more fundam ental review of jrau structure and operation is to be undertaken c planning courtroom utilisation 20 oios is of the opinion that there appeared to be adequate arrangem ents for courtroom utilisation ictr has three trial cham bers each of which can accom modate in shift system two trials per day courtroom utilisation was m onitored against judicial calendar and case m inutes were produced reflecting the activities of each cham ber indicating the commencem ent and closing tim at the end of each week workload statistics were produced showing the num ber of court sessions per case and per cham ber court room utilisation was on average f ive to six court sessions per day in addition trial com mittee was set up in novem ber 2003 with representatives from the three organs of ictr to look at all cases pending before the tribunal to assist in the scheduling of cases and to develop long term plans plans up to the year 2005 have been developed to date b work plans 21 oios reviewed the work plans for the period 2003 2004 for the four operational units and noted problem s w ork plans were prepared in accordance with stai20023 perform ance appraisal system and were in agreem ent with job descriptions and cms mandate and mission d internal and external reporting 22 chief cms subm its an activity report to the registrar through the deputy registrar

general assem bly and security council the reports for the biennium 20022003 were reviewed and found to be accurate com plete and prepared in tim ely manner 23 workload indicators which reflect the functions of the staff m ember have been developed for the operational units the workload statistics are updated each week but oios noted that with the exception of the court 5 reporters unit the workload database was not used to develop perform ance indicators to enable an assessm ent of efficiency and effectiveness of work undertaken which could then be linked to the pas and assist in determ ining adequacy of resources recommendation to assist in m onitoring efficiency of operational units chief cms should ensure that the statistics provided by staff are m onitored and verified by all supervisors and the statistics are used to develop perform ance indicators for each operational unit rec 04 24 ictr commented that it accepts the recommendation as it relates to further developing relationship between workload indicators and performance indicators it is worth noting however that by its very nature court reporting like translation easily allows the establishment of relationship between workload statistics and quantified performance indicators the collection of such data is not the prime function of anyone in cms it was developed as response to our budgetary and resource requirements the system was previously praised by external auditors adding extra tasks of verification of such large amount of data could be counter productive the system in place is tried and tested one the major improvement in this area is the further automation of the collection and compilation of the statistics the data collected is accurate as far as any such data can be nevertheless appropriate efforts will be undertaken to determine the feasibility and utility of linking data collected to performance indicators for all operational units of the section with the assistance of oios oios thanks ictr for the clarification and fully appreciates the effort being m ade by cms to collect perform ance statistics oios thanks cms for its recognition that the value of such data lies in how it is used to assist in improving ef ficiency and is willing to assist with the im plem entation of the recom mendation that will be closed upon receipt and review of the system developed for m onitoring and verification of perform ance statistics which includes the developm ent of perform ance indicators archiving archiving 25 each day seven hours of video and audio recordings are produced

indication of tim efram has been developed by the audio visual archivist for the im provem ent of the archival storage and preservation status of the audiovisual collection of ictr the action plan is based on guidance from the united nations archives and records managem ent section unarms current arrangem ents are considered to be adequate and m eeting the archiving needs of ictr but should be reviewed in light of the planned increase in judicial proceedings 6 b redaction 26 ictrs audiovisual m aterial needs to be redacted before it can be transferred to any public archives cms have estim ated that there is backlog of approxim ately 32000 hours of recording that needs to be redacted at cost in excess of us1 m illion and that an additional am ount of approxim ately us700000 per year is required to prevent the backlog from increasing and to undertake realtim redaction oios reviewed and agreed with the assessm ent of ictr and the need for this activity to be undertaken to fulfil its mandate of ensuring that the public have access to the tapes and transcripts of the tribunal whilst at the sam time ensuring the safety of the protected witnesses in accordance with article 21 of its statute recommendation to fulfil ictrs m andate to ensure that the public have access to the tapes and transcripts of the tribunal and at the sam time to ensure the safety of the protected witnesses in accordance with article 21 of its statute the registrar needs to pr epare paper outlining why redaction is needed and the cost involved which should form the centre of campaign strategy to seek public or private funds to clear the backlog of audio visual m aterial to be redacted rec 05 27 ictr commented that it fully supports the recommendation that should be seen as priority for the tribunal the arms commissioned nizette audiovisual report had also made mention of this issue detailed report was submitted to the registrar in december 2003 cms is unable to move on this until resources are mobilized this is an organizationwide issue and not purely cmsjrau oios appreciates the response and will close the recom mendation upon notification of the actions taken with respect to redaction to ensure that the public has access to the tapes and transcripts of the tribunal and at the sam time to ensure the safety of the protected witnesses in accordance with article 21 of its statute c trim 28 cms acquired and im plem ented an electronic recordkeeping database trim which allows tribuna l staff to access judicial docum ents filed with the registry and the general public to access unclassified docum ents oios found adequate arrangem ents in place for data integrity d backup of electronic data 29 as cms does not have backup facilities edp does daily and weekly backups of the server used by cms and the backup tapes are stored in an offsite location which is outside of the building but within the com pound an extensive analysis was done for the selection of this location and several considerations were m ade such as the distance from building security connectivity accessibility and safety all plausible locations were considered and this option was found to be the m ost suitable given the environm ent in the opinion of oios adequate analysis was done about situating of the storage facility 7 storage of audiovisual records 30 the current capacity for storing audiovisual records is adequate however based on current usage and the proposed expansion of court proceedings the current storage is expected to run out in under two years recommendation chief cms should explore options for additional storage space for audiovisual m aterials to accom modate the growing collection rec 06 31 ictr commented that it accepts th recommendation storage space is an ongoing issue that is routinely reviewed by us oios thanks ictr for the positive response and will close the recom mendation upon notification of the actions undertaken to address the need for additional storage space for audiovisual m aterials to accom modate the growing collection f access to archives 32 record is kept of individuals who have authorised access to archives and who actually accesses the archive in the opinion of oios the absence of such records provides insufficient protection for the docum ents which could adversely im pact the integrity of the judicial process as result of delays in proceedings and exposure of protected witnesses jrau explained that their staff m embers know who the authorised users are and one is allowed access unless staff m ember is on duty recommendation to enhance the m onitoring m easures in place for access to archives chief cms should install closed circuit cam era and request chief safety and security section sss to generate from their database quarterly list of authorized personnel having access to the archive for review and confirm ation by jrau rec 07 33 ictr commented that it supports the recommendation as it relates to the installation of close circuit camera feasibility of the recommendation will be reviewed in consultation with other relevant sections of the tribunal due consideration being given to the

exhibits when filed with jrau and to carry out checks to ensure that exhibits returned to jrau are in the sam state as originally filed all changes should be logged with an explanation of what happened and log of all changes should be provided to chief jrau on quarterly basis for review and determ ination of any additional action that m ight be required rec 08 35 ictr commented that consideration would be given to the feasibility and utility of the proposed mechanism the movement of documents is formalized and it is felt that the insertion of another layer of control could be counterproductive in the context of increased workload oios thanks ictr cms for the additional inform ation and for its willingness to consider the recom mendation oios is of the view that it is im portant for jrau to look after exhibits placed in its care and to ensure their integrity oios views this matter very seriously and will close the recom mendation upon notification that adequate
