introduction both chambers of congress have passed comprehensiv legislation to reauthorize expiring programs at the food and drug administration fda and to expand the agencys authority to help ensu re the safety of cer tain medical products the bills are the food and drug administr ation revitalization act s 1082 and the food and drug administration amendmen ts act of 2007 hr 2900 s 1082 and hr 2900 represent the most comprehens ive fda legislation since the food and drug administration modernizati on act of 1997 fdama pl 105115 the primary driver of the legislation is the renewal of fdas authority for two key user fee programs set to expire at the end of fy2007 the prescription drug user fee act pdufa pl 107188 and the medical device user fee and modernization act mdufma pl 107250 fda had reportedly urged congress to complete its reauthorization efforts before august 1 2007 rather than by the programs termination date of october 1 2007 because of requirement that fda notify employees at least 60 days in adva nce of layoffs which would be necessary without pdufa and mdufma funds1 the media report that fda has switched to reserve funds to forestall the issuance of layoff notifications the effect of which is hiring freeze at fda2 in addition the fda commissioner has reportedly stressed that the funding uncertainty is harming the morale of employees 30 of whom are at point where they can retire the bills also would reauthorize two other expiring authorities which are related to pediatric pharmaceuticals the best pharmaceuticals for children act bpca pl 105115 reauthorized in pl 107109 and the pediatric research equity act prea pl 108155 in add ition the bills address number of other issues of concern to congress and to the public the fda an agency within the department of health and human services hhs regulates the safety of most human foods3 all animal feeds and certain other products such as cosmetics the agency also regulates the safety and effectivenesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34089crs2 4 regulation of biologics for anim use is overseen by the usdaof human drugs biologics eg vaccines medical devices and animal drugs4 those products regulated for effectiveness must be revi ewed and approved by fda before they can be placed in commerce process called premarket approval fda is tasked with postmarket surveillance for these products as well products regulated only for safety may enter commerce with little fda oversight though the agency may inspect production fac ilities and require that cer tain good manufacturing practices be carried out fda has the stat utory authority to withdraw from commerce any product it regulates that it determines to be unsafe media coverage of issues re lated to the safety of food eg spinach drugs eg vioxx and medical devices eg cardi ac stents have brought congressional attention to fdas performance and the funding it has available to carry out its statutory responsibilities for those products requiring premarket approval central issue for the 110th congress is how best to balance the need for the agency to help speed the products it regulates to market if they are safe and effective and correct them or keep or remove them from the ma rket if they are not for human foods animal feeds and other products not requiri ng premarket approval key issues relate to fdas ability to assure product safety and protect public health by preventing health threats from occurring or by iden tifying and responding to problems quickly drug and device user fees in order to bring revenue into fda to help speed products to market congress has passed several measures authorizing fda to collect user fees from the products manufacturers some have questioned whether the agencys reliance on fees it collects from the companies that it regulates is appropriate calling instead for greatly increased appropriations for the agency nevertheless efforts to reauthorize the two expiring user fee authorities pduf and mdufma are already underway income from pdufa and mdufma repres ents by far the largest proportion of fdas user fee revenue and signif icant proportion of the agencys overall budget according to fdas fy2008 budget request pdufa will generate 339195000 and mdufma will genera 47500000 combined these fees would account for 87 of fdas user fee revenue and 19 of its total program level budget in fy2008 pdufa was first enacted in 1992 pl 102571 and has been reauthorized twice once by the food and drug ad ministration modern ization act of 1997 fdama pl 105115 and second time by the public health security and bioterrorism preparedne ss and response act of 2002 pl 107188 pdufa authorizes the fda to collect fees from companies that produce certain human drugs and biological products and to use the revenue for the review of new product applications pdufa also incorporates by reference performance goals aimed primarily at reducing fda premarket review timeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34089crs3 mdufma first enacted in 2002 establis hed user fees for fdas review of medical device applications like pdufa mdufma incorporated by reference performance goals for many types of pr emarket device reviews mdufma also allowed thirdparties to c onduct establishment inspections and added new regulatory requirements for reprocessed singleuse devices the expiring authorities within mdufma are those related to user fees and the associated performance goals pediatric drug research in part to protect children from the risks of participating in clinical trials researchers did not often test drugs on that population as result information about appropriate dosage levels for and potential side effects of dult medications in children were unknown frequently leaving c linicians with pediatric patients the choice of prescribing nothing or some thing with an unknow n effect in 1997 congress gave fda tool in bpca to encourage pediatric drug research extended marketing exclusivity in exchange for trials investigating drugs effect on pediatric populations meanwhile fdas atte mpts to require as part of new drug applications assessments of how new drugs would affect pediatric populations were stopped by the courts until congress in 200 3 codified that requirement in prea bpca and prea provide marketing excl usivity incentives and requirements for studying pediatric use of both on and offpatent drugs other fda issues the following topics are addressed in one or both reauthorization bills pediatric medical devices it has been reported that developing medical devices for children is less profitable and more problematic than developing them for adults this is because fewer children need medical devices than adults and because children have physical attributes eg size biochemistry growth rates activities and environmental influences that vary from those of adults the result has been characterized as critical need for pediatric medical devices that help diagnose and treat diseases and conditions affecting children both s 1082 and h r 2900 contain provisions offering incentives to manufacturers to create pediatric medical devices and giving fda the authority to require postmarket studies of approved pediatric devices to ensure their continued efficacy and safety drug safety while premarket clinical trials reveal many of the adverse effects of medical products others may not beco apparent until product is on the market this may be because the adverse effects require peri od of years or decades to manifest or it may be because the adverse effects are so rare that they require use by large number of people for them to be recognized as dr ugrelated in some instances only small proportion of people who will ta ke the drug are

large swath of the population to use drug before the adverse effect is seen s 1082 and hr 2900 include pr ovisions focused on buttressing fdas system for collecting data on marketed pr oducts sifting through the massive amounts of information to identify situations that merit fda action and providing new authorities to allow fda to require manufacturers to take some actions clinical trials databases medical journals tend only to publish the results of clinical trials demonstrating products effectiveness as negative studies do not draw readers in the same way product manufacturers may be re luctant to make unsuccessf ul results public as well to avoid both alerting potential customers to problems and informing competitors of their activities however in 2004 congress and others raised questions about the safety and effectiveness of several fdaapproved biomed ical products about which negative trial results had not been publicly disclosed eg antidepressants cardiac stents5 the issue of public access to negative trial results then gained significant traction both s 1082 and hr 2900 c ontain provisions relating to the public registration of clinical trials and the public posting of their results conflicts of interest fda uses advisory committees to provide the agency with independent advice from outside experts on issues related to human and veterinary drugs biological products medical devices and food dvisory committees make recommendations to fda which fda may or may not follow to be credible and useful many say that committees need to be free from or reduce conflicts of interest however others note that the most expert members in the field are often those involved directly or indirectly in the activities about which fda is seeking advice creating the potential for such conflicts in 2006 and 2007 the media has reported that fda advisory committees are biased in favor of drug approval and that many committee members have conflicts of interest6 both s 1082 and hr

reaganudall foundati on nonprofit corporation that would support fda in those tasks importation of prescription drugs the high cost of prescription drugs in the united states has prompted some consumers to seek medications from foreign sources current law permits only the manufacturer of prescription drug to import it such importation is tightly regulated by fda based on law because im ports acquired outside of this regulated chainofcustody may come from foreign s ources not subject to the same rigorous safety and inspection requi rements that fdaregulate d manufacturers and importers face the law prohibits all other drug importation some lawmakers have tried to find ways to allow access to lower priced medications perhaps enabling individuals or commercial importers to purchase medications from foreign sources while still ensuring the products safety one title of s 1082 was written to allow and regulate some importation of prescription drugs an amendment to require the secretary of hhs hereinafter referred to as the secretary to certify that the program would be safe and costeffective effectively nullifies the detailed drug importation language food safety since 1906 fda has had responsibility for regulating the safety of most food products its authority has volved over time to reflect dvances in food science and to address problems that have arisen with

reauthorization and report requirements the senate bill would codify within ffdca 735 which it would rename as drug fees certain core elements of the prescription drug user fee program that although included in pdufa i ii and iii were never pl aced into the ffdca first it would require the secretary to submit annual performance and fiscal reports to congress second it would requi re the secretary

examine its handling of drug safety iom res ponded with 2006 report that addressed the agencys organizational culture science and expertise regulation communication and resources16 at the same time many consumers health experts and members of congress looked for ways to enhan ce fdas actions to protect the public s 1082 title ii drug safety and h r 2900 title ix enhanced authorities regarding postmarket safety of drugs refl ect those concerns they would establish some new authorities and expand others to allow fda to identify postmarket drug safety problems and to correct or minimize them active surveillance and assessment although the senate and house bills di ffer on timetables nd organization both would require that the secret ary establish publicprivate partnerships to develop postmarket risk identification and analys is system using electronic databases risk evaluation and mitigation strategies current law allows fda to require postmarket study as condition of its initial approval of ma rketing application the law does not authorize fda to add such requirements after approval though fda does recommend that postmarket studies be conducted for produc ts on the market many obs ervers believe that such recommendations and requests do not creat enough needed postmarket studies17 thus the senate and house bills propos strengthened authority and set of procedures to support fdas postmarket safety activities at the core would be risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems both bills would authorize the secr etary to require that the sponsor of drug or biologic application or supplement to an appli cation submit proposed rems the bills differ on the criteria they would require that the secretary use the house bill language calls for preapprova l to ensure that the bene fits of the drug involved outweigh the risks of the drug the secr etary could require rems after product has been approved if the secretary beco mes aware of new safety information based in part on the sponsors required st atement as part of the application of whether it believes rems or postmarket st udy or clinical tria l should be required the senate bill requires that the secretarys determination be based on signal ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34089crs15 serious risk with the drug and that rems is necessary to assess such signal or mitigate such serious risk this authority also would cover supplem ental applications concerning new indication for use of an approved product and applications for the marketing of generic product both bills call for all rems to include certain core elements including timeframes and other elements that the secretary could require elements might include instructions to patients and clinicia ns and restrictions on distribution or use and system to monitor their implementation both bills would allow waiver from rems restrictions on distribution or use for certain dical countermeasures in the time of declared public health em ergency the senate bill would create mechanism to assure access to drug with rems for offlabel use for serious or lifethreatening disease or condition most elements considered in rems are part of current fda practice the rems process proposed by s 1082 nd hr 2900 would add authority for structured followthrough dispute resolution and enforcement both bills would require reviews of approved rems at specified times initially and then as the secretary would determine they lay out detailed procedures for the review of both proposed rems and required or voluntary ssessments or modifications both the senate and the house bills would establish drug safety oversight board made up of federal government scientists nd health care practitioners which would participate in resolving disputes between the secretary through fda scientists and products sponsor the bills would require the secretary through the drug safety and risk management advisory committee to evaluate whether the various rems elements assure safe use of drug and whet her they limit patient access or place an undue burden on the health care system postmarket studies both bills would authorize the secret ary to require postapproval studies or clinical trials but they differ on the criteria for determining whether they are necessary according to the senate bill the secretary in addition to routine active surveillance and other requirements would have to assess signal of serious risk with use of drug or to identify based on review of demonstrated pattern of use of the drug unexpected serious risks in domestic population the house bill unlike s 1082 addressing this outside of the rems process would authorize the secretary to require based on scientific information postapproval study to assess known risk assess signals of serious risk or to identify serious risk labeling the senate bill would require the sponsor and the secretary to notify each other upon acquiring new safety information that they think should be included in drugs labeling for times when sponsor disagrees with the secretarys request to preparehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34089crs16 supplemental application to change the labeling the bill woul d set up multilevel process with defined time limits invol ving meetings dispute review and recommendations by the drug safety ov ersight board and if the secretary determines necessary

information to order labeling change both bills include time limits for sponsor and secretary the labeling provisions also include dispute resolution procedure advertising both bills would authorize the secretary to require submission of certain advertisements to the secr etary for review before dissemination although they set different criteria for the secretarys decision the hous bill refers to television ads and specifies that the secretary could recommend but not require changes the senate bill refers to advertisements not distinguishing among the media both bills would require clear and conspicuou s presentation of side effects and contraindications enforcement by allowing the secretary to impose civil monetary penalties for violations of certain requirements both bills would give fda new enforcement tool for violating rems both bills would aut horize fines of up to 250000 the senate also would set 15000 minimum per viol ation and up to 1 million for violations adjudicated in single proceeding th house bill would include additional civil penalties if violation were to continue after the secretary had provided notice 10 million per violation not to exceed 50 million for all violations adjudicated in single proceeding for violation that is continuing in nature and poses substantial threat to public health the secretary c ould fine the sponsor up to 1 million per day both bills would allow the secretary to consider drug not in compliance with certain elements of its rems to be misbranded the house bill explicitly states that sponsor could not market product with rems if it is not in compliance with rems the senate and house bills would establish separate civil penalty authority for the dissemination of false or misleading directtoconsumer dtc ad for prescription drug the house bill fine for first violation would be up to 250000 with fines for subsequent violations not to exceed 500000 each the senate bill would authorize lower fines up to 150000 for first violation and up to 300000 for subsequent violations funding both bills would authorize increased appropriations to support components of the proposed drug safety provisions for the surveillance and assessment activities both would authorize the secretary to use 25 million of pdufa fees each year tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34089crs17 carry out those activities for rems and other drug safety activities in this title the senate bill would increase the revenue allowed under pdufa by 225 million over fys 2008 through 2012 and designate its use fo r drug safety activities the house bill would authorize appropr iations of 125 million for that fiveyear period ie 25 million annually antibiotic drugs the house bill would require the secret ary to issue guidance for the conduct of clinical trials of antibiotic drugs nd require the secretary to convene public meeting regarding orphan antib iotic products it would so authorize appropriations of 30 million for each of the next five fys for grants and contracts to develop orphan drugs the senate bill would c onsider antibiotics as orphan products and authorize 35 million for each of those fiscal years the senate bill includes other provisions regarding antibiotic access and innovation one would provide incentives extended marketing exclusivity for the development of certain antibiotics anticounterfeiting technologies the senate bill would require within specified timeframe that the packaging of any prescription drug incorporate st andardized numerical identifier and overt optically variable counterfe itresistant technologies the house bill would require the secretary to develop standards and evaluate technologies to secure the distribution system against prescription drugs that are counterfeit diverted or substandard or damaged drug safety provisions in only one bill some drug safety provisions appear in only one or the other bill many are reports to congress on the implementation of provision or studies of options

medication to the fda log onto httpwwwfdagovmedwatch or call 1800fda1088 in s 1082 alone within the drug safety title of the senate bill provisions would require that the secretary establish an advisory committee on risk communication and develop and maintain website content to include an extensive range of drug safety information includi ng summaries of surveillance data and documents from drug approval and biologics licensing applications such as summary of conclusions from all reviewing disciplines and staff disagreements and recommendations the senate bill would also require that statelegalized medical marijuana be subject to fdas full regulatory requireme nts in addition upon the approval of neglected or tropical disease product it w ould require the secretary to award to its sponsor priority review voucher which that sponsor may transfer including byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34089crs18 sale to sponsor of new drug applica tion the recipient of the voucher would then be

provisions requiring the publication of the results of many clinical trials registry s 1082 and hr 2900 woul d require the registration of most clinical trials involving drugs devices and biologics not just those involving treatments for life threatening conditions and would include international trials on products with or seeking fda approval however hr 2900 would forestall the public release of registrysubmitted medical device information until after fda had cleared or approved the device s 1082 would exem pt newly created pediatric postmarket surveillance clinical trials from registry requirements and would allow the voluntary registration of clinical trials that are not required to be submitted both bills would link the timing of certain requirements to the trials completion date hr 2900 would link the definition of completion date to the collection of data relevant to primary and secondary outcomes both bills would require the responsible party rp for trial the trial sponsor or possibly principal investigator to comply with the bills provisions both bills articulate certain requirements for when principal investigator might serve as rp however only hr 2900 would require that principal investigator have control over the data and right to publish trial results in order to serve as rp both bills would expand the type of information that must be included in the registry

the results database s 1082 specifies few more criteria than does hr 2900 by which the registry must be s earchable including fo r example the age group studied in the trial s 1082 also specifies timeline by which the nih director must make registry information pub lic and would require the registry to link to certain public clinical trial results information for example from fda and nih results database both hr 2900 and s 1082 have provisions related to the establishment of public database containing the results of clinical trials however only hr 2900 provides specific instructions on the crea tion of the results database s 1082 in contrast would require the s ecretary to create database through rulemaking based on the recommendations of the nih direct or hr 2900 specifies for the results database certain searchable categories the timing of required submissions and their public posting and that the information s ubmitted be truthful and regularly updated requirement that results summaries be nonpromotional was removed from an earlier draft of the bill and replaced by requirement that the comptroller general conduct study and report to congress on whet her information in the results database is promotional regarding the timing of posting into the results database hr 2900 would require that the results of preapproval studies be made public with in 30 days of number of possible events including the secretary issuing not substantially equivalent nse letter regarding medical device19 the issuance of an nse letter does not necessarily mark the conclusi on of an fda application for device manufacturer manufacturer may opt to apply to fda for premarket approval20 thus the timing provision could result in clin ical trial informa tion being made public regarding device for which fda action was still pending parallel provision regarding studies pertinent to new use of drug or device already on the market does raise the same issue it would allow for posting delay of up to two years if thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34089crs20 manufacturer certified to the secretary that filing with fda for new use would soon be made coordination compliance and enforcement both bills include coordination complia nce and enforcement provisions hr 2900s compliance provisions would apply to registry and results database requirements whereas llel provisions in s 1082 would only apply to registry provisions hr 2900 contains provisions re garding enforcement of results database requirements and coor dination between registry and results database and would prohibit the secretary from filing approving or clearing fda applications with noncompliant trials s 1082 would require fda applicati ons to include certification of registry requirement compliance on controversial provi sion that was dropped from hr 2900 and was never present in s 1082 specified that the act would not have had any legal effect on and thus would have llowed causes of action for damages under state law current law does not specify penalties or enforcement mechanisms related to registry requirements general mechan isms for enforcing compliance with fda requirements may be applicable but have not been applied by the fda both hr 2900 and s 1082 contain specific penalties fo r noncompliance in its enforcement provisions hr 2900 refers to but would not amend relevant ffdca sections allowing penalties of 10000 per day and capping penalties at 15000 for individuals and nonprofits s 1082 would amend relevant ffdca sections and would allow penalties of 10000 for first

fdas current approach conflict of interest may require potential committee member to disclose the conflict refrain from voting andor not participate in committee depending on the nature of the conflict the law is articulated primarily in three sources 1 the federal advisory committee act 5 usc appendix faca 2 the fda advisory committee policy 21 usc 355n and 3 law governing special

advisory committees to apply to committees providing advice on all topics both bills define advisory committee as facacovered entity that provides the secretary with advice and recommendations regarding activities of the fda and define financial interest as defined under 18 usc 208 this definition covers activities such as persons or their family members current or future employment trusteeship or directorship on its face it does not apply to activities such as stock ownership former employment or receipt of grant or contract although fdas regulations do require disclosure of these types of activities an alternative definition offered in 21 usc 355n has been interpreted to require disclosure relating to broad range of activities including those listed above however as encoded in statute this definition applies only to drug and biologics committees not to medical device committees s 1082 and hr 2900 would require dvisory committee member recruitment mechanisms generally focused on reaching experts from areas such as academia medical research institutions public intere st and consumer groups both contain provisions to discourage financ ial conflict waivers hr 2900 contains section that would specifically permit the participation of nonvoting guest expert with financial interest if the secretary determined that the guest had particular required expertise s 1082 and hr 2900 would require advisory committee members full financial disclosure prior to meeting on related matter they would preclude voting by member with conflict of interest unless exempted by the office of government ethics the bills would allow waiver of the voting restriction if necessary to provide the committee with ssential expertise hr 2900 would only allow one such waiver per
