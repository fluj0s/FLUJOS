this report will be updated periodically panamas canal and economic relations with the united states the united states and panama have entered into many agreements over the past 150 years the most prominent ones defining their relative stake in the famous canal that traverses the central american isthmus bisecting panamanian territory see figure 1 the canal has been critical factor influencing panamanian domestic and foreign affairs and like earlier uspanama agreements the ftas significance is tied to panamanian economy that has formed largely around the canalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32540

since first explored by the spanish at the turn of the sixteenth century interest in panama has centere d on its unique geographic charact eristic the slender distance separating the atlantic and pacific oceans because of the transit possibilities this presented first for peruvian gold and othe r colonial trade panama was natural crossroads for the movement of commerce strategic position that grew as the world became ever more traveled and integrated in fact panamas destiny became fused to its geography and over time to the vagaries of foreign interests that sought to take advantage of it particul arly the united states panama was swept to independence from spain on november 28 1821 becoming part of the gran colombia regi onal group by this point both the united states and britain had openl coveted the prospect of an interoceanic connector well before construction of canal could begin the united states displaced britain as the dominant foreign influence and co mpleted crossisth mian railroad in 1855 this project was driven by the westward expansion of the united states which included an anticipated southern water route to the west coast to secure this transit system as well as the safety of goods nd people using it the united states resorted to armed intervention in panama some 14 times in the 19th century by the time the united states sought permission to construct canal precedent had already been set to use military force for defense of us interests in panama6 the initial us effort to build canal required concession from colombia allowing the united states to complete the bankrupt french project abandoned in 1889 in early 1903 the details were set down in treaty ra tified by the us senate but unanimously rejected by the colombian legislature the united states responded by reaching out to the growing panamanian successionist movement on november 3 1903 in quick and bloodless move encour aged by the offshore presence of us warships panama separated from colombia the united states immediately recognized panama as an independent stat and in return pa nama signed the buneauvarilla treaty ceding to the united states the rights to construct canal and to control it in perpetuity7 the panama canal opened in 1914 leading to us dominance in the economic and at times political life of panama although both countries benefitted from its operations the relationship wa s far from equal which along with the perpetual us presence generated nagging resentment frequent protests and periodic violence over the tangible loss of national sovereignty this tension remained dominant feature of uspanamanian relations until the canal was ceded back to panama in 1977 under terms defined in th panama canal tr eaties signed by presidents jimmy carter and omar

greater economic benefits from its ownership the canal operations by themselves account fo r approximately 6 of panamas gdp with the largest and fastest growing tra ffic volume generated along the us east coasttoasia trade route especially us china about onethird of all cargo passing through the canal has its origin or destination in the united states the canals total economic impact however is far greater supporting income and jobs in various services industries including ware housing ship registry and repair salvage operations insurance banking and tourism the two major ports at either end of the canal have been privatized and moderniz ed portion of the canal was widened in 2001 but panama faces difficult and expe nsive challenge to enhance the capacity of the entire canal to accommodate much larger postpanamax ships9 panama held national referendum on the proposed 525 billion expansion on october 22 2006 which passed by wide margin with transfer of the canal and its operations to panama the country also inherited substantial amount of land and physical assets the conversion of these assets to private use has been boon to the panamanian economy but not without considerable costs and investment as well privatization efforts eased the transformation of former us governme nt facilities to produc tive panamanian use which has included refurbishi ng the

prospects as business venture but because it is forw ard looking rather than relying on the maquiladora business model co mmon in much of the region12 at the start of the 21st century the canal and close ties with the united states are still the defining features of panamas ec onomy but in the past these traits have hindered panamas par ticipation in regional integration although part of the central american integration system broadly focused political arrangement panama has declined to join the central american common market relying instead on the canal and the large us economy as its economic anchors panama s always had fully dollarized monetary system and is beneficiary of us unilateral trade preferences defined in the caribbean basin economic recovery act cbera the caribbean basin trade partnership act cbtpa and the generalized system of preferences gsp13 under these circumstances there has been little external incentive for panama to become more open economy only since joining the world trade organization wto in 1997 did panama begi n to reduce tariff rates an important step in preparing panama for an fta with the united states panamas subregional independence nd reliance on us economic ties has suited the united states as well given its continuing interest in the canal an fta with panama may be seen as one way for the united states to support long established commercial interests and deepen bilateral relations particularly if accepted as mutually beneficial pact with reasonably balanced political and economic outcomes although many ships have outgrown the canal its locale and prospects for enlarging the passageway continue to reinforce panamas historic albeit currently diminished importance for the united states as strategic trade passage bilateral fta with panama is also part of the bush administrations competitive liberalization tr ade strategy in which negotiations are taking place on multilateral regional and bilateral levels this multitiere d

liberalization goals and supports continued us foreign direct i nvestment the services sector is already globally competitive but the manufacturing sector is small and agricultural remains protected and uncompetitive see below for panama the chief concern was crafting an fta that would balance the need to pursue openness for services export growth and promotion for manufacturing and adjustment

changes to the labor environment intell ectual property rights and government procurement chapters to accommodate new commitments ag reed to by the ustr and bipartisan congressional leadership market acce ss schedules drawn from previous fta templates reflect both us and panamanian interests as do other market access provisions congress requires that the united states international trade commission usitc make an economic assessment of the potential impact of an fta on the us economy the analysis usually is done with both general equilibrium model to estimate economywide changes and partial equilibrium model to estimate sectoral or industrylevel changes in pa namas case there was insufficient data to make meaningful estimate from general equilibrium model and so detailed estimates of how the fta might affect u s economic growth employment trade and income were not offered in general however through other quantitative and qualitative indicators the us itc concluded that because panamas economy is very small relative to that of the united states the likely overall effect on the us economy also will be similarly very small23 at the sectoral level the usitc finds that the main effect of the fta would likely be to increase us exports while causing little growth in us imports from panama in general the estimates are in line with general expectations based on 1 the small amount of goods imported from panama 2 the sm all production capacity of panama and 3 the fact that most im ports from panama 96 by value already enter the united states duty free through either normal trade relations ntr or preferences provided by the caribbean basin initiative cbi programs or the generalized system of preferences gsp24 specific estimates suggest that when fully

market access was particularly difficult for four highly protected products pork poultry rice and sugar the united states was basically offensive on pork poultry and rice expecting to ope n further panamas markets as soon as possible it was defensive on sugar attempting to limit increases in the sugar quota that might disrupt operations of the gar program as defined in legislation panamas position was the reverse pressing to minimize increases in us exports of pork poultry and rice and to increase its us sugar export quota in the united states the sugar program reflects an historical commitment to protect the income of sugar beet sugar can and sugar processing firms with below primerate loans limitations on sales in the domestic ma rket and tariff rate quotas trqs trqs restrict imports with pr ohibitively high tariffs on imports above defined quota amount as defined in wto rule s agreed to by the united states in 2003 the abovequota tariff on sugar was 7827 on average panama harvests only quarter of the sugar produced by each of the five central am erican countries but it still plays disproportionally important ro in the agricultural sector sugar constitutes 1 third of

compared to less than 10 of gar exports from central america given the dependence of sugar producers on the us market in part driven by panamas relatively high wage rates that make it cost prohibitive to produce for the world market the panamanians argued that even relatively small quantitative increase in their portion of the us sugar quota would have large benefit for their industry the us sugar industry however continued to resist the inclusion of sugar in bilateral ftas arguing that the wto is the forum for addressing domestic support programs and trqs in the agricultural sector in panama

special issue related to the consumption of white versus da rk meat the united states consumes considerably more white meat than dar k leaving disproportional amount of dark cuts for export which face the highest tariffs in panama as with much of the world dark meat is preferred the concern revolved around us pr oducers willingness to sell dark meat cuts at low price in foreign markets putting downward pressure on prices and hurting domestic producers in t hose countries the panamanians argued that because of the relatively high profit margins on white meat in the united states on cost allocation basis us producers can actually afford to sell the dark meat at below cost the cost accounting can be bated but concerns over the price effect in the panamanian mark et remained

supports 40 of the countrys population living in rural areas most of whom exist at or below the poverty line given the potential to dislocate much of the poor in the country the panamanians argued that opening the agri cultural sector too quickly to the large production capacity of the united states woul d have been highly detrimental to the social structure of the rural economy l eading to increased unemployment poverty and ruralurban migration for these r easons panama wanted slow trans ition to open markets in the agriculture sector as well as an increase in the sugar quota to boost employment this would also buy time for panama to develop its non traditional export crops such as melons pa lm oil and pineapples which some view as the future of this sector the compromise struck in the proposed fta would provide dutyfree treatment for over half of us farm exports to panama including high quality beef poultry products soybeans most fresh fruits and number of processed goods remaining tariffs would be phased out between 7 and 17 years after the fta takes effect rice tariffs which protect one of panamas most sensitive pr oducts would remain in place for the full 17 years as would tariffs on pork chicken leg quart ers dairy products and corn among others these products would receive expanded quotas under the panamanian tariff rate quota system the united states agreed to give panama an additional 7000 metric tons of sugar imports in the first year under threetiered trq system which would grow by 1 per year capped eventually for some types of sugar the american sugar alliance apparently has agreed not to come out against the agreement29 other protective measures for agriculture were negotiated whereas export subsidies voluntary restrain agreements vres and

propos ed this agreement be put into formal side letter panama responded by noting that the sps chapter had already been closed that its meat inspection standards are among the highest in the world and that last minute effort to change sps provisions raised sovereignty issues in panama by potentially requiring panama to wer its standards in some cases31 as part of the resolution panamanian

international trade reporter bna inc march 10 2005 see also crs report rs21609 the wto intellectual property rights and the access to medicines controversy by ian f fergussonpharmaceutical issues three patentrelated issues generated the major ipr debate the first and perhaps most sensitive and complicated issue was data exclusivity to bring patented drug to mark et drug company must demonstrate through clinical trials that the drug is both safe and effective timeconsuming and costly process under us law the data used to establish these claims are protected from use by generic manufacturers to certif their own products for period of five years from the time the patented drug is pproved for use in countrys market the socalled data exclusivity term this issue was raised by members of congress during the caftadr debate but was only pa rtially addressed in side agreement assuring that relevant wto rules would be in force critics however wanted the side agreement to include an explicit exception to the data protection requirement for cases where compulsory licencing under the wto rules might be invoked42 congressional input led to significant changes to the panama text the ipr chapter provides that if company files to bring to market new drug in second country eg panama after making an initial filing in the first country eg the united states and panama approves the drug within six months of that filing the data exclusivity term begins at the time the drug was approved in the united states not panama this provisi on is intended to encourage both drug companies and foreign governments to engage in the appr oval process as efficiently as possible thereby speeding the entry of generic drug s into developing countries panama because the sixmonth rule effectively reduces the data exclusivity term in panama drug companies are encouraged to file as soon as feasible to maximize the time their data may be protected in panama after getting market approval because countries must approve within the sixthmonth rule to benefit from it they are encouraged to put in place an efficient drug certification process in addition there is language in the ipr chapter stating that in the case of epidemics waiver from the data exclusivity laws would be allowed in the past the wto public health provisions have allowed for compulsory licen sing circumventing patents in public health emergencies but in the case of the uspanama fta the waiver is extended to the data exclusivity term as well second issue is patent term restoration which allows for the retroactive application of patents in cases where the approval process for patent extends beyond some legal or regulatorydeter mined standard period of time although there are provisions that require term restoration for patents in general in the case of pharmaceutical products term extension is only optional the third issue is patent linkage this term refers to linking the sanitary registration process done for example by the food and drug administration in the united states with the patent registration process us firms would like to see ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32540crs22 43 the difference is that in most developing countries the social costs associated with environmental degradation pollution and poor working conditions may not be captured in the market price of goods socalled external costs through legal and regulatory measures developed countries require that businesses corr ect for many of these social costs thereby internalizing them to the business where they are then reflected in the final relatively higher price of the good in the market placetransparent preferably administrative pr ocess that would automatically check for patent infringement when an application for bringing drug to market is made in foreign country sanitary registration office the panama agreement allows for both administrative and judicial procedures wh ich could increase the chances of country employing cumbersome and costly process public health advocates have long pushe d for rebalancing international rules in ways that would facilitate the introduction of lower co st generic equivalents into developing countries the revised ip r chapter in the panama fta supports congressional interest in pursuing this goal pharmaceutical companies however argued against these changes because they bear the full cost through cumbersome administration and lost revenue by the earlier introduction of generic competition they count on this revenue to offset the hi gh costs of research and development that allows new drugs to be properly tested and approved in the first place also in developing countries with less than robust patent laws data exclusivity for example is often the only recourse dr ug companies have to provide some protection of their investment and so changing the terms of the data exclusivity term has direct financial cost for drug companies labor and environment labor and environment provisi ons have been highly contentious issues in trade agreements with considerable disagreement in congress and elsewhere over how aggressive language in trade agreements should be in accommodating these concerns an important aspect of the proposed uspanama fta is that it adopts new standards for both the labor and environm ent chapters that reflect bipartisan understanding as developed by congressional leadership and the ustr in the new trade policy for america despite the bipartisan nature of the agreement many members continue to expre ss reservations about the be nefits of bilateral ftas the debate over labor and environmental standards re flect differences in both economic and political perspectives from an ec onomic perspective labor and environment advocates in the united states have argued that developing country firms may have an unfair competitive dvantage because their lower standards are basis for their lower costs which in turn are reflected in lower prices for goods that compete with those produced in developed countries43 it follows from this argument that the difference in costs may be an i nducement to move us investment and jobs abroad in addition critics ve also argued that trade agreements should not support status quo in production standards that leads to unacceptable working conditions and severe

on the other hand some studies have ggested that cost differentials are usually not high enough to determine bus iness location alone and that productivity is the more important factor44 further many economists view trade liberalization as part of the overall development proce ss that in and off itself can promote improved social and economic conditions over the long run45 developing countries are concerned with the loss of sovereignt should specific standards be defined in trade agreements as well as with the possibility that such provisions can be misused as disguised form of protectionism labor issues preliminary drafts of the uspanama fta adopted the caftadr labor chapter language verbatim many members of congress and others objected to four key aspects of th is language first it emphasized that country must effectively enforce its own labor laws rather that define specific labor standards to be codified and enfo rced second this was the only provision in the labor chapter subject to the ftas labor dispute resolution process other commitments are unenfor ceable third labor and environment provisions had their own dispute settlement process separate from the process used for commercial and other disputes critics argued that the labor dispute mechanism was inferior for many reasons fourth for other commitments in the labor chapter language requiring that the parties to the agreement strive to ensure that basic labor principles as defined in the inte rnational labor organization ilo fundamental principles and rights at work and its followup 1998 declaration was an inadequate commitment and unenforceable in short there existed basic criticism that the labor provisions in the bilateral ftas did not reflect the intent of cong ress in defining labor negotiating objectives in trade promotion authority tpa legisla tion were step backward in us policy on this issue that conditions trade benefits on meeting basic ilo labor commitments as defined in the caribbean

the caftadr m odel prevailed in earlier agreements new bipartisan consensus emerged with the 110th congressional leadership that led to significantly changed model for bilateral fta labor chapters the principles of this change as defined in the may 10 2007 new trade policy for america were incorporated into the labor chapters for proposed us bilatera l ftas with panama peru and colombia the major changes from the caftadr model state that each country shall adopt and maintain in its statutes regulations and practices as rights the five core ilo labor pr inciples freedom of association the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining the elimination of all forms of compulsory or forced labor the effective abolition of child labor and for purposes of this agreement prohibition on the worst forms of child labor and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation not waive or otherwise derogate fro m or offer to do so in manner affecting trade or inve stment between the countries in implementing the above commitment shall not fail to effectively enforce its labor in accordance with the above commitment and that each pa rty retains the right to the reasonable exercise of discretion in using resources to achieve this goal provided the exercise of such discretion is not inconsistent with the obligations of the chapter and will be required to use the dispute settlement process defined for the entire agreement rather than separate process for labor disputes as defined in the caftadr the change in language is intended to make commitments to ilo basic principles binding and enforceable to the same extent as all other commitments in the proposed fta including having recourse to trade sanctions the rest of the labor chapter conforms largely to commitments in previous bilateral ftas that include procedural guarantees of transparency and fairness in the use of tribunals to enforce partys labor laws and institutional arrangements that include creation of joint labor affairs council to oversee implementation and review of commitments made in the labor chapter these commitments include establishing labor cooperation and capacity building mechanism panamas labor conditions panama has higher wa ge rates stronger labor laws and fewer impediments to union formation compared to many countries in the region the business community including us firms operating in panama argue that the labor laws are too generous with respect to firing or downsizing the labor force which can actually encourage unint ended

to the same dispute resolution and enforcement mechanisms as are other aspects of the agreements49 advocates raise the issue of the environmental effects of trade particularly in developing countries that may have weak laws and lax enforcement mechanisms some of these same advocates however have indicated that thus far trade agreements have not led to catastrophic po llution nor encouraged regulatory race to the bottom there has also been certain acknowledged degree of success in having environmental issues addressed in the body of ftas in side agreements on environmental cooperation nd

new trade policy for america reflect bipartisan sense of that although the text recognizes sovereign righ ts and responsibilities with respect to the management of natural resources that trade and environmen tal policies should be mutually supportive and dedicated to the obj ective of sustainable development the new language therefore strengthens the commitments to environmental obligations and their enforcement re quiring that each country adopt maintain and implement laws regulations and other measures to fulfill their obliga tions under selected multilateral environmental agreements meas

canal also places severe water use requirements on the country panama has responded through the public policy process establishing envir onmental standards in law and entering into international and

ited states or on panama the environmental review further notes that panamas serviceoriented economy and the small trade volume with the united states are unlikely to be greatly affected by the proposed fta and so will change marginal production and trade little the fta however may have both positive and negative effects the negative effects of pollution environmental degr adation and endangering w ildlife would come mostly from increased agricultural trade and production which might be addressed with increased environmental oversight and policies the positive effect of the fta could include improvements in envi ronmental standards that ma be encouraged by the provisions of the agreement and the consultative and cooperation agreements attached to the proposed fta53 panamas environmental regulatory agency autoridad nacional ambiente anam points out that panama is increasingly using environmental impact studies but realizes it has enforcement capacity issues that may require time to remedy wh ich could be accommodated in the fta trade capacity building the proposed fta would create committee on trade capacity building tcb designed to assist panama with th transition to freer trade with the united states in general the committees mission includes providing technical assistance and coordinating financing to accelerate the transition period in expectation of increasing the gains of trade while minimizing the adjustment costs the tcb committee would help coordinate technical assistance provided by us regional and multilateral agencies in helping panama meet its obligations under the fta panama prioritized tcb needs in its national trade capacity building strategy the overriding goal is to formulate strategy that would allow panama to assume all the commitments under the proposed fta in the context of meeting the countrys development needs the national tcb strategy places strong emphasis on sectoral adjustment strategies recognizing that some industries are already competitive by international standards eg financial services whereas others will need considerable assistance when faced w ith increased competition from the united states eg agriculture emphasis is also placed on supporting existing and potentially new micro small and mediums ized businesses which may need the most assistance and constitute signifi cant portion of the panamanian economy as well as government capacity to administer traderelated activities54 the major goals identified include in tersectoral coordination increasing exports to the united states

the revised fta 584 on july 11 2007 but it cannot take effect until the us congre ss passes implementing legislation the 110th congress may consider such bill in 2008 the debate over ftas is frequently contentious for other reasons as well give n their increased complexity and members broadly held concerns over the negative ffects of globalization that have increased substantially in postcafta dr environment to address some of these concerns the proposed uspanama fta in add ition to supporting us commercial and economic interests incorporates significant changes initiated by the democrats and ultimately agreed to by congressional leadership as part of bipartisan congressional understanding arrived at with the bush administration the most significant changes include the adoption of enforceable labor standards compulsory adherence to select multilateral environmental agreements meas and an easing of restrictions to developing country access to generic drugs in each of these cases the proposed u spanama fta goes beyond provisions in existing multilateral trade rules and even t hose contemplated in the doha round in this case along with the broader argu ments both for and against ftas congress perhaps now faces an even more difficult c hoice given that the recent changes to this proposed fta may set precedent in us trade policy as significant as thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32540crs29 changes may be perhaps portending shift in us trade policy it is still not clear that they are sufficient to ease the concerns many members have over bilateral
