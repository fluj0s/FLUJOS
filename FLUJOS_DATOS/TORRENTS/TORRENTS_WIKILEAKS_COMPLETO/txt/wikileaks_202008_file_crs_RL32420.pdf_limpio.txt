and animals in variety of chemical forms natural forces move mercury through the environment from air to soil to water and back again industrial activities have increased the portion of mercury in the atmosphere and oceans and have contaminated some local environments coalfired electric utilities are the largest single source of us mercury emissions according to epa but mobile sources also are important the chemical form of mercury generally determines how it moves through the environment but mercury can and does change form relatively rapidly where bromine and other oxidizing substan ces

harm the devel oping nervous systems of young children at higher levels of exposure mercury is known to be potent neurotoxin people in the united states are exposed to mercury primarily by eating large predatory fish risks of health problems for people who consume rcury in fish have caused wide public concern and prompted the us environm ental protection agency epa and the food and drug administration fda to i ssue consumer alerts warning women of childbearing age and young children to avoi d certain fish altogether and to limit the number of meals for other fish numerous legislative proposals in the 109th congress aim to reduce levels of mercury in the environment in consumer products in solid wa ste in utility and other emission sources and in surface wate r most of these proposals focus on sources of mercury emissions to air because atmospheric mercury deposition accounts for most of the mercury in us fre shwater lakes and streams at least five proposals target emissions from coalfired electric utilities because they are thought to be the last remaining major uncontrolled source of mercury emissions these various proposals and final regulation pr omulgated by the us environmental protection agency epa on march 15 2005 differ in how much and how soon emission reduction would be re quired as well as in the extent to which reductions would be distributed geographica lly across the united states analysis of the competing policy pr oposals for reducing mercury emissions raises questions about the urgency of n eed for emission controls the likelihood that they will reduce mercury contamination of fish and the possibility that overall reductions might be achieved at the expe nse of local hot spots of mercury contamination to answer such questions

from one year decade century or millennium to another during the past 500 years or so human activities have rel eased mercury from its relatively stable and waterinsoluble fo rm cinnabar in rocks and soil through mining fossil fuel combustion and other ac tivities and so have increased the portion of mercury that is actively cycling through the atmosphere surface waters plants and animals as it changes chemical and physical form released mercury may enter the air persist in the atmosphere and travel great distances or be deposited locally dissolve in water droplets settle back onto the land or water reenter the air ie be reemitted be buried in lake or ocean sediments or be taken into plants and animals the generally accepted estimate is that roug hly three to five times as much mercury is mobilized today as was m obile before i ndustrialization3 however the author of one recent study argues that the mercury deposited from the atmosphere today is at least 10 times the amount of mercury th at was being deposited 500 years ago4 in 1995 abou t 1913 metric tons roughly 2104 us tons5 of mercury were newly emitted globally as result of stati onary combustion metal production

emissions are presented in table 1 the first two estimates were made by epa for the national emissions inventory12 crs added 12 tons of emissions from gold mines to the epa emission inventory that was conducted for 1995 at the suggestion of epa13 epa was unaware of the emissions from that source at the time the invent ory was conducted the other category encompasses emissions from various unidentif ied industries including most iron and steel mills epa advised crs to note that there are some sources not accounted for in the 1999 epa inventory such as iron and steel produc tion using mercury contaminated scrap which probably accounts for 710 tons of emissions per year14 these emissions are not included in the other category epa also does not include mobile source emissions in its

the ease with which mercury moves through the air water and soil and over distances for example elemental mercury emissions may remain airborne for more than year traveling around the world as part of the socalled global pool of atmospheric mercury about 95 of atmospheric mercury is elemental particulate and reactive gaseous mercury both organic and inorganic are found in the atmosphere in smaller amount s because they travel shorter distances from the point of emission and are mo re quickly deposited reactive gaseous mercury typically is deposite d within about 100 kilometers of the point of emission19 coalfired electric utility emissions vary depending on the technology and coal used at each plant but are roughly 50 elemental mercury according to epa20 however the chemical form of mercury emissions can and does change in the atmosphere making it difficult to predict th fate of particular emissions including utility emissions elemental mercury emitted to the atmosphere can attach to particles or change to watersoluble form ie reactive gas that more easily combines with other chemicals and deposits relatively quickly reactive gaseous mercury is more likely to form and to be deposited in the presence of sunlight this explains why measured centrations of atmospheric mercury generally are lower during the day than they are at night mercury deposition in north america incr eases in spring and peaks in summer according to data from the mercury deposition network21 higher summer deposition probably results at least in part from the increase in solar energy that is available to spark key chemical reactions ie oxidation for exampl scientists have shown that in the lower layers of the atmosphe re ie roughly 400 ters of land or 1000 meters of the ocean surface

recent analysis of deposition data collected for both hemispheres indicates that total gaseous mercury increased in the late 1970s peak ed in the late 1980s decreased somewhat until the mid1990s and has rema ined constant since then30 at present approximately 5000 metr ic tons 5500 us tons of mercury are deposited globally each year31 layered samples known as cores of glaci ers and peat provide historical records of mercury deposits that clearly show the contemporary impact on land of major trends in mercury emissions that is core s record the historical rise in mercury emissions and deposition due to mining nd industrialization however while such records inform us about relative changes in global regional nd local emissions over scale of years even cen turies they provide little information about the precise relationship between particular emissions and particular deposits this is because the path and time taken by emitted mercury to cycle through environmental media depends on its chemical form as well as on physical conditions like height of emission temperature sunlight wind speed and direction humidity and the presence of certain other substances such as ozone atmospheric deposition tends to be greater in areas closer to emission sources and in locations with more rainfall thus epa has estimated that about 60 of mercury deposited in the united states is from local or regional us sources and deposition increases from west to east32 local or even regional deposition can result in areas of relatively high deposition or hot spots deposition of mercury in particular cases varies how ever depending on many fact ors including regional and local climate and weather pa tterns soil types topogra phy vegetation and local or regional sources of mercury emissions33 thus mercury may be deposited near to or far from an emission source34 the relative contribution of various sources to mercury deposition also can change over time for example the record of mercury deposition in ice cores from fremont glacier wyoming shows peak s of high mercury deposition following volcanic eruptions in the northern and sout hern hemispheres as well as during the california gold rush35 such cores are difficult to interpret however because they reflect local as well as global influenceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32420crs9 36 everglades consolidated report p 2b11

the quality of waters that are impaired by mercury according to epa more than 700 bodies of water th roughout the united states are listed as impaired by mercury in most cases the s ource of the mercury c ontamination is air deposition to address these impairments states are developing total maximum daily loads tmdls which are plans to bring those waters into attainment with water quality standards the florida everglades and devils lake in wisconsin were selected as pilot tmdl projects for mercury scientists studying the florida everglades have estimated that at least half of the mercury deposited in the everglades is emitted locally while between 5 and 29 is emitted regionally from within the south eastern united states the remainder derives from sources outside the united states36 epa has estimated that 80 of deposition to pines lakes new jersey comes from us sources37 in contrast almost all of the mercury f ound in remote regions of the arctic is be lieved to have traveled from distant sources38 methylmercury formati on and accumulation the most biologically significant transformation of mercury occurs in soil or sediments of lakes or streams where bacteria primarily sulfatereduc ing bacteria are capable of converting inorganic mercury to methylmercury39 the significance of methylation is that relative to inorganic mercury methylmercury is more easily absorbed by living tissues more likely to be ingested in food and much more toxic to animals methylmercury is easily absorbed by the digestive tract and accumulates in the bodies of fish and other animals when it is ingested faster than it can be excreted because methylmercury tends to be stored in muscle tissue ie the edible meat of fish and other animals animals higher on the f ood chain tend to have higher levels of exposure predatory fish eg walleye rgemouthed bass or tuna fisheating birds eg loons ospreys or eagles and fisheating mammals g raccoons otters or mink which top the longest food chai ns accumulate the greatest concentrations of methylmercury in the florida everglades methylmercury concentrations in fish are up to ten million times greater than concentrations of mercury

fish41 however the rate of methylmercury formation and accumulation is highly variable even within relatively small geographic areas because it depends on many factors in addition to the abundance of inorganic mercury recent research indicates that some ecosystems are particularly sensitive to relatively sma ll mercury inputs and are more likely to experience high rates of methylmerc ury production and accumulation sensitive ecosystems include lowalkalinity ie low capacity for neutralizing acid and humic lakes and streams which are character ized by an abundance of dissolved decomposed plant or bacterial matter wetlands surface waters connected to wetlands and waters linked to areas subjected to flooding42 methylmercury formation by sulfatereducing bacteria and bioaccumulation is favored in ecosystems that are oxygenpoor and acidic that contain sulfate the most common form of sulfur in surfacewaters but not too much sulfide the form of sulfur rendered by sulfatereducing bacteria 43 and in which mercury is recently deposited rather than older mercury44 in wisconsin lake researchers found th at levels of both sulfate and mercury determined levels of pr oduction and bioaccumulation of methylmercury and that modest changes in acid rain or mercury deposition can significantly affect mercury bioaccumulation over shorttime scales45 in response to significant decrease in mercury deposition between 1994 and 2000 methylmerc ury in yellow perch decreased by roughly 30 5 per year the link between industrial emissions and mercury levels in the oceans is less clear because the role of the oceans in rcury cycling is poorly understood on the one hand significant quantitie s of reactive inorganic rcury are deposited in the oceans and methylmercury is found in mari ne fish and their predators sometimes at very high concentrations and although thylmercury levels are very low in the surface layer of the open oceans concentr ations

tuna three cans of albacore tuna and six fre sh swordfish information was provided about the age or length of these specimensthreefold higher than they were prior to industrialization assuming that insignificant amounts descended to the ocean depths46 so we know that organic methyl mercury is formed in the oceans what we do not know is where the mercury in ocean fish originated in industrial missions deposited to the oceans or in the natural reservoir of the ocean depths nor where it was transformed into methylmercury some scientists believe that methylmercury probably is formed in the deep sediments of oceans or in the areas surrounding deep thermal vents in the ocean floor47 in that case they argue depos ition of atmospheric mercury cannot account for current methylmercury levels in ocean fish given the relatively large size of the deep sea reservoir of mercury and the time it takes for the ocean depths to mix with the surface layers where fish feed an estimated 400 years if all the mercury deposited into the oceans due to human activities over the past hundred years were mixed into the ocean even to its greatest depths the mercury concentration of ocean water would have increased only an timated 1 to 10 over preindustrial concentrations other scientists believe that sulfatereducing bacteria form methylmercury in coastal sediments where it is taken up by tiny plants and animals at the bottom of aquatic food webs small fish and other animals feeding in nearshore waters concentrate the mercury then venture fa r enough from shore to be prey for larger fish seabirds and mammals48 at this time not enough information is available to deter mine whether mercury levels in ocean fish and fisheating marine mammals have increased or decreased over the past hundred years or so much less whether levels rose and declined as result of changes in atmospheric emissions49 although most scientists who study mercury agree that deposition of atmosphe ric mercury has increased

captured in 1971 with methylmercury in ye llowfin tuna caught in 1998 both in the vicinity of hawaii found significant differences in mercury concentrations51 however the significance of these measurements is unclear given the historical trend in atmospheric deposition which peaked in the mid 1980s another study compared feathers over time from two kinds of fisheating birds that live in the northern atlantic ocean52 feathers were obtained from museum specimens taken as long ago as 1885 the study found significant increase in concentrations of methylmercury over time among birds that eat fish living near the ocean surface concentrations of methylmerc ury in feathers increased at an estimated rate of 11 annually between 1885 and 1994 according to study authors this increase is

individual exposure to mercury may be determined based on measured concentrations of mercur in blood for slightly longer exposure history eg over several months mercury c oncentrations in human hair several inches from the scalp may be useful however there is way to measure exposure that occurred more than few years ago because methylmercury breaks down in the bodies of animals and both organic and inorganic mercury are excreted over time although rates of physiological processes va ry widely among individuals in general people eliminate about half th mercury taken in within period of roughly 4480 days72 in this way mercury differs from many ot her pollutants such as lead which may be measured in the bone or teeth years afte r exposure has ceased if mercury exposure ends because

for adverse hea lth effects among individuals who regularly consume fish federal agencies have estimated the risk associated with methylmercury exposure at current levels of environmenta l ie fish contamin ation of particular relevance is the reference dose rfd set by epa which is discussed in some detail below because there has been some controversy surr ounding the epa rfd it is compared to two other maximum allowable c oncentration levels tablished by federal agencies the minimum risk level mrl set by the agency for toxic substances and disease registry and the acceptable daily intake adi level established by the food and drug administration as explained belo w the apparent inconsistency among the fda atsdr and epa estimates of safe exposure level for methylmercury is primarily due to the agencies diverse re sponsibilities and actions that are triggered when contamination is found to occur epa reference dose for methylmercury the epa reference dose rfd is risk assessment tool used to estimate daily intake levels of chemicals that are expected to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious health effects83 even if exposure persists over lifetime the risk associated with exposure to methylmercury above the rfd is uncertain but likely to increase with increasing exposure levels the rfd is intended to account for sens itive members of the human population such as pregnant women and infants but not individuals with unus ual sensitivity due to conditions such as genetic disorders or severe illness to calculate the rfd epa generally uses observed adverse eff ect level noael which may be observed or estimated using model noael estimate s the threshold level of exposure below which adverse effects do not occur then the rfd is established by dividing the noael by uncertainty factors which account for the need to extrapolate from limited data sets to the general us population in 1985 epa established its first rf d for people who eat methylmercury contaminated fish at 03 micrograms of methylmercury µg per kilogram of body weight kgbw per day this is equivalent to about 126 µg of methylmercury per week roughly the amount in two 7ounce servings of fish containing 03 ppm mercury for person weighing 132 pounds this dose is ba sed on the lowest level of exposure that produced adverse effects on the nervous sy stems ie numbness and tingling in the extremities of adult iraqis after they were poisoned by eating contaminated grain during 19711972 and adult japanese w ho ate contaminated fish from minamata bay during the mid1950s two years after epa set its rfd data were published showing adverse effects of maternal mercury exposure on the development of iraqi children who were exposed in the womb in 1995 epa revised its rfd basing it on these developmental effects this second rfd of 01 µgkgbwday 42 µg per week for pers on weighing 132 pounds remains in effect this level would be exceeded if 132pound person ate more than one fish

per million parts maternal hair ppm by weight based on all the adverse hea lth effects observed in iraqi children who were exposed to methylmercury before birth the findings of other human studies as well as toxicity data collected from animals in scientific laborator ies supported the validity of the epa calculated benchmark dose84 benchmark doses calculated based on data from studies of island populations with heavy seafood consumption produced similar values 11 to 17 ppm85 epa used the benchmark dose to c onclude that consumption of 11 µgkgbwday of methylmercury probably was safe for the unborn children of women who ate contaminated grain in iraq at this leve l of mercury intake iraqi women who weighed an average of 60 kg about 132 pounds had about 11 ppm mercury in maternal hair and 44 µg methylmercury per liter of blood h owever individual ratios of hair to blood concentrations varied widely epa divided that daily dose 11 µgkgbwday by an uncertainty factor of 10 accounting fo r the lack of data on reproductive effects and differences among individuals to establish the rfd at 01 µgkgbwday at this level of exposure mercury concentration of pproximately 4 to 5 parts mercury per

scores rose significantly with fish consumption falling only when mercury levels in maternal hair rose above 12 ppm the study authors c oncluded that pregnant women should eat at least two fish meals

of their accumulated methylmercury when they form new feathers moreover s eabirds seem to be able to demethylate methylmercury rendering it less toxic nevertheless methylmercury exposure may harm sensitive species at levels found in cer tain local environmen ts many scientists suspect that the immune system is weakened as result of methylmercury exposure the most likely adverse impact on birds of methylmercury exposure is impaired ability to reproduce101 in common loons which have been studied extensively concentrations of mercury in blood correlate with mercury levels in the fish they eat

more subtle effects on mink of mercury exposure there are field data indicating that the wildlife species most at risk because they eat fish currently are experiencing adve rse health effects from mercury exposure conclusion current scientific knowledge can inform the debate about co mpeting legislative and administrative proposals to reduce rcury emissions from utilities but it cannot provide firm answers to all of the specific questions that have been raised neither can science resolve policy c ontroversies that revolve around value judgments for example questions about how urgent the need is for u tility emission controls however recent scientific studies have provided potentially useful information for policy makers about chemical changes to mercury emissions that may take place in the atmosphere rates of mercury deposition to and reemission from the earths surface the relationship between mercury emissions and mercury levels in freshwate r fish in various specific ecosystems and the potential effects of low level chronic exposure to methyl mercury through fish consumption scientific studies have clearly demonstrated that levels of mercury in the atmosphere and in deposits to earth have at least doubled and probably tripled due to human activities even in places that are remote from human in fluence although most of the largest and most direct us sources of mercury releases to water and air have been controlled and levels of us rcury deposition are declining leve ls of mercury in fish continue to be concern electric utilities are the only uncontrolled major stationary source of us mercury emissions as result control of utility emissions might be the most direct step that could be taken to re duce mercury deposition in the united states however there are uncertainties in chemistry and transport leading to current debates among policy makers local and regional emissions from various sources have caused mercury deposition to increase as much as tenfold in some locations indicating that there is possibility that local hot spots of mercury contamination might persist despite overall reductions in mercury emissions in sensitive experimental lakes and wetlands when local and regional mercury emissions decreased deposition decreased proportionately and levels of methylmercury in freshwate r fish dropped quickly this indicates that controls on mercury emissions from electric power plants particularly those plants with emissions that tend to be deposited locally could lead to substantial reductions in deposition at some nearby hot spots it remains to be determined whether there is link betweenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32420crs27 mercury emissions and mercury in ocean fis h however scientists have shown that significant quantities of emitte d mercury are deposited in the oceans methylmercury is found in marine fish and predatory seabir ds sometimes at very high concentrations and sulfatereducing bacteria are active in coastal sediments as yet unquantifiable but potentially sign ificant risks from emissions exist to people and wildlife locally but also in areas distant from emission sources research continues to find evidence of subtle impacts on human health of low levels of methylmercury exposure levels close to current levels of exposure for people who eat large amounts of certain large predatory fish in considering the potential adverse effects of mercury however the potential nutritional benefits of eating fish that are not heavily contaminated by mercury should not be overlooked
