base closure and realignment commission hereafter referred to as the brac commission or commission became binding on november 9 20051 in september and october 2005 mr michael wynne then principal deputy under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics issued instructions to the military departments and defense agencies2 in dod to create business plan for each of the recommendations drafted by the commission and approved by the president following is series of frequently asked questions concerning these business plans frequently asked questions what is business plans objective business plan specifies all actions necessary to comply with all or part of particular commission recommendation including timing estimated cost military construction and environmental remediation among others the 2005 brac round was the fifth since 1988 however because this round is occurring concurrently with dod transformation efforts as well as the redeployment of forces from overseas installations it is the most complex of all rounds to execute secretary wynne devised the business plan approach as management tool serving two main functions to ensure that military departments and 1 for more information see crs report rs22291 military base closures highlights of the 2005 brac commission report and its additional proposed legislation by daniel h else and david lockwood 2 military departments is the term used by dod to refer collectively to the department of the army the department of the navy includes the marine corps and the department of the air force defense agencies refers to 16 organizations that fall under the dod but are not uniformed service defense agencies include the defense finance and accounting service the defense logistics agency and the missile defense agency for complete listing of defense agencies see the us government website at httpwwwfirstgovgovagenciesfederalexecutivedefenseshtml crs2 defense agencies adequately plan and coordinate implementation and to assist dod in allocating resources and prioritizing tasks to meet the statutory deadline3 business plan is not intended to provide an all inclusive description of activity but only the level of detail needed by administrators to ensure coordination and to allocate brac funds effectively the plan describes necessary steps that must be taken to carry out the commissions recommendations and the estimated time frames and costs associated with those steps detailed planning is not included but can be found in associated documentation referenced in the plans also some details concerning to the planning particularly with regard to personnel are deliberately excluded in order to avoid providing potentially useful information to adversaries what information is included in business plan secretary wynne issued his guidelines for business plan preparation in two memoranda the first dated september 21 2005 provided basic outline of major headings and general guidance regarding the information to be included the second dated october 12 2005 described the necessary data in greater detail4 each plan should contain the relevant recommendation from the commissions final report description of the steps needed to satisfy the recommendation list of the dod organizations including military units that will have to be moved in order to fulfill the requirements of the commissions recommendation timetable for the movement of organizations listed above where applicable this will also include schedule for installation closure description of the estimated costs and savings associated with moving each organization details concerning military construction necessary as result of brac actions all required environmental studies at both the losing and gaining bases and the estimated costs for them identification of land and permanent structures real property that will need to be sold destroyed or otherwise disposed of list of all dod agencies affected by the plan along with assurances that those agencies have participated in the plans development and concur with its content why is it called business plan secretary wynne selected the term business plan based on the premise that the plans present the business case for the implementation of each 3 under existing law brac actions must be completed later than six years after the date on which the president transmitted the commissions report or september 15 2011 4 copies of the memos can be obtained by contacting mr daniel else mr else can be reached at 202 7074996 or delsecrslocgov crs3 recommendation they outline financial estimates of costs and savings as well as describe movement plans throughout the brac implementation process furthermore use of the term business is consistent with terminology currently employed within dod soon after taking over as secretary of defense donald rumsfeld announced his intention to steer the department towards more cost effective operations by adopting commercial business models june 18 2001 dod press release announced the creation of the senior executive committee to function as business board of directors for the department and the business initiative council created to recommend good business practices and implement cost savings that could offset the funding requirements for personnel programs infrastructure recapitalization equipment modernization and transformation initiatives5 secretary wynne adopted the practices of private enterprise to create these business plans who developed the plans secretary wynne assigned each brac commission recommendation in whole or in part to military department or defense agency generally the entity that has the largest number of resources tied to the action is responsible for preparing and executing the corresponding business plan when more than one service or defense agency is involved in realignment dod gave consideration to the location receiving resources as result of the recommendation dod reasoned that the receiving agency could best decide how to align additional personnel and facilities with their existing infrastructure as an example in commission recommendation 131 which calls for the colocation of military criminal investigative agencies with the counter intelligence field agency and the defense security service at the united states marine corps base quantico virginia responsibility for developing the business plan was assigned to the department of the navy who will have access to the plans because they were intended to be internal resource allocation documents these business plans were not intended to circulate outside dod nevertheless once the dod fy2008 budget proposal is submitted to congress much of the information contained in the plans if not the plans themselves will likely become publicly accessible this is because the plans will form the basis for dods allocation of brac funding and estimated budgets thus supporting data from the plans will likely be included in the military department and defense agency budget justification documents or jbooks jbooks are usually provided annually to congress to explain how the military departments and defense agencies plan to use requested funds 5 see department of defenses website at httpwwwdefenselinkmil releasesreleaseaspxreleaseid2949 crs4 why are business plans required for brac 2005 and not for previous brac rounds brac 2005 differed from previous brac rounds in number of ways unique to 2005 was the number and complexity of the recommendations in their final report the commission noted the 2005 brac recommendations exceeded the number considered by all prior brac commissions combined in addition to the unprecedented number many dod recommendations were extremely complex proposing intertwining movements between and among numerous installations6 the planning and execution of the 1991 1993 and 1995 brac rounds centered on the departments of the army navy and air force each of which crafted its own list of recommendations dod consolidated coordinated and forwarded these lists to the president for approval the military departments were then responsible for implementing the approved recommendations within the six years required by law however the very high level of complexity of the 2005 process led dods senior leadership to institute centralized control of the planning and resource allocation process while at the same time preserving decentralized implementation policy for the military departments and defense agencies furthermore dod believed the coordination required by business plans development process would provide an added benefit coordination was intended to produce an efficient plan but also to create conditions in which potentially problematic issues could be identified and resolved prior to implementation this was of particular importance where commission recommendations resulted in new methods of operation such as with joint basing7 what time period does the business plan cover business plans are intended to cover current planning through fy2011 when the law mandates implementation must be complete action affecting location after fy2011 such as its postclosure use by the local community is not covered in the plans will the business plans be updated dod will require updates to each of the business plans biannually in the fall to examine the next years budget request and in the spring to assess current budget execution dod considers these plans living documents that are likely to change as operational priorities and resource availability shift or any number of other 6 brac commission report executive summary pg iii of the 190 closures and realignments recommended by the dod the commission approved 119 with changes and accepted 45 with amendments see crs report rs22291 military base closures highlights of the 2005 brac commission report and its additional proposed legislation by daniel h else and david lockwood 7 for an explanation of joint base see what is the current status of the plans p 6 crs5 variables and circumstances change for example survey of planned renovation of an existing facility may reveal that new construction would be more cost effective how are the business plans prepared the head of each military department or defense agency assigned responsibility for the preparation of each business plan to subordinate organization for example the secretary of the air force assigned the plan for the realignment of mcguire air force base to air mobility command which is responsible for that installation air mobility command is empowered to coordinate details of the plan with the other services affected by that particular brac recommendation after the plans formulation the secretary of the air force or his delegate reviews and approves it the plan is then submitted to the installation capability council icc at dod for review and approval the deputy under secretary of defense for installations and environment dusd ie currently mr philip w grone chairs the icc which consists of senior executives and military officers drawn from the office of the secretary of defense the military departments and the joint staff8 after approving each business plan the icc forwards it to the departments higherechelon infrastructure steering group isg for further review9 the isg chair the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics usd atl has the final approving authority before this approval is granted each business plan is reviewed by the isg executive secretariat the dod base realignment and closure office this review includes legal assessment of whether the business plan meets the brac commissions intent for the recommendation once approved the military departments and defense agencies put the business plans into action figure 1 illustrates the review structure 8 the joint staff is the military organization in the pentagon that directly supports the chairman and the other members of the joint chiefs of staff 9 the infrastructure steering group is chaired by the usd atl and is composed of the vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the military department assistant secretaries for installations and environment the service vice chiefs and the dusd ie since the september 21 and october 12 2005 memoranda the dod comptroller and the director program analysis and evaluation have also been added as members crs6 figure 1 business plan review structure infrastructure steering group usd atl installation capability council dusd ie military departments defense agencies what is the current status of the plans to date 219 of the 23710 required plans have been approved three of the 18 unapproved plans were reviewed by the dod brac office and sent back for further analysis examples of further analysis includes ensuring the plans address dods legal obligations and further assessment of implementation alternatives the remaining 15 unapproved plans still require action of the 15 unapproved plans 12 are for joint bases joint bases involve locations where installations of two or more services are either adjoining or within close proximity and the brac commission has recommended that the installations support functions be combined and operated by single service dod is currently developing joint base implementation guidance to provide the military departments and defense agencies direction regarding how the combined bases will be established and operated once this guidance is issued by the deputy secretary of defense the 12 plans will be completed and submitted for review and approval the remaining three of the 15 unapproved plans involve armyrun chemical munitions depots where closure requires compliance with international treaty obligations11 affected locations are newport chemical depot indiana umatilla 10 the initial number of required business plans was 240 however the dod brac office determined that three of those were not necessary two of the three were for naval air station oceana virginia beach virginia and naval broadway complex san diego california those two installations met certain conditions set by the brac commission are therefore longer slated for closure the third plan longer required was for recommendation requiring the establishment of an oversight board for the naval post graduate school monterey california and the air force institute of technology wright patterson air force base ohio the dod brac office determined that detailed plan was not necessary for recommendation so narrowly defined and limited in scope 11 the convention on the prohibition of the development production stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and their destruction commonly known as the chemical weapons convention prohibits the development production stockpiling and use of chemical continued crs7 chemical depot oregon and deseret chemical depot utah it is possible that the required destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles at these depots may not occur within the sixyear statutory period for completion of brac actions questions regarding this
