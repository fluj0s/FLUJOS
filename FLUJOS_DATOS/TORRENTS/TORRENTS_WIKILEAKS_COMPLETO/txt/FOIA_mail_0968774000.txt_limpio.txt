all i think i heard replies to my last proposal from most of you i have also had phone conversation with linda so let try to summarize the situation 1 from the replies i got it sounds like at least the basic idea of my proposal is viable in particular i read an at least semiconsensus and certainly some strong individual positions that the sres material since it is unpublished and remember unreviewed until now should not be presented as our sole or even primary source of conclusions now i share that position and in fact quite strongly presenting such material breaks the proclaimed ipcc rules now the rules have been softened for this case but remember that there are people around who are paid to find faults in the ipcc process and the last thing i want to do is being accused of having broken the rules i think the tsu people are too optimistic and casual in the way they change the rules during the process and expect people to accept that this just happens remember what happened to ben santer after the sar besides i myself think that material for document as important as the tar cannot be drawn from lastminute barely quality checked and unpeered reviewed material people have barely looked at the mpi run that was completed last friday it is up the the ipcc to better plan these things and avoid the mess be it as it may unless somebody is strongly against this position i will assume that we can proceed from this basis 2 having said the above it is also clear the we can present the ipcc data in some format chapter 9 is doing it remember also in their case the sres stuff is only minor component of the chapter so we can and i think we should because it is relevant and important material but with the proper caveats clearly up front ie that whatever we present is preliminary analysis that has not undergone publication process it would be certainly strange and confusing to have the sres discussed in chapter 9 but not in our chapter in some form besides we went through significant effort to get it and process it i myself think that the sres information is important to provide it is just unfortunate but not surprising that it came around too late 3 so the question is at this point how do we present the sres i suggested not to incorporate it within the text of 103 since 103 is our assessment of published research which has undergone peer and government review i stand strongly by that suggestion obviously 103 might need bit of rewriting to make it flow better with possibly different conclusions but not more than that i then suggested to make the box an sres box including the format figures i thought we needed 4 ie two for each scenario but linda pointed out we really need only 2 one for precip and one for temperature each including the two scenariost now this offers several advantages we can say right up front that this is from preliminary analysis we can separate it cleanly from the rest of the official text it gives direct info in format that people seem to like two very legitimate comments were made on this peter said if we give this more palatable format the figures only for sres data would it not implicitly give it too much attention linda said why not present similar plots for the is92 data the obvious action which would address both of these concerns is to present similar plots for the is92 data this is certainly an option the only problem i see is that i think the clear separation of published and unpublished results would be lost if we put it in the box the alternative is to do those figures and put them in 103 leaving the sres for the box this could be good option although it might require significant effort all and all i am still in favor of an sresonly box with clear statement up front that gets us off the hook in case of problems you can see it as sort of disclaimer i guess so lets come to the next point we need to decide on this and soon the best way appears to be conference call linda suggested thursday which is fine with it now looks like richard cannot organize this so linda i am afraid you are left with the organization of it the call would have to be during europeansouth african afternoon us morning and i am afraid i am not sure what time in australia problems is jens can you make it i think jens is the person in the group most strongly opposed to presenting sres data so it important he is in the conference call it is also critical that peter participates given he has been the main player in all this now here is my proposal conference call on thursday 3 pm triestehamburg time which means 4 pm cape town time 2 pm bracknell time 9 am boulder time 8 am fairbanks time and australia time linda is this feasible for you to organize is this ok for all conbin are you available at all items of discussion question 1 do we do an sres box with figures question 2 what are the technical details n1 vs n2 model agreement inclusion of outliers threshold for large vs small vs change both for precip change and temperature amplification factor question 3 do we do similar figures for is92 data which would either replace the current figures on is92 in the text i think this would be perfectly acceptable since it is simply way to present in different way published results question 4 how do we incorporate the sres results within the current executive summary i hope that by thursday i will have all data to do all relevant figures i need to get ccc control and mpidmi data from bruce and dig out the old is92 data if not by thursday then hopefully by friday once i have the data i can easily directly calculate all the thresholds necessary for doing the relevant figures i will then circulate all the material to you needless to say that any data based on sres that is circulated among us should not go any further except for the chapter of course until we decide what to do with it paper or something like that in the mean time i will never tire to keep asking you to please work on the section revisions and lets get those out of the way cheers filippo filippo giorgi senior scientist and head physics of weather and climate section the abdus salam
