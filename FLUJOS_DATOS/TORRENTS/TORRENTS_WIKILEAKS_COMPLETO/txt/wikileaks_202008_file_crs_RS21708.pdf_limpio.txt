congressional budget office cbo and joint tax committee jct estimates of the possible revenue effects of extending the expiring jgtrra tax provisions the estimated revenue losses indicate that extending the expiring jgtrra provisions could cost more than 630 billion during the fy2005 through fy2010 period revenue losses of this magnitude represent an increase of well over 50 in cbos cumulative baseline deficit projection for the same period the most expensive of these provisions accounting for almost half of the total revenue loss would be the extension of the 50 bonus depreciation deduction maintaining the increase in the alternative minimum tax exemption would also be expensive reducing revenue by pproximately 181 billion over the period the revenue estimates of
