landlocked south american country bordering argentina bolivia and brazil and has populati on of about 65 million predominately concentrated in and around the capital city of asunción th majority of the population is of mixed spanish and guaraní indian descent both spanish and guaraní are the official languages with over 90 of the population fl uent in guaraní paraguays per capita income was 1400 in 2006 according to the world bank one of the lowest in south america while about 60 of the people live in poverty and 32 live in extreme poverty according to the economic commission for latin america and the caribbean2 political situation3 the current political context in paragu ay has been shaped by the countrys turbulent political history in the late 19th century twoparty system emerged with the formation of the colorado party and th liberal party but the colorado party soon became the dominant political force ruling between 1887 and 1904 paraguay was defeated in the war of the triple alliance 18641870 against argentina brazil and uruguay and lost 25 of its territory and over half of its population this defeat led to an extensive period of political instability with three civil wars in the first half of the 20th century and war with bolivia between 19321935 the chaco war that further weakened political institutions nd hindered economic development the liberals ruled from 1904 until 1940 until the military assumed control with succession of authoritarian leaders the colorado party returned to power in 1946 and has remained in power until the present day making it the longestruling political party in the world in the latehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34180crs2 1940s the party began to assume greater control over state institutions and the bureaucracy to the point where party membership was prerequisite for civil service positions and promotion in the military further perpetuating the colorado partys dominance general alfredo stroessner who was member of the colorado party staged coup in 1954 and consolidated power in repressive military dictatorship that lasted 35 years the key to the stroessner regimes longevity was an alliance among figure 1 map of paraguayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34180crs3 4 brun p 576the military dominant economic groups and the colorado party the military regime was characterized by strong political repression the pe rsonalization of authority ultranationalist and anticommunist rhet oric and widespread corruption with democratic advances occurring in othe r south american c ountries stroessner ultimately was overthrown in 1989 coup and fled to brazil where he lived until his death in 2006 in 2004 truth and jus tice commission ultimately was set up to investigate human rights abuses that occurred under the stroessner regime the overthrow of the stroessner regime initiated process of democratization with the enactment of new constitution in 1992 and competitive elections held for the first time in 1993 despite the mocratic transition however many characteristics of the countrys extensiv period of military rule have persevered although opposition partie s have held majority in congress the dominance of the colorado party has remained intact includi ng its control over the state apparatus the political culture has remained product of the countrys authoritarian past with pervasive corruption and clientelism nascent democratic institutions have been weak and almost every poststroessner pres ident has faced some legal troubles in 1996 army commander general lino ov iedo revolted after president juan carlos wasmosy ordered him to step dow n oviedo resigned but attempted to run in the 1998 presidential elections as th colorado partys candidate oviedos candidacy was nullified after the suprem court upheld his c onviction and ratified 10year prison term for his barracks revo lt oviedos running mate raúl cubas was elected president in 1998 and defied the supreme court by freeing oviedo from prison as one of his first acts in office this action led to the initiation of impeachment proceedings against the president and intensified the rivalry between vice president luis maria argaña and pr esident cubas and oviedo argaña was assassinated in march 1999 and blame was placed on both cubas and oviedo sparking widespread demons trations and violence in as unción president cubas was forced to resign and both he and oviedo fled the country as result luis gonzalez macchi the president of the senate completed the presidential term and attempted to establish government of national unity but
