classified by econ mc matthias mitman for reasons 14 bd putinberlusconi direct link 1 cnf xxxxxxxxxxxx told us during february 4 lunch that his embassy and his foreign ministry often only learn of conversations between pm berlusconi and pm putin after the fact and with little detail or background he expressed frustration about the pms direct line which sometimes leaves the embassy in the dark he said if there is action to be taken the cabinet secretary will instruct the foreign ministry or the embassy without providing any background and only note that berlusconi and putin had agreed on whatever the action item is xxxxxxxxxxxx explained that while the close relationship is not ideal from the bureaucracys perspective and more detrimental than beneficial it can be useful at times he cited the case of the sale to gazprom by italian energy giant eni of its 20 share in gazproms oil subsidiary gazpromneft he said gazprom had insisted on paying far below the market price but that it ultimately paid the market price after berlusconi weighed in with putin eni and enel 2 cnf in response to our comment that enis moscow representative ernesto ferlenghi wont meet with us xxxxxxxxxxxx said ferlenghi for some reason doesnt like to meet with foreign diplomats note we had very open and friendly meeting with ferlenghi about two years ago but ever since he has deflected our requests for meeting see also ref b end note xxxxxxxxxxxx said he believes ferlenghi may have directive from eni headquarters to refer foreign governments to enis romebased international governmental affairs director while xxxxxxxxxxxx his cell phone rang it was ferlenghi explained that although major projects such as the proposed south stream gas pipeline gain the most attention enis main business in russia is buying gas 3 cnf xxxxxxxxxxxx said the italian embassy is organizing visit by trade and investment delegation to novy urengoi the yamal region city that is project site of severenergia an upstream jointventure between gazprom eni and italys enel gazprom bought controlling stake in severenergia from eni and enel which had set up severenergia to purchase some of the assets of the former yukos oil company at its bankruptcy auction xxxxxxxxxxxx said that in addition to its investment in severenergia enel also has approximately 6 billion invested in the russian electricity sector and may raise its investment in that sector to 9 billion south stream and samsunceyhan 4 cnf xxxxxxxxxxxx also noted that eni xxxxxxxxxxxx and we presumably the italian government have regular contact with russian dpm and energy czar igor sechin xxxxxxxxxxxx said that lately the discussions relate to an explicit business link between south stream and the proposed samsunceyhan turkish oil pipeline of which eni is the operating partner he explained that eni and its turkish partner which he said is turkish pm erdogans soninlaw need russian oil to make samsunceyhan reality while gazprom needs turkish cooperation to move ahead on south stream comment 5 cnf on major issues it seems that russianitalian moscow 00000266 002 of 002 economic relations are directed by pms who have direct line to each other as well as control over some of the largest assets of their respective economies to whatever end they direct those assets it is likely they are not doing so based solely on commercial or rateofreturn calculations as our contact himself acknowledged it seems that everything that happens at the lower levels is just for show beyrle
