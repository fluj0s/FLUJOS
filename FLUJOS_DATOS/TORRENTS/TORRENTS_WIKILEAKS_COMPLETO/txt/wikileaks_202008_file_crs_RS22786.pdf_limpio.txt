senator barrack obama the sponsor of such legislation in 2006 contended it is in the best interest of th agency and public safe ty to have management and labor cooperate in contract negotiations and if that is impossible then one side should be able to impose its views on the other20 in june 2007 two bills that directly ddress the faas medi ation procedure were introduced hr 2673 the federal aviation ad ministration fair bor management act of 2007 was introduced by representative john l mica on june 12 2007 s 1735 measure that would amend title 49 of the us code to improve dispute resolution provisions related to the federal aviation administration personnel management system was introduced by senator charles sc humer on j une 28 2007 both bills would amend 49 usc 40122a2 and authoriz the involvement of fsip binding arbitration would be possibility under both measures if the parties fail to r each agreement hr 2673 would permit fsip to consider the negotiation impasse in manner consistent with 5 usc 7119 and the regulations that have been issued pursuant to that section in general 5 usc 7119 identif ies the composition and duties of fsip 5 usc 7119c5biii indicat that

report rl33920 federal aviation administration reauthorization an overview of selected provisions in proposed legislation by bart elias et the panel may take whatever action is ne cessary and not inconsistent with 5 usc chapter 71 to resolve the impasse including but not limited to methods and procedures which the panel considers appropriate such as directing the parties to accept factfinders recommendations or dering binding arbitration conducted according to whatever procedure the pane l deems suitable and rendering binding decision21 s 1735 also contemplates the use of bi nding arbitration however unlike hr 2673 which seems to recognize binding arb itration as one option for resolving an impasse s 1735 would require fs ip to order binding arbitra tion if there was an impasse arbitration under s 1735 would be conducted by private arbitration board composed of three members each party to the arbitra tion would be permitted to select one arbitrator from list of 15 arbitrators developed by th director of the federal mediation and conciliation service the two arbitrators would then select third arbitrator from the list s 1735 would require the arbitration board to give the parties full and fair hearing including an opportunity to present evidence the arbitration boa rd would have 90 days after its appointment to render deci sion hr 2673 does not provide similar requirements with regard to the composition of an arbitration panel or deadline for issuing decision provisions to modify the faa mediation system were also included in two faa reauthorization measures s 1300 the avia tion investment and modernization act of 2007 and hr 2881 the faa reauthorization act of 2007 under both measures fsip would be required to order bindi ng arbitration by private ar bitration board if there was an impasse hr 2881 also includes provi sion that would invalidate any changes that were implemented by the faa administrat or on and after july 10 2005 without the agreement of the exclusive bargaining representative22 the parties would be governed by their last mutual agreement until new contract was adopted this provision would appear to have the effect of undoing the ne w contract that was implemented on june 5 200623
