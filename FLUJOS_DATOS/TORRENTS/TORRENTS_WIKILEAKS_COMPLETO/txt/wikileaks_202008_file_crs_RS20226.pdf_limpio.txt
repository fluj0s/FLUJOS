the senate on may 20 1999 this report will be updated as appropriate background and current statutory language relating to discipline idea was originally enacted in 1975 due to the fact that children with disabilitie s often failed to receive an education or received an inappropriate education this lack of education led to numerous judicial decisions including parc v state of pennsylvania1 and mills v boar d of education of the district of columbia which found constitutional2 infirmities with the lack of education for children with disabilities when the states wer providing education for children without disabilities as result the states were unde r considerable pressure to pr ovide such services and they lobbied congress to assist them3 congress responded with the grant program still contained in idea but also delineate d specific requirements that the states must follow in order to receive these federal fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20226crs2 484 us 305 19884 srept 10517 105 cong

was dispute between the school and the parents of the child with disability the child must stay put in h is or her current educational placement until the dispute is resolved revised stay put provision remains in idea issues relating to children with disabilities who exhibited violent or inappropriat behavio r have been raised for years and in 1988 the question of whether there was n implied exception to the stay put provision was presented to the supreme court in honig v doe although the supreme court did not find such an implied exception it did find4 that ten day suspension was allowable and that schools could seek judicial relief when the parents of truly dangerous child refuse to permit change in placement in 1994 congress amended ideas stay put provision to give schools unilateral authority t remove child with disability to an interim alternative educational setting if the child was determined to have brought firearm to school in 1997 congress made significant changes to idea and attempted to strike careful balance between the leas local education agencyduty to ensure that schoo l environments are safe and conducive to learning for all children including children with disabilities and the leas continuing obligation to ensure that children with disabilitie s receive free appropriate public ed ucation this current law does not immunize child5 with disability from disciplinary proce dures but these procedures may not be identical to those for children without disabilities in brief if child with disability commits n action that would be subject to discipline school personnel have the following options suspending the child for up to ten days with educational services provided conducting manifestation determination review to determine whether there is link between the childs disability and the misbehavior if the childs behavior is not manifestation f disability long term disciplinary action such as expulsion may occur except that educational services may not cease if the childs behavior is manifestation of the childs disability the school may review the childs placement and if appropriate initiate change in placement placing the child in an interim alte rnative education setting for up to forty five days which can be renewed for situations involving weapons or drugs and asking hearing officer to order child be placed in an interim alternativ educational setting for up to forty five days which can be renewed if it i s demonstrated that the child is substantially likely to injure himself or others in his current placement school officials may also seek honig injunction as discussed previously if they are unable to reach agreement with students parents and they feel that the new statutor provisions are not sufficient 6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20226crs3 continued6 education act discipline provisions in pl 10517 crs report 9842 april 19 1999 145 cr s5691 may 20 19997 145 cr s5541 may 19 19998 20 usc 1412

which passed the senate on ma 20 1999 by vote of 74 to 25 an amendment offered to s 254 by7 senators frist and ashcroft to be referred to as the school safety act of 1999 wa s included in the senate passed legislation essentially this am endment would amend section 615 of idea to eliminate the requiremen ts regarding disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities who carry or possess gun or firearm to or at school on schoo l premises or to or at school functions under this amendment school personnel could discipline child with disability who possess ed gun or firearm at school in the same manner as child without disabilit could be disciplined child with disability who is disciplined under this amendmen t would be able to assert defense that the carryi ng or possession of the gun or firearm was unintentional or innocent this provision could help to addr ess the problem of child with limited mental c apacities who had someone place gun in his or her backpack however the exact implications of this provision are somewhat uncertain since it is not specified to whom or when this defense would be asserted during debate senator frist stated that this defense would be made to the schools principal or teacher and that the due process procedure applicable would be the same process available to every student8 the frista shcroft amendment further states that the idea provision regarding the continuation of educational services would not be applicable alt hough the local educational agency may choose to continue to provide educational services to the child in location determined by the local education age ncy educational agencies would not be considered in violation of the idea requirements regarding state or local educational agenc eligibility for funds because of the provision of disc ipline services or assistance under the9 amendment and actions taken under the amendment are not subject to other procedura l safeguard provisions of idea10 the definition of fire arm for the purposes of the amendment would be the definition at 18 usc 921 which reads the term firearm means any weapon including starter gun which will or i s designed to or may readily be converted to expel projectile by the action of n explosive b the frame or receiver of any such weapon c any firearm muffler r firearm silencer or d any destructive device such term does not include an antique firearm httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20226crs4 145 cr s5529 may 19 199911 id 12 145 cr s5690 may 20 199913 145 cr s5689 may 20 199914 145 cr s5684 may 20 199915 145 c r s5687 may 20 1999quoting from letter from the national association of stat e16 boards of education it should also be noted that an amendment proposed by senator harkin also passed the senate with s 254 this amendment which does not specifically address idea would continuedthe amendm ent includes conforming changes relating to citations to section 615 of idea similarly sub section would be added to the gunfree schools act stating that notwithstanding any other provision of 20 usc 8921 the s ection shall be subject to the amendment contained in section 615 of idea the fristashcroft amendment was the subject of extensive debate in the senate senator frist stated the amendment would change existing law which he described s allowing one child in special education class who brings gun or bomb to school to betreated prefe rentially compared to another child who does not have disability or is not in special education who brings gun or bomb to school tying this issue to recent11 school shootings senator frist further observed clearly the way we have set up this federal ly mandated disciplinary procedure with this loophole sends students mixed message about guns in schools it basically says if you are in special education you are going to be treated in special way if you bring gun into school but if you are not in special education you are going to be treated lik everybody else an d you are going to be expelled what mixed message when we are talking about guns when we are talking about the shootings the 27 deaths in ou r classrooms and schools that we have witnessed we must respond 12 similarly senator ashcroft described the amendmen t as school safety issue he also13 stated this is bill that provides for equity simply saying that principals an d superintendents should have the power without interference from the federa l governmen t to remove students from school who come to school with firearm n explosive or gun14 senator harkin disagreed with this characteri zation of the amendment he noted that under current law school authorities can unilaterally remove child with disability first of all for the first 10 days and provide ser vices whatsoever second if it is found that their actions were not manifestatio n of their disability then of course he is treated in the same manner as nondisabled children and can be kept out in alternative settin g forever senator harkin also argued that the amendment would make the schools and15 communities less safe as children would be out on the streets with educational services and quoted from numerous letters from police and prison authori ties as well as the national pta and the national associa tion of state boards of education the common theme in these letters was concern about denying children with behavioral problems educationa l services since this was seen as shifting the problem to the neighborhood and street s surrounding the school 16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20226crs5 continued16 require school personnel to ensure that immediate appropriate int erventions and services including mental heal th interventions and services are provided to child removed from school for any act of violence including carrying or possessing weapon at school funds are authorized t support this program 145 cr s5534 may 19 199917senator jeffo rds also opposed the fristashcroft amendment agreeing with senator harkin that current law allows for removal f child with disability who has disciplinary problem although educ ational services must be provided after ten days senator jeffords observed the basic question is in the final analysis should the school have to afford an alternative education situation and pay for it 17
