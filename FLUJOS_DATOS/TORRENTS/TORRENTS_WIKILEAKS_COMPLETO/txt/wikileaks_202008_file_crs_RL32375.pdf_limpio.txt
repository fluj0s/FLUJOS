appeared to give it lower priority than other trade matters but on november 13 2002 ustr zoellick notified c ongressional leaders that the administration would begin negotiations with australia the negotiations proved unexpectedly difficult presiden t bush and australian prime minister howard had committed to completing th negotiations by the end of 2003 but differences over agriculture and other sensitive issues caused the deadline to slip the first of five rounds of negotiati ons took place in canberra march 1721 2003 the fifth last and longest round took place in washington december 1 2003 and february 8 2004 although the negotiations took longer than expected they were completed in less time than the fta negotiations with chile and singapore the usafta negotiations over manuf actured goods proceeded smoothly tariffs on bilateral trade in most manufactured goods are already low the average applied australian mostfavor ednation mfn tariff is 43 and its average tariff on agriculture imports is 128 the average applied us mfn tariff is 51 and its average mfn tariff on agricultural products is 1009 issues pertaining to trade in agricultural goods proved the most diffi cult and forced the negotiations into overtime in the end both countries were determined to complete the agreement to do so each side acceded to very nsitive areas of the other in order to bring the negotiations to conclusion this meant th at australia acceded to the us objective not to liberalize trade in sugar and to onl gradual opening of dairy and beef it meant that the united states acceded to australias position on preserving its pharmaceutical subsidy program and on ma intaining monopolies for the export of wheat barley and rice the united states also largely conceded to australia the right to restrict foreign content of television programs nd advertising and to preserve its sanitary nd phytosanitary regime the negotiations resulted in an agreement to substantially free manufactured goods trade substantia lly from duties and to eliminate or reduce tariffs and other barriers on most agricultural products with the notable exception of sugar the agreement commits both

conjectu re or remote possibility is clearly imminentthe fta provides that during the tran sition period the period during which duties on product are being eliminated an importing country may suspend the elimination of duties or increase the dutie s on the import of product from the other trading partner if as result of the reduction in duties imports increase in absolute terms or relative to domestic production as to be substan tial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the dom estic industry producing like product16 the increased duty that may be applied will not exceed the lesser of the most favorednation mfn duty rate in effect at the time the safeguard measure was taken or the mfn duty rate in effect preceding the date the usafta entered into force the trade remedy can be applied only afte r an investigation has been conducted to determine cause and injury the trade remedy measures can only be applied for two years but may be extended for another tw years if determination is made that conditions causing serious injury still exist furthermore while safeguards measure is in place the country applying the meas ure must compensate the other country by making concessions in other sectors that ar equivalent in value to the additional duties these measures can be used by either partner on both manufactured and agricultural goods pharmaceuticals the australian pharmaceutical benefits scheme pbs is 55yearold program under which the australian government subsidizes the costs for pharmaceuticals to be eligible for the subsidy the drug must be approved be forehand and appear on list of subsidyeligible drugs if there ar two or more brands of the same drug the pbs will subsidize the cheapest brand the united states has asserted that the methods that the australian government uses to determine which brands to subsidize do not take into account the be nefits of newer innovative drugs many of which are produced in the united states and that cost more than older drugs these pharmaceuticals are therefore at disadvantage in the australian market during the negotiations the united states pressed australian negotiators to make the procedures for selecting eligible drugs more transparent and to make the benefits of innovative drugs factor in termining which brands will be subsidized under annex2c australia agreed to tablish procedures for reviewing product listings and to make more transparen t the process by which the amount of reimbursement for pharmaceuticals is set the united states and australia also agreed to establish medicines working group consisting of federal officials from each country who are responsible for federa l healthcare programs these officials will work together on emerging health policy

the pbac in addition australia agr eed to expedite the process as much as possible and to provide opportunities for the reimbursement amount to be readjusted next to agriculture the pbs proved to be the most controversial issue in the negotiations the issue exposed fundament differences between the us and australian healthcare systems and how each treats costs of pharmaceuticals borne by their citizens it is an issue that may be more widely debated when the congress considers the agreement during congressional consideration of the agreement and the implementing legislation some members of congress expressed cerns about the impact of chapter 1794 of the agreement and its potential impact on the reimportation of usbrand pharmaceuticals into the united states chapter 17 pertains to intellectual property rights protecti on that provision reads as follows each party shall provide that the exclusiv right of the patent owner to prevent importation of patented product or product that results from patented process without the consent of the pate nt owner shall not be limited by the sale or distribution of that produc t outside its territory at least where the patentee has placed restrictions on importation by contract or other means the concerns centered on whether th is provision would prohibit the us congress if it so chooses to pass law that would permit the reimportation of us patented drugs into the united states ustr zoellick argued that the provision provides new legal rights to us patent holders and that such rights as stated the provision are already in us law in ddition he argued that trade agreement can prevent the us congress from changing us law by passing another law17 nevertheless the issue may arise as the united states negotiates ftas with other trading partners and implementing legislation for the agreements are considered by the congress agricultural products agricultural issues were the greatest challenge in the bilateral fta negotiations

th sugar quota and it remains unchanged under the usafta australian exports of wheat rice barl ey and sugar are monopolies of state sanctioned commodity boards or singl desk arrangements during the

maintain the singledesk arrangements but agreed to work with the united states in the wto to eliminate restrictions on the right of private entities who are apart from the commodity boards to export

or just under 1 of total us exports to australia and us imports of textiles and apparel totaled 2536 million or about 4 of total us imports from australia the usafta chapter 4 and annex4a provides for speci safeguard measures to dampen the adverse effects of surges in textile and apparel imports in usaustralian bilateral trade if either australia or the united st ates determines that imports of textile or apparel products from the other are increasing at such rate as to be substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry then it can apply trade remedy in the form of higher dut to allow the domestic industry to adjust the safeguard measures are similar to but different from the general safeguard measures described earlier in the usaf ta one important difference is that compensation to the country that is the target of the safeguard measure must be in the form of concessions on textile and apparel unless the tw countries otherwise agree the usafta contains rules of origin that specifically apply to textiles and apparel the agreement applies the yarn forward principle that is fabrics produced for export must be formed entirely from yarns formed in either the united states or australia and apparel for expor t must be produced entirely from fabrics produced in either australia or the united states from yarns entirely formed in either of the two countries in addition the pparel must be cut or knit to shape or assembled in either australia or the united states there are number of exceptions to this principle that are productspeci fic and outlined in annex 4a of the agreementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32375crs12 21 department of commerce calculationsin addition to the safeguard measures nd rules of origin the usafta provides that tariffs on textiles and apparel are to be eliminated more gradually than tariffs on other manufactured goods for example whereas 100 of us imports of non textile and apparel manufactured goods from austra lia will become dutyfree immediately when the usafta enters into force only 7 of us imports of textiles and apparel from au stralia will become dutyfree immediately around 86 of those imports will not become entirel dutyfree until the agreement has been in force 10 years21 trade in nonfinancial services the usafta chapter 10 covers the sa production distri bution marketing and delivery of services and also paymen t for services the obligations under the usafta mirror closely and in some cases exceed those that the united states and australia have undertaken in the wt under the general agreement on trade in services gats the usafta covers service transactions delivered in any of three ways from the territory of one ftacountry to the terr itory of the other in the territory of one ftacountry by national of that c ountry to national from the second fta country and by national of one ftacountry in the territory of the second the agreement requires the united states nd australia to accord

imposing restrictions on the number of service providers the total value of service transactions that can be provided the tota l number of service operations or the total quantity of services output or the total number of natural persons that can be employed in services operation in addition the two governments could not require service provider from the other ftacountry to have presence in its territory in order to provide services there are exceptions to this coverage that are listed in chapter 10 as is the case with the gats the usafta allows the united states and australia to make exceptions nonconforming measures to the national treatment mfn market access and local presence re strictions the exceptions apply to any existing nonconforming measure at the fede ral or regional leve ls of government and that are specifically identified in either annex i or annex ii of the agreement and to all nonconforming meas ures maintained by local governments the nonconforming measures listed in annex i ca nnot be made more restrictive and if made less restrictive are th bound those listed in annex ii can be made more restrictive and are not bound if made ss restrictive the usafta adopts the negative list approach to the coverage of services that is the countries are obligated to cover all service sectors except those specifically listed in the annexes in contrast under the gats service sector is covered unless specifically identified the usaftas coverage is therefore more comprehensive in terms of usaustralian bilateral services tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32375crs13

additional legislation if local financial service providers are allowed to provide the same service however the provider of th new service could be required to obtain authorization and to provide the new service in particular institutional or juridical form the usafta permits an ftacountry to recognize as valid the prudential measures of nonfta countries without auto matically recognizing the validity of the other partners measures but it must give the other ftapartner the opportunity to show why its prudential measures should be so recognized the usafta also requires the establishment of

the same annexes for services of the agreement australia has used annexes i and ii to preserve its right to screen foreign investments all foreign investments in australia are subject to government screening and approval while this process has apparently not stopped us investors from establishing successful operations in australia representatives of the us business community insisted that the process does not conform to the principle of national treatment that is treating foreign investors less favorably than domestic investors the united states has used its right to exceptions among other things to preserve programs to encourage minorityowned businesses at the outset of the negotiations ustr zoellick stated that he wanted the australian government to eliminate or reduce trade distorting investment measures24 the australian government had indicated that changing the process might be difficult25 however in compromise the united states has allowed australia to maintain its screening process australia agreed to eliminate screening of us investment in new entities greenfield investments it also agreed to increase the threshold value from a50 million to 800 million above which us acquisitions of established entities in australia will have to be screened26 the threshold on us investments in some sensitive sectors such as telecommunications transportation and defenserelated areas will remain at a50milli on us acquisitions of australian financial institutions will also remain restricted27 during the negotiations the united states insisted that special investorstate dispute mechanism be established under th usafta australia argued that such mechanism will not be necessary becau us and austra lian legal traditions regarding investment were ve ry similar and us investor s will receive fair treatment in australian courts the united states agreed to keep the mechanism out of the agreement but the agreement contains provision that will allow the establishment of an investorstate disput mechanism if changed circumstances warrant it other issues the usafta contains provi sions covering other re latively noncontroversial but nevertheless important as pects of usaustralian tr ade and investment the provisions on labor chapter 18 and environment chapter 19 are structurally similar because the australian and us economies are both modern and industrialized and are at s imilar levels of velopment with similar average wage levels and environmental sta ndards labor and environmen t issues have not been cause of bilateral trade friction ne vertheless the usafta commits the two countries to enforce their respective labor rights laws that is those laws that are directly related to the internationally recognized labor principles and

interpretation of the agreement the agreement requires the formation of joint committee of representatives from each fta country that will meet annually to review the operation of the agreement to consider and to discuss possible disputes or change s that one or the other country wishes to make to the agreement the agreement places premium on resolving through consultation but if that means fails it pr ovides for the establishment of panel to arbitrate the dispute and assign compensation if warranted reactions to the agreement with some notable exceptions the reactions to the usafta of

that some issues regarding australias sanitary and phytosanitary sps regime still needed to be resolved before us agricultural exporters will be able to take full advantage of the agreement that the agreement does not include an investorstate dispute provision and calls for the us government to ensure that such provision be added if it proves warranted and that the environmental provisions in the

independent labor movement it has an imba lanced inadequate system of labor laws that fail to fully protect workers rights30 the agricultural negotiations were the most difficult and the results somewhat ambiguous the reactions of agricultura l and food producers reflect the ambiguity us sugar producers were relieved that the agreement did not include liberalization of sugar imports while sugarusing proce ssors were critical us wheat exporters oppose the agreement because australia will be permitted to retain its singledesk monopoly on wheat exports pork producers have indicated that they will not support the agreement until australia imple ments final risk assessment on us pork for import into australia and us pork exports to that market begin to increase the reaction of beef producers has been mix ed they are disappointed that greater access to the us market for australian exporters was not matched by openings in other foreign markets for us beef ex porters through the

major shifts in trade patterns in large in creases in the total volume of trade or in significant trade diversion an analysis of the potential economic effects of the usafta conducted by the united states international trade commission concluded that the largest percentage increases in us exports to australia will occur in coal oil gas and other mineral products textiles pparel and leather products and other processed food and tobacco products although these increases will occur from small bases the largest value increases in us exports to australia will occur in other machinery and equipment and motor vehicles and parts the largest percentage increases in us imports from australia will occur in textile apparel and leather products meat products and other pro cessed food and

to 6394 million if the agreement is fully implemented34 under the usafta the united states and australia addressed the few significant irritants in their bilateral economic relationship accordingly the agreement could further solidify an already strong relationship for australia those irritants include us restrictions on beef and dairy products for the united states they include australian local content requirements in television programming sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures statesanctioned monopolies in exports of wheat and other grains and screening of foreign investments in some cases such as us restrictions on beef and dairy nd australian investment screening the two sides agreed to loosen restrictions in the case others such as the australian sps measures and statesanctione d monopolies they agreed to establish mechanisms for further discussion however in the case of some irritants such as us import controls on sugar the two countries agreed change was possible the agreement may have implications for us trade policy and strategy as whole enactment of the agreement will build on the increased us use of ftas especially by the bush administration as trade liberalization tool for some observers ftas act as building blocks to global trade liberalization especially at time when the mu ltilateral nego tiations in the wto are pro ceeding slowly at best others have argued that ftas undermine multilateral trade libera lization efforts and create confusing web of intert wining economic relationships if approved by congress the usafta may also set precedents for other ftas the united states might form for example the steps that australia agreed to take to make the pharmaceutical benefits system more transparent may be model for the united states in future ftas with countries that have similar government subsidized drug programs some observers have also suggested that the exclusion of us sugar import restrictions from the usafta will encourage other trading partners to exclude politicallysensitive products from agreements with the united states or encourage other us import sensitive industries to push for exclusion in future trade agreements
