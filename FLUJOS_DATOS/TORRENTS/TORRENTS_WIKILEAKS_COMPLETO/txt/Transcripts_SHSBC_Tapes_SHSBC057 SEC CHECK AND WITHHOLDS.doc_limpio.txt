sec check and withholds lecture given on 13 september 1961 okay well how are you doing today huh audience fine all right all right its apparently the what the 13th audience 13th september ad 11 all right now youre well immersed into the idea and one or two of you into the practicalities of running an engram i dont know how you got away with it or how good it was or wasnt but did it run all the way out is it still reacting on the needle this engram speak female voice evelyn she had one another female voice well i ran several how long did each one take female voice well they certainly took unfortunately i had to watch the time of the next preclear coming so that got in the way bit but we flattened off quite bit and one did go completely flat that was the first one female voice well i had two preclears running you see first one didnt because his session came to an end so i popped him out of it but the second preclear ran one flat and theres another one still sparking on how many another female voice shes auditing two people well im talking about one pc now did one engram get run on one pc female voice yes and did one engram get partially run on one pc but not flattened female voice thats right oh yeah whens it going to get flattened female voice next session i hope all right whos the pc thats got the unflattened engram oh you female voice yeah ah well that accounts for you not speaking up i suppose all right well so much for that the routine ive been talking to you about plan of clearing is very important thing i have been very leery you see of putting too many sawedoff shotguns in your hands but there is way to walk around this and we have to just front up to it and realize that youve got to use all the weapons and tools that are at your command in order to do the job you cant fool with it apparently there is shortcut to clearing any more than there is royal road to geometry well now the only way that you can front up to the fact of clears is to clear people and apparently there is short road by which this is done there is fast road in terms of exactly what you do and i gave it to you in yesterdays lecture but there is circuitous easy road do you get the ideathe difference here there could possibly be some milder more in keeping with repetitive commandless demand on the auditor is what im talking about there could be ive been looking for something like that all summer and have been testing with it and trying to do something about it and cases make progress but i will tell you that this is final conclusion and i dont care to make any further conclusions on the matter unless you have found the pcs goal and terminal youre auditing hodgepodge and they get better they dont get better and they go up and they go down and theyyou know and so on etc blah if you find their goal and find the pcs terminal why theyre on the road and if you run the terminal on the prehav scale you can only run it just so far and the person runs into certain series of engrams and gets well into chain of engrams and these engrams then are available to be run and they have to be run and thats that because pc all by himself puttering around is going to playi dont know whether they do schottisches on the outskirts of these engrams or what but they certainly dont do anything in the engram it requires an auditors skill to push them in there is substitute for security check security check has to be well done but again security check done on any other version than just straight security check form runs into this other phenomena of just running random engrams and stirring up the bank and that sort of thing and although you get off more withholds and although there are very tricky ways to run security checks just on the straight things the best security check is the straight security check for my money there are various things you have to do sometimes because not all the questions are present on the security check and pcs can think of great many random things to do with security check there is question on it that says for instance well have you ever made pc guilty for giving you withhold we just ran into that one and that was hotter than pistol wasnt it and the security check wasnt working wasnt working on this person and finally mary sue with large long blue sparki think her sparks are usually tinged with slight pinksaid well lets see if hes done anything unusual with the pcs withholds and he had done something unusual with the pcs withholds and was keeping the security check from working in other words you have to be smart to run security check but the best and fastest security check is just straightforward check all right in running engrams you again have to have good subjective reality on what an engram is all about in order to run an engram well but that doesnt say that you cannot run an engram without any subjective reality because that is going to have to be done and remember that i have run engrams with subjective reality of any kind whatsoever 1947 never been through birth and id run people through birth and so forth so this can be done you see now as we look on the pros and cons and the pluses and minuses on this type of an approach it is very blunt approach and it demanded certain tools andthe instructors of the washington course by the way arei just smell ittheyre just being little bit sparky they dont believe that the goals possibly could have occurred in the first 150 because none of the thirty people on the course were able to find goal on the 150 given by the pc you see they didnt believe their rudiments were out they just didnt believe their rudiments were out they cant believe it they cant face up to it yet on that course they were not crosschecking rudiments in other words student on the course was not taking student bs pc and checking to find out if the rudiments were out and then telling student b you see that routine was missing and the most clears were made in the south african course where that was done crosschecks of rudiments so rudiments are not always out for the auditor see it isnt that the auditor is being careless theyre not always out for the pcs particular auditor the pc gets into frame of mind where he believes that this auditor is skilled or confident and he swears by this auditor and therefore doesnt feel ill at ease at all you see and knows that if he gave up withhold that the auditor isnt going to chew him up with the withhold you see and he gets into this state of somnolence with regard to rudiments theyre wildly out hes got present time problems and everything else but he has confidence in his auditor and so he doesnt register you get the idea hed just as soon go into session for this auditor apparently but in actuality the rudiments are out another auditor checks the rudiments on that particular pc and they are wildly out theyre not necessarily now wildly out for an auditor or another auditor theyre just out its the fact that the pcs confidence or attitude toward his auditor or lack of confidence in the auditor or something else has put him to point where he just doesnt have present time problems and withholds while being audited by joe dont you see he just doesnt have them they are affecting the living daylights out of his case its just peculiarity now we havent even really gotten to the bottom of the peculiarity and probably there are great deal of odds and ends of mechanisms involved in this that havent been brought to view one of the mechanisms i did bring to view on it however is that an auditorpc as team get withholds you see they get withholds on the rest of the world so that anything given off by the pc to the auditor is looked upon as further confidence see its not being given up its just being passed to one person carefully so as not to be passed to anybody else dont you see so eventually they get whole bunch of withholds off but how far off are they theyre off on the understanding that they wont go any further and just to satisfy and placate the american psychotic association we put that keep the secrets of your pc you see in the auditors code well its good idea everybodys been doing it and so forth but thats the only part of the code of scientologist or the auditors code which i just wouldnt myself much believe in because right away its defeating isnt it it says well this withhold can go one person and thats it or on the other hand you start making with somebodys withholds and another evil develops so on so mabecause person is being punished for his withholds by the society which is all triggered to punish people for their withholds now little bit more further than that several times in research we have found this to be the case but i dont know if youre aware of the fact that pcs quite often get off withholds which are total lies and they go on reacting because they are lies and they get all messed up because theyve told lie and there are some people around who get off withholds to get other people in trouble quote get off withholds unquote its quite interesting i mean yousome auditor is guilelessly auditing this pc and this pc says well yesterday joe stopped in the hall and kissed and slapped on the gluteus maximus and told something or other something or other and the auditor says what do you know you know well he cant quite get it to clear and he thinks theres more to it and it goes on and on and then it finally just sags out of view somehow or another and he isnt reading his meter carefully you know and he goes around with the complete idea that this has occurred well of course the pc has now put himself out of session by miscommunicating to the auditor and the auditor unfortunately will very often go around and say well that joe hes really character you know he makes passes at women in halls nothing like this ever occurred i mean there are withholds quote unquote circulating around in scientology which have never occurred it is used by some pcs to spread entheta which isnt true ill tell you where this is most prevalent ill tell you how to spot this you get pc who never tells what theyve done but always says what somebody else has done did you ever rob bank but my father robbed bank you know that kind of thing you know and you watch this going on any length of time with pc and if its consistent you can be fairly sure that some of that pcs withholds that he gives you are just lies and you want to crosscheck on withholds for lies and you can just put it down as little rule because case can hang up by having given you false withhold thats something to know you see and you say well have you lied to about any of these withholds youve given today well we have little pintsize pc hes about as big as suitcase and so help pete if he didnt give his auditori dont know how many withholds he passed out the first day that he was being given childrens security check but it was something on the order of fifteen twenty maybe something like that comes back in the next day hes more honest than most and he says well ihuhhuh huhhuh two of those withholds i gave you yesterday are lies he woke up to it so you want to crosscheck on this sort of thing be particularly leery of anybody whos always giving withholds about somebody else see i have never held up bank but my last auditor uh id be particularly alert to this one in the first place thats not withhold withhold is what the pc himself did that is withhold plus the pc being an accessory to fact that is withhold now the pc being the accessory to the fact does not include the pc passing on all the bad data and all the rumors and so forth the pc has ever heard because of course the pcs not an accessory to the fact of any part of these things the pc didnt rob the bank the pc stood out on the corner and made sure the police werent coming while the bank was being robbed dont you see all right thats an accessorytothefact withhold and which is part of the withhold its quite valid withhold but it is something the pc did isnt it see the pc did stand on the corner the pc didnt rob the bank but the pc stood on the corner youll get this sort of thing youll get as withhold occasionally well i sat and listened to some violent criticism of and that the pc considers an overtand it was pc didnt speak up and shut it off or put anybody straight or anything they just sat and agreed with it all you see and all of sudden why this turns up as withhold but remember that was something the pc did the pc accepted tamely or agreed with you see or didnt do anything about situation but again its something the pc did dont you see it isnt the information that was given the pc that had nothing to do with it so youand then you always want to check as i have said check the security check for lies have you told any lies during this session of security checking are any of these things lies have you misrepresented the facts in any way while i have been security checking you well of course let the pc take umbrage but the harder the pc umbrages why the harder i push pc says what such thing ive never told lie in my life i said well all right which one of these withholds was lie well but ive never said anything like that ioh i never well ive never been so insulted in my life all right well lets check them over now lets take the first question did you lie on that one well not much thats the usual routine one two three four the more upset person gets about security check up to the point of refusing to take one which is the ultimate upset with security check the more withholds the person has it is proportionate scale it is directly proportional the more protest the more withholds right up to refusal to have any check of any kind whatsoever thats up now listen thats not some punishment mechanism im thinking of i have never had it fail now in much more thanwell its two years and more experience now with security checks i have never had it fail that the person who refusedi dont care if that person was straight off the streetthe person who has refused to have anything to do with security check was the most loaded of the lot you say well how do you find this out well thats not necessarily secret you take nonscientology staff or nonscientology personnel dont you seeweve had lot of experience with these not just hereand theyre pretty wild the person who has got fairly clean slate or halfway clean slate will come in and sit down and have security check but the person that you cant even see the black for the chalk you know and they say well thats against my rights we have rights here you might not understand it but we have rights rights now at first i sort of bought this but as time went on and i got crosschecks on these people i found out the more rights the more crime soon as somebody tells something like that anymore i just well what do you know so thats where the sugar has been going in fact id be perfectly liable to say that right out loud to them what else have you done around here that i dont know about and oddly enough theyll start breaking down drrrrrrr boom ah i didnt mean it and so forth and the spoons just leaped off the sideboard and into my pocket and what do you mean by having spoons that do this that is something to know that is something to know now the general mechanism of the security checkin that withholds can be abused person has the horrible choice of remaining static as case from there on out or getting them off and taking the chance that it ruins his reputation that hell be hanged and so forth well in two years of experience i have never seen anybody hanged for getting rid of withhold i have noticed occasionally on staffs and so forth an hco sec or somebody reading down sheet of withholds and finding one thats so damn contrary to organizational regulations or what were supposed to be doing or something of the sort that the person just goes up like small skyrocket and lands on the persons head in gigantic atomic explosion and the person is rather taken aback by all this what do you mean stealing mimeograph paper dont you know that stuff costs money wonder ive never had any mimeograph paper around here you know well thats actually bad theyre abusing withhold but why do anything about it why do anything about it another thing that happens with regard to withholds is very very funny and it was happening to us down in south africa im looking at student right now who was very baffled on two or three occasions but i think he came in on at least one occasion that i know of maybe two occasions and found his desk as director of materiel johannesburg practically covered with unidentifiable nonsource items all kinds of weird things organization property dont you see and i think this one thing was terribly mysterious awfully mysterious was that his office was locked and nobody had key to it except two or three top executives and yet he came in in the morning the office still locked and desk covered with all kinds of litter bricabrac you know missing tapes and missing books and missing this and that and somebody you see trying to get out from underneath itbeing found on the security check or something i dont know what all that wound up on but sooner or later of course somebody would collide with it anyway but when it comes to health or case advances or decent society and so forth actually society which makes it impossible for person to take any road out of course is doomed society that society can kiss itself goodbye it will go along with chaldea babylon and egypt any day and of course this society the present society is absolutely boobytrapped well goodness gracious the police are running around in circles up here right now im sure trying to solve some vast crime or another and get back some property or something and theres probably some thief sitting someplace saying good heavens why on earth and what possessed to steal queen victoria hat im sure i dont know you see and all this other junk and what am i going to do with it and the fences will have nothing to do with it and id happily give the stuff back but he cant the police couldnt accept it back andoh theyve got big ridge going of some kind or another id pull different deal if i were figuring out which way to go on such thing i wouldnt let people off scotfree on such things but i would sure send them someplace where they could get straightened out in other words i would make road out but in the existing society there is road out well handling security checks in society of this particular character then runs into little bit of heavy weather and you very often run into some heavy weather somebodys sitting there and good god theyre the fellow who did it you know and what are you going to do as the auditor you know well one of the things that occurs to you at once is theyre the one who did it and so forth they therefore are guilty and theyre criminal involved in the situation and what is your responsibility as an auditor well itsyour responsibility as an auditor is first and foremost as an auditor is get the person out of it youre not the police force dont you see and then you actually are not honor bound from that point there on to be under stamp and seal of total secrecy with regard to the fact that the first national bank was robbed by joe you see but dont go calling up the police theyre on the wrong road cops never get society anyplace cops are shortterm proposition strictly the more cops the more crime not the more crime there is the more cops see its the reverse quite the reverse if you had totally lawful society all youd have to do is look around and hire thousand police and youd have criminals well these fellows have to have something to do dont they theres game called cops and robbers and if there arent any criminals were going to make some and they dont protect the society various times on the track when ive done police work always operated on one basic mechanism that the responsibility of provost marshal or military governor or something like that was to public security public safety first and foremost public security that was the target not criminals you dont have anything to do with criminals you had to do with public security of course that makes kind of vigorous kind of law if you look it over and you find somebody standing on the crossroads with three people in the held up coach with bullets in them and hes got bloody jewels in his hands right at that moment well you dont bother the courts you think of public security and of course if you think of public security you also think of public economy thats sort of vigorous kind of justice but nevertheless is much more positive kind of justice than hire thousand cops in lawful society oh somebody has sent whole series of clippings on this by the way this had escaped my memory and theres some town in texas that had jail and they had two or three police officers and they finally cut the police force down and they noticed that the crime disappeared to some degree so they chopped the police force out entirely and havent had crime since whole series of clippings on this quite amusing but youre not in the business of justice with security check is all im trying to impress you with youre not in the business of justice you are totally and completely in the business of straightening somebody out now if you later on are in the business of justice you have to reconcile with your fact youve used an auditing confidence or something that you forced the fellow to give you and if you use this later on wearing some other hat well you just have to reconcile it somehow or another or figure out whether you should or shouldnt but it would be while wearing another hat that something like this occurred dont you see this society is rather goofy along one line it believes second dynamic withholds are far more valuable and more important you see than other types of withholds and the second dynamic is one of eight and i dont know that second dynamic withholds have any vast importance of course sex is little bit closer to creativeness and creativeness is little bit closer to reactivity than other things but id say that man who created bad machinery on the third dynamic dont you see or sold bad machinery or something like that on the third dynamiche wasthis shouldnt have anyshould have about the same weight as somebody who is doing some weird second dynamic activity whats all this emphasis well the society gets this from papa freud and freud brought this up and said the single source of human aberration was the libido theory you didnt get that joke wasnt sex it was freuds theory and theyve been playing it on their zithers and guitars ever since that was just what the victorian age needed to top itself off with and finish itself off and they bought it and thats it but you find great deal more freedom being expressed along in these lines and if you think the case is going to get better suddenly by getting off some bad second dynamic withhold be prepared to often be disappointed case gives up second dynamic withhold and doesnt get any better according to freudian theory you see once you found the childhood sexual abnormality penis envy i think was one of the greatest crimes of the whole setup you know that kind of thing terrific awful and you get this off you know and you say well gee you know that ought to really make difference with this case this case really ought to run now you know case doesnt run any better wrong target you find one fine day that the case had an unkind thought about pc in session and you get that one off you know and the case all of sudden starts to run and if you dont recognizerecognize that the value of withhold is the value assigned to it by the pc and the value of releasing itis the degree it assists auditingthe way it assists his life or something and if you recognize those principles why you wont get carted astray with all this nonsense and so forth now i suspect that in some group or another they could start vying with one another about the meatiness of the second dynamic withholds that they could get off and iabout the time i saw some of these things i would say oh hell why dont you people stop lying and start auditing you know because pooey its not that important the whole world its perpetuity as far as bodies are concerned is based on certain nowimsupposedtos all of which are selfprotective and if youre trying to hold unit together like family or something like this there should be nowimsupposedtos and they should hold together and if that is the game thats being played it should be played by the rules but as far as the total aberration of manyou got off second dynamic withhold off of somebody like he was the fellow who set up the perpetuity of bodies for any given planet and hes been sort of feeling guilty about that ever since of course hed be the source of all second dynamic withholds or upsets or aberrations from there on out wouldnt he and yet that would be social activity in the field of science its not second dynamic activity at all itd be fifth and sixth dynamic activity well it cant be very aberrative i was party to something like that once but the upshot of it is the withholds that you get off are what they are not what the pc embroiders them into and they are as good as they assist auditing to take place youre just trying to put the pc insession thats all youre trying to do with withholds and you could overvalue this as matter of fact they have here and there you get tremendous resurge when youre doing security checks you find out some mechanism or another and you release this thing and you get big case resurge and it is good thing to have happen to the case there is doubt about this but remember he wont go clear on withholds and thats all were interested in you get off ofall of his withholds off the length and breadth of the track the whole distance and you wouldnt have clear isnt that interesting youd just have somebody that audited better so look at your relative values now case will not progress unless certain proportion of the withholds are off the case and youll find any case that is holding on to withholds hard to audit and hard to clear getting off withholds does not make clear but having withholds can prevent clearing from occurring now do you follow that you see its just like building barricades across roadways and the persons trying to travel on this road well actually removing the barricade doesnt get him much further on the road it just permits him to travel on it therefore you have to know how to do these things and you have to know how to do them well and it is subjecti wont mince around with itit is subject which requires cleverness you have to be clever to be good security checker you have to be clever you cant sit there and run over and over and over like woundup phonograph and say well have you ever cooked companys books thank you have you ever cooked companys books thank you have you ever cooked companys books thank you thats not going to get anyplace you read the question have you ever falsified companys accounts and the person well looks little tense and the meter might or might not have reacted and you say well what do you know well have you ever juggled companys books you ever juggled any accounts bing all right when was that you see security question sheet can never be put together to answer up to all human beings at all times and all places just skip it you cant do it couldnt be done youve got to ask the question so that it applies to the pc now supposing you did security check in oxfordian english with polysyllabic address at all corners and then you were checking bantu right away of course your security check breaks down because all these beautiful words go over his head and thats it of course you dont get any reactions hes innocent of everything including being bantu doesnt think of himself as bantu hes zulu see so are you zulu hed fall on that but not on are you bantu you got the idea has to be adapted to the person and when you give security check you have to give security check to the person you are giving the security check to and the list of questions are never to have any omissions always ask them all the questions on this sheet and any others you think it would be good to ask them auditors are always adding well let open the gates right there let open the gates wide you can add all the questions you want to to security check as long as you ask all the questions that are on the sheet so your prolixity for additity can be given free and complete rein i dont care how many security questions you interlard into security check i just dont care and youre going down the line and you say you know i bet this fellow has an awful lot of security check questions on the subject of horses i bet you hes been stealing horses and beating horses i justcausebecause every time he blows his nose he goes hynhynhynhyn hyn good lead all right do bunch of little questions about horses next time you open up the session on form 3 why just sail into your questions about horses and get them cleaned up and go on with form 3 you get the idea you can throw questions into security check anyplace very ordinarily in handling cases why i will dream up series of security check questions thatd exactly fit that case and ask the auditor to run them and usually theres pay dirt on them that would have made the fortyniners look pale well ill give you an example well lets say cigarettes are disappearing around upstairsyou know packages of cigarettes are disappearingand i read an employment security check to staff member only im worried about cigarettes i dont say have you stolen anything i say well have you stolen any cigarettes around here get the idea in other words security check is being given against series of known circumstances so those known circumstances which are current of course are interlarded into standard security check theres one exception to this and that is formhco ww security check form 7 because that is so deadly it mustnt be added to the security checker there is taking the fellows life in his hands he can deny him job or he can suspend him from staff just from failing one question whether the question is cleared or not so you start adding bunch of questions to that thing and of course you close the gates in all directions because there isnt human being alive nor doll on some other planet or any human beings on some other planets that could pass security check from beginning to end withoutwell security form 3without about 30 percent casualty there isnt anybody alive who hasnt got about 30 percent casualty on that thingyou know flunk that and if youre just giving the security check you see dedede da da bada da da and just flunking just because they had needle reaction an instant read reaction of course youd flunk everybody everybody in the universe would become unemployable at once so dont mess up form 7 but you mightsomebody might pass form 7 and then you still arent sure well if youre still not sure why you after theyve passed the form 7 why you get somebody else to do something about it or tip off their auditor or something of this sort youre not sure but if they didnt really give an instant read on form 7 versions or b you cant do anything about it and those are read verbatim and they are read just that many checks but of course that is security check for the purpose of security and were talking about security checks for the purpose of processing and purpose of processing thats another reason youre much more cognizant with security checks from the basis of processing and thats the viewpoint from which were looking at it now if you were doing security check from the standpoint of police work of course you would know exactly what questions you were looking for because you were asking from set of known conditions and therefore the security check should be dreamed up for whatever activity youre engaged in that way youre trying to find thief or something of the sort well ask the questions necessary to find the thief theres another rationale about security checks that i should say something about and that is that rights shouldnt be invaded now of course you get that from the people with all the withholds but you should have this datum if somebody ever argues with you consistently and continually on broad public front like meeting or something like that about the security checks and invasion of privacy and so forth the answer to that is contained in in an essay i wrote in bulletin honest people have rights that has been so neglected on this planet that only the crook now has rights honest people have rights there is doubt about that and that is not part of any police curriculum rule book or mores on this planet today i was very amused i followed for some weeks newspaper stories about crimes and i found in each casei was out in arizonaand i found in each case the total interrogation was of the person who had been robbed fellow had had his car stolen theyd have him right down to the police station beinginterrogating him under the lights it started out fellow had parked his car momentarily alongside of road and couple of tough guys had come up and beaten him up and i think drove off with the car or something like that and the police came along very shortly afterwards and they shadowed this fellow whod had his car stolen they interrogated him they took him down to the police station and then thereafter shadowed him crossquestioned him had his name in all the papers until reading the stories you would have been absolutely certain that there was something very wrong with this man that he had committed the crime of being beaten up by two toughs you see how it gets bent around i wanted to see if things were going that way so i followed the press rather rigorously for while on just that one theme honest people have rights now give you consequence of that any domestic difficulties there have been at saint hill amongst domestic staff which of course are non scientology staff have been occasioned by people who had fantastic withholds this was long time ago and it worked like this they immediately got rid of good staff members you can always count on staff member who has great many withholds and who is doing criminal things getting rid of good staff members you can always count on it when you see good staff members disappearing look for the guy with the withholds because they will tell lies about them they will try to get rid of them because they cant bend them down to their level and person for instance in some large british company right at thethis instant you see who has criminal background who has lots of withholds of one character or another is terrible liability to the rest of the staff hes terrible liability to them the situation is not faint one they let these boys ram around inside of athe perfectly good employees and that sort of thing and the next thing you know the place is dogs breakfast and it isnt that management should be suspicious and mean but management that is going to protect their working people and their employed people must use security measures they must they must not employ criminals they just mustnt do it because they are victimizing the people they are supposed to be protecting well ill give you an idea i imagine theres student or two that was given fancy story around here not too long ago about how horrible saint hill was thought of from the region of east grinstead you know the people in east grinstead areboarding houses or people in east grinstead thought that saint hill was terrible and hubbard was terrible and this was an awful place and that sort of thing well this type of story had been current mostly around here and some staff members had been upset by this and if you remember the death lesson gagthat piece of nonsense well i finally turned private eye loose in east grinstead for period of about ten days to interrogate one and all to find out if there was any slightest libelous or slanderous things taking place and whether or not any of the parents of those children were still upset and see if we could get down and find out if there wasanything had developed along in this line well you know private eye who gets on hot lead actually they dont have too many clients their pockets are always wide open for the next fivepound note you know and you give private eye carte blanche and tell him to carry on and hell sure carry on as long as he can find out anything but after ten days this fellow had been totally overwhelmed and that was the maximum that he would put in on it and he quit he was overwhelmed everybody in east grinsteadhe contacted everybody he could think of trades people and boarding houses and hotels and restaurants and everything you could possibly think of and all he got was saint hill thats wonderful place they do very good work doctor hubbard i know him hes fine man oh yes oh theyre nice people yeah thats fine saint hill is lovely i can show you the report it goes on page after page after page and this poor fellow you see looking for slander and libel you see is getting overwhelmed by all of this good opinion and it finally just drove him out too much theta on the line so we find out that the rumors were coming from just one person who happened to be on staff here these rumors never came from east grinstead they just came from an insecure person thats what we have to assume from this dont we we put it to the total test that person isnt here now and there are rumors isnt that fascinating yes but what is the end product of this sort of thing well good staff members are made nervous upset they think theyre working for place that is not worthwhile they think theyre liable to be under criticism from this they get nervous they dont know quite whats going to be said about them and all of sudden they lose job something like this or factually they will be lied about to point where theyre falsely accused and do lose their jobs but inevitably you will find this kind of thing taking place in the absence of security checking honest people have rights and if i were workingknowing what i know about security checks and so forth if i were working for some large office of some kind or another which had security system of any kind whatsoever id sabotage the joint i mean id sabotage it id go to the top and find out why why there was security program just as bluntly as that and fellow would say security program what are you talking about and i would say well id say got contract with to hire and keep on the job and let do my work and i cant do work without security program cant be done well how is this oh well people come around all the time and say youve just swindled quarter of million pounds and people drifting around by the water cooler and giving you all the hot dope about all the wrong contracts that didnt get signed got thrown out the window and nobody ever types my letters and so forth and youve got some sour apples in here man you expect to associate with this scum to hell with it id tell him bluntly get them processed get security system in here youmaybe you got something running maybe it might even work out that your ulcers wouldnt be bothering you so much it isnt thatit isnt that its nice thing to have you cant work without it thats asits just as blunt as that ive proven it time and time again ive just proven it over and over and over therell be one two three characters who are just so damned aberrated that they should be inside looking out someplace and theyll just be tearing the place to pieces and they can have twenty thirty people just going in circle just bum data bum data bum data bum data alteris alteris bum data oh plooey everything is in commotion all the time well all of sudden you have to wear the wrong hats all of sudden youre wearing police hat or youre wearing the managements hat and under these circumstances youll get so uneasy about management that you feel you dont have any direction so you feel you dont trust the direction and so you dont have any orders and whether youre doing right or wrong you dont know what the hell nobody can work under those circumstances if i want to fight war i like to fight war with machine guns and mortarshonest tools not lies not lies i just dont like to fight wars with lies or fight wars with covert investigations or fight wars with other back slaps or figurefigures or intelligence services at work or something like that i like an honest war of course honest war has gotten discredited i dont know why its gotten discredited i suppose the munitions makers discredited it or something of the sort but they got in there too if two guys want to stand up and kill each other well what the hell who are you to tell them they cant well thats point but just the point of them standing up and killing each other shouldnt enturbulate the rest of the world theres all kinds of sides and general descriptions about this sort of thing that rather escape the eye on broader look theres nothing more fun to hunt than submarines theyre the biggest fish there are and they can shoot back but some guy down here is huntingfishing for some perfectly good marlin i have little bit better than fourth dynamic attitude toward these things you see and somebodys fishing for marlin and they take this perfectly good marlin and they yank him around in the sea and sink pieces of steel into his mouth and they drag him up and knock him over the head so they can mount him on wall to show how big and tough they were well he was being good marlin well what the hell what more can you ask of him hes being good marlin so they punish him thats silly you know its deeper significance than you would first glimpse well whats all this whats all this about well that seems to be all right but its apparentlyits only all right because the marlin cant shoot back i think its much more fun to hunt submarines you can get in real trouble hunting them youve put up as big stake as they have dont you see aircraft too i like ducks i have absolutely just gotten more disgust from duck hunters you know my father still tells wild tale about being in duck blind when i was about twelve and they said you have the first shot you know and i was supposed to put up this big doublebarreled shotgun with smokeless powder and projectiles made by remington under vast scientific process and couple of teal were coming in and one came in and suddenly saw in the blind i was just standing there with gun i was supposed to be holding it and this teal was very pretty teal and he turned around and he misinterprets the whole thing i merely said thats pretty teal you see and he said well he said why dont you shoot the way he tells the story why didnt you shoot and i said well hes too pretty that isnt what i said at all i just said he was pretty teal you know meaning what am i supposed to be doing shooting teal you know in the first place i dont like duck to eat and thats it they raise plenty in long island that are dedicated to dying for humanity i admit this is little bit too broad view dont you see but airplanes thats different the guys out there to kill you well if you can kill him first well fine thats game thats game of comparable odds and if youre going in for sports you notice you always have to have comparable odds and thats it he loses body you lose body you know and the government loses some property im not holding any brief for war but you notice that war has been just stamped on as being most terrible activity you see and its been notised and not asised to such point now that the little baby in his crib up in london is going to fight the next one its not going to be troops any more all right this all comes out from the basis of withholds and individuation and people get individuated and they back up further and further and further and they become more and more individuated and they become more and more and more individuated well how do they get this way they get so individuated theyre eventually not even themselves how do they get this way just withholds and overts overts and they withhold and overts and they withhold and overts and they withhold and eventually you got guy who cant be duck see he shoots ducks so he cant be duck so therefore thats the reason he should shoot ducks proves itself doesnt it selfproving proposition if you have enough overts on something you cant be it then you should shoot it silly isnt it so you get this superindividuation and the more individuation that occurs the less likely person is ever to be able to walk out of anywhere its just like hes backing up down long corridor and the corridor hasis actually not so much corridor but an endless succession of isolation rooms and its further and further and further from communication and its further and further and further from being anyplace and the way he gets there is very simple route he has overts which he then withholds that puts him in room one now while in room one he commits another overt which he then withholds he goes to room two you get the idea now while in room two he commits more overts because now its the best reason in the world he should commit overts you seebecause hes in room two and he commits another overt withholds that and moves to room three and hes just going on not necessarily apart from the human race but apart from life person to be in some kind of shape must be able to be almost anything he must be able to be almost anything and the degree that you cant be things is the degree that you have overts on them that you are withholding and that is the whole equation there isnt anything more significant about it than that now you find out that if youve wrecked enough cars that you find it damn near impossible to be car you can drive one and run it off the road and run it into the bus but you cant be car its as simple as that therefore cars seem to go to pieces around you you get this mysterious thing motorcycles which are much more touchy are noted for this in the motorcycle world rather this fact is very well known terribly well known you get certain guys and the sequence and how they got that way is overt against motorcycle then they can be the motorcycle less and then overts against the motorcycle and they can less be the motorcycle and theyre totally individuated from the motorcycle and theyve withdrawn it gets to point of where to touch motorcycle is to have an overt against the motorcycle and then youyou do that by dumping it in the nearest ditch or something of that sort all the automobile accidents that are the subject of the diffident interest of road safety committeesall automobile accidents occur just through this mechanism because you can stop person from having automobile accidents by making them run reach and withdraw from car it proves itself backwards you see you just make him run reach and withdraw reach and withdraw and reach and withdraw and reach and withdraw from various parts of car and the next thing you know he not only can drive the car but he wont have accidents with the car and the car will run its quite interesting person want to cure this sort of thing uphe might feel like he looked like silly ass doing it but he ought to just stand alongside of motorcycle and run reach and withdraw on the motorcycle and then take and drive the motorcycle and actually consciously run scs on the motorcycle while riding the motorcycle you run scs on the motorcycle its very interesting activity do it very slowly and so on and the next thing you know you get horrible feelings like you dont want to ride motorcycle anymore and you get somatics and you get all kinds of things well what youve actually done is put motorcycle back under control and the mechanism by which it goes back under control is the overts start blowing you start blowing overts well there are many ways to blow overts but the best way to blow overts is the security check because the overt only remains bad if it is withheld all right its an overt to go to war in this society socalled that we have today its an overt to go to war so therefore one must withhold going to war all kinds of nasty words jingoist warmonger oh theres whole dictionary of these things you see of anybody who thinks of going to war do you see whats happening commit an overt called war and then they withhold another one you see so therefore they commit another one so therefore they withhold that and so forth and theyre more and more individuated so therefore they can less and less control war until you get leaders that get up and bleat from over the radio and microphones to the nation i hate war and hes building up war situation year by year hes just building up worse and worse war situation hes not doing anything at all thatd avert war hes just telling people how much he hates it i remember the marines on guadalcanal had that down boy they had that down to very fine point they could give that speech from one end to the other eleanor hates war james hates war they had it all down taped see some guyall you had to do for laugh is just start giving this speech it was the standard humor the us was involved in one of the nastiest wars it had ever fought under the leadership of somebody who hated war now its quite interesting isnt it international peace and the destruction of this particular playing field is at stake against this exact mechanism you see war is so terrible it cannot be fought yeah whats that make whats the next immediate step fight it because its on automatic nobody can stop war you know you sit back and after while you dont know whether to laugh or cry you know this berlin thing berlin all right so the russians wanted to fight about berlin of course theyd want the city and so forth because somebodys free in it and they cant stand that and so theres this pawn sitting out there well it was set up by somebody who hated war so he set berlin up there so that it would create war that was the way they divided germany you see start another war inevitably and has anybody all through the years that berlin has been sitting there as crisispotential crisis has he ever gotten counterpawn all youd have to do is say well budapest actually or vienna or something like that start agitating for the russians to give up vienna you see orafter the hungarian thing and so forth just start treaty talks at once with them how far they withdrew beyond the hungarian border not how much hungary they could have you see but just reverse you see how much of russia are you going to give up beyond hungary now that is the point well its counterplay dont you see and the russian says berlin and you say well were not too interested in berlin how about this hungarian border this hungarian border you see theres an old treaty the treaty of budapest that was made by the early huns which were your people you get the idea and everybodys just all built up on this idea and the russians start worrying and they say well better talk about berlin you know dangerous thing to talk about what the hell will these people think up next just counterplays has anybody bothered to pick up pawn so we must decide then that they are heading for war theyre not playing the game so the game is going to occur and it wont be game interesting viewpoint but thats individuation from subject which then longer becomes controlled and that is true in all life that is true in all life when person totally individuates he can longer control anything good garbageman sure has to be able to be garbage let tell you man but the idea of being able to be garbage immediately wipes out any possibility of his ever becoming garbage isnt that interesting now way to make little kids have accidents is just keep telling them they mustnt have accidents simple simple mechanism just say dont touch this dont touch that dont touch something else what would happen to pc if you stood around saying all right now were going to run little process on you now stand in the middle of the room good enough now dont touch that wall and dont touch the ceiling and dont touch the floor whats going to happen well yet parents run this on little kids all the time and they fall down bark their shins and that sort of thing whats very interesting is our kids around here dont get much of this run on them and well they havent to date had very many accidents they dont have the usual childhood accidents and so forth but i see people worrying about them every once in while little arthur or something will be walking along high wall you see with disaster on both sides of him and ive seen somebody go ughhh you know like that why suggest it to him he doesnt think hes going to fall off he wont he doesnt either so theres the basis of individuation the basis of individuation if youre going to make beer youve got to be able to be beer you know all right youve got overts on beer and withholds on the subject of beer why you of course arent going to make any good beer now another mechanism takes placeto give you broad view of this although this sounds very chatty security checks are very vital thing to understand in their full panoplyand that is that after you have gotten to the end of the corridor room one room two room three room four room fivewhat do you know you cant stay out of the place you left it is impossible having backed up to the end of the corridor you now find yourself at the entrance to the corridor but unable to leave in other words you snap terminals and obsessively become the thing of which you have overts against and that is what is valence closure and as result the individual gets stuck in various things obsessed with various things you know now you take one of these dear old ladies thats protecting cats brother man ive seen them around and after theyve talked to about well you got to realize the reality of cat in the first place to have much to do with cats youve got to know cats and cats are package of certain imseries of iamsupposedtos and these are neither bad nor good theyre just the imsupposedtos of cat and cats have whale of time playing with halfdead mice and halfdead birds and they kill certain things theyre supposed to and they have certain habits which are not necessarily very endearing habits at all and on the other hand they have certain admirable qualities and so on and this is cat and it isnt poor dear little pussy well how does cats imsupposedtos suddenly become this poor abused little thing which must be superprotected from life how does it get that way well the person who did this must have been hanging cats shooting cats beating cats and then not telling anybody about cats and then as child in some life you see he strangled cats as pastime and then kept saying that it was done by the boy next door dont you see had to be withholds on this thing every time and we just keep going like this and after while why poor dear little pussy you know and you look at this lady whos telling you that you notice the way shes wearing her hair and you look her over she wont buy fur coat made of anything but cat fur but it mustnt be of cat fur you see so therefore its even synthetic cat fur but its very coninvolved but what she has done is back up the whole corridor dont you see and then found herself in nothing but cat see sheyou can only get only so far and then it snaps back that is the mechanism which actually takes place and that is very general mechanism of life the police officer who is an honest cop and resists criminals and then gets withholdsthe withhold is an absolute necessity to individuation and he gets overts on criminals and then withholds and then goes little bit wrong and withholds that and life after life why this thing goes and next thing you know youve got criminal police officer and in the next life or two youll find him being thoroughgoing criminal see heoverts on criminals and he becomes criminal thats the mechanism you look at some fellow who is criminal trace it back to time he was police officer and you wont always be wrong you wont always be right but you wont always be wrong either but its cop who went crooked by starting to withhold hes been withholding and of course thats one of the best things police forces do ive been very hard on cops in this particular lecture and i could be accused then of having something against cops but i dont have what ipeople usually have against cops i am just running supposedtobe bit of an oughttobe on cop i think in society that has any order to it this kind of situation should exist that the people who are being what they are being should be what they are being you know thats an awfully innocently crude look at things you know if the fellows the mayor of the town he ought to be the mayor of the town and he ought to be mayor of town see you shouldnt have police who are criminals you see all kinds of weird mishmashes i believe in the simplicity and purity of it all all im saying is im against pretence but anyway where you have pc who is loaded with withholds on security check you have pc who is very individuated got the idea so therefore you have somebody who cant be and youre trying to find valences and of course you cant find valences easily on somebody who cant be but you can pick out and find the fixed valence the person is in because its been this mechanism which has led up to his becoming that valence so you could find persons terminal without completing his security check but you will find that where persons individuationforced on him or actual and so on to such great degree that hes loaded with withholdsyoull find hes very hard to get into session he arc breaks he gets very upset in sessions and so forth well he cant be preclear well now there are two routes by which he could approach this point of beingness you find it in that hes critical of the auditor this means he has withholds it alsothat also means then that he is having beingness trouble and he cant be this thing called preclear and you have your first rudiments process on that which i choicei believe you have by now which is the shakespearian approach to be or not to be that is the question whats he willing to be and what hed rather not be now youll find out that will walk forward but if you run much of that two things will occur one of them beneficial and one of them harmful the first of them is that itll soften him up on security check youll find out all of sudden hell be able to do security check better if you run that process see because beingness and withholds these things are counteropposed and one tends to solve the other see all right and the notsobeneficial part of it is is of course it walks him into his valence chain without the valence chain being identified you dont know that this fellow is being beermaker you dont know that hesthat is his terminal but because youve run an awful lot of this process you have walked him into the engrams on that chain and that process walks people into engrams so dont make any mistake about it and be alert that isnt any reason why you shouldnt use it but you can get to point of running where the person is not ready to run an engram hes not ready to run the engram you havent got his terminal you havent done any prehav runs its not sorted out at all yet theres your pc sitting in an engram well at the moment call it one of the risks of the business because man youre going to turn on some fancy somatics if you dont watch it thing to remember is the somatic that the pc has is where he is on the track and it is only at that place on the track and wont release from any other place so you can walk him away from that place on the track which keys it out or you can walk him into that place on the track and as is it and these are the two things the only two things that processes do with regard to somatics they either walk him away from it by getting in closer to pt and in other channels or they walk him into it where he as ised it and of course of the two theres choice the second one is easily the best solution now withholds will very often soften up and knock out present time somatics by walking the person away from the area and maybe thats good thing see the person could be tightly into an engramin life you see the engram is just keyed in hundred percent and there he is in life in an engram so that means he has very harsh somatics hes got arthritis hes got what you commonly call psychosomatic illness of some kind or another well hes right in an engram all right well you can walk him out of that engram by moving him off so that you can then when youve found his terminal move him back into the engram you got the idea you might say the fellows so close to it he cant see it well you couldnt see it either and the possibilities of getting him thereof course you find his goal and find his terminal and then run him for while on the prehav scale youll find him landed in that section of the track thats for sure but he might be so tightly in that section of the track that he couldnt even put his attention on the auditing session see that would be an interesting state wouldnt it i mean youd find pc then whos unauditable well let tell you the best approach to this until others are found the best approach to this is simply security check now you can even run security check on the basis of the chronic somatic that is making the person unauditable persons got so much eye trouble that you cant possiblywell you just see all he does is talk about these eyes and its just chronic present time problem he talks about eyes and he talks about eyes andhis eyes and you run into it and you try to run session and you run into eyes and so on well thats boring because the truth of the matter is youve got to have his goal and youve got to have his terminal and youve got to run him on the prehav scale and then the engram will eventually turn up where his eyes are loused up see its one two three thats the way the thing stacks and there he is sitting with bad eyes with present time problem and its present time problem so his case is not going to make any progress and you cant find anything because hes got present time problem you see the knotty mess that this makes see you cant get it because hes got it and very excellent way of getting at this and making him auditable is to security check him and you give him security checks and then he walks off from all this because youve knocked out this obsessive individuation see and he can walk off from the track then to where his eyes are being butchered and hell tell you dont be taken in by this hell say oh my eyes are cured theyre well i mean ive never been so well before in my life everything is fine and so forth well take it with grain of salt pat yourself on the back for having temporarily relieved it dont bother to tell him that hes not going to experience permanent this and that maybe it never will get that good or that bad again nobodywho knows but for sure when you get his goal and you get his terminal and you run him on the prehav scale and youre running him on the track why one fine day youre going to do an assessment of the engrams hes run into and there he is with those redhot pokers in both eyes and the somatics come off right there in that exact incident and that is the end of it you see so up to that time youve done an assist an alleviation which means youve walked him away from the valence in which he was obsessively stuck but dont kid yourself that you cured him because you havent and that would be the history of all chronic somatics weve run into in dianetics and scientology they key out they key in they key out they key in and we sweat ourselves to death keying them out and then after while they key in and then sometimes were lucky and we key them out and they stay out marvelous now somebodys going to get ahold of that person one fine day is going to find his goal and his terminal and even before he has chance to do prehav run or anything else bang all the somatics around again in thud disheartening huh well the thing to do if that kind of thing happens security check knock out the individuation and youll knock out the chronic stuck in the engram why because hes backed up to the end of the corridor until he is at the front of the corridor you see well if you can at least get him to the back of the corridor and uphalfway up the corridor again toward it again see you can do it with security check and he can be audited halfway back up the corridor again you got the idea of course hes always got the chronic somatic on the chain of the valence which will be his terminal thats why you must always have it correct thats why you must always have correct goal and correct terminal because theres only one valence chain in which hes stuck and that is the way the cookie crumbles so the use of security check is what it is and dont be bemused into thinking security check is more so by rendering tremendous numbers of security checks of course you put the person into better communication of course you put the person into feeling better about life yes he isnt going to get that bad again hes going to feel good about lot of other things and that sort of thing but basically youve made him auditable because after youve gone all the way around give him the security check straightened him all out you find his goal you find his terminal run it on the prehav scale assess the engrams that he has run into where he was in valence you run one of those engrams and bang you run right back into the chronic somatic he was running from only now its on full and will run out so you get the circuitous routes here by which you can take to alleviate chronic somatics or banish chronic somatics and you sometimes have to alleviate chronic somatics in order to get the case into auditing condition so that you can banish chronic somatic now does that make more sense we have all these years of experience behind us about all the various routes and im talking to you now about route and throwing it into your lap and saying well you better be good at these things now i could have told you great deal about how to do security check but there have been lectures on that sort of thing youve got textbooks on it youve got bulletins on it what im trying to tell you today is simply why you should do security check what security check will produce what to expect of security check and more or less its general use in auditing i dont think you could do the type of auditing youre doing smoothly now without security checks i think itd be impossible so the security check is very very valuable but dont overrate it and dont underrate it and dont for heavens sakes go riding hobbyhorse that if everybody in gods green earth confessed it would be paradise i think itd be mess the end product of withholds is good communication the end product of withholds is not clear its just good communication so you use security check to set somebody up for auditing persons difficult to audit think of security checks thats one of your best ways out trying to resolve all the present time problems and all the rudiments of the pc and all of that sort of thing and going on over this is absolutely necessary youve got to do this but theres one positive tool that does do this we have tested some other tools and theyre nowhere near as positive as security checks so that is its value security check well done keeps rudiments in security check badly done and rudiments will be consistently out the security check can be tailored to represent the area of the persons present time problem so as to key it out so that you can get him back down and actually get at the source of what his difficulty is those are its uses and i hope you will find what ive told you of some value thank you
