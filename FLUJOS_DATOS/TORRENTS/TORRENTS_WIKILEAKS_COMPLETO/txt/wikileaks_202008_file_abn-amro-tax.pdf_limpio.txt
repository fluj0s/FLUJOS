engagement to provide certain tax advisory services to abn amro the terms of business which are attached to this letter and constitute an integral part of this engagement letter provide further details of our respective responsibilities in the event of any inconsistency the terms of this engagement letter will prevail 1 introduction 1abn amro is responsible for the collection of wht and tob abn amro bank belgian branch abn amro has tax collection and reporting obligations with respect to number of the services it provides this applies in particular to the services described hereafter nsociété civile ayant emprunt é forme dune soci été cooperative à responsabilit é limitée burgerlijke vennootschap die rechtsvorm van een co öperatieve vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid

for various belgian and foreign debtors of interest and dividend payments in this capacity abn amro must act as withholding agent this means that it is responsible for collecting remitting and reporting belgian withholding taxes on such payments when due abn amro must also generally act as withholding agent with respect to securities for which it acts as custodian in such capacity abn amro also offers relief services for belgian and certain foreign withholding taxes whereby it generally relies on the help of subcustodian established in the relevant local market with respect to the foreign withholding tax relief procedures the aforementioned services may also trigger obligations under the belgian legislation implementing the eu savings directive and under certain foreign withholding tax regimes such as the us qualified intermediary regime abn amro may from time to time also act as broker for the account of clients in this capacity it will have certain obligations for the collection of stock exchange transaction taxes tob 2tax parametrisation of backoffice systems to be able to deal with large volumes of transactions and to reduce the risks for human errors banks generally automate the tax collection and relief procedures as much as possible this is often done through the incorporation of tax matrices in the back offices systems that will pick up any relevant corporate actions or transactions and automatically determine the applicable tax treatment the tax matrices are combinations of certain parameters including the security type the nature of the taxable event the tax rate and the client type these tax matrices are interfaced through it applications with databases that contain information on the clients tax status tax rates and details of the securities clients tax status is based on series of attributes that may vary according to the type of tax these attributes generally include the tax residence and may also include the status as financial institution the status as intermediary as opposed to beneficial owner the presence of required tax certificate etc the tax matrices are thus set up to determine which information is needed to apply given tax treatment the interfaces with the databases are intended to check which of the various tax matrices that are used in connection with each type of business activity is applicable in respect of each relevant taxable event and to apply the appropriate tax treatment 3risks attached to faulty tax parametrisation 2 whilst the automation of tax collection and relief procedures generally increases the efficiency thereof and mitigates the risk of human errors it also carries certain risks the main risk is that the tax matrices are not accurate because of faulty design or lack of updating the likelihood of this risk materializing is potentially very high given not only the complexity of the underlying rules but also the frequent legislative changes which require continuous updating of the relevant procedures in this regard it is unclear whether the setup of the procedures implemented by abn amro have been verified in the past by an independent specialized tax expert and whether they have been thoroughly tested because of the automated and systemic nature of the procedures any inaccuracy may cause significant compliance issues these issues may create not only financial risks for the bank but may also harm its reputation it is key therefore that the bank is able to provide full assurance that its tax collection and relief procedures function in an accurate manner we understand that abn amro wishes to test the accuracy and completeness of the tax matrices currently used for withholding tax and tob purposes as well as the proper functioning of the underlying systems through health check abn amro also wishes to test the fulfillment of the compliance obligations that apply in connection with the taxes due in respect of the services described above we will describe hereafter in more detail our understanding of the scope of the health check and our proposed approach for handling the health check 2 scope of the health check aintroduction as stated above you have asked us to review the application of withholding taxes and tob by abn amro in connection with securities held on behalf of its customers we have hereafter outlined the scope of the activities that we would perform we have added thereto list of activities that are not included in the scope of the current fee proposal to avoid any misunderstanding on this point bproposed activities we propose to perform the following control activities as part of the health check i fact finding iicreation of tax matrices iiigap analysis 3 ivtesting vverification of compliance obligations vi issuance of report and wrapup ifact finding during this preparatory phase of the project we will gather information necessary for our understanding of the current infrastructure and procedures applied by abn amro in connection with its handling of the tax collection obligations triggered by the transactions and payments referred to above we propose to prepare documentation request and to conduct interviews with key staff members designated by yourselves the information request may ask for things such as description of the tax collection and relief procedures the documented tax procedures if any description of information flows descriptions andor manuals of the relevant it systems to allow us to understand the information stored in and produced by such systems description of selected business activities account opening procedures everything that is asked for in this phase of the project is asked with an eye towards efficiency it is indeed of key importance that we have good understanding of the way abn amro operates in connection with the activities under review and that we capture all relevant taxable events further factfinding requests may be made during subsequent phases of the project if this would prove useful for our understanding of the abn amro environment we consider the analysis of the informationdocuments provided to be part of this activity iic onfirmation of methodology and approach we have outlined our standard approach for the subsequent phases of the health check hereafter we will however reassess the efficiency of this approach in the light of our findings from the first phase of the project this means that we will discuss alternative approaches with you should it appear that the proposed standard approach is not likely to yield the desired result in the light of the operational context of abn amro iiicreation of tax matrices 4 this phase involves the design of tax matrices for each type of tax we propose to extend the project to cover belgian withholding tax and tob but we will be glad to extend the scope further to include for example the residence levy under the eu savings directive the socalled reynders tax on investment funds having invested more than 40 of their assets in debt andor the us qualified intermediary regime this proposal is however limited to belgian withholding taxes and tob separate tax matrices would be created for each relevant security type the tax matrices will detail the various corporate events to be distinguished the tax rates and the conditions at client level that must be met to benefit from reduced rate of tax if any ivgap analysis this activity involves gap analysis to identify any gaps between the tax matrices created by ernst young and those created previously by abn amro we would indeed check whether the tax matrices developed by abn amro considered jointly with the various applications yield the correct result ie the appropriate amount of tax levy this will involve checking whether the information stored by abn amro on customers securities and transactions in its databases suffices to apply the correct tax treatment special regard will have to be had at tax certifications received from customers more specifically the gap analysis will involve the following activities 1determination of relevant categories of securities this activity involves the matching of the ernst young list of all relevant categories of securities the list will be derived from the tax matrices with the securities categories currently distinguished by abn amro this means that each security type available in abn amros securities database would be recategorized into the various categories on our list this exercise should enable us to determine whether abn amros backoffice systems contain the required securities categories for belgian tax purposes and whether such categories are sufficiently well described it should also detect any redundant categories 2determination of all relevant corporate actions for each category of securities 5 this activity involves the matching for each relevant category of securities of all relevant corporate actions derived from the ernst young tax matrices with the corporate actions currently distinguished by abn amro this activity should enable us to determine whether abn amros backoffice system contains all required corporate actions that need to be distinguished for belgian tax purposes and whether such corporate actions are sufficiently well described it should also detect any redundant corporate action types 3determination of all relevant investor types for each category of securities this activity involves comparison between the various investor categories that are required to be distinguished for belgian withholding tax purposes per securities category and the client categories currently distinguished by abn amro this activity should enable us to verify whether the abn amro client categories are sufficientl exhaustive and accurate 4verification of applicable tax rate the fourth activity serves to verify whether the tax rates as used in connection with the tax matrices of abn amro match with the tax matrices created by ernst young when setting the rates in the tax matrices that we will create we will distinguish between the applicable default statutory rates and any available reduced rates or exemptions when applicable and we will specify whether the availability of reduced rate is subject to the provision of tax certificate for our matching of the tax matrices with the abn amro data we will be relying on abn amro to provide us with the relevant data for example for us verifying whether the taxable events are all adequately captured by abn amro we will rely on list of corporate events that abn amro will provide to us v testing 6 for this phase of the project we will draw up at least 501 sample test cases covering various permutations in terms of security types taxable events and client types these test cases would then be input into abn amros systems with view to verifying whether the results that should follow from the tax matrices and applications used in connection therewith are effectively being produced viverification of compliance obligations during this phase of the project we will verify whether abn amro complies with the following obligations maintenance of registre spéciale for foreign source income paid to customers and for certain coupon transactions preparation of withholding tax and tob returns and timely filing of such returns timely payments of withholding taxes we will do so by verifying the processes and procedures applied by abn amro to collect the information required to be reported in the tax return in particular we will verify whether the processes are sufficiently complete so as to pick up all relevant information whether such information is interpreted correctly and whether the information is input correctly into the tax return we will also test the computation of the taxes due and the timely payment of the taxes for 5 withholding tax returns viiissuance of report and wrapup once we have completed the activities described above we will issue report outlining the activities performed and the findings of such activities we will also identify areas where improvement of abn amros back office tax parametrisation is necessary in addition we will highlight areas where compliance does not meet tax authorities requirements the report will contain our recommendations to make the necessary improvements to systems and procedures this activity also includes meeting with you during which we will comment on the report agree on possible followup actions and respond to any questions you may have on the report c excluded activitiestransactions 1 the number of test cases will ultimately be determined on the basis of information gathered during the previous phases of the project in consultation with abn amro 7 the following activitiestransactions are not part of the current fee proposal but may be added thereto at your request any taxes other than belgian withholding taxes and
