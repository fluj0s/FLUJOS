be further updates to this report teacher quality and quantity proposals in the 105th congress summary the 105th congress considered broad array of proposals responding generally to two issues of teacher quality and quantity some of the legislative interest was prompted by the expiration of the funding authority for the higher education act hea title v of that legislation authorized large number of programs focused on precollege teaching only one of these authorities was funded for fy1998 the higher education amendments of 1998 pl 105244 repeal the title v programs and add new ones to improve preservice teacher training and teacher recruitment in other major action regarding teachers the fy1999 omnibus appropriations legislation pl 105277 includes 12 billion for the hiring of teachers to reduce class size policymakers are concerned about the quality and quantity of elementary and secondary school teachers efforts to raise curriculum standards and student performance standards are increasing the knowledge and skills that teachers are expected to have concurrently projections of enrollment growth and increased attrition from teaching due to retirements are generating concerns about substantial increase in future demand for teachers the current and anticipated need for more teachers and for more highly qualified teachers may be exacerbated by efforts to reduce class size the process of preparing recruiting licensing compensating testing and structuring the working conditions of the elementary and secondary teaching force is primarily the responsibility of states and localities nevertheless the federal government provides wide array of support for teachers many of the proposals that were before the 105th congress could be placed in one of two groups depending upon their focus 1 proposals that sought primarily to improve the quality of teachers through such steps as reform of teacher education and strengthening of recruitment incentives or 2 proposals that principally addressed the issue of teacher quantity by supporting the hiring of new teachers among the issues raised by proposals in the first group was the effectiveness of their approaches to reforming teacher education issues involving the second group of proposals included the consequences for student achievement and teacher quality of substantial

1998 pl 105244 add new programs to the higher education act hea to support improvements in the training of prospective teachers and in the recruitment of qualified individuals to teaching the omnibus appropriations legislation for fy1999 hr 4328 which was signed into law on october 21 1998 pl 105277 includes 12 billion for the hiring of new teachers in order to reduce class size in other major action the congress approved hr 2646 bill to amend the new education individual retirement accounts to which was added support for state teacher tests and merit pay programs for teachers the president vetoed that bill on july 21 1998 all of these enacted provisions and legislative proposals are described below in the section on selected proposals before the 105th congress introduction policymakers at all levels are increasingly concerned about the quality and quantity of elementary and secondary school teachers ongoing efforts to raise curriculum standards and student performance standards are increasing the subject matter knowledge and pedagogical skills that teachers are expected to have concurrently projections of student enrollment growth and increased attrition from the teaching force due to retirements are generating concerns about substantial increase in future demand for teachers in addition the current and anticipated need for more teachers and for more highly qualified teachers may be exacerbated as policymakers undertake or propose initiatives to reduce class size proposals to address teacher quality or quantity may concentrate on number of broad aspects of teaching such as the following preservice teacher education preparation of prospective teachers inservice training professional development for current teachers teacher recruitment induction the process for introducing new teachers to teaching licensure licensure and certification are used interchangeably in this report to refer to the process of granting the license to teach teacher testing and general working conditions including compensation tenure as well as the organization and management of schools and classrooms the 105th congress considered broad array of proposals responding generally to the two issues of teacher quality and quantity this report analyzes two groups of proposals crs2 proposals that sought primarily to improve the quality of teachers through such steps as reform of teacher education and strengthening of recruitment incentives and proposals that principally addressed the issue of teacher quantity by supporting the hiring of new teachers1 some of the legislative interest in the 105th congress was prompted by the expiration of the funding authority for the hea title v of the hea under prior law authorized large number of programs focused on precollege teaching see discussion below this entire array of programs was repealed and new programs enacted in its stead this report provides analysis of the teacher quality and quantity issues brief overview of the current federal role supporting elementary and secondary school teachers and review of the proposals considered by the 105th congress in each of the groups listed above this report describes legislative action on these proposals during the 105th congress the quality and quantity issues the elementary and secondary education teaching force is large in 1995 there were an estimated 26 million public school teachers and 380000 private school teachers2 teacher quality teacher quality may be defined by and measured by the level of education teacher has completed the teachers tested ability level or the teaching credentials he or she has earned among other characteristics3 in particular concern about the quality of current teachers has centered in part on the extent to which teachers are currently teaching outoffield that is providing instruction in subjects in which they have relatively little preparation and academic background one analysis which considered the extent to which secondary school students were being taught an academic subject by teachers who had neither college major or college minor in that subject found for example that over quarter of all public secondary school students enrolled in math classes and that over half of public school students in 1 this report does not cover proposals for the education and training of individuals providing educational services outside of the k12 level such as individuals being trained in early childhood education or entering the early child care profession 2 us department of education national center

quality policy issues models and data bases national research council washington 1992 p 33 see also the problem of improving teacher quality while balancing supply and demand by mary m kennedy included in this volume crs3 physical science classes had such teachers4 another analysis found that in 199394 21 of high school teachers teaching academic subjects had neither major or minor in their main teaching subjects in specific subject areas this percentage of teachers was for example 28 for mathematics and 18 for science5 it should be noted that this measure of quality outoffield teaching is partly reflection of teacher assignment practices there is growing recognition that the success of nearly any effort to improve the academic performance of us students depends critically upon their teachers mastery of subject matter knowledge and their ability to teach it6 as result teachers capabilities in the classroom and their impact on student performance are increasingly considered integral components of teacher quality further concern about teacher quality takes on more urgency as states and local school districts raise curriculum content and student performance standards in different subject areas this changes expectations about what teachers need to know and be able to do in the classroom factors that have been identified by different analysts and policymakers as contributing to the quality problem include the following the abilities of individuals entering teaching7 poor preservice education limited ineffective professional development compensation systems that do not reward good performance organization of schools that militates against effective teaching teacher assignment 4 us department of education national center for education statistics outoffield teaching and educational equality nces 96040 by richard m ingersoll washington 1996 this study was based on the us department of educations 199091 schools and staffing survey 5 national

national commission on teaching americas future what matters most teaching for americas future new york 1996 hereafter cited as national commission what matters most 7 for example some analyses have found that the college entrance examination scores of individuals who enter teaching are somewhat lower than those of individuals who do not prepare to teach see for example us department of education national center for education statistics out of the lecture hall and into the classroom 19921993 college graduates and elementarysecondary school teaching nces 96899 washington 1996 p 2022 crs4 practices and state tenure laws that are viewed by many as unduly protecting poorly performing teachers8 teacher quantity concurrently there are warnings of potential shortage of teachers during the next decade precipitated by large projected increases in student enrollment and an anticipated surge in retirements from an aging teaching force overall public school enrollment is expected to rise by over 4 between 1997 and 2007 an increase fueled primarily by projected growth at the secondary school level of about 139 further the average age of public school teachers has grown sharply and more teachers will be eligible to retire in 19931994 the average age was 43 nearly 3 full years higher than it was in 1987198810 based on data such as these for public and private elementary and secondary education some projections have been made that during the next decade 2 million teachers will have to be hired to keep up with enrollment growth and higher teacher attrition rates11 crosscutting concerns teacher quality and quantity are inextricably linked actions to address one have consequences for the other of particular concern are possible negative interactions for instance tightening licensure requirements in order to improve teacher quality may make it difficult for districts to find enough teachers who meet the higher standards when school districts struggle to meet their need for teachers they may circumvent quality standards by such steps as hiring teachers under emergency certification procedures this interaction is particularly evident in efforts to reduce class size 8

reduce class size are increasingly popular many states and localities are considering or implementing their own reductions in class size and as described below the administration included class size reduction program in its fy1999 budget request13 and the omnibus appropriation for fy1999 includes funding for such action these efforts have been prompted partly by belief that reduced class size will improve student performance this specific issue is addressed in latter section of these report the impact on the demand for teachers resulting from large scale reductions in class size may be substantial and may have direct consequences for teacher quality the experience to date with the class size reduction initiative in california is informative in this regard as perhaps the most prominent effort to reduce class size currently underway the california class size reduction program created as result of 19961997 budget legislation provides local school districts with funds to help them reduce class size in the early elementary grades to not more than 20 students from an average that was over 28 in all grades the initial years funding for the program was 771 million in operational funding which paid for teacher compensation furniture instructional materials and supplies and 200 million for facilities funding for the second year consists of 15 billion for operational expenditures facilities funding can be drawn from each participating districts operational funds that remain after operational expenses are met participating 12 class size is measure of the number of students in class often average class sizes are calculated separately for teachers with selfcontained classes typically elementary school teachers who teach an array of subject to single class and for those in departmentalized classes typically secondary school teachers who teach subject to several classes of students for the latter the average size of all of the classes taught by each individual teacher may be determined and then an average taken of those class size averages across all departmentalized teachers generally special emphasis teachers such as those teaching the disabled or those teaching specific subjects at the elementary school level such as music or art are excluded from the calculation of class size since the number of students they work with at any one time is often unusually small eg special education teachers or unusually large eg physical education teachers class size is distinct from pupilteacher ratios those ratios are most frequently calculated by dividing the number of enrolled students by the number of fulltime equivalent teachers fulltime teachers plus an estimate of the fulltime equivalent of parttime teachers regardless of the kinds of classes taught or whether teachers duties are noninstructional partly as result of including the full breadth of the teaching force the pupilteacher ratio is almost always lower than the average class size for example the size of the class taught by the average public school teacher in 19931994 was 232 at the elementary school level and 237 at the secondary school level the pupilteacher ratio for the fall of 1993 was 189 and 151 at the public elementary and secondary levels respectively 13 reportedly class size reduction initiatives are being implemented or are under consideration in 20 or more states viadero debra small classes popular but still unproven education week february 18 1998 hereafter cited as viadero small classes crs6 school districts are to certify that they have provided their teachers with staff training on topics related to effective instruction in smaller classes14 in the initial year of the program some 18400 teachers were hired 115 more than the number that would have been needed to compensate for normal teacher attrition and enrollment growth15 according to several analyses of the initial year teacher quality may have suffered in the drive to satisfy the greater demand for new teachers approximately onefourth of the individuals hired did not have teaching credential as one analysis concluded desperation hiring has brought in new teachers who are less experienced less qualified and less skilled on average than those of previous years the teachers on emergency permits have bachelors degrees and passed the minimum competency test but most have teaching experience or preparation16 it remains to be seen what impact these characteristics will actually have on the quality of classroom practice and student performance current federal role supporting precollege teachers the process of preparing recruiting licensing compensating testing and structuring the working conditions of the elementary and secondary teaching force is primarily the responsibility of states and localities nevertheless the federal government provides wide array of support for teachers prior to the 105th congress the federal aid that was specifically targeted on elementary and secondary school teachers focused on inservice training with some additional funding for preservice training and recruitment further under several federal programs local school districts were able to use federal funds to hire teachers and instructional specialists the 105th congress has shifted this balance regarding the focus of federal efforts it enacted new programs in the hea primarily addressing teacher preparation and recruitment and appropriated 12 billion for hiring new teachers these new initiatives are described below in the section on selected proposals before the 105th congress overall although federal aid for precollege teachers comes from multiple federal agencies the us department of education ed is the primary source next to the class size reduction initiative in the fy1999 appropriation legislation the largest of the programs administered by ed is the eisenhower professional development program title ii of the elementary and secondary education act esea the eisenhower state grant program 335 million for fy1999 allocates 14 for descriptions of the california program see for example illig david c early implementation of the class

teachers the hea title iv student aid programs provide assistance to prospective teachers also borrowers under the federal perkins loans hea title iv are eligible for loan forgiveness for performing certain kinds of service including teaching at high poverty schools new teacher loan forgiveness was added to the hea by the higher education amendments of 1998 see description in section below prior to its 1998 reauthorization the hea authorized in its title v wide array of programs addressing elementary and secondary school teacher training nevertheless only 1 of its 17 separate funding authorities was funded in fy1998 the minority teacher recruitment program 22 million17 as already noted the new hea programs replace the previous programs in title v other teacher programs in ed are the personnel preparation program 821 million for fy1999 and state improvement program 352 million for fy1999 of the individuals with disabilities education act idea these programs support preservice and inservice training respectively for teachers working with disabled students also the bilingual education acts professional development program 50 million for fy1999 funds preservice and inservice activities for teachers working with limited english proficient students federal funds also support the national board for professional teaching standards 185 million for fy1998 the level for fy1999 is not yet available which is creating an assessment process to certify on voluntary basis teachers across the country who meet high standards ed programs that are not primarily targeted on teachers may fund significant amounts of inservice training the exact level of this spending is not known these include the title i program of the esea aggregate appropriation of 77 billion in grants to leas for fy1999 which supports compensatory education for disadvantaged students and the innovative education program strategies state grant program esea title vi 375 million for fy1999 which can be used for wide array of education reformrelated activities other ed programs may also provide federal support for the hiring of teachers and instructors although not usually general classroom teachers among them are the esea title i program and the esea magnet schools program assisting local school districts establishing special schools and programs to desegregate student enrollment voluntarily other relevant programs are the responsibility of many different federal agencies such as the departments of agriculture defense and energy doe as well as the national science foundation nsf the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the national endowment for the humanities many of these programs are focused on providing professional development opportunities for 17 crs report 97449 title v of the higher education act educator recruitment retention and development by james b stedman crs8 current teachers for example the nsf administers the teacher enhancement program conducted collaboratively with doe national laboratories this program supports training opportunities including summer workshops and support activities during the school year for elementary and secondary mathematics and science teachers nsf is also funding statewide systemic initiatives urban systemic initiatives and rural systemic initiatives under these programs participants work to strengthen and reform science mathematics and technology education by providing standardsbased instruction aligned with the curriculum professional development for teachers and assessments other examples of relevant programs include educational workshops at nasa field centers these workshops provide elementary and secondary school teachers with the opportunity of interacting directly with nasa scientists in research and development projects selected proposals before the 105th congress in this section selected proposals in the 105th congress addressing the quality and quantity of elementary and secondary school teachers are reviewed two major groups of proposals are considered below proposals with primary focus on improving teacher quality through reform of teacher education and enhancement of teacher recruitment many of the proposals in this group sought to amend the hea and proposals principally addressing the teacher quantity issue by supporting the hiring of new teachers the quality of teachers hired was also concern of these proposals these groupings are intended to bring together relatively similar kinds of proposals with similar focuses nevertheless the distinctions between proposals in one group and those in the other are not always clear cut for example proposals to support alternative routes for highly qualified individuals to teacher certification are considered below in the section on efforts to increase teacher quality although such efforts are likely to also increase the number of teachers available for the classroom for each group brief summaries of individual proposals are provided and key issues related to the proposals are analyzed proposals on which there was legislative action are described at the beginning of each of the sections below beginning with those enacted into law18 18 resolutions expressing the sense of the house or senate regarding teacher preparation recruitment and hiring are not covered below eg the following amendments added to sconres 86 senate fy19992003 budget resolution amendment 2225 dewine concerning enactment of legislation focusing on teacher training and alternative certification and amendment 2229 feinstein concerning federal support for state and local education goals including teacher recruitment and certification crs9 improving teacher quality this section provides brief overviews of selected legislative proposals introduced in the 105th congress to address broadly the improvement of the quality of the elementary and secondary teaching force the major activities supported by these proposals generally involved reform of teacher education programs and financial incentives to attract highly able individuals to teaching inservice training was addressed by some of these bills as well many of the proposals considered below would have amended hea title v or some other title in the hea proposals that addressed preservice or inservice education of teachers by targeting particular subject area or skill are not considered here among such proposals are the following s 839 bingaman and hr 2065 morella to fund preservice and inservice training in information technology and hr 2614 goodling s 1596 coverdell and hr 2646 senatepassed version to improve reading instruction partly through professional development activities19 enacted provisions and selected proposals the following descriptions necessarily omit many important details they identify the specific funding level if given for the initial year of each program when substantially similar or identical bills were introduced in both the house and senate they are described together in the order in which they were introduced proposals on which there was legislative action are described first and in greater detail there was action on most of these proposals pl 105244 higher education amendments of 1998 the higher education amendments of 1998 as signed into law authorize several new programs to reform teacher preparation in higher education institutions and increase teacher recruitment efforts these amendments also newly authorized loan forgiveness for individuals teaching in high poverty schools these various provisions are described below title ii of hea as newly amended authorizes teacher quality enhancement grants for states and partnerships there are two main components to this title an array of three grant programs to improve teacher preparation programs at higher education institutions and to recruit highly able individuals to teaching and set of broadbased teacher education accountability requirements the three grant programs include state grants partnership grants and teacher recruitment grants the statute authorizes 300 million for fy1999 and such sums as necessary for the 4 succeeding fiscal years the annual appropriation is divided among the three programs as follows 45 for state grants 45 for partnership grants and 10 for recruitment grants the fy1999 omnibus appropriations legislation includes 75 million for this authority state grants these are onetime 3year competitive grants awarded to the state governor unless state constitution or law designates another person entity or agency 19 see crs report 97972 reading instruction new federal initiatives by wayne riddle crs10 as responsible for teacher certification and preparation participating states must provide matching amount in cash or kind from nonfederal sources equal to 50 of the amount of the federal grant examples of the activities for which state grant funds must be used include holding teacher preparation programs accountable for the academic and teaching qualifications of the teachers they prepare reforming teacher certification and supporting the recruitment of teachers partnership grants these are onetime 5year grants awarded competitively to partnerships that must include partner institution20 school of arts and sciences at higher education institution and high need local educational agency21 partnerships must match from nonfederal sources 25 of the partnership grant in the first year 35 in the second and 50 in each succeeding year examples of the activities for which these grants must be used are holding teacher preparation programs accountable for the academic and teaching quality of the teachers they prepare providing preservice clinical experience to teacher candidates and providing professional development opportunities partnerships may also support such activities as teacher recruitment and leadership training to principals and superintendents teacher recruitment grants these are onetime 3year grants awarded competitively to states or to the partnerships eligible for partnership grants states and partnerships have the same matching requirements for these grants as they have under their separate grant programs see descriptions above recruitment grant funds must be used for either of the following teacher education scholarships as well as support services to help recipients complete college and stay in teaching each year of scholarship assistance requires year of teaching in high need leas or activities enabling high need leas and schools to recruit highly qualified teachers other grant program requirements among other requirements the new hea title ii requires that any lea or school that benefits from activities under the title must upon request provide parents of students with information about the subject matter qualifications of students classroom teachers further each state receiving state grant must report annually on progress toward certain specified objectives such as raising the academic standards required for entering teaching increasing the pass rate on initial certification assessments increasing the percentage of secondary school classes in core subjects taught by 20 partner institution is public or private higher education institution with teacher training program that 1 has either an 80 or higher pass rate by its graduates on state qualifying assessments for new teachers or is ranked among the highest performing programs in the state or 2 requires its students to participate in intensive clinical experience meet high academic standards and either complete an academic major in the subject in which the student intends to teach if preparing to teach at the secondary level or in the arts and sciences if preparing to teach at the elementary level or otherwise demonstrate competence 21 high need lea is one that is serving an elementary or secondary school in an area with high percentage of individuals from families in poverty high percentage of outoffield secondary school teachers or high teacher turnover rate crs11 teachers with academic majors in those or related fields or who are able to demonstrate competence through subject tests or classroom performance in core subjects increasing the percentage of elementary school classes taught by teachers who have academic majors in the arts and sciences or who can demonstrate competence through high levels of performance in core subjects and increasing the number of teachers able to apply technology to the classroom each partnership that receives partnership grant must include an evaluation plan in its application that plan must include objectives and measures that are similar to those on which states must report with the inclusion of an objective to increase teacher retention in the first 3 years of teaching failure to demonstrate progress by the end of the second year of state grants and recruitment grants and the third year of partnership grants can lead to termination of the grant general accountability provisions for teacher preparation certain accountability provisions included in the teacher quality enhancement grant program are likely to affect nearly all teacher education programs in the country not just the programs receiving funding under this program beginning within 2 years of enactment of the legislation each state receiving funds under the hea is required to prepare an annual report card on the quality of its teacher preparation programs including such information as the pass rate on each of the assessments used for teacher certification disaggregated and ranked by teacher preparation program and the extent that certification requirements are waived particularly in high and low poverty districts and in different subject areas beginning within 18 months of enactment any higher education institution with teacher preparation program that enrolls students aided under the hea must release an annual report that includes such information as the latest annual pass rate of graduates on certification assessments and whether the program has been designated as lowperforming see below by the state as condition of continued receipt of hea funds and within 2 years of enactment state must have established procedure for identifying lowperforming teacher preparation programs and for providing them with technical assistance any higher education institution with teacher preparation program that has lost state approval or financial support because of its designation by the state as low performing programs is ineligible for any professional development funding from ed and cannot accept or enroll in its teacher preparation program any student receiving assistance under hea title iv loan cancellation for teachers as amended by pl 105244 the hea newly provides for cancellation of subsidized and unsubsidized federal family education loans and direct loans for individuals who teach on fulltime basis in eligible low income public or private nonprofit elementary or secondary schools for 5 years secondary school teachers must teach in subject that is relevant to their academic major elementary school teachers must demonstrate that they have knowledge and skills in reading writing math and other areas of the elementary curriculum maximum of 5000 can be canceled for each borrower after the fifth year of teaching only loans made to new borrowers on or after october 1 1998 can be canceled crs12 hr 2646 as passed by the congress as passed by the

eisenhower program exceeds 600 million or every state has an eligible teacher testing and merit pay program further the legislation provides that notwithstanding any other provision of law all federal education funds not defined can be used by states to implement teacher test or establish merit pay program23 hr 1435 clay24 among other provisions this bill amends hea title iv to provide borrowers

amend the hea to include loan forgiveness program for teachers was defeated 24 although this proposal does not have focus on teacher quality it is included here because its loan forgiveness provisions are largely duplicated in other bills which do crs13 to improve such areas as teacher recruitment and induction activities occurring in the initial years of teaching to introduce the new teacher to the career both bills amend the esea to condition receipt of esea funds on public schools informing parents of the qualifications of their childrens teachers and ensuring that teachers meet certain

issues raised by these proposals the primary focus of many of these proposals was preservice teacher education somewhat lesser attention was paid to teacher recruitment and inservice training reform of preservice education was being widely sought because of strong criticism of its overall quality for example the national commission on teaching and americas future concluded that in comparison to education in other professions and to teacher education in other countries teacher education in the united states has historically been thin uneven and poorly financed27 as result one of the most critical aspects of these proposals is how they intended to generate reform of teacher education nearly all of these proposals funded partnerships that link ihes with other entities principally leas in some instances the partnerships included individual schools as well as businesses the partnership requirement appears to be part of an effort to ensure that the faculty and the content of teacher education programs are closely tied to the needs of teachers in the classroom as result partnerships might influence the content and delivery of teacher education nevertheless partnerships by themselves might have only marginal impact on teacher education programs which are subject to myriad other influences such as the policies of their own higher education institutions state level policies and their faculties abilities and willingness to undertake change some of the proposals under consideration would have taken other steps to generate reform several would have required participating ihes to have teacher preparation programs that are accredited by nationally recognized accrediting agency or that can demonstrate certain outcomes among the purposes of such requirement is to bring all teacher education programs eligible for federal funding up to set of standards applied nationally the national commission on teaching and americas future made accreditation by the national council for accreditation of teacher education ncate part of its recommendations for teacher education programs noting that ncates quality standards are demanding but not beyond the reach of any school of education genuinely committed to preparing excellent teachers for the classrooms of new century28 ncate the only teacher 27 national commission what matters most p 14 28 national

for national accreditation was controversial generating resistance particularly from the teacher education programs schools and departments not currently accredited at present institutionwide accreditation is an eligibility requirement for participation in hea programs accreditation of specific programs is not among the concerns raised about such requirement were its costs and its potentially adverse consequences for teacher education programs at small liberal arts colleges and selective universities31 debate in this area was not something new32 proposals to hold schools of education or their host institutions accountable for the performance of education graduates on certification assessments was also controversial as described above the new teacher provisions in the hea address this kind of accountability among the issues raised by this approach include how to measure and compare each institutions performance given that certification assessments and the standards for determining passage of those assessments can vary significantly from state to state further the question of what consequences were to be applied to institutions not meeting the requirement was debated as well deliberation over other features of these proposals addressing other issues also occurred for example primarily in an effort to attract highly able individuals to teaching loan forgiveness for teaching was to be expanded under some of the proposals and was included in the reauthorized hea see above scholarships with teaching service payback requirement were proposed and included in the recruitment component of the new teacher quality enhancement grants available research suggests that initiatives such as these particularly loan forgiveness are 29 new organization to accredit teacher

teacher training group trounces ncate mandate education week february 22 1995 crs17 likely primarily to reward individuals who would have taught anyway33 nevertheless the research evidence is limited and relatively dated based on this research it appears that certain features of loan forgiveness and service payback scholarships are keys to their effectiveness these features include the amount of assistance provided and the buy out terms that is the conditions under which the beneficiary can avoid providing service with regard to loan forgiveness it is possible that loan debt among college students has increased sufficiently in recent years that the prospect of loan forgiveness will induce individuals to consider teaching who otherwise would not and keep them in teaching at least as long as necessary to forgive their debt further in an effort to make these provisions more attractive the portion of borrowers debt forgiven for each year of teaching might be set relatively high thereby requiring fewer years of teaching to cancel the debt in addition there may also be other steps that could be taken to increase the effectiveness of loan forgiveness for example information might be widely and systematically disseminated early in students college years concerning the availability and conditions of the forgiveness the more targeted nature of service payback scholarships may increase their effectiveness the primary purpose of such programs is teacher recruitment in contrast to loan programs to which loan forgiveness for teaching is added scholarship recipients will be aware from the inception of their involvement that teaching service is required the effectiveness of such payback programs might be strengthened if substantial amount of scholarship aid is provided annually at the same time the number of years of service required will directly affect the programs attractiveness relatively long service requirement may create disincentive for participation increasing the number of teachers the 105th congress had before it number of proposals for broad efforts to support local school districts hiring of new teachers these responded to concerns about enrollment growth and projected increases in attrition from the teaching force at the same time some also reflected widespread belief that reducing class size has positive effect on student performance and that in contrast to other uses of federal resources funds devoted to class size reduction are more likely to have direct effect on students in the classroom these proposals also sought to address the compensation of teachers as well as teacher testing in an effort to improve teacher quality enacted provisions and selected proposals the following descriptions necessarily omit many important details they identify the specific funding level if given for the initial year of each program when substantially similar or identical bills were introduced in both the house and senate they are described together in the 33 us library of congress congressional research service the experience with loan forgiveness and service payback in federal and state student aid programs report by jim

on which there has been legislative action are described first and in greater detail pl 105277 omnibus fy1999 appropriations this legislation includes 12 billion for fy1999 primarily intended for the hiring of new teachers to reduce class sizes in the early grades from the appropriation 6 million is reserved for the bureau of indian affairs and the outlying areas the remainder is distributed among the states based on either state shares of esea title i part funding based primarily on numbers of children 517 years old living in poverty and levels of state per pupil expenditure or state shares of esea title ii funding based on school aged population and the distribution of title i part funding whichever share would provide the state with larger amount all of the state allocation must be distributed to leas 80 on the basis of the distribution of children 517 living in poverty and 20 on the basis of enrollments of students 517 enrolled in public and private nonprofit elementary and secondary schools award can be made to an lea if the size of the allocation is less than the starting salary for new teacher in that district such an lea can form consortium with at least one other lea and receive funds for reducing class size funds can be used for 1 recruiting hiring and training certified teachers including special education teachers and teachers of children with special needs teachers certified through state and local alternative routes are included among eligible teachers 2 testing the academic content knowledge of new teachers and meeting state certification requirements consistent with hea title ii see above and 3 providing professional development consistent with hea title ii but only 15 of the districts allocation can be used for activities listed under 2 and 3 above the legislation appears to suggest that class size reduction efforts must be focused on grades 13 unless class size in those grades has been reduced to 18 or fewer children34 at that juncture the local district is authorized to make further reductions in class size in those grade levels reduce class size in kindergarten or other grades or provide professional development and other activities improving teacher quality these funds must supplement not supplant state and local funds that would otherwise have been spent for these activities further funds may be used to increase teacher salaries each state receiving funds must report on activities supported each school benefitting from these funds or an lea serving such school must report annually on student achievement that results from hiring new highly qualified teachers 34 this is clearly not congressional intent as expressed in letter november 20 1998 to us secretary of education riley from senator james jeffords chair of the senate labor and human resources committee and representative william goodling chair of the house education and the workforce committee they state we would also like to clarify that despite arguably conflicting language in the new law it was and is clearly our intent that local educational agencies have the flexibility to hire teachers in grades other than 13 in order to reduce class size this issue was strongly debated during the negotiations and the final legislation does not require school districts to hire teachers only in the early grades emphasis in original crs19 ed has announced that these funds will enable schools districts to hire over 30000 new teachers for school year 19992000 states can first receive these funds beginning july 1 199935 the original class size reduction proposal from the clinton administration is described immediately below clinton class size reduction proposal and related bills s 1708 daschle s 2209 murray hr 3876 clay hr 4169 forbes in his fy1999 budget proposal president clinton called for funding of class size reduction initiative to reduce the average class size in grades 1 through 3 from 22 students to 18 students36 the overall purpose appeared to be improved student performance particularly in reading under this initiative federal funds would be awarded to states on the basis of the allocation of esea title i funds formula based primarily on counts of children in poverty within states high poverty districts would receive the same share of these class size reduction funds as they do of title i funds and the remaining funds would be distributed on the basis of districts class size districts would be required to match the federal funds on scale ranging from 10 to 50 depending upon the poverty of the district for the initial year of this proposal the president would provide 11 billion in funds to be generated from future settlement against tobacco companies when fully implemented in 2005 this initiative is projected to have cost total of 12 billion 73 billion over the first 5 years and have supported the hiring of 100000 new teachers in addition to using these funds to pay salaries of new teachers up to 10 of the funds could be used to train teachers in successful methods of teaching reading and in ways of instructing smaller classes to provide mentors to new teachers to provide incentives for teachers who teach in high poverty schools and to raise standards by initiating more rigorous testing programs for new teachers and raising the requirements for licensure any participating state would be required to implement basic skills tests for new teachers the selection of these tests rests with the states further states and local school districts would have to ensure that teachers hired under this initiative were fully certified or progressing satisfactorily toward certification finally districts would be held accountable for achieving improvement in reading performance in each school within 3 years of receiving these funds if they failed to do so they would be required to take corrective action subsequent failure to improve reading achievement could result in loss of funding districts would also 35 us department of education vice president gore announces 12 billion to begin hiring 100000 teachers in local school districts october 22 1998

elementary and secondary school teachers38 based on its findings this legislation appears to support such hiring in order to address the growing demand for teachers due to enrollment growth and to improve student performance by reducing class sizes the annual authorization is 500 million for fy1999 rising in 500 million increments to 25 billion by fy200339 the us secretary of education would be authorized to award grants on the basis of school age population to state governors who would in turn provide funds to local school districts on the basis of their need to address overcrowded classes districts could use these funds to hire elementary and secondary school teachers or qualified instructional personnel as authorized under state law teachers hired with these funds would be obligated to teach for at least 1 year federal funds provided under this program would have to supplement not supplant nonfederal funds that in the absence of these federal funds would be used for the education of students participating in programs assisted under this act40 to receive continued funding participating districts would have to demonstrate an increased number of teachers in the classroom they would also have to review annually the performance of individuals hired with these funds up to 10 of the funds awarded to each governor could be used for program encouraging innovative teacher

notwithstanding any other provision of law states may use federal education funds not defined to assess the performance of every elementary or secondary school teacher to establish merit pay program or to hire elementary or secondary school teachers who are certified to teach selected issues raised by these proposals although number of issues were debated concerning these proposals the analysis here focuses on three the evidence that reducing class size will raise students academic achievement the costs of hiring new teachers and the impact on teacher quality effects on student achievement of class size reduction the research literature on class size reductions has been punctuated by caustic battles among analysts contending over the impact of reducing classes on academic achievement42 substantially different interpretations of the research literature continue to be used in policy debates over class size reduction nevertheless the generally positive findings from tennessees project star studentteacher achievement ratio longitudinal study of the effects of class size reduction in grades k through 3 have 41 although this language does not preclude teachers hired with funds provided under this legislation from securing tenure under state law it has been characterized as prohibition of the granting of tenure to teachers hired with these funds peterson molly representative paxon proposes hiring 100000 teachers cutting federal bureaucracy legislate news service january 8 1998 online httplegiweblegislatecomnnews980108htm 42 the debate has been carried on in numerous works see for example glass gene v et school class size research and policy 1982 and educational research service class size summary of research 1978 glass et concluded the relationship of class size to pupil achievement is remarkably strong large reductions in school class size promise learning benefits of magnitude commonly believed not within the power of educators to achieve p 50 educational research service concluded there is general consensus that the research findings on the effects of class size on pupil achievement across all grade levels are contradictory and inconclusive p 68 crs22 helped lead many analysts and policymakers to the following conclusions concerning class size reduction43 enrollment in the early grades in classes of 15 or fewer students may have positive impact on students academic achievement compared to enrollment in substantially larger classes minority students in particular may benefit from smaller classes and the benefits students experience from reduction in class size may persist into later grades albeit at somewhat reduced levels in keeping with these findings the funding including in pl 105277 and other proposals are targeted to the early grades but the degree of reduction in average class size likely to be achieved may be less than the literature suggests may be necessary for substantive achievement gains44 costs of teacher hiring nevertheless even assuming that national efforts to reduce class size do lead to some degree of improvement in student achievement it must be asked whether the gains achieved are worth the cost of the effort that the costs of hiring new teachers can be high is suggested by the aggregate levels of funding in the presidents proposal 12 billion over 7year period and in hr 3157 75 billion over 5year period that would be used to hire 100000 teachers number equal to 34 of the current teaching force the funds required to hire new teacher are only portion of the total costs that are and will be associated with that new teacher particularly if that teacher is only one of many being hired these costs include the expenses involved in creating sufficient number of new classrooms to house the new teachers providing staff training to new teachers and compensating teachers at higher levels as they gain 43 see for example mosteller frederick the tennessee study of class size in the early school grades the future of children summerfall 1995 word elizabeth r et the state of tennessees studentteacher achievement ratio star project technical report 19851990 1990 under project star teachers and

has been quoted as characterizing the amount of achievement gain to be realized by the size of the class size reduction under the presidents proposal as very small associated press teachers parents equate smaller with better classes as printed in the washington times february 9 1998 crs23 experience and move up the pay scale the decision by school districts to use federal funds to hire more teachers is step with longterm financial consequences45 increasingly analyses of class size reduction have focused on the benefits relative to the costs of such initiatives many of them conclude that there are equally or more effective reform strategies that cost substantially less money in the short term and in particular over the longterm46 slavin for example identifies oneon one tutoring by certified teachers for atrisk first and second graders peer tutoring and cooperative learning as among intervention strategies that can raise performance by larger amounts at fraction of the cost effects on teacher quality the potential impact on teacher quality of major nationwide hiring of teachers is also significant concern to address this issue for example the funds provided by pl 105277 can be used to hire only certified teachers the experience in california suggests that finding enough teachers who meet regular certification standards can be difficult task at the same time some would argue that certification as currently awarded offers substantial assurance of teacher quality permitting the hiring of teachers recruited to teaching through alternative routes would open the potential pool of teachers but in the view of some analysts such provisions could threaten teacher quality as well47 the proposals described above would also seek to address the quality issue in some other ways annual performance review of the teachers testing of new teachers and performance assessments of current teachers with regard to testing current state efforts to test teachers as condition of the granting of certification also may not constitute much of gauge of teacher quality as asserted by the national commission on teaching and americas future the testing required for certification are little more than multiplechoice tests of basic skills and general knowledge widely criticized by educators and experts as woefully inadequate to measure teaching skills furthermore in many states the cutoff scores are so low there is effective standard for entry48 45 hoff david j clintons 100000teacher plan faces hurdles education week february 4 1998 46 see for example slavin robert class

asserts that although well designed nontraditional routes to teaching can be effective there is concern that some alternative routes provide inadequate levels of preparation and training for teacher candidates with potentially adverse consequences for student performance national commission what matters most p 53 48 national commission what matters most p 28 crs24 concluding observations the 105th congress considered large number of proposals to address the quality of elementary and secondary school teachers and their overall quantity it enacted new programs to reform teacher preparation and increase available funding for recruiting and hiring new teachers fashioning federal response to these issues raised numerous questions concerning the appropriateness of such response given the traditional responsibility at the state and local levels for teacher preparation training and hiring further as was discussed earlier some activities particularly the hiring of significant number of new teachers have substantial federal costs associated with them at the same time the effectiveness of these efforts to address either of these issues are weighed against their costs perhaps most significant is the interplay between quality and quantity as has been observed in this report action to address one issue may have consequences for the other and some of those consequences may be negative for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98166
