by an inspect or general who is appointed and removable in one of two ways 1 presidential appointment subject to the advice and consent of the nate and presidential removal in specified federal establishments including all cabinet depar tments and larger federal agencies and 2 agency head appointment and removal in designated federal entities the usually smaller boards foundations co mmissions and corporations the dual focus of oig activities since their inception has been auditing and investigation indeed the 1978 act requires each ig in federal establishment to appoint two assistant inspectors general one for auditing and one for investigations more recently the offices have added in spection shorthand phrase for usually shortterm evaluation of agency pr ograms and operations and their impact purposes powers and protections the statutory offices of inspector gene ral have been give n broad mandate along with an impressive array of powers and protections to carry it out independently and impartially purposes of offices of inspector general section 2 of the codified law specifies three broad purposes or missions of the oigs to conduct and supervise udits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of the establishment to provide leadership and coordination and recommend policies for activities designed to promote economy fficiency and effectiveness in the administration of such programs and operations and b prevent and detect fraud and abuse in such pr ograms and operations and to provide means for keeping the head of the establishment and congress fully and currently informed about probl ems and deficiencies relating to the administration of such programs and ope rations as well as the necessity for and progress of corrective action appointment removal and general supervision of igs igs in federal establishments section 3 of the codified law covers the appointment removal and ge neral supervision of insp ectors

who then must communicate the reasons for removal to both houses of congress there are explicit restrictions on the presidents authority removal ma be with or without cause each inspector general must report to and be under the general supervision of the establishment head or to the extent this authority is delegated to the officer next in rank below the head and shall not report to or be subject to supervision by any other officer the restriction on supervis ion is reinforced by another provision neither the head of the establishment nor any other officer shall prevent or prohibit the inspector general from initiating carrying out or completing any audit or investigation or from issuing any subpoena exceptions to this prohibition are few they are spelled out for only certain departments and for only specified reasons sections 8 8d and 8e of the ig act as amended authorize the heads of the depar tments of defense treasury and justice respectively to prohibit an ig audit i nvestigation or issuan ce of subpoena which requires access to information concerning ongoing criminal investigations sensitive operational plans intelligence matters c ounterintelligence matters and other matters the disclosure of which would constitute serious threat to national security under separate statutory authority the director of central intelligence dci has similar power over the inspector general in the ce ntral intelligence agency cia should the agency head use this power to limit the igs exercise of authority the reasons must be communicated to the ig and then by the inspector general to specified committees of congress section 3 also provides for two assistant inspectors general within each ig office in the specified federal establishments ie an assistant inspector general for audits and an assistant inspect or general for investigations igs in designated federal entities section 8g covers the same matters for offices of inspectors general in designated federal entities category of organization added by the 1988 amendments these entities include the consumer product safety commission federal communications commission federal labor

nvestigation or issuance of subpoena duties of igs the broad mandates highlighted in sec tion 2 are spelled out in greater detail in section 4 of the codified law each inspector general is required to perform specific duties to achieve the goals of promoting economy and efficiency and of detecting and preventing waste fraud and abuse these duties illustrate the igs unique role within the agency and the broa d grant of authority delegated by congress the igs are specifically directed to provide policy direction for conduct supervise and coordinate audits and investigations relating to the establishments programs and operations review existing and proposed legislati on and regulations re lating to programs and operations and make recommendations in the semiannual reports concerning the impact of the laws or regulations on the economy and efficiency in the establishments programs and operations and on the prevention and detecti on of fraud and abuse recommend policies for conduct superv ise or coordina other relevant activities of the establishment recommend policies for conduc t supervise or coordi nate relationships with other federal agencies with state and local governmental agencies and with nongovernmental entities with respect to promoting economy and efficiency and preventing and detecting fraud and buse in establishment programs and with respect to identifying and prosecuting participants in fraud or abuse and report expeditiously to the attorney general whenever the inspector general has reasonable grounds to believe that th ere has been violation of federal criminal law ig reporting to and informing the agency head and congress under section 5 inspectors general have two basic ty pes of reporting requirements to the agency head and to c ongress these are 1 semiannual reports and 2 sevenday letter reports dealing with particularly serious or flagrant problems reporting obligation that was supplemen ted in 1998 by legislation regarding allegations from whistleblowers in the intelligence community these reporting obligations complement the section 4 requirement to keep the agency head and congress fully and currently informedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98141crs5 semiannual reports igs are directed to make semiannual reports that summarize the oigs activities for the previous six months itemizing waste fraud and abuse problems and identifying proposals for corrective action the 1988 amendments refined and enhanced severa l of the semiannual re ports ingredients for example the reports must contain cer tain entries some of which include description of significant problems abuses and deficiencies relating to programs and operations description of recommenda tions for corrective action an identification of each significant recommendation contained in the previous reports on which corrective action has not been completed and statistical information relating to cost s management of funds and related matters these ig reports go directly to the agency head who must transmit them unaltered to appropriate congressional committees within 30 days after another 60 days such reports are to be made available to the public the agency head is authorized to append comments and specific data and information to the ig reports this additional information includes statistical tables showing audit reports and dollar value of recommendations of disallowed costs and projected savings of recommendations for funds which could be put to better use sevenday letter reports the inspector general act as amended also requires the ig to report immediately to the agency head whenever the ig becomes aware of particularly serious or flagrant problems abuses or deficiencies relating to the administration of programs and ope rations such communications must be transmittedunaltered but allowing for co mments the head deems appropriateto the appropriate congressional committees within seven days intelligence community whistleblower reporting parallel provision affecting inspectors general in the inte lligence community became law in 1998 the intelligence community whistleblower pr otection act pl 105272 specifically authorizes intelligence community employees and contractors to submit an urgent concernthat is serious or flagrant pr oblem abuse violation of law or executive order or other specified wrongdoingbase d on classified information to congress this is to be accomplished by first notifying the inspector general in the relevant agencythe central intelligence agency department of defense department of justice or other organizations that conduct foreign intelligence or counterintelligencewho must determine within 14 days whether the allegation appears credible if so the ig notifies the agency head who transmits the complaint along with any comments the head deem s appropriate to th house and senate select committees on intelligence within seven days if the ig does not transmit the complaint or does not do so in an accurate form then the whistleblower may contact the intelligence committees directly following specified guidelines these include notification to the agency head th rough the inspector general of the intent to contact the committees and statement of the allegationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98141crs6 2 this section does not permit the ig to use the subpoena power to obtain documents and information from other federal agencies 5 usc app 3 6other channels of communication the enactment provides for additional channels for igs to communicate with the agency head and congress section 4 requires the ig to keep the head of such establishment and congress fully and currently informed by means of the reports required by section 5 and otherwise concerning fraud and other serious problems abuses and deficiencies relating to the administration of programs and operations administered or financed by such establishment to recommend corrective action concerning such problems abuses nd deficiencies and to report on the progress made in implementing such corrective action the concept of keeping the head and c ongress informed otherwise separate from the required reports allows for va riety of mechanisms for the inspector general or the office to communicate with congress these means extend to testifying at congressional hearings meeting with lawmakers and staff and providing information and reports directly to members of congress its committees and subcommittees and other offices authority of igs to carry out the purposes of the act c ongress has granted the inspectors general broad authority specific powers section 6 of the codified legislation authorizes the igs among other things to conduct audits and i nvestigations and make reports relating to the administration of prog rams and operations to have access to all records reports audits reviews documents papers recommendations or other ma terial which relate to programs and operations with respect to which the ig has responsibilities under the act to request assistance from other federal state and local government agencies to issue subpoenas for the production of all

necessary to carry out the act the scope of an igs investigative authority is seen further in the range of matters the inspector general may investigate stemming from an employee complaint or disclosure of information under sec tion 7 of the act the inspector general is authorized to receive and investigate complaints or information from an employee concerning the possible existence of an activity constituting violation of law rules or regulations misma nagement gross waste of f unds and abuse of authority or substantial and specific danger to the pub lic health and safety in such instances the ig shall not disclose the identity of the employee without the employees consent unless the ig determines that such disclosu re is unavoidable durin g the course of the investigation the act supplementin g other whistlebl ower statutes3 also prohibits reprisals against employees who properly ma ke complaints or disclose information to the ig prohibition on program operating responsibilities notwithstanding the broad powers granted by the ig act as amended inspectors ge neral are prohibited from taking corrective action or instituting changes themselves indeed section 9 of the act expressly forbids the transfer of program operating respons ibilities to an ig this prohibition is designed to ensure the integrity of an igs audit or investigation if an ig were to carry out programs or institute changes he or she would not be able to audit or investigate them objectively or impartially in the future law enforcement powers despite the broad range of investigative authority under the ig act as amended law enforcement powers have not been granted across theboard in public law instead the oigs that have such authorityto carry firearms make arrests without warrants and obtain and execute search warrantshave acquired them in one of four basic ways through transfers of pre existing offices which held relevant powers when the oig was created specific statutory grants to particular office eg in the agriculture and defense departments dele gation of relevant authority and jurisdiction by the agency head and special deputation by th department of justice in the past igs have received ad hoc temporary special deputation from the justice department when law enforcement powers were needed independently that is without relying upon other agencies to make arrests carry firearms or execute search warrants criticism arose from the ig community however over the costs associated with such deputation delays in processing oig applications for it and its limited duration and extent as result an alternative policy has since been devisedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98141crs8 4 sections 1102 and 1103 of pl 105206 enacted on july 22 1998 us congress

jurisdiction over the establishment or entity in which they are located the few exceptionsin the departments of justice and the treasur yexclude from or circumscribe the department igs jurisdiction over certain law enforcement agencies one of those bureaus excluded from its parent agency ig has been the treasury departments internal revenue service irs which has been criticized for abusive and arbitrary conduct maladmin istration and an absence of accountability oversight and controls as result treasury in spector general for ta x administration along with other new organizations including an irs oversight board has been established to cover the inte rnal revenue service alone4 the new ig for tax administration who is presidential ppointee subject to nate confirmation operates independently of the treasury department oig this is the only case among all statutory offices in which an ig has jurisdiction for part of an establishment or entity that has its own office of inspector general as corollary the treasury department office of inspec tor general is the only statutory office whose jurisdiction has been subdivided to accommodate separate statutory oig within the same establishment or entity coordination among and investigations of igs inspectors general along with other re levant agencies are members of one of two coordinating mechanisms which have been established by executive order and operate under the auspices of the office of management and budget omb in addition allegations of wrongdoing against igs themselves or other high ranking officers can be investigated by special integrity committee consisting of members of these two councils coordination two councilsthe president s council on integrity and efficiency pcie for the presidentially appointed igs and the executive council on integrity and efficiency ecie for agencyhead ppointeesprovide coordinating mechanism for the inspectors general along with representatives fro m other appropriate organizations the other members include the deputy director for management ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98141crs9 the office of management and budget who chairs both councils the associate deputy director for investigations of the fe deral bureau of investigation fbi the controller of the office of federal financia l management the director of the office of government ethics the sp ecial counsel of th office of special counsel and the deputy director of the office of personnel management besides these individuals the vice chairperson of the pcie sits on the ecie and the vice chairperson of the ecie on the pcie the presidents council on integrity and efficiency the older of the two councils was established in 1981 by president reagan through executive order 12301 both councils are now governed by executive order 12805 issued by president bush in 1992 among their f unctions the councils shall continually identify review and discuss areas of weakness and vulnerability in federal programs and operations to fraud waste and abuse and shall deve lop plans for coordinated governmentwide activities th at address these problem s and promote economy and efficiency in federal programs and operations administrative investigations allegations of wrongdoing by inspectors general or other highranking officers in an ig office may be investigated by special integrity committee following process authorized by executive order 12993 issued by president clinton in 1996 such committee established by the chairperson of the pcie and ecie ie the deputy director for management from omb is to consist of at least the following pcie and ecie members the fbi representative who chairs the committee the special counsel of the office of special counsel the director of the office of government ethics and three or more igs representing both the pcie and the ecie in addition the chief of the public integr ity section of the criminal division of the department of justice serves as an advisor to the integrity committee with respect to its responsibilitie s and functions once it receives allegations of wrongdoi ng the integrity comittee reviews them and where appropriate refers them to one of two investig ative entities either to an agency with jurisdiction over the matter or to an investigative team composed of selected investigators supervised and controlled by the integrity committees chairperson current issues affecting inspectors general the issues affecting the statutory igs can be grouped under six broad categories institutional arrangements and procedures changes in authority of the igs effectiveness and orienta tion of the igs as well as the pcie and ecie reporting to the agency head and congress personnel practices and incentive awardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98141crs10 each of these issues is connected to the need for additional information and study or to options for change these have arisen because of perceived problems or weaknesses in the existing offices resources capabilities operations or authority possible need for statutory oigs in government organizations or entities which do not have them currently initiatives from the inspectors general directly to enhance their powers or recent studies of their operations and recommendations for change coming from members and committees of congress or from outside sources underlying some of the issues and opti ons for change are differences among the igs based in part upon the different need s and characteristics of the establishments where they serve as well as the characteristic s experience and orientation of the ig possible tension between the audit and i nvestigation functions of the offices differences in the igs focus between pr evention and detection concerns about ig independence from the establishment officers versus ig impact by working closely with the same officials and disputes between certain igs and the department of justice over their authority and jurisdiction the following provides suggestions for each of the five broad issues based on the public record since the igs were established the congressional research service takes position in support of or in opposition to these suggestions institutional and pro cedural arrangements changing the removal provision for igs by requiring that any such action by the president or agency head be for cause such as neglect of duty malfeasance or serious disability setting term of office eg 6 8 or 10 years for the igs to encourage longer service and greater stability in single post than is now common establishing an inspector general in the executive office of the president with jurisdiction for instance over statutorily created entities therein establishing by statute offices of in spectors general in congressional branch support agencies particularly the gene ral accounting office and the library of congress modeled perhaps after the oig in the government printing office or in designated federal entities where the ig is appointed by the agency head bringing the oig in the government printing office into closer conformity with the ig act provisions affecting oigs in designated federal entities adding ig positions in other entities which might now meet the criteria used in the 1988 amendments for the designat ed federal entities but did not then setting up panel of pcie members to make recommendations to the entity heads or screen possible candidates for the igs in the smaller designated federal entitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98141crs11 placing certain oigs in designated federal entities under statutory inspector general in related major establishment this might be considered because of the oigs small size limited resources or problems with independence capabilities and effectivene ss several precedents for dual assignment or shared jurisdiction exist there s been only one dual inspector general assignment however ie the ig in the state department also served as the ig in the arms control and disarmament agency which has since been transferred to the state department presently the state department ig also has jurisdiction over the broadcas ting board of governors and the international broadcasting bureau while the ig in the agency for international development covers the overseas private investment corporation having one person be the inspector ge neral for all or number of smaller designated federal entities for instance one individual could be the inspector general in perhaps 10 or 11 small entities thus the socalled miniigs would have combined total of three igs contrasted with the more than 30 presently because of this combinati on the newly created posts could become presidential nominations subject to sena confirmation rather than remaining as agency head appointments this might also be way of overcoming the limitations of small size few re sources and limite d capabilities by comparison to other statutory igs examining the offices with presidentia lly appointed igs established by the 1988 ig act amendments and since the n this review would look at the newest of the presidentially appointed ig positions with view to assessing their performance and reviewing any c oncerns about their independence and their offices capabilities reviewing the statutory limitations on the treasury department igs jurisdiction and authority over the law enforcement organizations in the department ie bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms customs service internal revenue service irs and secret service this could examine whether there is need to modify the current relationship with the existing treasury department ig or possibly to create separate ig for one or all of these organizations if merited because of concerns about their accountability performance and conduct in 1998 such an effort led to establishing new treasury inspector general for tax admin istration to cover the irs pl 105 206 establishing separate office of insp ector general for the federal bureau of investigation fbi and drug enforcement administration dea in the department of justice or alternatively augmenting the authority and jurisdiction of the justice department inspector general over them these options might be considered because of the size and importance of dea and fbi sensitivity of their operations criticisms of past performance and their relative independence from the justice partment office of inspector general by comparison to other bureaus and or ganizations within the department httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98141crs12 examining and clarifying in statute th role and responsibilities of the justice department ig with regard to the office of professional responsib ility opr an administratively created office along with other internal investigative or audit units in the department currently for instance there is dispute within the justice department about the scope of the igs jurisdiction visavis oprs regarding investigation of offi cers or employees in attorney positions clarifying or changing the relationshi p of the igs in the individual armed services with the department of fense dod ig this might include placing the military igs directly and exp licitly under the control of the civilian dod inspector general expanding or clarifying the jurisdiction and authority of the ig in the central intelligence agency with respect to other intelligence agencies for instance those in the departments of defense and justice one option would be to extend the cia igs jurisdiction to mirror the jurisdiction of the director of central of intelligence resulting in an inspector general for the entire intelligence community examining the relationship of the ig with the chief financial officer cfo in each establishment where both posts exist creating the post of assistant inspector general for inspections to supplement the existing ones for auditing and investigations authority of inspectors general reviewing and further clarifying if n ecessary the scope and tools of the igs regulatory investigation authority certain limits on this authority and jurisdiction were prescribed in 19 89 justice department office of legal counsel memorandum commonly know n as the kmiec memo for its author the following year the acting attorney general based on discussions between the department of justice and the pcie issued followup memorandum establishing set of principles that attempt to clarify the earlier opinion examining and possibly expanding and standardizing law enforcement authority for criminal investigators in the offices of inspector general this area of inquiry could look at whether th current arrangements especially the longterm special deputation by the mars hals service have proven effective and at what costs and impact on the offices of inspector general whether there should be acrosstheboard law enforcem ent powers in public law or whether law enforcement powers if expanded by statute should be granted selectively to specific agencies and most fundame ntally whether there is need for independent law enforcement authority for oig criminal investigators by comparison to other mechanisms whic h rely upon the marshals service or other law enforcement entities and what impact such change would produce in the oigs themselves in their relationship with the justice department and in crime control efforts at the federal levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98141crs13 enhancing ig testimonial subpoena au thority for all statutory inspectors general under the 1978 ig act this change could aid igs especially in gathering information about alleged buses of authority and evidence about suspected criminal wrongdoing examining and possibly clarifying the rights of employees who areinterviewed by ig staff such as the ri ght to counsel or to union representation at such meetings clarifying or expanding ig access to certain private records of public officials these might include such items as income tax records and other financial records protecting the confidentiality of whistleblowers and other employees who bring allegations of wrongdoing to th igs attention this might result in examining instances where such confidentiality has not been adequately protected where the indivi dual employee protested the disclosure and where alleged reprisals resulted granting igs authority to halt specific projects or operations which are found to have particularly serious or flag rant problems and which are reported to the agency head and within seven days to congress only the nowdefunct inspector general for foreign assistance has held authority to halt project these new powers could help to improve agency responsiveness to ig findings of these serious problems and subsequent recommendations for corrective action providing prosecutorial authority for ig s in specified areas possibly on trial basis this power could increase the impact of ig findings of criminal conduct currently prosecutions base d on such discoveries are conducted by us attorneys and the department of justice these justice department prosecutors may be overwhelme d with other cases that have higher priority such as those involving illegal narc otics thus reducing the likelihood of prosecutions based on ig findings of wrongdoing for instance for medicare or medicaid fraud effectiveness and orientation of igs pcie and ecie measuring effectiveness and orientation of the offices and comparing them over time this could include attempts to determine changes within and between the audit and investigation f unctions since the establishment of an oig between an igs prevention and det ection focuses or between his or her possible roles as an outsider eg an independent critic or insider eg an ally of management other studi could focus on corrective action taken by an agency on ig recommendations based in part on the semiannual statistical reporting provisions requi red by the 1988 amendments to the ig act these studies might examine wh ether the proposed corrective actions have actually taken place to what extent and with what results related inquiry might question the budgetary impact of corrective recommendations that have been implemented asking for instance whether the costsavings resulted in reduction of an agencys budget requestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98141crs14 using different measurements or base s to assess performance effectiveness and success different kinds of measurements than presently used might reveal different levels or rates of success nd effectiveness of igs assessing the role of oigs in implementation of the government performance and results act both for themselves and for the agencies in which they are located examining the role of oigs in help ing to determine commenting upon and recommending corrective action for the high risk or high vulnerability areas in federal programs that have been identified by gao requiring that the summary reports on ig activities produced by the presidents council on integrity and fficiency and the executive council on integrity and efficiency be issued semiannually the pcie reports had been issued twice year until the fy 1988 re port these accounts along with the ecie reports now appear only once year and their release is often delayed by more than six months after the end of the fiscal year this results not only in fewer summary accounts of ig activitie s but also in less timely information and data than would be available if they were issued semiannually examining the role and responsibilities of the presidents council on integrity and efficiency pcie covering presidentiallyappointed igs and the executive council on integrity and effi ciency ecie covering entityhead appointments this effort could examine how the pcie and ecie have contributed to the effectiveness of the igs presumably through improved coordination any omb followup to such efforts what other techniques or operations might be adopted along the same lines and whether individual ig activities operations or independence might have been jeopardized or reduced because of pcie or ecie demands looking into the controls via the pcieecie integrity committee over alleged abuses of authority or othe r improprieties by igs or their top assistants examining what has happened to ig findings of suspected criminal wrongdoing reported to the attorney general this might include comparing among the igs the number and type of ch reported suspicions as well as the justice departments own followup i nvestigations and prosecutions this examination could lead to determining the reasons why the justice department followed up or did not do so with its own investigations and prosecutions and thus help to improve ig preliminary investigations and gathering of evidence if that appears necessary reporting to the agen cy head and congress enhancing and standardizing the data and information on investigations in the semiannual reports this might follow th lines for audit statistics and data required by the 1988 ig act amendmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98141crs15 improving communication surrounding th major findings conclusions and recommendations in the miannual reports this could occur through for instance regular hearings with relevant congressional subcommittees when the report is issued and inperson brie fings by ig personnel for congressional staff on relevant panels consolidating or coordinating the semiannual reports from igs with the periodic reports submitted unde r other relevant statut such as the chief financial officers act and the federal managers financial integrity act requiring that the igs issue their summary activity re ports only annually rather than semiannually as is the case now increasing the use of the sevenday tter reports about particularly serious or flagrant problems this might be accomplished by clarifying the meaning of the phrase in law in congressional report or in pcie advisory opinion to the igs the effort might also lead to setting specific criteria and standards for submitting such reports it might for instance require that any finding which is repeated in three successi ve semiannual reports be considered particularly serious or flagrant and automatically submitted to the agency head and then sent to congress with in seven days this possible product could be based on an examin ation of the infrequent us of the sevenday letter reportsabout once year for all igsand comparison of this use with episodes that appear to meet comm on understanding of p articularly serious or flagrant problems but were not reported under this provision examining systematically the agency heads and congresss response to sevenday letter reports ab out particularly serious or flagrant problems discovered by the igs requiring the ig to issue confidential report directly to the appropriate congressional committees whenever the head of the establishment is the subject of an ig investigation pres ently only the cia inspector general has this authority for the director of central intelligence personnel practices comparing personnel practices of igs this might include examining whether the ig hires his or her own staff or relies upon personnel ro tating into and out of the office from other parts of the blishment it could also involve comparison of the recruitment practices and selection criteria for new hirings promotional opportunities nd practices and complaints or grievances from ig personnel in this field comparing changes over time between the audit and investigative side of each oig this effort could help to deter mine whether any growth in one side has been accomplished at the expense of the other and if so why contracting out for activitie s and operations this c ould involve review of such contracting among igs currently or for each ig over time what types of activities are contracted for actual costs and costbenefits and the possiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98141crs16 loss of inhouse capabilities through reliance on such outsourcing of activities and operations which might result in hollow government that is the inability of government office to perform its basic functions or activities itself incentive awards using whistleblower cash incentive awar ds this effort could look at the extent of their use by the inspectors general to reward federal personnel for costsaving disclosures differences among the igs and changes in usage over time allowing igs to be eligible for incentive awards or not an examination of this matter might first of all review the differences in accepting incentive awards among igs and then examine th differences of opinion over whether igs should be eligible for such awards particularly those granted by the establishment head or based on his or her recommendation if these types of awards are found acceptable attention mig ht then be given to alternative arrangements for nominating igspossibl through panel of pcie or ecie members or through panel

changes in the statutory offices of inspector general proposed inspector general act amendments of 1998 in the most farreaching of these sena tor susan collins introduced legislation s 2167 for herself and senator grassley that would have amended the inspector general act of 1978 in number of ways first of all the proposal would consolidate seven of smaller ig offices in designated federal entities into larger oigs in federal establishments with similar subject matter jurisdictions eg peace corps oig into the state department oig the initiative would also reduce the semiannual reporting by igs to the agency h ead and to congress to single annual report in addition inspectors general in larg er federal establishments who are appointed by the president nd confirmed by the senate would be given renewable nineyear term of office in the expectation that this would encourage longer tenure the bill would also require that all igs unde rgo an external review or evaluation of their activities and operations at least every three years finally s 2167 would increase the salary level of igs in the federal establishments from executive level 4 118400 to executive level 3 125900 because igs have generally refrained from receiving bonuses in order to avoid the appearance of conflic t of interest this loss of bonuses from the agency head has resulted in some igs receiving
