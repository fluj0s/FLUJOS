weak colombian enforcement of international labor organization ilo core labor standards and labor laws proponents of the agreement argue primarily for the proposed colombia fta on the basis of economic and national security benefits accordingly they argue the cfta would support increased exports expand economic growth create jobs and open up investment opportunities for the united states they also argue that it would reinforce the rule of law and spread values of capitalism in colombia and anchor hemispheric stability proponents specifically respond to labor complaints of the opponents that 1 violence against trade unionists has declined dramatically since president álvaro uribe took office in 2002 2 substantial progress is being made on the impunity issue as the government has undertaken great efforts to find perpetrators and bring them to justice and 3 the colombian government is taking steps to improve conditions for workers if congress were to approve the colombia fta it would be the second fta after peru to have some labor enforcement teeth labor provisions including the four basic ilo core labor standards would be enforceable through the same dispute settlement procedures as for all other provisions ie primarily those for commercial interests opponents argue that under cfta only the concepts of core labor standards and not the details of the ilo conventions behind them would be enforceable proponents point to recent colombian progress in protecting workers on many fronts they argue that approval of the fta and the economic growth in colombia that would result is the best way to protect colombias trade unionists they also argue that not passing the agreement would not resolve colombias labor issues opponents argue that delaying approval of the proposed cfta further would give colombia more time to keep improving protections for its workers this report will be updated as events warrant

rugged terrain that has been hard to govern in addition long history of poverty and inequality has left colombia open to other influences among them drug trafficking leftist guerrilla groups inspired by the cuban revolution formed in the 1960s as response to state neglect and poverty rightwing paramilitaries formed in the 1980s to defend landowners many of whom were drug traffickers against guerrillas the shift of coca production from peru and bolivia to colombia in the 1980s increased drug violence and provided new source of revenue for both guerrillas and paramilitaries in 2002 colombians elected an independent álvaro uribe as president largely because of his aggressive plan to reduce violence in colombia

and 26th largest export destination worldwide machinery organic chemicals and cereals constitute half of total exports to colombia and petroleum accounts for 41 of all imports from colombia given the relatively small level of trade between the united states and colombia the cfta would according to us international trade commission report likely have minimal to effect on output or employment for most sectors of the us economy3 us proponents argue that the proposed cfta would provide number of economic benefits including market access for us consumer and industrial products cooperation in the production of textiles and apparel and new opportunities for us farmers and ranchers 4 however the trade effect overall is expected to be very small the largest changes in us output are projected for the cereal grains production sector 03 and the gar sector 03 the largest changes in us employment are projected to be in cereal grains 03 sugar cane 03 and textiles 035 colombias exports to the united states already enter the united states mostly dutyfree under the andean trade preference act tpa however new us investment in colombia as result of the agreement could support increased economic growth and employment and additional exports to the united states colombian proponents argue that the only western hemisphere pacific rim countries with which the united states does not have free trade agreement are colombia ecuador and panama the united states has ftas with all others canada mexico guatemala honduras salvador nicaragua costa rica peru and chile the investment that goes into these other countries from the united states as result the colombian embassy argues means that new exports from latin america to the united states are increasingly coming from noncolombian countries

debate on the cfta is the longterm trend in murders of colombias trade unionists as they try to express rights that are in concept protected in colombias laws three organizations track data on the number of trade unionists murdered each year the colombian government the international trade union confederation ituc successor to the international confederation of free trade unions icftu and the escuela nacional sindical ens or national labor school nongovernmental organization founded in 1982 in colombia to provide nonpartisan and independent information on human rights labor and the dynamics of association and collective bargaining figure 1 below tracks each of their data on the number of murders of trade unionists in colombia and worldwide between 1997 and 2008 projected it shows wide yeartoyear variation in the number of trade unionists murdered but distinct downward trend since 2001 inconsistency among the three trend lines for colombia reflects the fact that the three data sources do not always agree on which murders s hould be counted as trade unionist those murders that may not be counted by all sources include nonaffiliated advisors to unions retired and inactive union members rural and community organization members and teachers 8 the large bump in the murder trend line from 19992003 coincides with large bulge in the cultivation of coca produced in colombia and simultaneous decline in coca production in bolivia and peru according to department of state data the fact that the three lines for colombias murders of trade unionists closely track and crowd the line depicting such murders worldwide shows the extent to which colombia accounts for most such worldwide murders colombias share ranges from low of 49 in 1999 to high of 86 in 2002 and then declines to 54 in 2006 7 data in this paragraph are from economist intelligence unit country report colombia october 2008 p 16 us bureau of labor statistics and us state department country reports on human rights practices 2007 published march 2008 8 until recently murders of teachers were not counted in co lombian government statistics yet teachers constitute the group that has suffered the most

relationship between colombias murders and worldwide murders of trade unionists proponents including the bush administration and the colombian government focus on the steady decline in such murders since uribe became president in 2002 and on actions taken recently by the colombian government to reduce these fatalities such actions include bringing to colombia permanent ilo representative passing new labor laws stepping up enforcement of labor laws implementing new judicial system and setting up trade unionist protection program under this program as of march 7 2008 roughly 1983 trade unionists were receiving protection 21 of all persons receiving protection but 30 of the total protection budget of 131 million 9 opponents of the colombia fta also poin t out other reasons for the decline in murders including the decline in targets unions in colombia have dwindled from 13 of the formal labor force in 1965 to 4 currently they and their efforts have been eroded primarily through

detentions and death threats proponents of the cfta note reductions in assassinations and arbitrary detentions since 2004 opponents examining the data longer term focus on third means of intimidation death threats they argue that in recent years perpetrators have switched their focus from murders to death threats because this more subtle form of intimidation can achieve the same results of discouraging union activity with less public notice12 these three methods of intimidation are tracked individually in the left graph in figure 2 and cumulatively in the right graph the right graph

paramilitaries guerrillas and the colombian military13 the human rights advocates group amnesty international usa reports on the difficulty in identifying the perpetrators in cases of trade union violence however it reports that among cases in which clear evidence of responsibility is available in 2005 of all human rights abuses against trade unionists paramilitaries committed 49 security forces committed 43 guerrilla forces committed 2 and criminals committed 414 proponents of the agreement cite data showing progress in bringing perpetrators of the violence to justice as the result of tripartite agreement with the ilo among the government trade confederations and business groups the office of the colombian prosecutor general in october 2006 created special subunit to investigate and prosecute 1272 criminal cases of violence against trade union members these included 187 priority cases as determined by the unions15 as of october 20 2008 there have been total of 147 convictions in cases involving violence against trade union members between 2001 and 2008 with 97 66 of them handed down in 2007200816 luciano vasquez director general of the ens views convictions over longer period of time and points out that since 1986 in about 97 of the cases of murders of trade unionists the perpetrators have never been identified and brought to justice he argues further that while in some cases the perpetrators of labor killings are found guilty in zero cases has the mastermind behind the crime been convicted17

of enforcement of colombias labor laws and colombias ability to protect workers many observers point out that enforcement of labor laws and standards generally is an issue for colombia as well as throughout latin america and other developing countries proponents point to colombias system of labor laws and protections which include ratification of all four ilo core labor standards they argue that colombias laws provide for fundamental labor rights and more 18 these ilo standards 1 protect the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively 2 prohibit forced labor 3 prohibit child labor and 4 provide for non discrimination in employment 13 us state department charting colombias progress 14 amnesty international usa colombia killings arbitrary detentions and death threats the

adhering to its labor code in january 2007 permanent ilo representative opened an office in colombia pursuant to june 2006 tripartite agreement in october 2007 it received 40 million in funding from the colombian government subsequently the ilo removed colombia from discussion in its committee for the application of standards which examines significant problems in specific countries for the first time in 21 years19 the ilo has enforcement authority its main tools are technical assistance and moral suasion however the government and the ilo are working to improve cooperation among national regional and municipal governments to eradicate child labor and protect working youth issues addressed in the paragraph below opponents argue that the state departments country reports on human rights practices 2007 notes numerous shortcomings in colombian law and its enforcement of which the following are examples right to organize and bargain collectively the right to organize and bargain collectively in colombia is limited because of high unemployment large informal economic sector traditional antiunion attitudes an d violence against trade union leaders prohibitions against forced labor forced labor is problem in prostitution and in new illegal guerrilla groups which practice forced conscription including the conscription of children prohibitions against child labor child labor remains significant problem particularly in the informal sector as well in the sex industry in mining and in coca picking colombias 276 labor inspectors for enforcing child labor laws in the formal sector covering about 20 of the child labor force are seen as inadequate for effective enforcement finally the state departments country reports 2007 also points to the inadequacy of some of colombias labor laws for example the mont hly minimum wage in colombia about 205 does not provide sufficient income to purchase basic market basket of goods for family of four in addition it is difficult to enforce the minimum wage in the informal sector g18g152g156g156g146g139g149g142g561g11g150g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 if congress were to approve the proposed colombia fta it would be the second fta after peru to have some labor enforcement teeth labor provisions including the four basic ilo core labor standards enumerated in the previous section would be enforceable through the same dispute settlement procedures as for all other provisions such those for commercial interests opponents argue that under cfta only the concepts of core labor standards and not the details of the ilo conventions behind them would be enforceable proponents point to recent colombian progress in protecting workers on many fronts first the personal protection program for union members has been success in that since 2002 not single trade union member enrolled in the program has been killed according to the colombian embassy second funding for investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of crimes against trade unionists has increased third the government has engaged in greater social dialogue with the ilo and other international union organizations which are having an impact on national labor policy fourth there are number of new legislative proposals pending to further protect basic core labor rights 20 19 country reports on human rights practices 2007 20 an open letter to congressional democrats on hemispheric trade expansion signed by seven former members of congress and the senate and at least 30 former cabinet officials ambassadors and foreign and trade policy

violence in colombia as well as recent corruption and wiretapping scandals they assert that the level of reported violence has steadily and significantly declined under president uribe they argue further that rather than hiding the scandals or minimizing them colombia is taking steps to root them out and cleanse the political system recognizing that more must be done including bringing to justice those who have committed crimes against unionists however they argue walking away from the proposed cfta or postponing it until conditions are perf ect would send an unambiguous signal to friends and opponents alike that the united states is an unreliable partner without vision for cooperation in the western hemisphere they argue that this would make colombia panama peru and others who are making political decisions to enhance relations with the united states despite strong domestic and external political pressure reevaluate their relationship with the united states 21 opponents argue that delaying the vote on the proposed cfta further would give colombia more time to keep improving protections for its workers they assert that colombia is still the most dangerous place in the world to be trade unionist since it still accounts for the majority of murders of trade unionists worldwide they also argue that the progress made in bringing to justice perpetrators of violence against union workers is limited and point to the fact that significant percentage of those convicted in these cases 34 as of october 20 2008 according to the colombian government are convicted in absentia and remain at large they also argue that members of the uribe government continue to inaccurately denounce union members as guerrillas finally they argue that passing the cfta could very well halt the meager progress by the colombian government on worker rights protections achieved to date 22 proponents argue that approval of the proposed fta and the economic growth in colombia that would result is the best way to protect colombias trade unionists they also argue that not passing the agreement would not resolve colombias labor issues continued available at
