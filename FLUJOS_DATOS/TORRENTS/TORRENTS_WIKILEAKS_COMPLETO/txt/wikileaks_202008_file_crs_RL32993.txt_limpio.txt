2006 nonna noto specialist in public finance government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress abandoned mine reclamation fee on coal summary the abandoned mine reclamation fund also known as the abandoned mine land aml fund is financed by fees levied per ton of domestically produced coal the fee is 35 cents per ton for surfacemined coal 15 cents per ton for underground mined coal and 10 cents per ton for lignite the fund and the fees were established by the surface mining control and reclamation act of 1977 smcra to finance restoration of land abandoned or inadequately restored by mining companies before august 3 1977 the fees were originally scheduled to expire in 1992 but congress has extended them seven times the fy2006 interior environment and related agencies appropriations act hr 2361 pl 10954 enacted on august 2 2005 extended the fees for nine months until june 30 2006 the bush administrations fy2007 budget requested that the aml fees be extended through september 30 2007 at their current levels this interim extension was intended to provide time for the administration to work with congress to change the rules governing expenditures from the aml fund the fy2006 emergency supplemental appropriations act hr 4939 as amended pl 109234 enacted on june 15 2006 extended the fees through fy2007 as the administration had requested in the 109th congress there are proposals to extend the aml fees longer term as part of bills to reauthorize the abandoned mine reclamation program hr 5970 thomas passed by the house on july 292006 as well

fund has balance of 21 billion which earns interest since fy1996 most of the annual interest earnings of the fund have been transferred to the united mine workers of america umwa combined benefit fund cbf to help pay the medical expenses of orphan retirees their spouses and dependents from fy1996 through fy2005 746 million in interest was transferred the law provides that if the regular aml fees sunset special fees should be established solely to provide for the annual transfer to the cbf under current law 50 of the aml fees collected are allocated back to the state or indian tribe that collected them known as the state share since 1977 when smcra was enacted the production of coal has shifted westward mostly to wyoming while most of the remaining high priority reclamation sites are in eastern states the location of historic pre1978 coal production the office of surface mining estimates that at least 3 billion in additional reclamation expenditures is needed to clean up remaining priority 1 and 2 sites aml fees could be lower or collected for fewer years if the state share allocation were eliminated and the aml fund focused on reclaiming these high priority sites however

stages by 10 on october 1 2007 and by the remaining 10 on october 1 2012 the fees would be extended for 14 years through fy2021 fee levels and collections under section 402a of smcra11 the aml fees were set at the rate of 35 cents per ton for surfacemined coal and 15 cents per ton for undergroundmined coal or 10 of the value of the coal at the mine whichever is less the fee was set at 10 cents per ton for lignite or 2 of the value of coal at the mine whichever is less12 these same rates continued each time the fees were extended according to the legislative history of section 402a of smcra the lower fee set for underground mining compared with surface mining reflects the disproportionately high social costs incurred by underground coal mine operators in meeting responsibilities under the coal mine safety and health act of 1969 as amended13 the fee for lignite coal was agreed to by the conference committee the compromise reached on the reclamation fee for lignite reflects the conferees 9 pl 109234 the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and hurricane recovery 2006 section 7007 the provision was not included in the version of hr

than coal and thus 10 percent fee could be onerous second many recent longterm contracts for lignite have had prices in the same range as subbituminous coal14 thus the disparity in rates was not linked to differences in the estimated cost of repairing damage done to the environment by the alternative methods of coal removal the aml reclamation fee is collected quarterly from coal operators commonly referred to as producers it is levied on each ton of coal produced domestically from its outset in 1977 the fee was not levied on imported coal recently the issue of whether the fee applies to exported coal has been in litigation in an april 2005 decision the federal claims court ruled that applying the fee to exported coal is unconstitutional the government still has the option to appeal the decision approximately 100 million in refunds of aml fees are at stake15 the fee is administered and collected by the office of surface mining osm in the interior department16 osm was successful in collecting an estimated 999 of aml fees due in fy200517 in fy2004 aml fee collections were 287 million while total distributions for aml programs were 159 million18 in fy2005 fee collections were 293 million and total distributions for aml programs were 148 million19 cumulatively over the life of the fund from january 30 1978 when the first aml fees were paid through september

2005 the balance of the fund was 21 billion20 the unappropriated balance of the fund was 18 billion21 the unappropriated balance represents 24 of cumulative collections osm estimates that about 3 billion in additional reclamation expenditures is needed to clean up remaining priority 1 and 2 sites another 36 billion of high priority coal problems affecting the general welfare of individuals and the environment have been identified22 under the current smcra law 50 of the fees collected are allocated back to the state or indian tribe that collected them known as the state and tribal shares ten percent are allocated to the rural abandoned mine land program ramp which has received appropriation since fy1995 twenty percent are allocated to sites ranked priority 1 and 2 for reclamation based on historic coal production and 20 go to other reclamation projects and administrative costs23 since 1977 when smcra was enacted the production of coal has shifted westward primarily to wyoming while most 94 of the remaining high priority reclamation sites are in eastern states the location of historic pre1978 production consequently the state share program now results in high allocations to western states while the greater reclamation needs are in eastern states aml fees could be lower or collected for fewer years if the state share allocation were eliminated and the aml fund focused on reclaiming high priority sites however western states would have less interest in supporting the aml fund if they received nothing in return for their producers contributions relationship to the umwa

energy policy act contained proviso that after the regular aml fees sunset on september 30 2004 the aml fee should be established at rate to continue to provide for the deposit of funds to the cbf27 in preparation for this possibility on september 17 2004 osm published final rule to permit the collection of special aml fee in the event that congress allowed the regular fee to expire28 osm noted that section 402b of smcra did not address whether the same differences in rates should continue to apply to coal produced after the regular fees expired29 in its september 17 2004 rule osm stated its intention to maintain the same ratios among the per ton fees that were originally established by smcra the fee per ton of coal produced by underground methods would be 43 of the fee per ton of coal produced by surface methods the fee per ton of lignite coal produced would be 29 of the fee per ton of coal produced by surface methods30 osm proposed aml fees for fy2005 of 88 cents per ton for surface mined coal 38 cents per ton for undergroundmined coal and 25 cents per ton for lignite coal31 these fees were based on estimates of coal production by type of mining and were set with the intention of raising 69 million the estimated interest earnings of the aml fund in fy2005 the exact level of the fees was projected to change each year from fy2006 through fy2015 in relation to estimated interest earnings and coal production but the ratios among the fees were to remain the same because the existing fee levels were extended by congress the lower fees proposed by osm never took effect 25 osm annual report 2004 p 79 this includes interest earned by the aml fund during fiscal years 19921995 but transferred in subsequent years 26 us executive office of the president office

take effect crs6 economic burden of the fee32 for some time aml fees have been below the statutory percentofprice limits of 10 of value for surface and undergroundmined coal and 2 for lignite steep increases in coal prices in late 2003 and in 2004 further reduced the relative burden of the fee measured as percent of price in the last year coal prices have fallen somewhat raising the relative burden but it is still below the low points of 2004 in most cases judging by spot prices the price of coal in midaugust 2006 is as much as 85 higher than in 2003 and the relative burden of the aml fee in the categories examined in table 1 consequently is only between half and twothirds of what it was in 2003 it should be noted that spot prices in recent years have been noticeably higher than likely contract prices which apply to the predominant share of us coal production consequently the actual burden of the aml fee in 2006 probably is somewhat greater than indicated by the percentages reported in the following text and table the 035 aml fee equaled 14 of the estimated average us price of surfacemined bituminous coal in midaugust 2006 2500 compared with 26 in 2003 1342 the 015 fee equaled 03 of the estimated average us price of undergroundmined bituminous coal in midaugust 2006 4500 compared with 06 in 2003 2671 the 010 fee was at 09 of the average us price of lignite in 2003 lignite price data are available yet for 2006 for the aml fees to be at the percentofprice limits the price of surfacemined coal would need to be 350 per ton or less undergroundmined coal 150 per ton or less and lignite 500 per ton or less in contrast the black lung excise tax blet runs closer to its limit of 44 of price in most cases the blet of 055 per ton of surfacemined coal equaled 22 of the estimated midaugust 2006 average us spot price of surfacemined bituminous coal 2500 but is 50 of the spot price of powder river basin coal 1090 the twice as high tax of 110 per ton on undergroundmined coal equals 24 of the estimated midaugust 2006 average us spot price of underground mined coal 4500 the relative aml fee generally is higher on surfacemined coal than on undergroundmined coal both because the absolute fee is higher and because the price of surfacemined coal is lower however the relative burden of the fee can differ by specific type of coal within those categories for example the 035 aml fee in midaugust 2006 equaled 32 of the estimated average spot price of bituminous coal surfacemined in the powder river basin which has lower heat content than most other bituminous coals it was 08 for surfacemined bituminous coal from other geographic basins this compares with an average 03 burden of the 015 fee for undergroundmined bituminous coal 32 bernard gelb specialist in

proposals to extend the fees in its fy2005 budget the bush administration proposed returning unobligated state share balances to the states over 10year period and henceforth eliminating the state
