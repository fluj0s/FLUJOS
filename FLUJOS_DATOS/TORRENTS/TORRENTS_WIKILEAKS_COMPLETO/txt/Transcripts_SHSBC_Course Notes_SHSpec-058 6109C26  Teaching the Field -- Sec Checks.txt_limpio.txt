6109c26 shspec58 teaching the field sec checks one can always add to sec checks but never subtract from it for given person depending on his interests and activities this gets complicated enough to be real to someone whos having difficulty in life there are lots of different sec checks for instance you could use the childrens sec check to help restore persons memory of childhood and get all the results freudian psychiatry sought if an auditor can run some process with great confidence of good results have him run that on every pc regardless of what the pc needs you try not to give him pc who can only be run on something else on sec checks you get fast wins this gives an auditor reality fast any auditor who has gotten tired of auditing or upset with auditing has had lot of loses someone who doesnt want to learn how to audit has had long series of disasters with trying to help people an auditor who has an exaggerated idea about what ought to happen in session who gets frantic changes processes continually has had loses with auditing so you want to give him something that gets fast result in order to restore their confidence in their ability to help sec check is good way to get results on pcs who just never cognite who never give you what do you know about their cases especially if you use sec checks that hit on the pcs particular areas you can even cure psychosomatic illness by using the ptp of long duration as the subject of the sec check looking for hidden standards which is the one thing on which his attention is fixed you pay attention when the pc tells you what would have to happen for him to know scientology works which could be something on any of the eight dynamics when you get one that is extensional ie where something would have to happen to someone else youll find that it is easy to audit this on sec check you get all their overts on the other terminal with it this works very well because youre separating valences and terminals withholds add up to lots more than just withholds overts secrecies individuations and games conditions were asking the person to straighten out his relationships with another terminal the normal sec check is addressed to the individual versus his society or family because its what people would consider reprehensible that makes it withhold you could have special mores between husband and wife or auditor and pc if person transgresses against moral code he individuates if he individuates too obsessively he snaps terminals and becomes it the security check clears this all up to get rid of chronic somatic you must first find something the person really thinks is wrong that he wants to recover from you cant assume that if its wrong he wants it fixed it could well be solution to some other problem it could be service fac this generally starts somewhere way back with some series of withholds illnesses are protests against life so you can tailor sec check to reach the areas of life the person is protesting against and run it the psychosomatic illness will disappear it does take lot of figurefigure and detective work the sort of problem about case that many auditors just love so get the thing the person wants to handle trace it back to some area or activity you are looking for activities which had to do with changing the position of mass the massier it is and the more change of positions the more aberrative it is sec check the persons handling of masses and changes of space if you have clue on that go into his most confused motional areas if hes now motionless find what he was doing prior to becoming so motionless and find an area of intolerable activity run sec check on that area of activity get all the items and terminals in that area and invent all possible overts against them crude way to do it is to use modification of an existing sec check it is better still to mock up new one using all the crimes you could do in an area of tight mores you could handle someone whose goal is to fix up his memory both by what wouldnt you mind forgetting plus ow on various terminals with deficient perception plus find who didnt remember well or who insisted he remember and sec check him on those people this will spring him into his what do you know on the subject you can assume if he doesnt cognite that hes really pinned down on the area by withholds from you from the area and even from himself the sec check will increase his freedom to know which is the opposite of the notknowingness enforced by ow so make list of all the items you can think of from his area of difficulty ask if hes done anything to or interfered with those items and activities his cognition may come out little by little or at last with bang the rule is that any zone of life with which person is having difficulty is fruitful area for security check any area where the person is having difficulty hes stupid stupidity is notknowingness which occurs through overts but the overt has to be hidden so its withheld so withholds add up to stupidity so he has trouble in the area you must always assume psychosomatic difficulty is solution after the fact of confusion confusion consists of change of position of particles in time and space predicted or unpredicted if they are unpredicted changes in space youll have confusion the pc puts attention on one particle as stable datum this is fine except that he ends up with psychosomatic complaint to resolve the complaint find the prior confusion and do good security check on the things in the vicinity of the confusion to get off the overts that made it necessary to pull in the somatic all sec checks add up to very thorough keyouts
