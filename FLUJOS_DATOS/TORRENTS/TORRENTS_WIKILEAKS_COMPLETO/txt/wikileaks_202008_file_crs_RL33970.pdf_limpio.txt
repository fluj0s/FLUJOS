energy use john blodgett specialist in environmental policy larry parker specialist in energy and environmental policy december 31 2008 abstract this report identiﬁes drivers of the increase in emissions and explores their implications for eﬀorts to reduce emissions during this exploration it is useful to bear in mind that although shortterm eﬀorts may not achieve emissions reductions that immediately meet goals to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system such endeavors may nevertheless establish basis for longerterm eﬀorts that do meet such goalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33970g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

responses to the risk associated with it three variables strongly influence the levels and growth of greenhouse gas ghg emissions population income measured as per capita gros s domestic product gdp and intensity of emissions measured as tons of greenhouse gas emissions per million dollars of gdp population per capita gdp intensity ghg emissions ghg this is the relationship for given point in time over time any effort to change emissions alters the exponential rates of change of these variables this means that the rates of change of the three lefthand variables measured in percentage of annual change sum to the rate of change of the righthand variable emissions for most countries and for the world as whole population and per capita gdp are rising faster than intensity is declining so emissions are rising globally for the variables above over the period 19902005 the rates of change in annual percent sum as follows population per capita gdp intensity ghg emissions ghg 14 17 16 16 as can be seen global emissions have been rising at rate of about 16 per year the numbers do not sum exactly due to rounding driven by the growth of population and of economic activity within this generalization countries vary widely between 1990 and 2005 in some countries including brazil mexico indonesia and south africa population growth alone exceeded the decline in intensity for most countries and for the world as whole per capita gdp growth exceeded the intensity improvement each achieved countries for whom intensity improvements were greater than their per capita gdp increases included germany the united kingdom france and south africa and both the russian federation and the ukraine following their economic contractions in the 1990s posted negative numbers for population per capita income intensity and ghg emissions between 1990 and 2005 besides the russian federation and the ukraine only the united kingdom and germany reduced their ghg emissions for the period germany being helped by reductions in the former east germany stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions would mean the rate of change equals zero globally with population growth rate of 14 per year and an income growth rate of 17 per year intensity would have to decline at rate of 31 per year to hold emissions at the level of the year that rate of decline went into effect within the united states at the 19902005 population growth rate of 12 per year and income growth rate of 18 per year intensity would have had to decline at rate of 30 per year to hold emissions level however us intensity declined at rate of 19 leaving emissions to grow at just over 10 per year

three variables underlie debates on the issue of climate change1 and what responses might be justified the magnitude and rates of change of 1 population growth 2 incomes and 3 intensity of greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic activities this report examines the interrelationships of the variables to explore their implications for policies that address climate change both internationally and domestically initiatives are underway both to better understand climate change and to take steps to slow stop and reverse the overall growth in greenhouse gas emissions2 the most important of which is carbon dioxide co 2 emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels these initiatives include the following bulleted items the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc to which the united states and almost all other nations are parties its stated objective is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at levels that would prevent dangerous interference with the climate system 3 it established the principle that all nations should take action and that developed nations should take the lead in reducing emissions it required parties to prepare national action plans to achieve reductions with developed countries aiming to reduce year 2000 emissions to 1990 levels it required preparation of inventories of emissions and annual reports and it set up process for the parties to continue meeting the kyoto protocol to which 169 nationsbut not the united statesare parties even as the framework convention was going into force it was recognized that most nations would not meet their 2000 aims of holding emissions at 1990 levels negotiations through the conference of parties ensued in which the united states participated these led to the kyoto protocol which called for mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases for the period 20082012 by developed nationsbut not by developing ones whether the reduction goal of the kyoto protocol is met parties ar already discussing postkyoto options the asiapacific partnership on clea n development and climate app composed of the united states china india japan australia and south korea the purposes of the partnership are to create voluntary nonlegally binding framework for international cooperation to facilitate the development diffusion deployment and transfer of existing emerging and longerterm costeffective cleaner more efficient technologies and practices among the partners through concrete and substantial cooperation so as to achieve practical results it has the 1 crs report

climate change concerns consistent with the principles of the framework convention on climate change unfccc4 however these efforts have had to struggle with substantive economic technical and political differences among regional national and local circumstances foremost among these differences is the divide between developed and lessdeveloped nations5 conflict arises because any pressure to reduce emissions comes up against increases in emissions likely to result from energy use fueling economic development and raising standards of living in developing economies which contain large share of the worlds population even in many developed nations efforts to constrain emissions by for example conservation increased energy efficiency and use of energy sources that emit less or co 2 have been outstripped by increases in total energy use associated with population and economic growth for example between 1990 and 2005 in the united states the greenhouse gas intensity of the economy declined at rate of 19 per year but total emissions increased at the rate of 10 per year6 although some countries have experienced declines in emissionseither through economic contraction7 or deliberate policiesthe overall trend both globally and for most individual nations reflects increasing emissions this upward trend in greenhouse gas emissions runs counter to the longterm objectives of these climate change initiatives this report identifies drivers of the increase in emissions and explores their implications for efforts to reduce emissions during this exploration it is useful to bear in mind that although shortterm efforts may not achieve emissions reductions that immediately meet goals to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system such endeavors may nevertheless establish basis for longerterm efforts that do meet such goals g9g155g142g142g151g145g152g158g156g142g561g9g138g156g561g7g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g561g24g138g155g146g138g139g149g142g156g561 the

emissions are rising if the sum is negative emissions are declining and if the sum is zero emissions are constant equation 3 makes explicit why there is upward pressure on ghg emissions for nearly all nations population is increasing with developing nations typically having the highest rate thus kp is positive globally and for most nations it is zero or negative for only few nations13 the economic development of lessdeveloped nations is global objective acknowledged by the unfccc developed nations also promote economic growth to raise living standards thus k g is increasing globally and for most nations with k g and k p positive emissions will be rising unless the decline in intensity k i exceeds the growth in population and economic activity which has seldom been the case if the goal is to reduce ghg emissions the larger the negative ki the better table 2 shows the changes in these variables for the 1990s the figures in the rightmost column are taken from the cait database14 as the table shows global growth rates for population and per capita income outpaced the rate of decline in intensityso ghg emissions rose this is also true of the majority of nations including the united states circumstances in several individual countries highlight some important points about ghg emissions and their potential control first for many nations population growth is an important contributor to the increase in ghg emissions for brazil mexico indonesia iran australia spain south africa and turkey any improvements in intensity were annulled by increases in population alone 15 second developing countries focused on developing their economies have increasing ghg emissions even when they manage to improve intensity eg china india mexico indonesia south korea and south africa for these countries population growth combined with per capita gdp growth overwhelmed whatever intensity improvements they achieved 16 third lower emissions can be associated with decreasing economic activity for the russian federation and ukraine economic contraction following the dissolution of the soviet union contributed to decreases in their emissions some fear that the cause and effect of this relationship runs both waysthat policies to reduce emissions will inevitably result in depressed economic activity fourth several developed countries improved per capita gdp while holding their ghg emissions to 1 increase or less the united states japan germany the united kingdom italy and france germany and the united kingdom and also the european union 27 actually decreased their emissions 13 the rate of population growth has declined in many countries in recent d ecades partly as result of deliberate policies eg birth control programs and in few countries such as china limits on family size and partly as result of education higher standards of living and cultural changes global population growth is expected to continue at least to midcentury with projections suggesting global population of around 9 billion in 2050 14 in principle these figures could be calculated by adding the three lefthand data columns in fact number of rows do not add this may be due to rounding or where discrepancies are large from shortcomings in the underlying reported data nevertheless the figures are consistent with the generalizations about trends 15 for iran and spain population and intensity both increased 16 for iran ghg emissions rose because population and gdp growth had offset at all from intensity which worsened

how fast they could be curtailed second is to assess what level of greenhouse gases can be emitted to the atmosphere without causing dangerous interferen ce with the climate system in the words of the

emerges from table 5 which shows their rates of change20 including the energy subsectors shown in italics global emissions are growing fastest in the industrial processes sector 39year next is the energy sector for which emissions are growing at the same rate as total emissions 16 because industrial process emissions 21 are much smaller share of total emissions than energy see table 4 the increase is relatively small in absolute terms however the rate of increase is substantial for nations that are industrializing especially china india and south korea the largest absolute increase in emissions is driven by the rate of increase for the energy sector within that sector the most rapidly growing subsector is electricity and heat energy at 25 per year led by developing nations especially china india brazil south ko rea iran and indonesia and also by spain and turkey in contrast for the eu27 the rate and absolute emissions for the subsector declined slightly but for the russian federation and ukraine the rate and absolute emissions declined substantially as their economies contracted the next fastest growing subsector is transportation at 21 year with every nation showing positive rate of growth except the russian federation 20 for fugitive emissions and waste emissions rates of change were not calculated if both the 1990 and 2005 emission levels were below 10 million tons at low levels even small changes can yield notable rates of changefor example if emissions went from 2 to 4 million tons between 1990 and 2 005 the rate of change would be 38 per year but

carbon intensity of energy use see table 6 are strongly affected by the carbon intensity of electricity generation which accounts for about 467 of world co 2 emissions not counting land use changes and forestry practices differences among countries are marked as depicted in table 8 choices among generating technologies are the primary driver of disparities among countries in the carbon intensity of their electricity generation in general countries with high numbers generate substantial proportion of their electricity by burning coal and countries with low numbers generate large quantities of electricity by nuclear facilities hydropower or other renewables for example france with the lowest carbon intensity of electricity production at 218 grams of carbon per kilowatthour in 2004 generated about 78 of its electricity by nuclear power about 11 by hydropower and 9 by conventional thermal the united states with carbon intensity of electricity production of 152 generated about 20 of its electricity by nuclear power about 7 by hydropower and about 71 by conventional thermal 25 although nations electricitygenerating technologies are obviously affected by its resource endowments in terms of hydropower and fossil fuels choices can be made as exemplified by france in 1980 frances electricity was generated 27 by hydropower 24 by nuclear 27 by coal and 19 by oil by 1990 with electricity production up over 60 nuclear had risen to 75 share whereas coal and oil had fallen to 8 and 2 shares respectively26 not only did nuclear power account for all the growth in electricity generation during the period but it displaced half the coalfired and more than threequarters of the oilfired electricity generation in 1990 the electricity produced by nuclear power exceeded frances

risen to 39 28 because natural gas produces less total co 2 per kilowatt hour than coal at ratio of about 06 to 1 on btu basis29 co 2 intensity in the united kingdom declined between 1990 and 2000 at

the examples of france and the united kingdom show that for period of time at least greenhouse gas intensity improvements can be sufficient to absorb growth in population and economic activity so that actual emissions decline the examples also show that the introduction of new technology can cause sudden shifts in emission rates the united states has also had periods when its co 2 emissions declined from 19801986 us co 2 intensity declined at rate of 36 per year and emissions declined at rate of 05 per year but after 1986 the rate of intensity decrease slowed between 1987 and 2003 the intensity rate averaged about 17 per year after 2003 through 2005 the last year of caits data the rate of intensity decrease speeded up to an average annual 26 nonetheless throughout the 19872005 period the decrease failed to compensate for population and per capita gdp growth so co 2 emissions rose at 12 per year over the long er term therefore emissions have risen in 27 climate analysis

emissions intensity of their transport sectors for example one effort examining vehicle miles shows substantial variations among several nations with the united states being the highest emitter per vehicle31 figure 1 to some extent these variations reflect differing geographic cultural and infrastructure circumstances among the nations however as with the carbon intensity of electricity

the latter had reduced the difference to 12 all in all it appears that policy choices can affect the energy intensity of travel and thus opportunities for improvement exist because there is clearly limit on greenhouse gas emission reductions to be achieved by heightened efficiencies in the transportation sector interest turns to alternative fuels that do not generate greenhouse gases including

they have been excluded from most analyses in this report because the data are limited and less robust than most of the emissions data and because for most nations taking it into account changes little however as table 10 shows substantial effects result from logging and clearing forests in few nations most notably indonesia and brazil and to lesser extent mexico and canada their ghg emission

greenhouse gas emissions are longlived in the atmosphere so their effect cumulates over time justification for developed nations taking the ad on reducing emissions while giving developing ones the opportunity to increase emissions from activities that are necessary for economic development is not just that developed nations are wealthier but also that they account for the bulk of cumulative emissions affecting climate data to assess cumulative emissions are limited in general data are available only for co 2 and are calculated from fuel use estimates land use changes over long time spans are important but data are scanty or unavailable cait provides figures for co 2 emissions only from 1850 not including land use changes table 11 because climateforcing depends on the cumulative emissions not current emissions it is easy to see from table 11 why developing nations feel that developed ones should take the lead given cait data the united states and the european union27 account for over half the cumulative co 2 emissions from energy use since 1850 the data on cumulative emissions and on including or excluding land use changes see table 10 highlight why individual nations are so differently affected by proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions setting baseline year for determining nations emissions means that countries that developed early could do so with restrictions on the use of fuels and other resources regardless of their potential impact on climate while those nations just now undergoing development might face restrictions the emissions of already developed nations are embedded in their baselines similarly whether certain activities such as land use changes are included or not affects what is in the baseline the greenhouse gas emissions of brazil and indonesia for example increase markedly when emissions from land use changes of the last few decades are counted but comparable land use changes in many other countries eg the united states happened in earlier centuries and the resulting emissions count only toward cumulation not against any current baseline

growth in two ways first birth rates tend to decline as incomes rise34 reducing one of the upward pressures on emissions most highincome nations have annual birth rates of 05 or lower compared with developing nations with birth rates that in some cases exceed 2 per year second the economic opportunity that many developed nations offer means they may have relatively high immigration rates so their population growth is higher than their birth rate35 overall most demographers expect the rate of population growth to slow although world population is projected to exceed 9 billion in 2050 with most of the increase in the developing world36 economic development and energy use are closely intertwined the substitution of fossil fuel energy for human and animal power has been an important driver of the industrial revolution and consequent higher incomes indeed for many industrialization is synonymous with economic development yet at some point in development the growth in incomes becomes at least partially detached from energy use as energy costs lead to attention to energy efficiencies and as economies shift toward postindustrial services public policies can affect the relationship between economic development and growth and energy use in many ways including taxation infrastructure development and research and development the unfccc assumes that developing nations will inevitably have to exploit more energy as they give priority to reducing poverty key element of the climate change debate is how to decouple that economic developmentenergy use link income and emissions are related in another way as well in general lowincome people in developing nations focus their efforts on survival whereas nations and individuals with higher incomes are likely to have more time and money to attend to environmental needs and amenities thus while richer nations consume more goods and services including energy per capita they also have generally been the most aggressive in addressing pollution and other environmental insults this empirical relationship is known as the environmental kuznets curve however its applicability to co 2 emissions has been questioned37 and to the degree that it does exist for such pollutants as sulfur dioxide it reflects policy choices to constrain emissions these interactions have both shortrun and longrun implications for most nations most of the time the combination of population growth and per capita gdp growth has more than offset forces tending to depress emissions so emissions have increased overall the most critical interaction is the one between per capita gdp growth and resource uses especially energy but also including cement manufacture agricultural practices deforestation waste disposal and the consumption and release of certain chemicals 34 this is not simple cause and effect but reflects evolutionary changes in areas such as education cultural expectations womens rights access to birth control and health careall of which may be affected by social policy 35 for the united states in 2005 the annual rate of population increase from the birth rate was 06 whereas counting migration the population growth rate was 09 see httpwwwcensusgovcgibinipcidbsumplctyus 36 see httpwwwunorgnewspressdocs2007pop952dochtm 37 the entire march issue of the journal of environment development vol 14

g9g152g138g149g156g561 what might be required to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system remains debatable the answer actually depends on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere not the level of emissions at given point in time ultimate goals then are typically expressed in terms of what concentration would be required to keep global warming below certain amount with certain probability 38 models are then used to assess what emission reductions would be required to keep concentrations below the target level developed nations that have agreed to the kyoto protocol have interim 20082012 greenhouse gas reduction targets based on reducing emissions from 1990 or adjusted baselines the united states has not had an emissions reduction targ et though the

analyzing and projecting the values and the rates of change for the variables population income intensity and emissions depend on the baseline the time period in question and assumptions about changes over time for the purpose of anal yzing us targets for greenhouse gas emissions one could assume the following business as usual projection from the baseline year of 2000 population grows at the annual rate of 09 for 20002010 and 08 for 20112025 39 per capita income grows at an annual rate of 20 t he 19802005 rate and intensity declines at the annual rate of 19 the 19902005 rate for ghg an interim target to reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be to stabilize them because the sum of the assumed rates of population growth and per capita gdp growth equals 28 per year after 2010 decline in the intensity rate of 28 would be necessary to stabilize total greenhouse emissions at the emissions level of the year that rate of decline went into effect compared with the recent annual rate of intensity decline of about 19 for the united states now consider goal of returning us greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 level of 1631 mmtce40 assuming that baseline trends continue41 through 2009 and that greenhouse intensity is then brought down what rate of intensity decline would be necessary to achieve the 1990 goal 38 see for example mgj den elzen and m meishausen meeting the eu 2 c

that we are looking at trends over an extended time these assumed average trends blur short term variations eg higher rates of intensity decline in 20042005 or possible variations from the recession

about 49 per year42 compared with the recent 19 per year beginning in 2010 to reach the level of 1636 in 2020 slightly over the target this represents substantial ongoing improvement in intensity from ghg intensity of 1533 mmtcemillionppp in 2005 to an intensity of 858 in 2020but perhaps not impossible when one considers that in 2005 frances intensity level was 807 over the longer term much more aggressive go als have been proposed typical goal for 2050 has been an 80 reduction in 1990 levels of ghg emissions43 which would limit us emissions to 326 mmtce again assuming population and pe r capita gdp grow from 2010 to 2050 at the average annual rates of 08 and 20 respectively then given the emission rate at the cap us greenhouse gas intensity in 2050 would be 74 mmtcemillionpppimplying an extremely lowcarbon economy or in terms of rate of change assuming current trends until 2010 intensity would have to decline over the next 40 years at an average rate of about 74 per year 44 to give perspective to rates of intensity decline consider an illustrative scenario in which for each of the 10 years 20162025 two 1000megawatt nuclear electrical generating facilities go into service or equivalent generating capacity based on renewables replacing existing coalfired facilities each plant would displace approximately 6 million tons of carbon per year when all 20 coalsupplanting plants were in service in 2025 they would be displacing 120 million tons of carbon per year all else equal displacing this much carbon would accelerate the rate of decline in intensity for 20162025 by about 05 per year this example which lowers emissions and intensity only incrementally shows that large declines in intensity would require multiple initiatives to meet the goal of reducing econom ywide emissions to 20 of 1990 levels by 2050 implies some mix of making tremendous gains in energy efficiency shifting to energy sources that emit virtually co 2 and developing the capacity to capture and sequester enormous amounts of co 2 g9g149g152g139g138g149g561g9g155g142g142g151g145g152g158g156g142g561g9g138g156g561g11g151g157g142g151g156g146g157g162g561 as has been noted world greenhouse gas

manufacture goods to transport people and goods etc to decouple those increases in the numbers of consumers and their consumption from increases in greenhouse gas emitting energy uses implies policies fostering greater efficiency in using energy andor use of nongreenhouse gasemitting forms of energy such as renewables or nuclear but greater efficiency ultimately reaches limits from the laws of physics alternative fuels run into the facts that in most places coal is the least expensive fuel for generating electricity and heat and oil is the least expensive fuel for powering transport beyond the energy sector moreover there are many other areas where policies may affect ghg emissions land use and agricultural and forestry policies can have direct implications for emissions and could reduce intensity the nonco 2 gases many of which pose particularly long term climate implications offer costeffective opportunities for reductions from certain industrial processes landfills and fuel production perhaps most importantly at the global scale the possibility exists for identifying and exploiting the leastexpensive opportunities for reducing greenhouse gases thereby increasing the efficiency with which economies use greenhouse gasemitting technologies this depends however on global instruments for accounting for and verifying such reductions reaching practical agreements on international mechanisms eg for carbon tax or capandtrade system to obtain economic efficiencies among nations in re ducing emissions requires divergent national goals to be focused on what is

intensity of emissions equation 1 together with the inexorable force of compounding growth rates over time equation 2 are inescapable conditions determining both the risks of climate change and the

challenges adopting and implementing policies and encouraging the development and use of technologies that emit lower levels of greenhouse gases and maintaining sufficiently high rate of intensity

in the generation of greenhouse gases 47 in ratifying the unfccc the united states agreed to several principles for achieving this objective including the following developed country parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof48 parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate prevent or minimized the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects49 parties have right to and should promote sustainable development climate change policies should take into account that economic development is essential for adopting measures to address climate change 50 the unfcccs linking of sustainable development and climate change mitigation reflects the perceived need to decouple economic development and growth from nonsustainable greenhouse gasemitting energy technologies as this report suggests an expanding population in many parts of the developing world is an important driver for economic growth as affirmed in the unfccc climate change policies are to take into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty51 economic development may reduce population pressure in the longterm but creates increasing demand for resources that employing current technologies contribute to greenhouse gas emissions although economies become more efficient over time those efficiencies have yet to overcome the combination of expanding population and growing economies without the intervention of governments satisfying the energy needs of dynamic economies is increasing the demand for coal and other fossil fuels for economic and other reasons coal is abundant available locally and is relatively inexpensive to meet the massive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the long term required by various stabilization scenarios would seem to require the development and deployment of commercially available technologies to shift economies substantively away from fossil fuels andor the largescale capture and sequestration of the emissions of co 2 from coal and other fossil fuels the unfccc recognizes the special difficulties of those countries especially developing countries whose economies 47 section 1602a 48 unfccc article 3 49 ibid 50 ibid 51 unfccc preamble

depend on developing sustainable alternativesboth in improving the efficiency of energy use and in moving the fuel mix toward less greenhouse gasemitting alternatives in the unfccc developed nations comm itted to taking the initiative by adopting national policies and taking corresponding measures on the mitigation of climate change that will demonstrate that developed countries are taking the lead in modifying longerterm trends in anthropogenic emissions consistent with the objective of the convention 53 such development paths are critical not only for any domestic program but also participation by developing countries in any global greenhouse gas stabilization program may be at least partially dependent on the availability and cost of such technologies as stated by the unfccc

commitments under the convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first

consumption would be broader one whether how and to what extent to use regulatory actions to change behaviors and to require technologies that increase energy efficiency or emit less greenhouse gases direct regulatory effort would be renewable power standard for electricitygenerating facilities which requires some specified portion of electric power to be generated by renewables such as water power solar or wind whether nuclear power might count is an open question heretofore especially in the united states regulatory efforts curtailing greenhouse gas emissions commonly originated in response to other objectives such as reducing healthdamaging air pollutants or enhancing energy security by fostering substitutes for imported oil in these cases reductions in greenhouse gases were coincidental regrets further coreduction opportunities remain eg methane from landfills however the objective of reducing greenhouse gases as the primary object of regulations is increasingly coming to the fore especially in some states 57 the technologypush side focuses on research and development it raises questions as to what rd programs should be supported at what levels over the shortto midterm how can existing technologies be made more sustainable how can energy and other resources be used more efficiently what alternatives can be pursued what are the relative federal and private roles in selecting and financing rd of specific technologies perhaps most important for the longer r what breakthrough research should be pursued over the past 100 years number of technological changes have occurred eg in nuclear power computing and communications that demonstrate the low success rate of predicting technological and societal changes far into the future at present at least two technological breakthrough possibilities can be discerned fusion power which conceivably could wean economies from fossil fuels and sequestration 58 which could capture and store carbon dioxideand perhaps even remove excess from the atmosphere other breakthroughs are surely possibleincluding serendipitous discoveries that cannot be conceived of now if the ultimate 2050 target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is as aggressive as 80 below 1990 levels as in some proposals then fundamentally at issue is whether the risks of climate change can be addressed only by incremental muddling through or whether some extraordinary aggressive effort is needed certainly there are many opportunities for incremental and iterative policies to reduce greenhouse gases to conserve energy to find alternative energy sources to make vehicles more energy efficient to enhance carbon sequestration through afforestation and refined cropping practices to deter deforestation and land use changes that increase co 2 emissions and so on the incremental nature of such response provides flexibility while time 57 see crs report rl33812 climate change action by states to address greenhouse gas emissions
