have revealed two decades worth of undecl ared nuclear activities in iran including uranium enrichment and plutonium sepa ration efforts iran agreed in 2003 to suspend sensitive activities in negotiations with germany france and the uk eu3 which broke down in august 2005 on september 24 2005 the iaea board of governors found iran to be in noncompliance with its nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt safeguards agreement and reported irans case to the security council in february 2006 the security council called upon iran to resuspe nd enrichment and reprocessing reconsider construction

sanctions may be under consideration this report will be updated as needed background iran has had nuclear program for close to 50 years beginning with research reactor purchased from the united states in 1959 the shahs plan to build 23 nuclear power reactors by the 1990s was regarded as gr andiose but not necessarily viewed as back door to nuclear weapons program po ssibly because iran did not then seek the technologies to enrich or reprocess its own fuel1 there were few suspicions of nuclear weapons program but these abat ed in the decade between the iranian 1979 revolution and the end of the iraniraq wa r both of which brought halt to nuclearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21592crs2 2 see statement by irans former foreign minister kamal kharra zi at httpwwwpbsorg newshourbbmiddle_eastjul

plans to construct seven nuclear power plants 1000 mw each by 2025 are still ambitious particularly for state with considerable oil and gas reserves2 iran argues as it did in the 1970s that rising domestic energy consumption should be met by nuclear power leaving oil and gas sales to gene rate foreign currency few observers believe that such an ambitious program is necessary or economic for iran and many question irans motives in developi ng uranium enrichment before even single power reactor is in operation iran has asserted repeatedly that its nuclear program is strictly peaceful stating in may 2003 that we consider the acquiring development and use of nuclear weapons inhuman immoral illegal and agai nst our basic principles they have place in irans defense doctrine3 iranian government spokesman g holam hussein elham said in july 2006 that the islamic republic will never produce weapons of mass destruction at the same time supreme leader ali khamanei said in november 2004 that iran would not give up its enrichment at any price and former president khatami stated in march 2005 that ending irans uranium enrichme nt program is completely unacceptable uranium enrichment can be used for both peaceful nuclear fuel and military nuclear weapons uses however two decades of cl andestine activities have raised questions about irans intentions and many have ca lled for iran to rebuild world confidence by refraining from enrichment and reprocessing perhaps indefinitely nonetheless the further iran proceeds down the path of enrichment the more difficult it will become to foreswear it if only for financial reasons what inspections revealed in 2002 the national council of resistance of iran ncr helped expose irans undeclared nuclear activities by providing in formation about nucl ear sites at natanz uranium enrichment and arak heavy wate r production three years of intensive inspections by the iaea revealed significant undeclared iranian efforts in uranium enrichment including centrifuge atomic vapor laser and mo lecular laser isotope separation techniques and separation of plutonium as well as undeclared imported material iranian officials have delaye d inspections changed explanations for discrepancies cleaned up facilities and in one case lavizanshian razed site4 according to iaea director general mohame d elbaradei iran tr ied to cover up many of their activities and they learned the hard way5 among other activities iran admitted in 2003 it conducted bench scale uranium conversion experiments in th 1990s required to be reporte d to the iaea and later admitted that it used for those experiments some safeguarded material that had been declared lost in other processes safeguards violation iranian officials told the

activities inspections revealed two enrichment plants at natanz pilotscale facility planne d to have 1000 centrifuges nd commercialscale plant under construction planned to have 50000 centr ifuges the pilotscale plant pfep started up in june 2003 only to shut down af ter iran suspended richment activities in december 2003 since february 2006 when ir an resumed enrichme ntrelated activities iran has tested small cascades 10 20 then 164 machines with uranium hexafluoride gas uf6 all under iaea safeguards8 the iaea has reported that iran has achieved maximum enrichment of 42 at pfep9 construction on the commercialscale plant fep was also suspended in 2003 although iran announced plans in april 2006 to install 3000 centrifuges in the commercial plan t by the end of the year it did not even meet third of that goal as of febr uary 2007 iran was operating two cascades under vacuum without feedstock and was in the process of installing another two cascades which would bring the number of centrifuges up to 656 at the point when iran introduces uf6 into the fep nuclear materi accountancy must begin the iaea has also told iran it must have remote monito ring equipment installe d before 500 centrifuges are operating in fep which iran has resisted10 few enrichment issues remain unresol ved the first is the source of highly enriched uranium heu particles at sites in iran iranian officials asserted that heu particles f ound at the natanz pilot plant in 2003 were contaminants from foreign centrifuge assemblies first clue revealing the pakistani aq khan network iran admitted to enriching uranium to just 12 while the particles sa mpled ranged from 36 to 70 u235 in october 2003 iranian official s admitted they tested centrifuges at the kalaye electric company using uf6 be tween 1998 and 2002 iaea report gov200615 reveals that components also came from another c ountry besides pakistan another unresolved issue is how far iran has pursued more sophisticated centrifuge and laser enrichment technology iran ad mitted in october 2003 that it also pursued laser enrichment program beginning in the 1970s and admitted that it possessed more advanced centrifuge designs p2 in janua ry 2004 such advanced designs could double irans enrichment capab ilities shortening the time potentially to bomb iran insists that it received centrifuge components after 1995 but admitted it received limited number of magnets for p2 centrifuges in 2003 and in april 2006 admitted to purchasing magnets suitable for the p2 design the iaea continues to investigate this issue plutoniumrelated activities in october 2003 iran revealed that it had conducted plutonium reprocessing experime nts in hot cell at the tehran nuclearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21592crs4 11 gov200615 12

center and estimated the amount separated as 200 micrograms the iaea calculated that more plutonium would have been produced about 100g and iran admitted in may 2004 that it understated the amount inspections also revealed that iran experimented between 1989 and 1993 on irradiating bismuth which can be used to produce polonium210 for civilian purposes for nuclear batteries or in conjunction with beryllium to create neutron initiator for nuclear weapon finally the heavy water program also has ra ised questions about irans intentions iran first told the iaea that it planned to export heavy water then suggested that the heavy water would be used as coolant nd moderator for planned ir40 reactor for research and development ra dioisotope production and traini ng however irans design information for the facility which omitte d necessary hot cell equipment for pr oducing radioisotopes conflicted w ith reported iranian efforts to import hot cell equipment construction of the ir40 reactor has conti nued despite the boards continued calls for halt although iranian officials predict th at the reactor will not be operational until 201111 the heavy water production plant repor tedly has been operational since 2004 and in august 2006 iranian officials nnounced they would double its production significance for nuclear weapons program iran is likely years away from producin g weaponsgrade plutonium or highly enriched uranium thendirector of national intelligence john negroponte told the senate select committee on intelligence on febr uary 2 2006 that we judge that tehran probably does not yet have nuclear w eapon and probably has not yet produced or acquired the fissile material according to one repor t the 2005 national intelligence estimate on iran assesses that it will be 10 years before iran has bomb12 that said iran has pursued three different methods of riching uranium and has experimented with separating plutonium suggesting steady accrua l of expertise in weaponsrelevant areas according to some observers if iran receive d the same nuclear weapon design that aq khan gave libya the remaining technical hurdle albeit the most difficult would be fissile material production on january 18 2007 thendni negroponte told members of congress that our assessment is that tehran is determined to develop nuclear weapons it is continuing to pursue uranium enrichment and has s hown more interest in protracting negotiations than reachin g an acceptable diplomatic solution calculations of nuclear weapons production are gene rally based on estimates of fissile material production one calculation is that cascade of 1000 p1 centrifuges could produce one bombs worth of heu 25 kg in 22 to 27 years and that cascade of 3000 p1 centrifuges could produce th same amount in 271330 days13 such an estimate assumes that iran has the necessary amount and quality of uranium hexafluoride to feed the enrichment plant the components fo r building 1000 or 3000 centrifuges and the engineering skills to keep such cascades operating with few mishaps in short iranshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21592crs5 14 infcirc648 communication dated 1 august 2005 recei ved from the permanent mission of the islamic republic of iran to the agency available at httpwwwiaeaorg 15 see httpwwwiaeaorgnewscenterstatementsddgs2006heinonen31012006pdf limited experience in enrichment so far should not be equated yet with an ability to operate an industrialscale enri chment plant for peaceful or weapons purposes negotiating with iran since 2003 negotiations with iran on its nuclear program have proceeded on two levels with iaea inspectors and at the ia ea board of governor s in vienna and with the european union foreign ministers know n as the eu3 of germany the uk and france in 2006 the eu3 were joined by ru ssia china and the united states after irans noncompliance was reported to the security council some observers may view the second nego tiating track as necessary because the iaea and board of governors failed to take decisive action against clear pattern of deception early on others may view it as necessary because of the potential danger of iran pulling out of the npt irans voluntary measures negotiated with the eu3 may have allowed iaea inspectors greater access than would otherwise be granted under irans comprehensive safeguards agreement but also may have left iran free to set the terms of engagement since irans concessions were voluntary and political while it is true that the eu3 have been unable to obtain irans agreement to permanent halt to uranium enrichment activities their key objective such an objective could not have been pursued by the iaea because that is not in its mandate within few months of irans voluntary mo ratorium there were signs of continued activities that called into question irans commitment although the november 2004 paris agreement clarified the terms of the mora torium by march 2005 iran proposed running its pilotscale enrichment facility which eu 3 negotiators rejected in april 2005 iran said that unless negotiations progressed it would start up its uranium conversion plant which it did in august 200514 following iranian president ahmadinejads inflammatory remarks at the september 2005 summit the iaea board voted on resolution gov200577 which found iran in noncomplia nce with its safeguards agreement specifically the board found that irans many failures and breaches of its obligations to comply with its npt safeguards agreem ent as detailed in gov200375 constitute noncompliance in the context of article xiic of the agencys statute for several months thereafter iran provided limited details on outstanding issues and discussed with russia an offer to conduct uranium enrichment on russian soil as an alternative to indigenous production in january 2006 iran abandoned its voluntary suspension of enrichmentrelated activities negotiations as well as the interim application of the additional protocol prompting an em ergency board meeting an iaea report prepared for the meeting linked for the first time khan network document in irans possession on uranium casting and machining to the fabrication of nuclear weapons components15 iran asserts that the khan ne twork provided the document on its own initiative nonetheless article ii of the npt obligates iran not to receive any

council consideration of irans npt noncompliance wto membership and an end to certain us sanctions to allow iran to purchase agricultu re appliances and boeing aircraft parts18 in return iran would suspend enrichment and reprocessingrelated activities resume implementation of the additiona l protocol and fully coopera with the iaea irans moratorium could be reviewed once several conditions had b

on iranians studying abroad in nuclear and missilerelated areas broader measures could include an arms embargo support for wto membership and general freeze on assets of iranian financial institutions since june 2006 the security council has demanded iranian compliance and transparency and iran has failed to respond the p5 discussed sanc tions through the fall and the security council ultimately adopted unscr 1737 on december 23 2006 which requires states to prevent the supply sale or transfer of equipment and technology that could contribute to enrichment reprocessing heavywate rrelated activitie s or missile delivery systems in iran and to freeze the funds of persons and entities involved in the nuclear and ballistic missile programs19 unscr 1737 gave iran another 60 days to comply which expired on february 21 2007 on february 22 2007 the iaea reported its inability to make further progress and hence its inability to verify the absence of undeclared nuclear material and
