determining what to run lecture given on 19 april 1962 thank you here we are second lecture and this is saint hill special briefing course 19 april ad 12 and were going to talk to you now about processes recommended recommended processes now i havent actually issued an authoritative statement on this recommended processes for some time and its about time that we did summary on this particular activity now youre always going to run into difficulty on an interpretation interpretation gives you lots of difficulty particularly if you do something else that isnt said but something that is apparently understood in the statement and nobody else understands it but that way and so forth but nevertheless in the absence of recommended procedure of course you could make lot of mistakes of one kind or another now ill tell you an optimum method of auditing pc more or less as of now theres some data through on this and ive inspected quite few cases in the last two or three months and several things show up now i told you that prepchecking we dropped prepchecking out and we only drop it out in the line of permanent gain see we dont rely on prepchecking for long permanent gain in the first place you could make long permanent gain perhaps with prepchecking if auditors would go deeply enough and it isnt that the prepchecking will not produce results its just that the auditor isnt producing long permanent gain with prepchecking nevertheless this does not drop prepchecking out of your lineup long way from it lets use prepchecking at the depth the auditors are using it and that theyre being successful with it now this is the basic formula on which i would audit pc today i would establish whether or not the pc was getting tone arm action and then would adjudicate my future course on that basis im not even telling you how you would have established this dont you see and get into 3d criss cross as soon as i was sure that the pc would get tone arm action and that his rudiments stayed in easily in other words id get on 3d criss cross as soon as i auditorily could see id get to it as soon as i could im talking now as though you were auditing pc in an hgc or in your own practice something or other thats the way im talking right now im not talking about necessarily how we would audit pc here or how you have to audit pc id establish this fact and if tone arm action was liberal and present i would get into 3d criss cross at once and sail from there doing just standard flawless 3d criss cross and i would get myself at least twenty lines and in case i forget to mention it 3d criss cross items are most beneficial apparently if opptermed at once in other words if you get line oppterm it so that you dont have lines without two items in other words dont keep letting them slide apparently this thing goes together better and runs better if its done this way that is almost an opinion dont you see i mean that it its better that way all right it can easily be done the other way but apparently its much easier on the pc gives the pc much better gains his attention is right there on half of it so therefore you can get the other half rather easily and so forth and itll probably save you auditing time make the pc more comfortable and there are apparently quite few advantages to doing this okay thats just as almost an aside but you get about twenty items twenty lines rather and then youve got twenty lines youve got forty items havent you so youd wind up with forty items now somewhere along this line with this many lines you would undoubtedly have reached practically every part and parcel of the bank one way or the other now id go back and get the third item for the lot by assessmentsee id just go over these twenty items id just read them off to the pc and see which was bouncing the hardest and i would oppterm it neglecting that one now id see which one was now bouncing the hardest and id oppterm that until i had line third rack for all of them see now ive got three for all see and then id get four for all then id get five for all you got the idea how it could go on certainly with that liberal spread i guarantee that along about this time youll be finding the pc thats very broad look in expectancy of what would be complete 3d criss cross itd get complete along about that time youd wind up youd wind up with crosscut saw and it opptermed timber and then you would get timber oppterming crosscut saw and everything would start to cone down to this is what you got and these were the items and the pc was being the crosscut saw and about that time hed exteriorize from the crosscut saw and hed be able to get into his body and the youve got various things that could go on from there dont you see but actually youre getting down what youre doing is looking for the thing which the pc has been and which he has been interiorizing into as see hes been this thing hes been this thing for ages and really its the first thing hes been shades of the rock see the rock was the first thing the pc had been you got the idea so of course if you get the thing first thing that the pc had obsessively been that is the last thing the pc will look at and exteriorize from now thats theoretical map of 3d criss cross without doing any auditing of the items now youll find that sooner or later your situation is going to change and your early items will deintensify theyll start to drop out and the bank starts to fall apart and things that were reading now arent reading you know you get that idea only your last lineup reads the early lineups longer read there isnt enough charge left in the bank to make them wiggle see now to do that i would use basically prehav the prehav assessment and lines from the prehav assessment i would use all the suppressor lines pardon then id use the flows lines and then i would use the suppressor lines any other kind of line that seemed to have worked out as being good line id just get good sampling of others lot but they would be dominantly suppressors flows and prehavs see theyd mostly amount to those three lines those three types of line thatd give you lots thatd give you lots to work on i can fully expect that ill come up with some even hotter lines you know that you say list this and the pc disintegrates in the chair but nothing would change with regard to the procedure the procedure is the same what youre doing is the same and thats all standard see where you get your lines from this could remain bit of variable without disturbing the whole lineup at all all right now thats thats like this see we set the pc down and we look it over and the needles live and it isnt scratchy and the pcs rudiments go in and we ask him some questions about this and that and he gets some tone arm action and we say fine and we just go right into listing and were off to the races and we get twenty lines and oppterm each line that we get and that would be the way we would clear somebody see all right thats fine thats the way id do it id make the test to find out which way this thing went i wouldnt particularly depend on profiles and i wouldnt depend on anything else id just want to see that tone arm wiggle now im not telling you at this time the best method of finding out if the tone arm will wiggle because i wouldnt i dont know it i havent investigated it on whole bunch of pcs that have never been audited before and found what was the best way to test whether or not the line was wiggling but fortunately youre not faced with that very often you generally have bit of history on this pc that youre doing and if you dont have bit of history on the pc why you could do several things you could give him start to give him problems intensive or something like that and youre going to find out if that thing is going to move see anything that will establish whether or not the rudiments can be put in and the tone arm will move see any way you could establish that would tell you thats fine well go on and do 3d criss cross or now lets get to the crux of the situation heh well do something else heheh it looks something on the order of fixed beam it sits there and it goes beautifully from 475 to 50 and drops all the way back to 475 and then goes all the way up to 50 and this continues on but as the session progresses the tone arm gradually drifts down so that its reading bit lower but at time is it moving do you see how youd get the idea then that movement is different than drifting well it is slightly constantly rising needle for instance will get you constantly increasing tone arm you see you can also have constantly dropping needles it isnt motion its just gradual theres nothing happening you might say its tone arm action without needle read if you can imagine this thing these things will drift during the course of two hour session why the pc drifts down one division of the tone arm scale or he drifts up thats not what you would call motion motion is regulated every twenty minutes and is usually in different directions its going up and its going down and its going up little and its going down lot and then its going up lot and down little you got the idea its not just falling falling falling and then it finally this falling needle finally just sits and if you were to continue the session to four hours it would have sat the last two hours or something like that do you see this is needle behavior tone arm behavior the you can tell you can tell it takes little bit of observation you can tell whether or not somebody is going to have moving tone arm whether their tone arm moves its not very hard thing to figure out you get used to it you observe it you say thats it thats moving tone arm and that isnt thats all all right what happens what do you do well frankly its not enough to just give it up i wouldnt say well hes had it because we have much better solution and thats combination and an alternation between prepchecking and cchs now youve got cchs which all by themselves if you observe the pcs physical origin and take it up as an origination and query it you can make mistakes on that you know i found out an auditor sometimes cant see the pcs physical origins you know the pcs head falls off and rolls across the floor and the auditor says give that hand so there is vast shift of case while doing the cchs because the auditor isnt really doing the cchs you know he isnt taking up the physical origins of the pc and isnt getting the pc exteriorized out of these little somatics and so forth isnt doing good job we feel certain delicacy right now because everybody isnt doing this uniformly all that well you know its something you got to get the hang of im sure you can learn how to do it but you havent all got the hang of it yet by long ways but even if you didnt have the hang of it you would eventually win you get the idea so were operating kind of with leadpipe cinch here if you combine it with prepchecking now if you combine good cchs with good prepchecking man youve got winner see but if you combine indifferent prepchecking providing you miss withholds providing you dont run up bunch of missed withholds on the case and indifferent cchs you still got winner thats what weve got to count on see we unfortunately cant count on perfection all along the line see even indifferent 3d criss cross gets you some gains and similarly in nottooperfect and nottoosearching prepchecking plus not toogood cch combination will still get you wins in other words you we havent got losing processes here which is good thing but it looks to that the cchs have to be handled as cchs and prepchecking has to be handled as prepchecking and you dont combine session of cch and prepchecking it looks to like this is clumsy this apparently is clumsy now person who cant asis things because he is being it all you know hes being the whole universe and he cant asis anything it looks to like this person really isnt going to asis very much on the prepcheck and at the same time isnt going to asis very much on the cchs but both of them will have some tiny workability and they have greater workability if interplayed now you neednt be so mathematical as prepcheck one session cch one session prepcheck one session cch one session you see because this ratio would vary from pc to pc and therefore you cant lay it down as textbook solution beyond this just what can we get done in session thats the whole thing what can we get done in session of course itd be terrible mistake to prepcheck remember now im talking about somebody you would audit not here just you know you sat down and you handed them the cans and you started the session and you did something whatever to establish what kind of tone arm action they were going to have even get their past history and illnesses see that will establish tone arm action you know do your preclear assessment form and keep good record of the ta action on it whatever youre going to do and you said this isnt much man this isnt very much when were talking about the past and his thinkingness it isnt very much now you might get good ta action as long as he was talking straight to you and you were doing some kind of twoway comm basis where he was trying to tell you about something and his attention was totally on you you might get more ta action than you really deserve to get so the ta action test would have to be taken on the basis of think its ta action while he is thinking of something not ta action while he is talking to you see so your ta action while he is talking to you doesnt mean thing except he might have to have cchs run see but ta action while youre asking him to think thats the important action you know how many times have you been sick in your life you know now he says soandso and soandso and soandso and youve been getting this kind of ta action see youve been saying well hes been saying oh well uh lets see would i would i mind talking to you uh well i i guess i could talk to you all right you you seem to be you seem to be very very sympathetic the attention square on you all right that tone arm action do hardly bother you can note it down for the record but dont take that as your adjudication now lets see what uh what what have you how many brothers and sisters do you have see well brothers and sisters yes brothers and sisters brothers and sisters yes uh brothers and sisters oh you want to know how many brothers and sisters i have lets see hmmmm brothers and sisters hmmm hmmm hmmmhmmmm brothers and sisters well i havent got any well all right well how many times have you been sick in your life well lets see been sick in my life sick in my life mmmmmmm been sick oh been sick long time ago mmmmmmm im very healthy ive never been sick in my whole life all right well good now what goals have you had and so on well oh ive had quite few goals not not many recently it doesnt matter damn what hes saying watch that tone arm you see when youre asking him introverted questions thats what will count and man if you didnt get any more than that 30 to 325 to back to 30 again or if it was just big drift up with confront you know just going up up up up the more you ask him about think you know and so on and you notice you have to keep setting the thing and so on twenty minutes have gone by youve gotten 775 in twenty minutes you betcha you have its rising and hes getting out of there hes just gone past arcturus by about now and you audit him for an hour and hes up to here someplace and so forth and gradually comes on up see thats not tone arm action thats drift see tone arm action is this way drift is just consistently up or consistently down see all right you would say brother weve had it thats what youd say because you know several things one you know the rudiments are not going to stay in thats what you know and if you have to put them in my god its like driving stakes with candy stick you know trying to lay railroad rails you know with chewing gum pssssst you know youve had it there see so youre not getting adequate tone arm motion and so you would say that we is going to do two things with this pc were not necessarily going to go off and do nothing but slog cchs were going to do cchs and prepchecking on this pc thats what we is gonna do and were going to do cchs and then were going to prepcheck in the direction of trying to get his rudiments in and session of cchs is session of cchs and session of prepchecking is session of prepchecking and neither the twain shall mix i told you little while ago i didnt know anything much about this well ive seen little bit about it i havent gain havent gained an awful lot of information concerning it but it just looks clumsy i dont know that its bad but i have found out that ta action on the cchs at first test appears to be very good in spite of the fact that ta action is probably lessened by the tester jumping in with the emeter every few minutes apparently its very good on case that ordinarily wouldnt get much ta action we havent finished that study either but the first indicators on the thing are that its very good your ta action on the cchs you dont get chance to observe it you know because you havent got long enough lead the auditor down in joburg who kept coming back to the dir mat and asking for longer lead on his cans finally they blew up longer lead what the hell how many feet do you need you know well i have to have enough feet because its going to have to reach across the room you know and so forth when the pcs doing 8c he moves across the room back and forth nobody up to this time nobody had ever told this poor auditor that he didnt use these see hed just assumed that if it was auditing you had an emeter and that was all there was to it they sure were baffled around there while he was asking for these longer and longer cords though imagine it was embarrassing when the pc did turnaround you know wrap them around but anyway anyway this indicator is here weve been just handing pair of electrodes and getting the tone arm position of the pc and then he goes on for awhile and weve been doing it against an arbitrary time period you see every three minutes i think it was and whatever the pc was being made to do we just interrupted and handed him the electrodes and the ta actions pretty good well thats fine thats fine but i have found this out about the cchs that if cchs turn into wrestling match the auditors missed withhold simple interesting thing to find out isnt it if it becomes wrestling match the auditors missed withhold well so there you are how are you going to get withhold off pc who is doing the cchs well youre going to do it by doing the cchs if it becomes wrestling match in that session and you go out of twoway comm with the pc and you cant talk him back into it again its wrestling match thats all you finish up the session and then you go and next session why youre going to do prepchecking particularly on the zero question have i missed withhold on you or has withhold been missed on you and you go ahead and straighten this out now supposing you cant straighten this out in one session supposing youre leaving him way down the track and all hung up well then you of course do prepchecking for two sessions and then if youre got the meter cord all wrapped around your neck by that time and you cant get out of that and it just seems like youre hanging yourself youd better go back to the cchs if you didnt clean it up in two i wouldnt go running marathon here i think the zenith would be about three before you went back to the cchs because youre handling somebody who probably has poor ability to asis see and you can bury him deep man you can really push him down for the third time by doing or making him think think think because he isnt getting much tone arm action of course youre prepchecking against tone arm action to amount to anything so youre liable to be in trouble but nevertheless youll pick up enough missed withholds so he isnt all that mad at you and hell make enough gain toward present time in the cch next cch session you run on him so he isnt all that out of present time and that seems to be going along very smoothly and now your cchs seem to be pretty well flattened out on this pc youve done maybe three sessions and they all appear to be kind of little bit more even you know and so forth and it looks like you get minimal change right so lets go back to prepchecking see lets prepcheck him and we get something little bit flat feeling little bit easier about it and so forth actually running the prepcheck through change to nochange same way lets go back to cchs after that optimum would be of course to follow the auditors code and to prepcheck him as long as he was producing change to cch him as long as he was producing change and if you get too involved or too upset on making up your mind when well just follow the auditors code on it and itll be all right that by the way may not be optimum you may be burning more time up than you should be burning up but in the final analysis that would get you there you see because if you did that to in extremis you might find yourself doing 60 hours of cchs and then 50 hours of prepchecking whereas you might have been able to make the whole gain in 50 hours of prepchecking and cchs instead of the 110 you see it might be that much faster in the first place youre treating them independently not as two different processes i say the theoretical method of doing it would be to flatten the cch approach and then flatten the prepcheck approach and then flatten the cch approach and so forth and if youre if you get too much in quandary about what to do with the pc fall back on that one see but you could also run it this way pick up gain heres another way to adjudicate it rather than arbitrary times pick up gain on the pc in prepchecking and be happy about it and pick up gain on the cchs and be happy about it and pick up gain on the prepchecking and be happy about it making whole session do you see not running half and half but making whole session if youre going to cch do whole session of cch you see if youre going to prepcheck do whole session of prepchecking but try to bring the thing up to gain and i dont care if it tapers off and hes kind of restimulated at the end of the session or not but nevertheless he had win in that session see thats fine well lets do some cchs in other words gain gain gain gain you know alternate on the thing youll probably get it fine you find yourself sometimes doing two consecutive sessions of cchs and three consecutive sessions of prepchecking and one session of cchs and two sessions of prepchecking and you see how what i mean but youre processing him toward gain and win now what direction are you processing him youre actually processing him into rudiments in and that is your goal now if you get rudiments in youre going to get tone arm action and thats the secret of it all not rudiments beaten in you see youre not going to get tone arm action but if the rudiments are actually in and hes really happy about being audited and hes happy about the environment and hes happy to have you as the auditor and so forth youre going to get tone arm action because youre not getting tone arm action because the rudiments arent in his rudiments arent in in life he cant talk to people he cant including you and he cant be in room he cant including this one see and people have missed withholds on him they have not only his boss and his wife but you too see and also the cops sometimes in other words the rudiments of life are so wildly out that the person never really can slide into session because theyre so out in life so of course he cant ever relax enough to asis anything you know he cant look at anything else except what hes in hes walking around in mass and hes so fixedly and so constantly in this mass that only the problems of the mass are the problems of life the problems of life are the problems of the mass dont you see he has certain number of problems dogs bite you wives desert you walls fall on you you see and youve got to tell halftruths you see because untruths are vital to the situation you see and if you dont impress everybody with the fact that youre sane why theyll know youre crazy see and this is life to him and his difficulties are simply long parade of out rudiments see they arent just out in the session theyre out on the street and on the bus and at work and at home and so forth you see theyre just out well itd be pretty good trick if you got the environment quite real to him and got him feeling friendly toward people and so forth and youd say gee you know youve just posed really the highest goal actually higher than any psychotherapy has ever had on this planet theyve never really had that much goal get rid of all of these bugs crawling on you see thats about the highest goal psychotherapy has ever had you know hell go on believing his wife is putting poison in his coffee and that sort of thing is just normal course of human events you see but to not only get the bugs off of him but to get the poison out of his coffee you see and let him actually sit down to table you see instead of having to stand up at buffet and few little things like that you never thought about this that would be awfully high for formal psychotherapy and now were posing this that rooms environment people hes going to be comfortable in all of this hes going to be comfortable in space and hes not going to be bugged up all the time every time he goes anyplace and hes going to feel all right in crowds and hey wait minute were getting up to higher goal than psychotherapy has ever had arent we and yet you know you could do all those things with the routine im laying down for you here you see the cch and the prepcheck you could accomplish them all not even going very drastically into the case just doing it by textbook take your prepchecking and take your zero questions are simply your rudiments questions and any subdivision of them that you happen to care about as your zero and then actually find withhold before you go asking him the what and then ask the what as chain and clean it as chain youll find out this will work pretty good if you do it that way see im not asking you to do some extraordinary piece of this and that now of course this person is not going to have very much tone arm action the first time you do the prepchecking on him its going to be very small but youre going to follow this with the cchs youre going to put in that first rudiment with the cchs but good going to get him used to his environment you see thats one of the rudiments so you got to get that one going and then youre going to get these other zero questions sort of cleaned up particularly missed withholds but missed withholds is not really part of the rudiments missed withholds is actually something you introduce in at odd intervals now lets look at this lets look at this we take pc we dont care if hes been audited or not been audited except for this if hes been audited and youve got accurate session sheets on him you can look at these session sheets and make guess at whether or not he gets tone arm action on think processes and if he doesnt get lots of tone arm action on think processes we know where this case has got to go this case is going to go into prepchecking and cchs right away but when i say lots of tone arm action i mean lots of tone arm action this tone arm action is good see what i mean he really got good nice tone arm action monkey business about this thing you see its not mediumly fair tone arm action im now talking about you see 05 divisions oh by the way in doing his past 3d criss cross he might have had times lets say in the fourteen sessions he has had on 3d criss cross that you have record of in eleven of these sessions he got tone arm action and to amount to anything but in three he got good tone arm action cchs and prepchecking for that boy he got eleven sessions with good tone arm action and three sessions with tone arm action probably continue him on 3d criss cross and see how it goes you see because you sometimes have cases hanging on certain line the line youre taking it inopportunely theres motion on that particular line to amount to anything its unreal to the pc and so forth that could cause minimal tone arm action but of course this wouldnt happen very often would it so just to the degree that that wouldnt happen very often thats acceptable action for 3d criss cross you see eleven in which he got fine tone arm action and three in which his tone arm action wasnt worth looking at see well thats probably 3d criss cross lets keep it going for sure 3d criss cross fourteen sessions he has had with lovely tone arm action on all fourteen obviously we do the fifteenth session with 3d criss cross you see the 100 percent would be the lead pipe cinch now this is this is adjudications of what you run but im talking now about somebody that you would run where you are are out just auditing pc pc comes in and signs up you turn him over to staff auditor you expect the staff auditor to audit this on him see youd adjudicate this youd see the pc had tone arm action worth beans now youd say well lets get real clever here and lets pull this pc up first by lifting the right side and then by lifting the left side and then by lifting the right side and left side even though its one millimeter at time were going to lift it in somewhat balanced fashion were going to get the think rudiments in balanced against the environmental rudiments see exterior rudiments are going to be balanced against the interior rudiments see extrovertintrovert the old formula of acc 1 and they pull up kind of equally and youll find out that theyll both come up then of course his havingness will run down if you make him think only and his rudiments will start going out more and more furiously you realize that the more pc is having difficulty the more difficulty he has thats hell of thing but it actually snowballs like mad you realize the longer it takes you to get 3d criss cross item the longer its going to take you to get 3d criss cross item see the longer the longer works in reverse the shorter the shorter but the longer it takes you to do 3d criss cross item and the longer it takes you to get an overt or something like that in prepchecking the less likely you are to get it and the more likely you are to have the rudiments go out see the longer it takes the more the rudiments go out is what this is all about thats because length drifts in the direction of auditing you see its more auditing to get an item week you see than to get an item month thats obvious isnt it well if you look at an item month session going unthinkably enough there have been them an item month session you never saw such cats breakfast in your life its the most ghastly looking mess down toward the end of the last two three about the last two weeks or ten days of that the pcs the auditor knows the pcs rudiments are out because the pc has picked up the chair and splintered it with crash all over the auditors head you see hed say oh oh the rudiments are out its fact the longer it takes the longer the more they go out and the more violently they go out in other words the longer it takes the less chance you have of getting it this will become recognizable to you some day youll get big reality on this thing you all of sudden do an item up in three days theyre all items with long lists yes it takes awhile to do an item in long list and so on pcs also go bang and other things happen and the bottom goes out from underneath them on some things and so forth all in the line it slows it down you see well when this stretches out to couple of weeks youre already in bad trouble thats getting nasty thats getting real bad because from here on after id say eight or nine days the rudiments just go progressively out because youre approaching auditing see and rudiments are most out on the least auditing and theyre most in on the most auditing that is to say the more the pc feels hes getting audited the less the rudiments will go out and as session approaches this noauditing thing the auditors sitting there and the pcs sitting there but nothings getting done and as the session begins to approach that reductio ad absurdum of auditing why of course similarly the rudiments go out in proportion to auditing see until the rudiments are go more wildly out than they are out in the normal operating life of the pc see you know session can go rudiments in session can go further out than they are out on the person you see the degree of responsibility hes accepting for an environment shows that he has to put on good show while hes walking down the street and riding in the bus and that sort of thing and in session he hasnt got that degree of responsibility restraining him and the rudiments go out further than theyre out now if you inspect this carefully youll see then that there is every reason to audit in the direction of wins the pc at first is giving you extraordinary and extravagant goals you can almost tell the state of pc by reading the goals he sets up for the session not the goals for life or livingness the goals he sets up as his session goals sets up as session goal well id like to be able to make the sun spin faster yeah thats his session goal that isnt an lol its session goal perfectly all right as an lol but thats what hes set up for the auditor to do now this pc has got the overt of setting up loses for the auditor do you see that and the pc equally will absorb loses from the auditor see its the overtmotivator sequence at play not that he has set up lose for the auditor but that he would as represented in the goals you see shows that you have somebody who is just sponge for loses now we get down to the feather brush for the win this person would at first believe that good effect you see would be the basis of the house dropped on his head then hed know that happened and he actually will beg to have the house dropped on his head he wants the big effect he wants it all to happen now got to be instantaneous and its got to be big and do you know when you get pc like that the only effect he can have is the feather brushed gently back of his head not in front of his face but brushed gently back of his head he can he can just get the effect of the wind of that feather and that will be all the effect he can have but the funny part of it is he can have that effect in other words the worse off the pc the tinier the gradient of win and youre actually raising him up little by little and be perfectly content to raise him up little by little because youd be surprised what they consider wins but they wont actually you could change the pc that he had the form of an angel wings complete halo in neon just give him an utter complete change in the session where he was in terrific euphoria everything else pc would never find out about it you think im kidding but the pc couldnt have that much effect the pcs told you that he has to have that much effect dont ever buy it because he couldnt have it pc at the end of the session is absolutely glowing he has some feeling in his elbow and he hasnt had any feeling in his elbow for some time feeling in his elbow he can feel his fingers on his elbow terrific its big gain youd be surprised terrific gain he has actually remembered back below the age of twelve he has actually remembered something before the age of twelve terrific win of course he tells you he wants to clear up the whole track in just this session he cant have that effect just the fact that he has said that hes got to have that in this session tells you he cant have it as an effect its before the age of twelve and he finally remembers car that his father had when he was eight and he comes out at the end of that session prepcheck session absolutely glowing marvelous session you see you you were trying to find missed withhold on him you know you were trying to get something done its that little tiny effect but he could have that effect ah hes winning its all confidence confidence confidence and if you continue to be consistent and not surrender to this demand for the tremendous effect and go on and get give the pc the effects you know the pc can have and go on and give the pc his wins on the environment and go on and give the pc his wins in his thinkingness why man theyll come up by those tiny little gradients millimeter on the right and millimeter on the left millimeter on the right and thats how you build the empire state building youve got to put up one block at time pc comes in and says i want this building sitting here 13764 feet and 3 inches high in this session and you get broom and you sweep off one corner of one sidewalk block and he says what do you know maybe someday there will be building here he didnt ever think so before all right so the best adjudication is win on the one win on the other one win on the one win on the other one now the worse off person is the longer its going to take to get win but i sure wouldnt try to prepcheck the pc session after session after session and then cch him session after session after session see i wouldnt stretch it out real long id settle for little tiny wins you know and it might be amount to session of prepchecking to session of cchs or session of prepchecking to three sessions of cchs or two sessions of prepchecking to one session of the cchs you see thats what it would maybe settle down to but it would be what it would be for that pc youd see these little wins stacking up next thing you know theres two things going to happen the pcs going to get tremendous confidence in his auditor if his auditor is consistent hes going to get tremendous confidence in this auditor and then youre going to see tone arm action because hes going to get confidence in his environment hes going to get some hope that something can happen what youve done actually is sell him some hope done more than that he sees that the auditors consistent he sees the environment doesnt all of sudden go out of plumb this pcs been expecting all of his life for all the corners of the room you see to get into rhomboid tetrascrewdron and he knows that it probably wont happen as long as the auditors there whatever it is you build this little thing up stack by stack by stack and the next thing you know why your pc has got enough confidence when you see hes got enough confidence hell actually start to look around he will see that he doesnt have to be all of the things he is being in order to survive that he can look at one of them see out of the 8000000 things he is being he can now look at one while being only 7999999 things you see that moment you will start to see tone arm action see your tone arm action occurs when hes able to observe hell find out that its safe to look at the auditor so youll see tone arm action this isnt as isnt either difficult nor complicated and you can make it easily much more difficult and much more complicated than it actually is because the processes youre using are absolute killers i mean prepchecking just used as prepchecking i mean i mean youre all youre going to use it for is to build up little bit of confidence of talking to you about his difficulties thing is totally capable if you dug deep enough and so forth of practically resolving his case and youre going to use it to straighten it up so he can talk to you about his difficulties huh and the cchs which can blow psychotic straight through electric shocks and bring him up the other side bright and smiling and so forth youre going to use them so that they can tolerate the auditing room that isnt asking very much of the process is it something like shooting grasshoppers with atom bombs you see and all you have to do is do the processes right now in this particular class we have not had the consistent case win going up the line that we had while we were doing lot of prepchecking see we were getting more gain proportionately while we were doing quite bit of prepchecking theres two reasons for that prepchecking gave the auditors great deal of experience with the emeter and getting rudiments in it had that virtue as training mechanism and it also tended to give the pcs lot of wins of the very small win nature that they could accept now youre running into the difficulty that the pc doing the cchs is getting his rudiments out so you better fill that gap with the prepchecking that isnt just for training reasons thats for the cases reason dont you see now how often you prepcheck this pc and how often you do cchs on this pc on this course we wont adjudicate totally at this moment but the auditors suggestions on any particular pc he or she is auditing you see are definitely invited on the auditors report what they think they ought to be doing next be monitored perhaps by space by room tend to get routinized more than it ordinarily would be the reason we get off of that sort of thing is we like to have unit for what is going on we like to have cch unit and we like to have prepchecking unit and we like to have 3d criss cross unit dont you see but the difficulties of this is is some people are all ready to do as cases 3d criss cross and some people are all ready to grind along you see on on prepcheckcch routine of some kind or another if we could just get this persons missed withholds off on the number of things which theyve done to pcs you see and other auditors have missed on them hed straighten out and run like bird you see on the cchs or something you know its the case puttogether or hell actually straighten out and run like bird on 3d criss cross so you cant have total relaxation of this thing because all auditors have to have some reality on cchs and 3d and prepchecking as well as 3d criss cross you see youre going to run into tougher cases off this course than you will find on it so therefore therefore its actually comprised of two auditing units and the two auditing units consist of the cchprepcheck unit and the 3d criss cross unit so that people are can be in those grades and pushed from one to the other and regardless of whether they had tone arm action or not could be expected to find themselves in the prepcheckcch unit early in their trainings now what would happen if pc went all to pieces on 3d criss cross and we got tone arm action they were all tied up and we didnt know which end this thing was going we couldnt keep the rudiments in this would be in your own practice or here in this unit so forth the only one thing that you could do with him is put him back on the other routine isnt that right you could transfer these things around but if you remember the lectures on interiorexterior introvert extrovert and so forth you will see that there is good reason in theory and apparently in practice here to use the cchs and prepchecking as pair theres good reason to do this and i think it would speed up the progress considerably regardless how its used on this unit regardless of what youd walk into on this unit in this particular direction that is at the moment how i would recommend that pc be processed in an hgc thats without any training considerations involved without any auditor skill considerations involved if we had all that perfect and set up i would see that pcs were audited just the way i have described in this lecture okay thank you
