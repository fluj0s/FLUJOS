june 2003 confirms that this tender was cancelled 11 when asked about the reason for the cancellatio n the procurement officer 1 stated to the itf that the technical specifications for the first tender were taken from catalogue of certain producer which offer ed those machines as result of which it predetermined the winner heshe added that machinery specified was of the most expensive type see below allegation 2 12 the maintenance official and member of the eval uation committee when asked the same question stated that the first tender was cancelled due to the fact that the procurement officer 1 indicated there had been proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines in the bids submit ted however heshe added that from hisher knowledge at least two of the com panies had included proper description of the cabins in their bid documents 4 13 an engineer at the pristina airport told the i tf that the airport requested cleaning machines with cabins in order that cleanin g could be carried out in different weather conditions however the bidders did not include the cabin in their bids heshe did not indicate that two bidder s included proper description in their bid documents 14 in the light of the evidence provided and deta iled below the itf does not find that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by companies submitting bids in the first tender allegation 2 first tender it is alleged that tender specifications for both tenders the cleaning machines were taken from the brochure of one of the companies sub mitting tender thereby giving it an unfair advantage in the tender process 15 the person responsible for drawing up the speci fications for the both tenders was the engineer at the pristina airport who confirmed in interview that heshe had been asked to draw up the specifications by the mem ber of the evaluation committee heshe also confirmed that the member of the evaluation committee provided him with signed photocopies from the broch ure of vendor 1 in order to assist him in drawing up the specifications the gineer at the pristina airport added that heshe used them as basis for the tech nical specifications the itf located draft of an undated handwritten note from the engineer at the pristina airport to the kta divisional manager which confir ms that heshe used the photocopies from the brochure to assist him in draw ing up the technical specifications for the cleaning machines the membe r of the evaluation committee confirmed to the itf that heshe handed t he signed pages to the engineer at the pristina airport to assist in the p reparation of the technical specifications for the cleaning machines 16 the engineer at the pristina airport and the mber of the evaluation committee were asked in interview whether they were aware of the provision of article 15 of financial administration instruction 21999 an d in particular articles 151 and 154 the engineer at the pristina airport indicat ed that heshe worked on the general principle set out in article 151 but had not seen article 154 whilst the chairman of the evaluation committee appeared to be ignorant of article 15 altogether second tender 17 bid evaluation report dated 30 june 2003 indi cates that second tender exercise was undertaken following the cancellation of the first one 18 pristina airport procurement officer 2 in the s econd tender indicated that although procurement officer 1 published the tender procurement officer 2 did the bid opening and was the member of the evaluatio n committee this is confirmed in memorandum from procurement officer 2 to the peap official 5 dated 9 july 2003 which identifies the evaluation committee members and in an itf interview with procurement officer 2 the peap official did not refer to procurement officer 2 or the second tender evaluati on committee in hisher interview 19 procurement officer 2 added that the evaluation committee chose vendor 2 however after heshe had drafted the contract and letter of acceptance for signature heshe was instructed by the airport man agement although heshe did not state by whom to put it on hold until the tech nical evaluation committee and airport management had organised meeting with the procurement officer 1 20 according to procurement officer 2 the reason for the meeting was due to concerns that the winning bid was the second most xpensive and doubts that the technical specifications had given an unfair ad vantage to one company 21 an examination of the technical evaluation repo rt and vendor 2s bid documentation suggests that the specification produ ced by vendor 2 was very similar to the specification requirement although there is evidence that it was provided with the technical specifications in advan ce in addition vendor 1 the company from whose brochure the specifications were taken did not submit bid 22 an internet search indicates vendor 1 is the cond largest producer of industrial cleaning machines in one united nations member stat being founded in 1966 it went into insolvency in 2002 and was bought by mu ltinational company an internet search of its directors does not indicate any connection with vendor 2 there is also indication that vendor 2 is connec ted to the multinational company 23 the engineer at the pristina airport in interv iew with the itf also stated that the evaluation committee had raised doubts as to whethe r it would be worthwhile purchasing the cleaning machines which whilst meet ing the specification criteria came at high price iv findings of fact 24 the first tender for cleaning machines was canc elled due to alleged deficiencies in the description of the cabins for the cleaning m achines in the bids submitted and the fact that brochure from the vendor 1 was used in the preparation of the technical specifications for the cleaning machines this gave rise to concerns that the technical specifications had given an unfair ad vantage to one company namely vendor 1 25 the second tender was not awarded due to concer ns that the technical specifications produced from the brochure of vendor 1 had given an unfair advantage to one company and doubts as to the high purchase cost of the cleaning machines which met the specification crite ria 6 v conclusions 26 on the available information the decision lead ing to the cancellation of the first tender was correct since concerns had been raised concerning both the descriptions of the machines to be purchased and th fact that brochure from vendor 1 was used in the preparation of the technic specifications for the cleaning machines this gave rise to concerns that the technical specifications had given an unfair advantage to one company in bre ach of article 151 of unmik finance administrative instruction 19992 on public procurement using kosovo consolidated budget funds 27 the reasons for the second tender not proceedin g appear to be well founded if concerns were expressed over the offer price and th technical specification however there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether in this instance the use of technical specifications from particular c ompany brochure was deliberate attempt to corrupt the tender process or due to ignorance of the regulations vi recommendation 28 based on the above information the itf recomm ends that unmik refer this report to the dsrsg pillar iv for any action deeme d appropriate with regard to ensuring that staff involved in preparing tenders d not utilise technical specifications that would give an unfair advantage to individual companies in the course of subsequent tender exercises iv0428001
