spending at the time escalating health care and health insurance costs declining numbers of individuals with private coverage and state experimentation and innovation spurred the federal debate reforming the oneseventh of the us economy devoted to health care would have been small feat however and despite considerable efforts by the 102nd and 103rd congresses comprehensive health insurance reform did not succeed support for the health security act began to decline well before its formal consideration was complete among the concerns raised were the non transparent process under which the plan was developed and the government involvement that would result from its implementation1 many of the bills considered after hr 3600 were rejected for not extending coverage far enough among the uninsured today similar conditions may be setting the stage for reconsideration of major health insurance reform while in the midst of recession the costs of health insurance and health care services are consuming growing portion of workers compensation and the percentage of individuals with jobbased coverage is declining states ar innovating and experimenting providing useful trials and errors to

broad term that could potentially span large range of policy options all of which have their own inherent st rengths and weaknesses some health insurance reform bills address discrete health insurance pr oblem or issue such as expanding public health insurance coverage for uninsured children or reducing the number of costly state mandates on private health insurance plans at the opposite end of the

simple yet comprehensive discussion of all of the important options challenging other fundamental differences separating health insurance reform approaches include different objectives of reforms and different priorities among important stakeholders g6g146g143g143g142g155g142g151g157g561g17g139g147g142g140g157g146g159g142g156g561 health insurance reform bills introduced in the 110th congress have surprisingly different primary objectives which can include the following reducing the number of people without health insurance most health insurance reforms seek to improve access to needed medical care in the united states access to great deal of expensive medical care is dependent on whether an individual has health insurance reducing the reliance on health insurance for at least some portion of needed medical care number of bills reflect the position that part of the insurance problem in the united states is that people have too much of itthat the presence of insurance has desensitized americans to the cost of health care services allowing both the demand for and the prices of medical care whether necessary or unnecessary to grow too quickly these bills include provisions intended to encourage costconsciousness in individuals choices of health insurance and health care and include group of approaches sometimes referred to as promoting consumer directed health care 2 reducing the cost of health insurance some advocates of reform believe that the rising cost of health insurance must be addressed before other problems can be dealt with their reform approaches reflect the belief that more people will purchase insurance once more affordable plans are available thus they assert reducing the number of uninsured is secondary to reducing the cost of the insurance costreducing approaches span the continuum from preempting the application of costly state laws to establishing single government payer for all health insurance advocates of single payer approaches believe such system would improve administrative efficiencies thereby reducing overall health insurance costs number of bills in the 110 th congress feature other objectives related to improving the quality of medical care or the quality of health insurance products proposals to improve health outcomes increase the availability of information about highquality health care and providers and establish disease management systems are raising interest among private insurers government programs and employers these provisions alone however will not reduce the number of people without any insurance and their effect on medical costs is as yet undetermined3 2 goodman j what is consumerdirected health care health affairs web exclusive at httpcontenthealthaffairsorgcgicontentfull256w540 3

insurance is an important consideration that is beyond the scope of this report nonetheless sponsors of bills extending coverage are likely to grapple with complex questions about the kind of coverage that should be extended sponsors of bills offering generous government subsidies for health insurance may feel that it is their duty to set minimum standard for qualifying coverage as way to ensure that taxpayers funds are being used responsibly g18g155g146g152g155g146g157g146g163g146g151g144g561g3g150g152g151g144g561g21g157g138g148g142g145g152g149g141g142g155g156g561 one of the challenges of undertaking comprehensive health insurance reform is that every us citizen is stakeholder whose preferences and needs differ from those of others reform approaches reflect different choices about the relative importance of needs among stakeholder groups including federal state and local governments health care providers medical researchers insurance carriers employers workers and consumers needs can vary considerably between stakeholde r groups and even within them for example health care consumers may prefer lowcost health insurance obtained through lower profits to health insurers while according to standard econ omic theory those health insurers will seek to maximize profits within consumer groups there are healthy people who may prefer limited insurance coverage or none at all while elderl or less healthy consumers may prefer more comprehensive coverage sometimes meeting the needs of one group can exacerbate the problems encountered by others for example requiring health care premiums to be community ratedthat is based on the average costs of everyone in large groupcan reduce premiums for individuals with expensive medical conditions on the other hand communityrated rates could lead to higher premiums for the healthiest individuals g21g140g152g153g142g561g152g143g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561 since the early 1990s number of incremental health insurance reforms have been enacted see text box 1 health insurance reform bills introduced in the 110th congress reflect little consensus about whether to continue incremental improvements building on our current

note d oes not include reforms to medicare or medicaid unless t hey ext ended eligibility number of incremental reforms enacted over the past 15 years have improved the availability of health insurance for some populations however they have been built on system where some continue to have access to any insurance and others to only unaffordable options where the number of uninsured has continued to rise and where such changes may have exacerbated the loss of privately sponsored coverage for example body of research has concluded that expanding medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip has generated some crowdout of private coverage on the other hand children are the only subpopulation in which uninsurance rates have fallen over the past decade 4 questions about the scope of reforms extend to the cost of the reform plans at one end of the federal financing spectrum are bills that feature subsidies for individuals to use toward the cost of health insurance such bills presume that financial commitment from the federal government is essential to achieve universal or near universal coverage whether coverage is provided through government programs or private plans fair amount of research supports the notion that significant subsidies would be needed to induce many of the uninsured to purchase coverage5 4 crowdout occurs when public funds substitute for rather than supplement private funding for more information see gruber j simon k crowdout ten years later have recent public insurance expansions crowded out private health insurance

number of market reform approaches that reflect the position that government laws and regulations have raised the cost of insurance reduced the number of options available to people and created disincentives to purchasing lowcost insurance for example state benefit mandates are blamed for increasing costs and reducing choices bills at this end of the spectrum aim to make the market for insurance work better proposing to achieve higher coverage rates without subsidies because people will find health insurance products are more affordable by meeting but not exceeding their insurance

were directed at the creation of national health insurance program while the legislation can take variety of forms the general thrust of such proposals is to make basic health insurance available to all americans so that access to health care would not be contingent on individuals ability to pay or their employment status these bills all share at least three common features replacement of most or all of the existing sources of coverage universal entitlement to health care or health insurance and governmentprovided health coverage national health insurance legislation in the 110 th congress

through governmentadministered and financed system medicare is an example of social insurance program for elderly and disabled individuals private insurers can retain role in such system essentially acting as contractors in contrast the national health service approach modeled after systems like britains national health service includes universal coverage as well as reforms of some or all of the factors of health care productionsuch as public ownership of hos pitals or public employment of physicians private insurers may or may not have role is such system because of the magnitude of the changes in such approaches they would be subject to criticism particularly about the level of governmental intrusion they would potentially introduce the counterargument could be that the continuation of more incremental changes cannot be relied on to achieve universal or near universal insurance coverage

the majority of bills in the 110th congress to expand public health insurance programs would have done so only for certain targeted groups of individuals for example some bills would have allowed younger nondisabled adults for example those between ages 55 and 64 to enroll in medicare other bills would have eliminated the twoyear medicare waiting period for people who are disabled yet other bills would have extended schip and medicaid with an objective of covering nearly all children none of these partial coverage bills are summarized at the end of this report instead the list of introduced legislation is focused on only those bills that are not limited to particular demographic groups although the bills characterized in this section are not listed at the end of this report because of their narrow scope that is not to suggest their impact would be insignificant 8 if one measures the success of past health insurance reforms by the number of previously uninsured individuals who obtained health coverage then the expansion of public programs medicare medicaid and schip must be considered great successes for example in the years after the creation of schip the percentage of children who were uninsured fell by more than onethird this is in contrast to 12 increase among nonaged adults over the same period 9 number of bills offered in the 110th congress would have built on those programs to extend coverage to more uninsured individuals public program expansions have advantages over other types of reforms in that the programs are already operational and their administrative costs may continued financing method is prescribed by statute b the program provides for explicit accountability of benefit payments and income usually in the form of trust fund c the program is financed by contributions eg taxes or premiums from or on behalf of participants which in some programs are supplemented by government income from other sources investment income on

utilizing existing programs that already conduct income determinations and administer subsidies may be efficient proposals to expand public coverage while maintaining the existing private market for insurance face an obstacle in crowd out there is evidence that in the presence of expanding public coverage private coverage will be lower than it would have been however analyses have concluded that when public programs cover the lowest income people for whom few affordable private sources of coverage exist crowdout is low but when public programs extend into higher income levels crowdout rises

bills were intended to address the disadvantages that small employers face in providing health insurance as benefit relative to large employers number of these approaches are discussed more thoroughly in the market reforms section below large employer groups are able to spread risk more broadly among their employees and enjoy economies of scale that keep per person administrative costs low when large employer self insures17 its health benefits are not subject to state insurance laws and regulation because it is not defined as insurance this along with the broad risk spreading and low per person administrative costs can confer considerable cost advantage over similar benefit plans in the small group or individual markets for insurance t ext bo x 2 subsidies f or private health insurance to achieve universal or near univ ersal private h ealth insu rance cov erage financial assistance with th cost of health insuran ce is likely to be necessa r various studies examining indiv

2008 annual meeting 17 many large employers selfinsure their own health coverage instead of purchasing insurance through traditional insurance carrier those employers retain the risk that costs of

most health insurance in the united states is obtained through employment this is due to number of factorsworkers perceive employers as paying for most of the cost of group health insurance and payments for group plans have taxadvantaged status18 further the cost of group plans are calculated for an entire group whereas people in the individual or nongroup market are often underwritten based on their own health statusthat is the price of the insurance policy is based on an individuals own set of he alth conditions while health underwriting could result in lowcost plans for healthy individuals seeking coverage those with medical conditions could be at significant price disadvantage relative to the price they might be charged if their premiums were averaged across an employment based group insurers selling plans in many states can even refuse to sell to individuals with health conditions or sell policies that exclude coverage for particular conditions and sometimes for entire body systems19 some bills offered in the 110th congress were intended to address these issues in the hopes of making the individual market work better for more people potential advantages of improving the individual market for insurance include increasing individuals choices coverage options would not be limited to those chosen by their employer and increasing the portability of health insurance portable health insurance does not have to be discontinued when one leaves job tools utilized by individual market bills include giving individually purchased insurance the same taxadvantaged status as employersponsored coverage and providing subsidies for the purchase of coverage in the individual market some bills would eliminate the tax benefits for employerbased health insurance premiums and replace them with new tax benefits for coverage in the individual market see text box 3 for summaries of tax policies related to health insurance these provisions were intended over time to provide incentives for people to move from employerbased coverage to coverage in the individual market however because of the market limitations discussed above such as health underwriting lack of guaranteed availability of plans and the absence of employer contributions these proposals by themselves may improve options for some but not others for example employer contributions fund large portion of the nations health insurance bills without replacing those funds some people may find individual insurance less affordable than their employersponsored plan at least in the short run 20 in addition risk pooling in the individual 18 under current law people buying health insurance through their employers and selfemployed individuals are able to exclude premiums for health insurance from taxable income others may deduct medical costs but only if they itemize deductions which most taxpayers do not and only to the extent that premiums and other unreimbursed medical expenses exceed 75 of adjusted gross income 19 pollitz k sorian r and thomas k how accessible is individual health insurance for people in lessthan perfect health report for the

for regulating the business of insurance over the years states have developed significant body of law dealing with all aspects of health insurance state laws and regulations include patient protections instructions on how insurance carriers may develop the rates charged for their products and procedures for approval of those rates they address how entities in the business of selling health insura nce fund their enterprises and prepare against the risk of insolvency insurance carriers are subject to fair marketing practice laws requirements related to the filing of grievances against the plans and appeals processes of plan decisions states also have benefit requirements that ensure that certain medical services must be available for product to be sold and marketed as health insurance 21 proposals to reduce state regulation would move insurance markets closer to an unrestrained free market and would invariably reduce costs for so purchasers of health insurance however they may increase costs for others they woul d also address insurers complaints about the challenges of selling products across state lines when laws in some states are significantly different from others many of the state laws were developed however to protect consumers from certain business practices bills that would preempt those state laws raise concerns about those business practices reemerging pooling proposals often focus specifically on sma ll employers small employers have harder time providing insurance to their employees for number of reasons small groups are not able to spread their highest health risks broadly as result premiums for small firms particularly those with older or less healthy workers or workers dependents are relatively high for similar benefits than for larger employers proposals encouraging small employers to join into health purchasing groups sometimes called health insurance purchasing cooperatives or regional purchasing cooperatives are meant to pool together those small groups raising the number of individuals over which premiums are calculated bills encouraging professional and trade associations to offer coverage were considered in the 109 th and 110th congresses and were ostensibly about such pooling in addition those bills would have provided regulatory relief for insurers selling products through associations most of those bills however did not require premiums to be calculated across the entire group and so would not have increased the size of the risk pools increasing the size of risk pools is one objective of bills that would establish programs similar to the federal employees health benefits program fehbp in general those bills would identify an existing federal agency or create new one to negotiate with limited number of health plans at least one plan would be available in all areas of the country and enrollment would be offered either to all small employers or to both small employers and individuals the coverage would be modeled on the plans offered through the fehbp in general the bills would require that premiums for plans offered through the program would be averaged across all of the enrollees for each planthe largest possible risk pool 22 in addition those bills usually include significant subsidies for lowincome employees or individuals and sometimes for employers as well spreading risk broadly however is not panacea communityrating setting the level of premiums based on the average expenses of all subscribers in an area could result in increased 21 see also crs report rs22476

for young healthy people with low health risk and lower prices for those who are older or have health problems if the goal of such approaches is to increase insurance coverage among those who need it most this tradeoff may be acceptable if however the healthier and younger groups find their rates excessive they may drop coverage altogether where enrollment is voluntary making the pool increasingly costly and undermining the objective of spreading risk only one state has pure community rating where individualmarket premiums can vary by any individual factor even age more than 15 other states have taken other steps such as rate banding or adjustedmodified community rating generally using at least age as rating factor that effectively pool some risk23 federal policies in this area might take into account the unique state markets that have developed in response to state laws to ensure that federal policies do not undermine improvements that states have already made24 consumer driven reforms are those that seek to encourage more choices for individuals in terms of the cost and coverage and to raise cost consciousness encouraging preference for low cost plans and better decision making about health care use ultimately these reforms are intended to reduce overall premium growth for example proposals to create tax preferences for high deductible health plans combined with health savings accounts are intended to encourage price reductions in coverage through several mechanisms high deductible health insurance plans offer limited coverage relative to what may be covered by more typical comprehensive products and health savings accounts encourage people to think more before seeking care for which money must be drawn from their savings account

generating interest and discussion at the federal level number of states are experimenting with comprehensive insurance reforms toward primary objective of achieving universal or near universal coverage see text box 4 some of these reforms may serve as blueprint for federal changes providing demonstrations that can better inform federal debate many legislators however would rather have states continue to undertake reforms to address coverage gaps for their citizens as result number of bills have been introduced to provide grant funds for states to continue and expand health

be very localized reflecting the close relationship between private health insurance and local health care providers labor markets and economic conditions state based reforms however face several significant obstacles the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa impedes states from passing certain laws that affect employer benefits such as health insurance25 for example erisa has generally preempted states ability to require employers to offer or pay for health insurance26 further states track record includes number of failed initiativesoften related to inability to fund the rising costs of the reforms 27 states ability to pay for reforms can be subject to the peaks and valleys of the states tax collections during challenging economic times need for state assistance of all kinds including health insurance rises often at the same time that states tax base erodes reducing states ability to fund such needs28 finally to ensure equity across states federal reforms may be necessary 25 although exactly how much of an impediment erisa creates is in flux as legal challenges are considered for more on erisa and the legal landscape see butler p erisa implications for state

large number of introduced bills include provisions incorporating combinations of the approaches discussed above proponents of such proposals tend to rely on existing sources of private insurance in combination with expanding public programs to extend coverage among the uninsured they reflect view that single approach except for what some maintain is politically unlikely national health insurance with its inherent strengths and weaknesses will be sufficient to get to all americans insured bills advocating multiple approaches often include market improvements to extend the availability of plans and subsidies to help lowincome populations pay for their health coverage some of these bills were new to the 110 th congress while others had been reintroduced from earlier congresses the newest of the bills advocating multisystem reforms tended to include provisions to improve quality of care better manage chronic diseases and encourage healthier living while there may be small number of introduced bills in this category it is favored approach among many in the policy community proposals offered by americas health insurance plans ahip wwwamericanhealthsolutionorg and the health coverage coalition for the uninsured httpwwwcoalitionfortheuninsuredorgamunins uredamuninsuredhtml which includes groups such as aarp blue cross blue shield associ ation and the american hospital

brief summaries of the major provisions of health insurance reform bills introduced in the 110th congress are provided below the bills are loosely classified into the following reform approaches similar to the discussion above largely replace existing coverage with national health insurance program or national health service expand privately sponsored coverage provide grants to states to encourage statebased reforms simultaneously expand private and public coverage options as discussed previously there were many bills in the 110th congress to expand public health insurance programs for certain targeted groups of individualsfor example to allow non disabled individuals between ages 55 and 64 to enroll in medicare none of these narrow scope bills are summarized in the list that follows similarly bills affecting private health insurance that only targeted certain individuals or narrow issuesfor example to prohibit preexisting condition exclusions for children or to restrict
