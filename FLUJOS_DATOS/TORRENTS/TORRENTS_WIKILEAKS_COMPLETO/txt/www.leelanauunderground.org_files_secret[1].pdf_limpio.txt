underground press the leelanau u nderground press is free speec h tool for student s in leelanau it is mean t to facilitate anonymous communicatio n between student s allow students t air g rievances about the school raise awareness about student r ights and create safehaven for student speech while the lup is 100 legal organization we publ ish anon ymously to protect ourse lves from persecut ion we believe that free speec h is studen t right and w are here to exercise it and help you exercise it as w ell whi there are rules explicitly den ying such pub lication s the ambig uity abou t the rules creates system ripe for censors hip as we have seen with the blocking of our si and persecution of our members however this is n ot an us v s them si tuation we want to work together with the admi nistration to find sol utions but that doesnt mean w are afraid to take direct action and resist you may redistribute t his paper in an form you like and ou may charge for it however free copies will always be available online for you lawyers w have released t his into the public domain the images are borrowed without permission from variety of sou rces but t he text is in t he publ ic domain if you are done wit h your copy please pass it on and spread the truth we have mailing li st for discus sion and an announcements li st to keep you updated see previous page for that editors update once again we have been blown away by the public suppor t we have recei ved fro m both ends of the spectr um students and s taff while so members of the leelanau school such as begg and odell cont inue their c rusade ag ainst our struggle for justice it is becoming clear that they are fighting losing battle as we go in to this new school ear we need t conti nue fighting for our own rights and the rights of our friends here at the sc hool w should never place the adm inistration ver our own studen ts and their safety they have shown us t hat they don t respect our views our desires or even our basic human r ights that groups ch as amnesty inter national f ight so hard for abr oad and at home our s truggle is n ot unique right now millions of others are eng aging in t he same s truggle fighting the same f ight and f acing t he same challenges in every single one of these si tuatio ns we see that w are winn ing truth is prevailing and old systems of oppress ion and the walls that confine us to them are being broken down there is quote fro m ghandi t hat real ly appl ies to the situation here at leelanau first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win first they ignore you when our first issue came out nothing happened our si didnt g et blocked they didnt try and track any of us d own and they just pretended li ke we werent goin g to become problem we emailed t hem n othing then they laugh at you after the release of iss ue two they started dministration officials and mr begg made posts at our forum making fun of us calli ng us pedop hiles and trying to make us disappear but it didn t work then t hey fight ou once they realized we were serious t hreat they fought bac k they blocked our site they blo cked all of t he mailing lists at riseupn et tens of thousands of them ju st in case they blo cked emails fro m us to our teachers they made legal threats they instructed teachers t to talk about us and they fought tooth and nail on is sues we cared abou t now we are at the end of the fighting several recent vic tories ve shown us t hat w have the power we need to change the school into somewhere we can be pr oud of somewhere w want to be kids are getting pas t the web filter with ease and the tax forms are out since last year some of the staff has m oved arou nd here but t he zine will cont inue to operate the same way as direct dem ocracy there are many parallel s we can draw between our struggle and t he struggles occur ring els ewhere in the world however the most striking one is that we are winning so cont inue fighting contin ue to be par t of this beautifu l struggle for freedo m and continue winning the finish li ne is so close and as lon g as we keep telling the truth and f ighting i njustice where w see it we will win suppor ter of our movement our web host and leelanau graduate karl dennin ger sub mitted proposal t the leelanau board he offered them 500 0 contribution every year for the rest of his life as well as nice cozy place in his estate what is passed on af ter you die sounds pr etty nice right an extreme ly large amount of cash wi th which you can do whatever you w ant w ell the school rejected it n ot because they did nt need t he money we have already sh own through t ax reports that they have serious debt problems but because they didnt supp ort student r ights under the deal karl denn inger would give that mo ney to them provided that they formally acc ept the right of studen ts to free speec h timely file all tax re turns and publish cor porate minutes for over 5 ears the leelanau school boa rd has been f iling xtensions on t heir tax returns why because t hey are hid ing their financial pr oblem s from pu blic vi ew all ther nonp rofits inclu ding t he red cross and t he aclu file these tax returns on year af ter year unles s there is serious problem like fire at the records building because of these extensions we are unable to view any tax returns af ter 2005 and as result investors cant make an educated decisi on about their donatio ns to the leelanau school releasing t hese forms irs form 990 t be exact f or 50 13 c corporat ions nonp rofits like leelanau is required b the federal government however extension s may be f iled these are intended t give extra time t compan ies who have lost reco rds or other wise come into situation beyond t heir contr ol however this is not what the leelanau school is using t hem f or as for publishing cor porate minutes the law varies dependin g on where one is incor porated but i t isnt too mu ch to ask of the school boa rd that they publish t hem b the time of the next meeting whi ch could be weeks or even months theyre probab ly all already typed up and ready to post on t he website considering that federal law requires them to keep t hem on file we have scared the sc hool adm inistration in fact w eve scared the shit out of t hem if theyre willing to turn down 5000 year and place in mr denni ngers tate so keep up t he good w ork bob mc nutt the school appreciates ou turning down mo ney in or der to preserve your own reputation on april 15th of 07 i made charitable gift offer to the leelanau sc hool intended to both serve as prototype for other alu mni ala rmed with the school s long record of secrecy in financial affairs as well as promoting general free speec h model the school formally rejected this offer on 57 notification came from bob mcnutt the chair man of the board of trustees karl denninger emphasis added see httpww wdenning ernetclearfireawardpdf for the original letterby winston smi th in any school it i s expected t hat there wil l be conf licts b etween student s and s taff som etimes t he teacher is right sometimes t he student is right and sometimes neit her of them are right r egardless of who is in the right when discuss ing the problems and possible solutions with student s staff mem bers should trea t studen ts with respect in letter to mrs pina rd fro m several leelanau s tuden ts she loses herself and refuses to enter into ratio nal discuss ion about mr kratkys teac hing practices instead c hoosing t simply deflect questions and t respond t criticisms of his teaching this is not the way to deal with studen ts and w respect t hat the student in q uestion had t he coura ge to share his experience with us if you are treated wrongly by staff member contact us immediately the sooner you contact us t he better and re member the studen t than an inj ury to one is an in jury to all all of my com ments ve been written in red i had t shrink this down to really small size to ma ke room for other stuff in this issue but the full text is available on our site in nonsmall size to mrs pinar d from ryan sea rs hi mrs pinar d ive been k ept upd ated wit h pauls attempts to contact ou about mr k ratky he speaks for lot of stud ents and if ou w ant to t alk to each one of them individuall than ou can but w got together and talked about t his before he contact ed you he is our r epresentation mu ch lik the ected representatives of t he leelanau s tudent council or t he united s tates go vernment i agre wit h mo st if not verything he has s aid and have some c omplaints of my own very day in h either didn t teach at all nd just h ands us probl ems and expects us to kn ow how to do t hem and t han add resses everyones complaints and misunder standings on n indiv idual b asis or he r ushes t hrough t he m aterial and ven wh i t ake not as im writing do wn the mat erial he is already on t he next thing i sk him to sl ow down c onstantly but it eventual ly gets to the point t hat i giv up and n ot ca re anymore i realize t hat the class is over and w already t ook t he exam but i dont know what to do we had guided xam review which kinda cks he didnt prepare us f or the st at all nd although it s over i kn ow i did hor ribly on it h aving m eeting on us on on one is qu ite one sided tw tea chers and on stud ent i t hink t hat it s unfair not to have at ast two students that have expierenced t his sam problem wit h mr kratky i think it is nothing but displa of admini strativ power and i t hink you should reconsid er having 2 stud ents there im not s aying t his just to go gainst the grain but i tr uly beli eve this to be t rue you and i c an have meeting at anytime nd keep in mind t hat pa ul ca n as of r ight w threaten gal ction f or the disr egard of his disclaimer there do em to be some l egal weight to this argument just t warn you it w as bl atent disre guard of his privacy referring to r equest by paul that the letter to mrs p inard be k ept p rivate and it was also slande rous to his r eputation in the eyes of both mr kratky and mr od ell i hope ou und erstand what im saying and n ot just p awning t his off as ither paul jas cha as or m yself being ngry about the test the on ly thing i re gret is that i didn t com to ou soone r with these c ompl aints from mrs pinard yes she r eally did send t he email in all c aps i app reci ate our comme nts r yan and wi ll go t hrough them i n june w ith t he acher you h ad ccess to plent of weeks to give input prior to now but it s xcuse to igno re his g rievancesit is not real c onvincing to wait u ntil t he ve ry end t pr oduce such insig hts if he h ad br ought t hem up ea rlier he c ould have been pers ecutedi also di d not see man comme nts like t his on th student vals that you w ere part of some but n ot of the ma gnitude ou i ndicate here it would h ave been helpful to hear fr om ou b oth the t eacher i if necess ary should h ave h ad t his input earlier in t he months prior to the end i will also factor i n the acher s input on our c ontribut ions to the clas sroom both positive nd ne gativeremember i have input fr om ot her s tude nts i n the class that do n ot hold your vie ws of th tea cher n or nd ctually have some of the ir own thou ghts n your involveme nt wi th the teacher an d the class so i h ave t consi der all sides of t he opin ions an d tho ugh ts this inf ers that one opinion is correct when t hey are only opinion ryan can hold any opinion he w ants regardless of w hether it is right or n ot and ou should i nvestigate regardlessin the nd ryanyour own effor ts and resul ts i ncluding effective co nstructi ve criticism are wh at you ge t out of an clas slearni ng to learn ef fective ly even w hen ou are nt confi dent or app reci ative of the i nstruct ors approach is p art of our edu cation if ou were s truggli ng this signific ant ly i would h ope that you tried numer ous avenues to get assis tancesuch as tut orials from ither our wn teacher or mr b reit haupt the depart lead er made use of the man of fers from the t eacher to meet in t he eve ningn ot jus t on t utorial ghts if he is pa ying attention in class doing his hom ework and doing verything good stud ent does t hen h shouldn t have to sp end time outs ide f that arning the content that is sign of bad acher and should not be bl amed on t he student especially when ther stud ents have had t he same p roblemsetc these are the th ings that ma ke up proactive positive appr oach to learni ngnot j ust dis tant group grousi ng ab out the s tate of aff airs mrs pi nard to mrs pinar d ok mrs pinar d i agre that i didnt come f oward wit h these things early enough and im not t alking about t he actu mate rial arned hes r ight he re and mrs pinard didn t even add ress his cerns but just how he presents himself in class h presents himself wit h type of rrogence and fidenc that should go with tea ching f or many ma ny years and should be ble to b backed up but he doesnt back it up ou arnt actu ally listening to m points as is nyway so i might as well just gi ve up i think that pawning this off on t he fact that very one of his students isn t complaining and that some of t hem think its re dicilus t hat w ere even bringing t his up is just im matu re k eep in mind that slavory was the popular rm until peopl star ted voicing t heir opinions on it and unti l the leaders talked to the people bel ow them i am not sking ou to ba ck us 1 00 but i thought t hat at least stud ent wit h 4 ears of elanau xpierence would h ave some mo re insightful input on problem wit h teacher than any other student ive seen good achers here and iv seen bad but t his is the first compl aint youve heard from is it not if it is t he first then m rs pinards rguments gainst his timing are virtually debun ked even wh following her logi c so w the ball is in our cou rt do what ou will wit h it ryan ars from mrs pinard unfortunately this is not verbatim copy mrs pinar d used weird font and some h tml cod that pdf f iles c ant inter pret so i had t go t hrough manual ly and f ix it all on ly punctuation w as changed i can n ot require of you to not sh ow this response t other sany more than ou cann ot require it of b the wayi ve n ot done thi s to hon or your r eques t make sure your open t doing the same pauls argumen t ight actually ve some legal weight to it and even if it doesnt you sho uld have respected his request regardless he is studen t and has r ight to ve his concern s and academic information in the nds of only those who need it odell w as not one of those people and he w as just pr obabl trying to keep t abs on the resistance i am v ery sor ry to s ee that you are taking my request that ou review your wn p art in classroom dynamics into c onsider ation as form of m blowing off your input or my obse rvation t hat ou could have come f orward soon er as response f im not really list ening to i f ind it encou raging t hat ou own this as mistak i he ar your messa ges ryan and i will mak sur i pass them along to t he teacher in m own review of his pe rformance i think i indicat ed that as for your obse rvation of his ar rogance that is matter of our opinion and judgment c all i hope t he teacher will take it in and conside r it as an oppor tunity to learn and grow again i sked in m response wh at have you done to c ommunicate t n ew staff membe r who m ay have benefited f rom our input th at was my primary mess age in m first response t you it looks to m as if all ou are doing r ight w is cr iticizing him behind his b ack emailing his high erups is hardly behind his ba ck and its the standa rd accepted p rotocol for such issu if he had v oices his opinion in t he lup pr ior to g raduation do ou think he would have gotten fair shak and to his supe rvisor and i ask is this h ow you w ant to b treated are you op to t his same s tandard and pr ocess ourself actually ryan i h ave had others d escribe some f your behavior in t heir ttings this ear as quite rrogant and sometimes ctually rude youre presenting t his like it has some w eight to it r egardless of ho w ryan acts it shouldn t giv mr kratky im munity and if r yan has ac ted out of line it is som ething ou should deal with separately i have never experienced t hat from you so i have simpl encoura ged those i h ear it from to add ress it wit h you another xample of ou ignor ing the concerns of stud ents if multiple stud ents have come t you wit h this complaint pe rhaps ou should have tak some ac tion on it or at l east investigated the validity of them i hop they have so t hat you can conside r your own actions attitudes b ehaviors and also l earn and gro w as an individual i have never heard it b the way from t he teacher you are writing about i think he actu ally has mor respect for you than to s ay this behind our back but there are other staff memb ers who h ave been bit surprised b this experience wit h you and have voiced their c oncerns wit h b ecause it w as not their experiences wit h you in p revious ears again i hop they have expressed this to you my whole point in mention ing this to ou is to point out t hat i have not l et those obse rvations feelingst houghts biases f others i mped or imp act m view of you can you say the same about h ow you vi ew at t his moment r have pieces of in formation whi ch don t always give the full pictu re or information helped f ormulat the ton i hear from ou in this most r ecent email i bring this up s an xample f how others comments and judgments can either b ring some thing helpful about ven if it is critical of ones p erformance or actions or it ca n simmer and b reed disco rd and just pl an old nastiness toward p erson ou w ont add ress f ace to f aceprocesses lik this can simp ly just produc smac k talk behind t he backs of others i sk you to c onsider our own inter nal barometer right w and m ake sure the input you are giving is some thing that can help the acher develop and i mprove if so why not giv it to him as respectfull and in good f form as i b elieve you are capable of hes asking ou to tak the ac tion which is our job dont shift this ba ck into his lap while he c ould probably take care of it himself f or his own p erson benefit it wouldn t help t he other students t hat also submitted si milar c omplaints to ou and doing so w ould on ly be s elfish like your example of our 4 years of xperience here as s tudent i have 5 years of w atching s tudents c ome and go h ere and 20 ears in other settings so ju st because youre xperienced do esnt mean you kno w everything and verybody ca n learn from situations re gardless of situations this is the arrogance ryan w as talking about n obody is infallable im tr ying to p ass onto ou some dvice bout ho w one c an go bout giving help ful criticisms so ot hers ca n ben efit i v alue your input ryan nd i will work wit h it as v alid i nput in spite f your rather r ude assumptio ns of my violation of another students right to p rivacy why are you so qui ck to assume t he information you have is co mple or b alanced if its not cite r yan evidence he h as not hing mo re to go off t han t he word of p aul and your own ou are staff membe r and h ave turned t his into an dversarial probl em by criticizing r yan for doing t he right t hing and re fusing to ddress his claims paul claims pr ivacy rights but then p asses on p artial inf ormation to you and thers as tr uth make sur youre as willing to filter he arsay from f riends as you are to filter i nput from staff pauls r ights to p rivacy or f or that matter ours may just end wh ere misinf ormation begins the f irst i heard from pa ul about ny concerns was the mor ning of t he ap xam and s eemed to be r ooted p rimarily in his wn anxi ety ver not feeling prepared that requires on on one meeting wit h the teacher and t he stud ent and t he way i work to suppor t both people i nvolvedwhether you agre wit h it or not that is my choice in pr oviding suppor t to b oth student and t eacher it is one lses busin ess what goes on b etween an indiv idual acher and stud ent when it involves the performance of eit her on of t hem unless t hey come to ou for help as for your other criticisms of ho w i h andled p auls emails did pa ul inf orm you that be fore those em ails he had t old he h ad alr eady taken all of t hese items to the acher and that there was nothing in his c oncerns that would b unf amiliar in keeping wit h pauls input to m that em ail was pass ed onto t he teacher in good f aith that the teacher already kn ew the content and w as forwarded t him to prepare all 3 of us f or the m eeting that is how it w orked ryan m r odell w as copied b ecause h is m direct supe rvisor nd evaluates m handling of these situations regardless of w hether its protocol ou should have consulted b efore doing this b ecause he w ent out of his w ay to request that extra care be taken wit h his privacy like it or not it is how educational sy stems w ork dont play victim mrs pinar d i make pologies f or that in fact right w i r esent t he di rect accusation in your mess age that my actions on t his item were blatant disr egard for pauls wellbeing our ton about t his could b read as blatant disr egard of the facts as i know them as far as group eting to hash over diff iculties re garding the cou rse it is not setting that i choose to w ork from f or various r easons one p rimary one b eing t hat we cannot id entify the individual needs f either the student or t eacher wit hout others looking on or watching t he process s bystanders this w ould be gross violation of privacy rights of ll involved the s tudents have requested t his so it s not violation of their pr ivacy are you claiming ou have privacy rights here dont expect this setting to be vailabl to ou at t he univ ersity level eit her ryan group etings wit h super visors of our professors just w ont happ it doesnt matter if it happ ens at uni versities this is like jud ge going 25 years for littering isn t so bad t hey could kill you for that in bur ma if you w ant to m eet with you kno w wh ere i am why would he you have already sho wn that ou wont listen to his cl aims and that ou are not his fr iend which is w hy this email was sent to the lup in t he first pla ce the ball is my court giv b reak ryan that sounds so adversarial you m ade t his adversarial by throwing p auls re quest for privacy out t he wind ow igno ring ryans rguments and wr iting in all c aps be fore he ever did it doesnt need to b somet hing tak to these levels i m still t he sam person ou have known for 4 years you are always welcome in m off ice in spi of how busy w both are right nowi have always enjoyed talking wit h you and li stening to ou mrs pinar d there are several t hings t hat need to be loo ked at here first off i have already dismantled t he majority of mrs pinards ar gument s the only reason t hey worked in letters t studen ts was that they were not subject to scrutiny in these letters she was in position of p ower because the students w ere appealin g to her and she abused t his power for her wn personal g ain man students ve complain ts about h ow mrs pinar d has handled si tuatio ns and this inciden t really brings t light what many students see as typical for her beha vior if she w ants to cor rect herself or fur ther suppor t her ar guments she is w elcome to do so through our zine or the discus sion li sts we have never squoted an ybody or skewed their words so she has t he perfect outlet if she so desires in this anal ysis i took r yans word on his interactio ns and t he in teractio ns he had wit h other studen ts because i am mo re prone to trust student especial ly when he has personal ly come to f or help i have already had veral bad xperiences with administration of ficials here so i have to assu that they are chang ing their w ords to sup port their wn plat form the s tuden t struggle is for truth transparenc and justice so an words that are chang ed to be in accordance with that are only for the better if you have been mistreated b an adm inistration of ficial please contact us im mediately remem ber if you w ant to get past the school filter youll need proxy email us at lupsaf ema ilnet to get one if yours dies well g ive you new one we give diff erent p roxies to every person so he cant block them keep bverting t he filter it is your r ight stude nt voices dear lup in response to your question about t he nurses treatment of students i have found her to be v ery unders tanding i ve gone in and every time she has been xtremel nice to unders tanding of my needs and taken the steps needed for t get healt hy again including t aking out of class and giving the right medication my f avorite nurs is n urse fr iley and im xcited that she is going to be working full t ime with us next year even though iv been treated well i know the sam cant be said of other students and t hese issues all seem to be wit h the other nurse one situation t hat comes to mind is one wh ere chelsea was supposedl puking up blood and the nurse told her to go to class if this tr uly was occur ring it w as rious issue t hat should ve been alt wit h if if did happ and thats what she to ld chelsea it was probabl bec ause chelse had faked being sick bef ore you lose your tr ust with the nurse when you do t hat ev so she should handle all cas ser iousl despite her feelings t owards i ndividual s tudents an anon ymous s tudent near the end of t he year several s tuden ts staged an event to raise money for whale preser vation raffle tickets were sold and kelsey and alex pictured ab ove got pied for the green peace campai gn saving the whales is g reat but the save the whales event contained messa ge that w asnt so bvious but equally important this w as an example of student activi sm at its finest small group of student s saw an in justice and instead of just sitting ar ound and complaining t hat it w as happeni ng they got out and did something they col lected signatu res they collected money and t hey caused so change but the most important par t was that they got active eac h and every one of can make small c hange in our veryday lives whether its questioning facts handed to us by the school adm inistration dur ing q uiet period writing an ar ticle f or the lup or simply thinking abou t things w have taken for granted as fact but this w asnt the on ly example of studen t activism since our t release and it cer tainly wasnt the mo st important during the da of silence several s tudent s remained si lent t he whole day to protest the silence that lgbt individuals ve to go through very day to prevent persecut ion and discrimina tion the organizer jake has been v ery acti ve in t he school com muni ty and very vocal about his op inions not only did he or ganize the day of silence and rder shirts and fliers for all the par ticipants he also s tood up to mr odel ls decision re garding clothing at graduation odell has ruled t hat all transg ender individual s had t wear the clothing of t heir original g ender alon g with several other students they demanded meeting wit h mr odel l and g ot the ruling overturned this is just ano ther example of what can happen when s tudents band to gether to get rules c hanged li ke when the guys from kindel g ot the manda tory participat ion at the dorm out ing the day bef ore the act removed when two leelanau s tuden ts saved the whales when ja ke got that ruling overturned and when studen ts pressured t he school to buy more nond isposable cups regardless of what your cause or iss ue you can personal ly make change in ourself and wi th little help ou can ma ke change in t he enti re school once again we can see that w are winn ing by winston smi th as w enter the ne w year we enter new real m of challeng victories and inevitably losses ven thoug h we are winning and t he studen t movement is t he strongest it has ver been at least in the t few years we are entering this year to completely new school in fact the school almo st mandated uniforms were it not for mr himbur g tireles s advocate for the studen t intere st we would all be wearing uni forms leelanau seems t in its advertising materials embrace individuali ty the strengths of eac h studen t and t he way eac h studen t learns but uniforms go directly against individuali ty uniforms make us all the same all bland all uniform and all dr ones drones t the lies that the school admin istration has been constantly shoving down our throats expect ing us to believe that we have been constantly debunki ng here at the lup because we know that it needs t be done the w ay the sc hool vi ews students has changed we are lon ger studen ts lon ger ind ividual s lon ger people who lear n different ly or people who can all contribute so mething t the leelanau com muni ty i dont say this only on t he basis of uniforms but on t he basis of what happened over the summer one of our good comrades and so mebody who has always embodied t he student t hat leelanau is perfect for charlie oc kerlund has been asked to leave the official reason gi ven was that he was late too often and t hat hi s grades were low but he didnt f ail his classes on the contrar he passed all of them and t his just shows how much power odell has been vested wi th odel l has di sliked charlie for lon g time and he met tipping point when you are in odells si ghts ou can kiss away your freedoms and eventua lly your tuition expect drug tes ts expect rando m room sear ches expect for him to constantly be looking f or evidence against you ma ybe charlie trusted mr odell mo re than i but i do kn ow that odel l couldn t find reason ins tead he nitpicked on issues t hat ma ny studen ts at leelanau are guilty of here tardines s give break odell get ou t of of fice buddy you are longer competent and ou have shown us that you cant handle the power that has been gi ven to you the daylight theft of our freedoms dignity and r ights has n ot gone unnoticed but it has gone unacted upon expect students t fight you mr odell our authority longer goes unchecked by the secret letter mr begg is at it again making pol ices that dont make sense if you look at t he new student handboo k there are few minor c hanges one of them is i n the tec hnolo gy policy unlike before in order t use the school internet all students mu st regis ter their ip address with house parent first off this po licy doesnt make sense ip addresses the addres s computer is identif ied b on network ie the internet are assigned random ly so what w ould it accomplish to register these with the office absolutely nothing most likely this policy is aski ng students t reg ister their mac address with the school whi ch they cant even demand because the handboo k asks for the ip address every single co mputer in the world has different mac address t his isnt actuall true but t he chance of finding t wo in the same ro om with the same m ac is so low that it doesnt real ly ma tter when computer asks for an ip address it pr ovides its mac address in order to get it the reason t he school wants these mac addresses or at least the reason t hey tell people is so that if student s do anything illegal using the schools inter net they wil l be able to find out who did i t whi its tr ue that you can use mac address to ident ify student its n othing n ew studen ts have gotten i n trouble before for doing stuff online and t he sc hool ne ver had t heir m ac address the school can see everything ou do the sc hool can get your myspace pass word your facebook pass word your emai ls or what ever else they want all of the dat images web sites text youtube videos etc passes t hrough the central server you kn ow this because of the nice orang fortinet banner which the school can legally use to see everything when ever it w ants so the
