koreapolitical and economic overview the long form name of north korea is the democratic peoples repub lic of korea dprk the dprk is communist state led by stalinisttype dictatorship with its capital city as pyongyang administrative divisions include nine provinces do singular and plu ral chagangdo hamgyongnamdo hamgyongpukto hwanghaenamdo hwanghaepukto kangwondo pyonganpukto pyongannamdo yanggangdo and three special cities jikhalsi singular and plural kaesongsi namposi and pyongyangsi in august 1945 the japanese in korea surrendered to the former soviet union which gained control of the korean peninsula south to the 38thparallel in august 1948 supposedly following general electionsthroughout the peninsula the dprk was established with kim ilsongheading the central government these factitious elections are the basisfor pyongyangs claim as the only legitimate government of korea andpyongyang has made national goal of reunifying the country on itsterms in pressing this claim the dprk has engaged in political economic and military competition with the republic of korea rokhowever in any comparison except military power pyongyang is apoor second on saturday 24 june 1950 dprk forces invaded the rok the united states acting with mandate from the took the lead in defending therok the chinese entered into the ﬁghting and the wars inconclusiveend led to return to the status quo at the 38th parallel an armisticesigned in july 1953 was followed 2 months later by the signing of amutual defense treaty between the united states and the rok the country is currently being led by kim chongil who succeeded his father upon the latters death on 8 july 1994 the elder kim was ruthless charismatic leader who retained tremendous loyalty from the people despite their hardships kim chongil has been described asparanoid spoiled and suspicious not having his fathers abilities and 3 his access to the government bureaucracy is through clique the coun try is facing insurmountable internal problems and is unstable politically economically and socially other political setbacks have further isolated the dprk and include the 1990 formal recognition of the rok by the former soviet union and the1991 entrance of both koreas to the the dprk lost one of its majorsupporters with the demise of the soviet union moreover although thepeoples republic of china prc remains the only credible supporter ofthe dprk economic and political rapprochement between the prc andthe rok continues the dprk will continue to be both economicallyand socially repressed and will become increasingly isolated the dprk kim chongil left and the late kim ilsong 4 will likely cling to its outmoded style of communism and political change will not occur until the current leaders are gone negative economic growth chronic shortages of raw materials espe cially oil ineffective centralized economic planning and an emphasison military power have contributed to the economic failure of northkorea the requirement by russia and the prc that materials exportedto the dprk be paid for with cash has further degraded north koreaseconomic viability the dprk can longer generate sufﬁcient electrical power to meet industrial needs social services have been severelydegraded and segments of society have been reduced to one meal daythere are chronic shortages of many of the basic commodities requiredfor subsistence and industrial production critical resources continue tobe dedicated to the military with increasing detriment to the economythere will be relief from the severe shortages which could fostergrowing dissatisfaction among the intelligentsia workers students andbureaucrats the dprks management of its economy provides freedom of action for producers real incentives for individuals to excel or agovernment responsive to scientiﬁc and technological progress if thedprk keeps its emphasis on its military and does not reform its economic system the country could eventually be in grave danger ofimploding the dprk is and will likely remain one of the most dangerous countries in the world transportation railroads north korea 4915 km 3055 total 4250 km 2641

rolling stock scarcity of heavy rail lines and lack of centralized trafﬁc control hamper the rail system poor surfaces and maintenance andan insufﬁcient number of roads constrain the highway system about 75 percent of the dprks 4915km railroads are electric major priority is to electrify all primary rail lines which would nearlydouble the rail capacity without additional track however electric railroads could become liability during wartime if key transformers orhydroelectric power plants were rendered nonfunctional the dprkproduces both diesel and electric locomotives diesel locomotives operate mostly in yards most steam locomotives acquired from varioussources shortly after world war ii still operate the dprk also manufactures several types of railcars including 60 and 100metric tonfreight cars however rolling stock shortages are frequent the dprks economic plans include upgrading and expanding several primary maritime ports construction of the nampo lockgate stabilized taedong river water levels allowing nampo port expansion andfacility development farther up the river songnim port is an exampleof this process some of the dprks rivers are navigable by small craft and are used as an auxiliary means of transportation to ease the strain on the railroadsand highways the taedong in the west central region serves as amajor artery for commerce the dprks civil airlift remains limited in addition to sunan interna tional airﬁeld the civil air administration operates few domestic terminals throughout the country personnel and equipment assigned tocivilian ﬂights do not have direct military function but could offerlimited support during wartime cultural overview the people of the dprk population of over 22000000 are mostly ethnic korean speak the korean language and use the korean phoneticalphabet the koreans take pride in both their antiquity and in the conti 9 nuity of their society which dates back to prechristian times they descended from migratory groups that entered the region from siberiamanchuria and inner asia several thousand years ago the society is aclearly deﬁned ethnic cultural and linguistic unit distinct from the neighboring populations of the asian mainland and japan the north koreansociety is mixture of ancient indigenous traditions with system oftotalitarian ideology imposed by the soviet union at the end of world warii this ethnic solidarity has deep geographic historical and politicalroots until the imposition of communism the people lived for centuriesin an exceptionally homogeneous society and culture with the partitionof the peninsula sharp political and economic differences developed withsome cultural variations between both north and south korea traditionally koreans have never conceived of society as merely an aggregate of individuals each pursuing private ends but as harmonious and collective whole more important than the individuals composing it this emphasis on harmony has justiﬁed the dprk governmentspaternalistic intervention in the lives of the people in the dprk todaythe dominant ideology is marxistleninist strongly inﬂuenced by traditional confucian values and kim ilsongs chuche selfreliance ideol ogy by western standards life in the dprk is regimented and grimthe centralized party state maintains tight control over all aspects ofdaily life and citizens must dedicate their lives to statedeﬁned goalsrather than personal interests proper attitudes and correct human relations are stressed it would be mistake to assume that north koreanssee their lives as harsh and colorless since the majority have spent theirentire life under totalitarian regime the average person is unaware ofconditions abroad and is subject to constant barrage of propagandaextolling the virtues of kim chongils rule and the heroic myth of kimilsongs past in addition this propaganda campaign harshly denouncesthe united states and the rok korean is uralic language remotely related to japanese mongolian hungarian and finnish although there are dialects the korean spokenthroughout the peninsula is comprehensible to nearly all the populace 10 chinese characters were used before the invention of the korean hangul alphabet in the 15th century number of specialized terms have beenintroduced in the north especially in written usage koreas traditional religions are buddhism shamanism and chongb ogyo christian missionaries arrived in the 19th century and foundedschools hospitals and other modern institutions throughout koreamajor centers of missionary activity included seoul and pyongyangalthough religious groups nominally exist in the dprk most available evidence suggests that the government severely restricts religious activity allowing these groups to exist only for the

asia korean peninsula geography koreas geographic position serves as natural bridge between the asian continent and the japanese islands the coastline is highly indented withapproximately 3500 islands mostly located off the south and westcoasts korea though comparatively small in size is noted for theextraordinary variety of its geography the country is punctuated withrough mountains large streams and rugged narrow passes with onlyabout 20 percent of the peninsula suitable for cultivation another factoris the shallowness of the yellow sea contributing to the extreme tidalrange 97 m 32 ft the second largest in the world on the west coast mountains the korean peninsula is primarily region of mountains approxi mately 70 percent and they are the deﬁning characteristics of the terrain the mountains are generally of medium height about 1500 m4921 ft with lower mountains 200500 m 6561640 ft high all elevations of 2000 m 6600 ft or more are found in north korea reliefdifferentials as measured from valley ﬂoor to peak or ridge tops foreven the lowest mountains are generally 300400 m 9801300 ft theelevated places are heavily bisected by river valleys which frequentlyhave deep narrow

is the headwater for the yalu and tumen rivers mountain ranges generally parallel the coastlines but nearly all emit number of mountain chains that extend in various directions and intersect one another making the countrys relief system complex and tangled koreas mountain system may be broken into three segments north korean mountain regions these are divided into the tumen and the yalu amnok river mountain regions the tumen region the area between the tumen river and theeast sea sea of japan is in the northeast corner of north koreathese mountains are relatively low and passable in the northeast butgradually increase in elevation toward the southwest becoming less andless accessible their high region reaches 2500 m 8202 ft theirsouthwest direction is interrupted by the materyong mountains whichextend southeast from the manchurian border to the east sea sea ofjapan the yalu amnok mountain region is between the yalu river and the yellow sea the region forms the mountain roof of the korean peninsula these ranges are noted for their complicated structure severityinaccessibility and lack of settlers the western portion of this regionbecomes gradually lower rarely exceeding 1000 m 3281 ft but theranges have steep slopes are highly dissected and contain dense forestscommunication is usually only practical via the deep river valleys east korean mountain region these mountains extend south along the shore of the east sea sea of japan in three parallel lines to the southern extreme of the peninsulathese mountains reach 1500 m 4921 ft and are characterized by narrow jagged

eastwest movement this restriction of lateral movementbecomes more prevalent the further north operations move the majorwater obstacles on the peninsula are its rivers during most of the yearthe rivers are shallow exposing very wide gravel river beds howeverthese rivers can become formidable obstacles as result of the increasedprecipitation during the rainy season climate koreas climate is deﬁned by its latitude peninsular shape terrain cur rents and close proximity to the asian continent it is characterized bycontinental winters and monsoonal summers though korea juts far outinto the sea the west coast climate is less maritime due to the shallowness of the yellow sea its shallow depths average 45 m150 ft waterbasin heats and cools rapidly contributing little to moderating the climate where as the east sea sea of japan moderates the east coastsclimate due to its deeper waters 1500 m 5000 ft the southern climate is less continental and more subtropical with sig niﬁcant warm

the cold dry winter to the summer rainy season this transition lasts nearly 2 months low pressure systems start forming near the gulf of bo hai and the shantungpeninsula these lows signiﬁcantly erode the dominance of the siberian high asiatic high pressure system as result cloudinessand precipitation increase during the spring months korea is occasionally inﬂuenced by the yellow wind during the spring monthsthe yellow wind occurs when storm winds behind trough cause dustfrom the gobi desert to become suspended in the air the dust ladenair is subsequently transported over korea during strong yellowwind visibility can be reduced to less than 1 mile spring is also thetime for heavy sea fog to form over the coastal areas the fog forms asthe warmer air passes over the cooler yellow sea and the east sea seaof japan wind gusts of up to 59 kts have been recorded as well astornados the average april temperature in the north is approximately10 c 50 f and in the south 12 c 54 f spring is generally coolerthan fall summer pattern juneseptember summer is the rainy season in korea during the summer southernmonsoon winds engulf the country the winds shift to the southwest andthe warm moisture laden air moving off the oceans clashes with thedrier air to the north these fronts oscillate back and forth across koreaduring the summer months the interior highlands disturb the windsforcing them into westerlysouthwesterly direction the majority ofthe annual precipitation falls between late june and the middle of september with rains fully developing along the entire peninsula by midjune seoul receives approximately 126 mm 5 in of precipitation during the winter decembermarch but in july alone receives approximately 383 mm 143 in28thunderstorms usually occur about 2 to 5 days per month during this period summer precipitation in korea is as likely to occur at 0200 as at1400 humidity is very high and fog will develop whenever cold airmass confronts this moisture laden air often forming on cloudless daysthe typhoon season occurs from july through september about onceeach year typhoon will pass very close to or move over korea causingheavy showers strong winds

especially in rough terrain the mean temperature for seoul in august is 253 c 78 c fall pattern octobernovember october is the transition month between the summer rainy season andthe cold dry winter the predominantly tropical cloudy weather of thesummer is replaced by cooler drier and less cloudy conditions theprimary weather producers during october are cold frontal systemsfrom the asian mainland on the average one frontal passage per weekcan be expected during the month typical frontal passage is precededby increasing middle and high cloudiness with light rain following thefrontal passage mostly clear skies can be expected for 3 or 4 days during this clear period it is very likely for fog to form fog is especiallyprevalent in river valleys and in low lying areas winter pattern decembermarch the winter in korea is controlled by the large siberian high asiatichigh pressure system which results in predominantly cold dry northwesterly winds about every 4 to 5 days lowpressure trough willmove through korea bringing with it cloudiness and light precipitationthe amount of precipitation locally depends mostly on the elevation ofthe station and the length of time that the air has been over the yellowsea maximum snowfall occurs over the northwest coast which is themost exposed to the northwesterly ﬂow and in the mountain areas normally less than 10 percent of the annual precipitation falls during the29winter frequently the weather is cloudless clear and dry except for the southwestern region of the peninsula the mean january temperature in seoul is 44 c 24 f effects of climate on military operations extremely cold outbreaks during winter could have serious impact onground and air operations during colder temperatures hypothermiafrostbite and cold related injuries

but dispersionpatterns are less favorable the southwest monsoon pattern also hasperiods of strong wind speeds which may adversely affect air operations air defense and communications which are antennadependent the best period for air and ground observation is the generally clear winter period december through march flying weather in the winteris the best of any time of the year although pilots must take note of frequent severe turbulence and icing both hazards can be associated withthe passage of trough the fall period october through novemberpermits good air and ground observation however air operations arefrequently marginal during morning hours due to periods of ground fogin river valleys and lowlying areas during the spring april throughjune air and ground observation are often limited as result of increasing cloud cover and precipitation additionally the spring period bringswith it an increase in early morning fog that burns off by late morningalso during the spring dust resulting from yellow wind can reduce visibility at times to less than 1 mile affecting both ground and air observation periods of rain during the summer when the peninsula receivesthe majority of its annual precipitation in the form of monsoons greatlyreduce air and ground observation capability vegetation during world war ii and the korean war the korean peninsula wasnearly deforested as result only scrub tree growth and relativelyyoung forests exist areas not classiﬁed as cultivated or builtup are generally categorized as forests areas that contain trees over 61 m 20 ftoccupy only onethird of south korea and are usually dense with tightlyspaced trees that are generally less than 10 m 33 ft tall in these forestsmaneuvering vehicles is difﬁcult because trees are so closely spacedthe valley ﬂoors are consistently terraced and planted with rice cropsassuming that adequate supplies of water are available for these terraced31ﬁelds low dry crops are planted where adequate supplies of water are not available usually on the edges of valleys the terrain and climateconditions of korea are favorable for growth of coniferous forest including pine ﬁr larch and spruce trees in the past most of the forest landon the peninsula has been denuded and the only remaining mature natural forests are on the higher mountains particularly in the north most ofthe peninsulas woodlands

is fair in areas of cultivationmainly in rice paddies and orchards but these are seasonal except indikes and ditches concealment especially from aerial observation islimited in the young forests throughout korea surface materials the predominant surface material throughout the peninsula is sand composed of rocks and silt the soil cover is usually thin outside the valleys on hills and on mountains in the valleys natural soils arenormally thick sands and silty sands with considerable cobblesizedrock in the upper reaches of the valleys in the wide valleys of the western portion of the peninsula minimal rock is present in the natural soilcultivated soils especially in terraced rice paddies are artiﬁciallydeveloped through regular plowing irrigating and fertilizing over longperiods settling of silts from annual irrigation and also from occasionalﬂooding of rivers has changed the soil composition from its originalcharacter in most areas rice paddy soil is uniform siltyloam whichis totally unlike the natural soils in the vicinity during spring plantingthese soils are usually supersaturated to allow an easy transition for thetransplanting of rice seedlings the introduction of this moisture in thespring and constant ﬂooding throughout most of the summer monthsmake these ﬁelds impossible for offroad movement of even the lightestmotor vehicles during early fall these rice paddies are drained toallow for the rice harvest and for the turning of the soil for nutrientretention the turning of the soil allows the ground to dry and becomehard enough for some

mi8hip in 1985 the dprk circumventedus export controls to buy 87 usmanufactured hughes helicoptersthese helicopters are considerably more advanced than those receivedfrom the russians although the dprk has the civilian version theyprobably have modiﬁed some of them to carry guns and rocketsbecause the rok produces the same model helicopter for its armedforces the dprk could modify their hughes helicopters to resemblethe rok counterparts to confuse cfc air defenses during sofoperations 38 the transport ﬂeet has some 1950s and 1960svintage former soviet transports including more than 270

kilometers km an hour the nkafhas at least six colt regiments and at least six regiments of attack andtransport helicopters dprk operational thinking reﬂects both russian doctrine and north korean experiences with heavy bombing during the korean war itrelies heavily on air defense the dprk houses large percentage of itsmilitary industries aircraft hangars repair facilities ammunition fuelstores and even air defense missiles underground or in hardened shelters the dprk with over 8800 aa guns combined with sa2 sa3 and sa5 and handheld sa7 and sa16 surfacetoair missiles has constructed one of the worlds most dense air defense networks in the mid1980s the former soviet union supplied sa3goa surfacetoair missiles to the dprk the sa3 provides shortrange defense against lowﬂying aircraft in 1987 the former soviet union provided sa5gammon surfacetoair missiles that gave pyongyang longrange highaltitude surfacetoair missile capability the sa2 guideline system provides mediumrange mediumaltitude point defense for citiesand military airﬁelds as well as barrier defense along the dmz sa2 and sa3 battalions are concentrated along the coastal corridors while most sa5 gammon battalions are located near the dmz andare extended north to cover pyongyang the north korean navy nkn the 46000man nkn is primarily coastal navy the nkn is orga nized into two ﬂeets the east coast fleet with eight operational commands and the west coast fleet with ﬁve operational commands theeast coast fleet is headquartered at toejo dong with major bases atnajin and wonsan the west coast fleet is headquartered at nampo 39 with major bases at pipagot and sagon numerous smaller naval bases are located along both coasts the ﬂeets do not exchangevessels because geographical limitations make mutual support almostimpossible the nkn does not have marine corps or naval airamphibious operations are conducted by sof units in addition tonaval personnel most nkn vessels are small patrolsize craft unable to operate over 50 nautical miles nm from the coast but capable of policing the dprksterritorial waters the navys numerous amphibious craft and midgetsubmarines are intended to clandestinely insert sof units into the rokthe dprk also maintains coastal defense artillery and missile sitescoastal defense artillery includes 122mm 130mm and 152mm systems landbased coastal defense missiles include the ssc2b samlet cssc2 silkworm and cssc3 seersucker the nkns most capable weapons systems are their approximately 43 guidedmissile patrol boats equipped with the ssn2a styx antishipmissile or its chinese version the cssn1 scrubbrush thoughtheir small size limits operations to coastal waters and calm seas theyhave capability to quickly respond to combined forces

torpedoes or 24 mines shortly after deliveringfour romeos in the early 1970s china helped the dprk start its ownromeo construction program the romeos are well equipped havean improved sonar and can carry 14 torpedoes or 28 mines to date the dprk has indigenously produced over 200 personnel land ing craft this includes approximately 100 nampo personnel landingcraft based on former soviet p6 torpedo boat hull the nampo has amaximum speed of 40 knots and radius of 335 nm at 28 knots thenampos provide limited amphibious capability each carrying up to30 troops with basic combat load

medium landing shipswhich can carry 3 to 4 light tanks and approximately 125 kongbang amphibious hovercraft the dprk has credible mine warfare capability there are numerous small surface ships that are capable of delivering mines within both thenavy and civilian sectors mines will be used to defend against amphibious assaults defend strategic ports and provide seaward ﬂank protection for land forces defensive mine ﬁelds will be monitored by coastalobservation teams and radar and they will be supported by wellemplaced artillery and missile batteries this will make close approachand mine clearing operations extremely hazardous dprk has largeinventory of older technology mines signiﬁcant historical experiencewith their effectiveness and most importantly the willingness to usethem 41 other considerations biological biological warfare has not received the same attention as chemical or nuclear warfare however if the dprk did choose to employ biologicalweapons it probably could use infectious agents such as those causinganthrax or plague against cfc forces chemical the dprk is capable of producing nerve blood choking and blister agents they have at least eight industrial facilities that could producethese agents while production rates are uncertain large quantities ofagents are believed to be available chemical weapons can be delivered by virtually all dprk ﬁre support systems this includes most artillery multiple rocket launchers including those mounted on chahotype boats mortars frogs scudmissiles and some aerial bombs the dprk plans to operate in chemically contaminated environment chemical defense units are organic to combat units down to regimentlevel for example an army corps has dedicated chemical defense battalion and regiment has subordinate chemical defense platoon thesechemical defense units have both detection and decontamination systems their missions include reconnaissance and the training of personnel in the use of protective equipment chemical training and exercisesfor both military and civilian personnel have increased consistently overthe years dprk chemical weapons would compliment conventional military power in surprise attack dprk forces are expected to use chemicalweapons to demoralize defending forces reduce their effectiveness anddeny use of mobilization centers storage areas and military bases without physically destroying facilities and equipment nonpersistentchemical agents could be used to break through cfc defensive lines or 42 to hinder cfc counterattack persistent chemical agents could be used against ﬁxed targets in rear areas including command and control elements major locs logistic depots airbases and ports special operations force nearly 60000 military personnel assigned to the 22 sof brigades and light infantry battalions would be available to open second front incfcs rear area these forces have ﬁve basic missions conductingreconnaissance performing combat operations in concert with conventional operations establishing second front in the enemys rear areacountering cfc special operations in the norths rear areas and maintaining internal security these forces perform operations at the strategic operational and tactical levels during offensive operations corpsreconnaissance units would conduct penetration missions to collect military intelligence and launch raids on military and civilian targets priorto the main attack some units would inﬁltrate behind allied lines by airand sea while others would cross into the rok through tunnels underthe dmz these units would penetrate at night to locate and destroycommand posts create confusion in rear areas interdict troop and supply convoys attack military and civilian installations to include portsand airﬁelds and gain control of critical terrain summary most of the dprks military equipment is technologically inferior to cfc equipment the state of readiness and training for the force willdecline due to the age of equipment and lack of repair parts thereforethe ability of the dprk to threaten the south with conventional forceswill be reduced by the turn of the century national military policy dprk military policy focuses on maintaining and sustaining military force capable of conducting an offensive operation into the rok toattain the national goal of reunifying the peninsula dprk military doc 43 trine and policy specify the structure of dprk armed forces allocate industrial resources and output and orient research and development tosupport the armed forces this doctrine is the blueprint drawn up by thehighest dprk political leaders that describes in detail the shape of thearmed forces and the way in which they are to be used it is based onthree fundamental and interconnected concepts shaped by the late kimilsongs vision of the future of the korean peninsula n eventual reuniﬁcation n dprk regime survival and leadership of uniﬁed korea and n the application of military force to achieve reuniﬁcation dprk force development and weapons acquisition strategy focuses on countering the strengths and weaknesses of cfc forces while remainingindependent and selfsufﬁcient in maintaining and modernizing theirarmed forces the dprk military is attempting to meet the followingforce objectives n develop and reﬁne selfsufﬁciency in armament n maintain active force size and rapid force generation capabilities of reserve forces n overcome terrain and technological disadvantages n ensure sustainability and improve warﬁghting infrastructure major hurdle faced by the dprk in attaining its force objectives is the dismal state of its economy though the dprk dedicates criticalresources to the military at the expense of all other sectors of societythe country may be facing economic collapse during this decadebecause of this the dprk may be reaching decision point either touse its military force or risk losing the military option consequentlythere is more pressure on the dprk to complete its force objectivesbarring economic collapse or military action dprk military policieswill continue to support the national goal of reuniﬁcation 44 the primary strength that the dprk can draw upon is the support of the north korean people whether by force of indoctrination or genuine feelings of nationalism this support constitutes reservoir of national powerdprk soldiers are taught that the outcome of war is not decided bymodern weapons and military technology but by the noble mission andrevolutionary spirit with which it ﬁghts for the liberation of the peoplethis translates into military force capable of supporting wide range ofcombat options without consideration for danger or moral values vulnerabilities of this military doctrine include the sheer physical exhaustion of the dprk population this is perhaps the greatest impediment to the norths attempt to offset the growing economic and militarypower of the rok on the battleﬁeld perhaps the most decisive shortcoming of the dprk would be the lack of modern reconnaissance surveillance and target acquisition systems this shortcoming is ampliﬁedby the relative inaccurate and cumbersome characteristics of most of thedprks major weapon platforms military strategy the primary objective of north koreas military strategy is to reunify the korean peninsula under north korean control within 30 days ofbeginning hostilities secondary objective is the defense of northkorea to accomplish these objectives north korea envisions ﬁghting atwofront war the ﬁrst front consisting of conventional forces istasked with breaking through defending forces along the dmz destroying defending cfc forces and advancing rapidly down the entire peninsula this operation will be coordinated closely with the opening of asecond front consisting of sof units conducting raids and disruptiveattacks in cfcs rear in developing the force to fulﬁll this twofront strategy north koreas leaders realized that they could never reach technological parity with theunited states or ussupplied south korea instead they focused onattaining overall combat superiority through the use of surprise shock 45 speed and overwhelming quantities of troops and ﬁrepower coupled with welltrained sof north korea devastated during the korean war also places great emphasis on maintaining strong defense to achieve the strategicdefense mission north korea has established defensive belts they aredesigned to defeat any attack from ground or amphibious forces themain strategic belt runs from the dmz to

units of the army at the initiation of adprk ground offensive the norths reserve forces numberingsome 5 million would man preestablished indepth national defensenetwork military doctrine dprk military doctrine is based on blend of russian operational art chinese light infantry tactics and north korean lessons learned duringthe korean war this doctrine is tempered by the national goal of chuche self reliance the impact of chuche is that imported military concepts have been adapted to the unique geography social conditionsand economic conditions found on the korean peninsula the guidingprinciples within dprk doctrine are as follows 1 annihilation destroy defending cfc forces in place do not allow them to withdraw and regroup 2 surprise attack achieved by making an unexpected assault in an unexpected manner prevent cfc from taking effective countermeasures position forces to attack with little preparation practice excellentopsec and deception attacks at night and during adverse weather arethe best way to achieve surprise 46 3 overwhelming firepower employ continuous massing ﬁres including chemical from heavy guns and multiple rocket launchers tocreate opportunities for maneuver and

and be able to tar get them operational level of war operational level offense the operational objective of dprk forces in the offense is the destruc tion of cfc forces in short duration high intensity campaign employing maneuver warfare to achieve these objectives the dprk has developed mobile ground force emphasizing the utilization of overwhelming ﬁrepower the latestevolution in force structure and doctrine begun in the late 1970s hasresulted in two distinct force organizations large mobile active forceincluding sof organized trained and deployed to carry out offensiveoperations against the cfc and an extensive well trained reserve forceto defend the dprk the dprk offensive against the rok will consist of three phases the objective of the ﬁrst phase will be to breach the defenses along the dmzand destroy the forward deployed cfc forces the objective of the second phase will be to isolate seoul and consolidate gains the objectiveof the third phase will be to pursue and destroy remaining cfc forcesand occupy the remainder of the peninsula the four forward conventional corps i ii iv and v are considered the warﬁghting corps they are expected to conduct the initial attackswith the primary mission of annihilating cfc forces north of seoul theconcept of annihilation is the key to the nka doctrine as it continuallystates the necessity to destroy enemy forces in place the forward corpsfollowon mission is the defeat of cfc forces in depth the remaining conventional corps iii vi vii viii and the capital defense corps cdc have several possible missions these missionsinclude providing followon forces roundout forces and serving as 48 coastal rear area or capital defense forces dependent on the forward corps success the rear corps will release units to serve as replacements two mechanized corps and part of the armor corps will provide the exploitation forces to carry the battle beyond seoul the remainingmechanized corps and armor from the armor corps could provide thestrategic reserve north of the dmz just prior to the initiation of hostilities two armylevel commands may be established these commands are expected to control operationsfrom the dmz to the port of pusan army group i would be responsiblefor conducting the main attack into the western portion of south koreaand destroying the bulk of cfc forces north of seoul army group iiwould be responsible for conducting supporting attacks down the eastern portion of the rok and securing the left ﬂank of army group i army group ii would most likely consist of the following forces first echelon will consist of the forward corps their mission will be to conduct the initial infantry assault across the dmz and break throughcfc defenses second echelon will consist of mechanized and armor forces the pri mary mission of these forces will be to envelop and destroy forwarddeployed forces third echelon will also consist of mechanized and armor forces the mission of these forces will be to pursue and destroy the remaining cfcforces and to occupy the entire peninsula additionally strategic reserveforces or followon forces exist to augment all echelons if required although the nka places great emphasis on maneuver it has elected not to rely on extensive mechanization of its infantry forces it is important to note the nka concept of mechanization to the nka mechanization is designed to provide rapid protected movement of aninfantry force for the most part personnel travel in armored personnelcarriers or trucks not infantry ﬁghting vehicles once the force reaches 49 its destination troops dismount to conduct traditional infantry opera tions rather than russianstyle infantry ﬁghting vehicle ifv tacticswhile ﬁghting mounted battle whenever possible through the

exploitation forces this force will operateunder the control of an army command and conduct corps level cohesiveoperations they are expected to be committed at the time forward cfcforces are annihilated their mission is to quickly seize and secure keyterrain leading to control of the area between seoul and pusan the nka will seek force ratios of 35 to 1 in armor 68 to 1 in artillery and 46 to 1 in infantry forces to mount an attack in attempting tobreach well prepared defensive position the nka may be expected toseek even larger ratios this undoubtedly would be the case in attempting to break through dmz defenses combinedarms operations constitute the foundation of tactical battle in nka doctrine utilization of the forward conventional corps reinforcedby the mechanized and armor

follows nmarch to contact with emphasis on forward reconnaissance ninitial contact and combat development by the advance guard nmaneuver and engagement of the main force ntermination and transition to subsequent actions when the forward element guard of marching unit comes into contact with the enemy the actions of the main body would depend on the sizeof the cfc force encountered if it is equal to or smaller than the forward element the forward element would attempt to decisively engageand destroy the cfc force if it is larger than the forward element themain body would either bypass or envelop the enemy strongpoint movement to contact nka movement to contact is designed to gain initial ground contactwith cfc forces or to regain lost contact though little is known on thespeciﬁcs of nka doctrine for movement to contact there are certainprinciples that apply to this type of offensive operation the nka willprobably seek to make contact with the smallest cfc element possibleto maintain freedom of maneuver with the bulk of its force all availablereconnaissance and security means would be employed to ensure that68the main force is committed under the most favorable conditions at the division level subordinate units would be expected to act boldly withinclear directives in order to seize the initiative to keep cfc off balanceand to exploit success the nka force conducting movement to contact will organize in march formation with advance ﬂank and rearsecurity elements protecting the main body nka movement to contactwould end when cfc resistance requires the deployment and coordinated effort of the main body it normally ends in meeting engagementor deliberate attack maneuver deliberate attack when an nka division conducts deliberate attack several types ofmaneuvers contribute to the overall execution and ﬂow of the battlewhen attacking defending cfc force that cannot be bypassed orshould not be bypassed because of possible future combat potential thenka would plan to begin with penetration this would be followedwith the envelopment and destruction of cfc forces and then pursuitof any withdrawing cfc forces to ensure complete destruction in the conduct of deliberate attack the nka assigns speciﬁc sionobjective to companysize unit battalion or larger unit isassigned an immediate and secondary missionobjective the secondary missionobjective is the immediate missionobjective of the nexthigher headquarters for example the secondary mission of battalionwould be the immediate mission of its parent regiment at night or whenvisibility is poor single broad mission would normally be assigned the objective of the penetration is to penetrate cfcs defense and would be used when cfcs ﬂank is exposed or when an exploitable gapor weakly defended point exists in cfcs forward defensive positions asuccessful penetration employs the elements of surprise and strong ﬁrepower the selection of the penetration direction and effective employment of secondary attack force and inﬁltration units are important to thesuccess of this maneuver69the envelopment is the primary and preferred tactical maneuver for nka ground forces whenever possible it would be attempted usingthe forward element to ﬁx and engage cfc defensive positions whileﬁrst echelon forces attack cfcs ﬂank and rear the second echelon willconduct penetration once the enemy front is weakened or secondenvelopment the main combat weight during an nka envelopmentwould be against cfcs ﬂank with the intent to divide and destroy andprevent the arrival of cfc reinforcements split envelopment would be used after the ﬁrst breakthrough of cfc defensive positions as the main nka force continues to advancedeeper into the defense subordinate elements would be tasked to conduct split envelopments to divide isolate encircle and destroy remaining cfc forces one by one this maneuver requires close coordinationand maneuver among nka units during an nka deliberate attackseveral small unit maneuvers are designed to contribute to the overallsuccess of the penetration or envelopment they are the pocho andcheon ib the pocho main attack is emphasized at the squad and platoon lev els and plans for the inﬁltration through gaps in cfc defensive strongpoints and attack to cfcs rear the cheon ib supporting attack is tactical maneuver that stresses the exploitation of small gaps in cfcs defensive positions to allow forinﬁltration to the rear it differs from the pocho in that it normallywould be conducted by small elements of the support attack during the deliberate attack some nka units may be assigned the sion of conducting pointed advance this would be conducted by straightleg infantry units along narrow front with the intention of penetrating cfc defenses along perpendicular ridgeline that is linked tothe defensive deep area this form of maneuver would commonly beused in combination with the breakthrough of the main attack or with anenvelopment and calls for heavy ﬁre support although pointedadvance would normally take place in an area adjacent to the main70attack it can also take place in the frontal area of the main attack when avenue of approach exists that is favorable for breakthrough deepinto cfcs defense in the execution of pointed advance and subjectto terrain limitations an nka division would use two battalionslocated 1 to 15 km from the main assault to penetrate to cfc battalions front line and an nka regiment would use two companies located500 to 700 m from the main assault to penetrate into cfc companysfront line pursuit the nka would execute the pursuit to block cfcs withdrawal routesthis maneuver calls for advancing to point of key terrain before cfcforces begin to withdraw and destroying them in series of meetingengagements generally nka pursuit operations would use column formation to provide speed and ﬂexibility the lead elements in the pursuit wouldattempt to apply pressure on cfc forces to prevent disengagement fromcontact concurrently nka artillery would attempt to form barrier atroad intersections or other chokepoints in an attempt to cut off cfcwithdrawal routes throughout the pursuit the nka plans for the forward deployment of artillery and mortars to maintain high level of ﬁresupport nka engineers are expected to eliminate obstacles to facilitatethe advance while the assault forces push forward in an attempt to commit the cfc reserve force nka reserve forces are expected to inﬁltratecfc rear areas nka doctrine includes three types of pursuit frontalparallel and composite frontal pursuit would be executed when there are parallel bypass routes or when strong pressure is required to keep cfc forces from disengaging from combat the nka might also use frontal pursuit to coverother forces conducting parallel pursuit into cfcs ﬂank and rear areas71the nka would execute parallel pursuit when routes exist on cfcs ﬂanks the nka would attempt to conduct surprise attack on theseﬂank areas to cut off cfc withdrawal routes the nka might also conduct composite pursuit combination of the frontal and parallel pur suits the nka main force would attempt to pressure cfcs coveringforces while simultaneously attempting to cut off cfcs withdrawalroutes an attack would be conducted into cfcs ﬂank and rear areas an nka pursuit operation would cease when cfc forces are com pletely destroyed nka forces have outdistanced their logistic linesnka forces in the pursuit are overextended or when confronted with apowerful cfc defensive position bypass nka forces would conduct bypass maneuver in an attempt to forcecfc forces to abandon or shift defensive postures bypass maneuveris characterized by an attempt to annihilate cfc reinforcements andblock withdrawal routes to prevent cfc withdrawal an nka bypasswould have secondary attack axis with emphasis on superior ﬁrepowerand maneuverability and is combinedarms operation with goal ofstriking deep into cfcs rear area successful bypass operation

operations as offering the greatest opportunity for surprise and would use this method for closing with cfc forces withoutbeing detected by forward defenses attacking targets opening passagesthrough obstacles and secretly moving secondechelon forces forward though based on simple movements and attack formations the nka regard the night attack as an important and complex form of combatrequiring close control detailed reconnaissance and daylight preparation it could be continuation of daylight attack or counterattackfrom an established defensive position although the starting time for an nka night attack could vary depend ing on the situation the nka would take into consideration times whencfc patrol activities appear to be relaxed during poor weather whencfc troops are asleep or when they appear to be offguard because oflack of previous combat operations night attacks launched before midnight would be executed for the purpose of expanding previous daytimeexploitation operations night attacks launched after midnight would beexecuted as the beginning of daylight offensive operations night attack formations would be selected based on the location of the attack starting position nka doctrine includes three types of night formations the column standing abreast and dispersed the column formation would be used when the attack starting position is located longdistance from cfc defensive lines the standing abreast formation is thestandard night attack formation the dispersed formation would be usedwhen the attack starting position is located near cfcs defensive lines the nka night attack formation would normally use narrower front than in the day also the assault line would normally be closer to cfcpositions than in the day less than 150 m and movement to this pointwould stress the need to avoid detection by cfc reconnaissance or surveillance during the advance nka personnel would quickly drop to theground at cfc employment of illumination and then quickly resume the75advance when the illumination is negated should they encounter cfc patrol or security force the advancing force would attempt to quietlycapture or dispose of these forces with gun barrel or soundless arms to improve command and control precise avenues of approach would be designated easily recognizable terrain features would be selected ascontrol points to facilitate movement and to indicate the direction of theattack additionally compassbearing specialist would be assigned toeach sector unit should the nka force conducting night attack be discovered and come under ﬁre and illumination it would move promptly without stopping towards the attack line avoiding ﬁre as much as possible andmaintaining communication silence upon initiation of the attack artillery and mortar units would open ﬁre at designated targets while theinfantry initiates the attack throwing hand grenades engaging in handtohand combat and shouting battle cries to maintain the proper direction of the attack tracer and artillery illumination rounds may be usedarmor assets would be held at the initial attack positions and on orderadvance to join the infantry armor support to offensive operations nka armor units are designed to act decisively in combat and operateindependently or as part of combinedarms operations providing directsupport to the infantry conducting antiarmor operations and facilitatingthe seizure of territory and the annihilation of cfc forces throughmaneuver and pursuit when the nka tanks are operating in small groups it is normal to have one or two platoons of infantry attached to company or vice versawhere tanks support an infantry attack in larger unit operations company of mechanized infantry is attached to tank battalions performingindependent tasks likewise tank company will be attached to mechanized infantry battalion when attacking strong defensive positionattached companies may be employed as whole units or be divided anddistributed as needed76nka armor and infantry forces are expected to coordinate their efforts during the attack each using its strength to compensate for the weaknesses of the other tanks would propel the attack maintaining vigorous pace attempting to destroy cfc vehicles and hardened positionsarmored forces would be capable of delivering ﬁrepower to greaterdepth than most infantry weapons and would be expected to destroycfc obstacles such as pillboxes wire entanglements and mineﬁeldsthrough the use of antimine rollers and blades as well as providingthe infantry cover as it advances behind nka artillery shelling theinfantry would be tasked with destroying any antitank positions reporting other targets for destruction by tanks and providing cover for damaged tanks pending their recovery nka armor units would perform the same types of offensive maneuver as the infantry and are well suited to attacking directly from the marchin the movement to contact tank formation would leave its assemblyarea with its elements deployed in such order as to allow for quicktransition to the attack formation in the attack and penetration nkatank formations would be selected to allow tanks and infantry to arriveat cfcs ﬁrst line of defense at the same time tanks would support theinfantry advance by ﬁre and destruction of antipersonnel obstacles during exploitation operations tanks would assist the infantry in carryingthe assault into cfcs defensive positions here the speed and shockvalue of armor would be stressed in denying cfc an opportunity tocounterattack or reinforce the defense tanks would also assist inbypassing cfc defensive strongpoints by blinding or screening throughthe use of smoke in the pursuit the speed and maneuverability of nkaarmor assets would be used to maintain pressure directly on cfc forcesand to envelop for eventual annihilation in organizing for combat an nka armor brigades assets would be assigned to the two combat echelons and reserve of the unit conductingthe attack these echelons would be reinforced according to theirassigned combat tasks 77nka armor formations would include the column rank wedge inverted wedge and echelon to the right or left artillery support to offensive operations in the offense the mission of nka artillery would be to suppress ordestroy cfc personnel and equipment which pose threat to nkainfantry and tank units the nka is capable of delivering massed or dispersed ﬁres from ﬁxed positions over relatively long ranges with highlydestructive power the nka considers the ability of artillery to maneuver and to ﬁre accurately under limited visibility weather and terrainconditions to be very important tactical employment of nka artillery would be based on ﬂexibility of organization integration of the ﬁre plan centralized control concentration of ﬁrepower and mobility nflexibility of organization would be used to concentrate ﬁrepower on the axis of the main attack by forming temporary missionorientedartillery groups at all echelons nintegration of the ﬁre plan would be used for the integration of the ﬁres of ﬁeld guns of various calibers with the machinegun ﬁres ofinfantry companies into single ﬁre plan ncentralized control would give the maneuver unit commander at each echelon control over artillery assets as the nka does not assigntactical missions to its artillery as the attacking units advance control of artillery would be decentralized starting at the lowest echelonthe maneuver commander would centralize the control of artilleryagain as needed nconcentration of power would be achieved through the use of all calibers of guns in concentrated ﬁre to the maximum extent possible nmobility would be used for quick dispersion or the concentration of artillery ﬁre in support of maneuver unit78the combinedarms theory of the nka is similar to that of the former soviet army in that artillery ﬁre support required for regiment and divisionsize battles exceeds the organic ﬁre support capabilities of regiments and divisions therefore the nka would form multibattalionartillery groups at all echelons to support speciﬁc combat missions thegroups would be formed at army corps division brigade and regimentlevel and would include artillery assets organic to these echelons plusartillery attachments at least corps artillery group cag would normally consist of two to three longrange artillery battalions that have themission of general support to the corps support of the divisions conducting the main attack counterbattery ﬁre and deep ﬁre on cfcs reararea division artillery group dag would normally be composed ofat least two or three battalions equipped with guns howitzers mortarsand multiple rocket launchers mrls regimental artillery grouprag would normally be composed of two to four battalions providedby division or corps and would provide support to forward maneuverunits this organization of artillery groups allows for concentration ofﬁrepower to support the main attack the ability to support unanticipatedrequirements or the requirements of higher echelon during the attack nka artillery ﬁring positions would be selected through reconnaissance of the actual location subsequent ﬁring positions would be selected through visual reconnaissance observation andby selecting general area on the map and moving to that area afterdestroying preplanned targets during the preparatory ﬁre the gunswould change positions normally artillery pieces would be placed at adistance of onethird of their maximum range from the line of contactwith cfc forces when needed the ﬁring positions would be set up inan area where artillery can conduct direct ﬁre in order to assure continuous and effective command of artillery asset and ﬁre direction the nka would establish and employ artillery observation posts ops at each echelon based on their surveillance of theterrain and cfc activity the ops would observe and adjust artillery ﬁreas well as provide command and ﬁre direction79nka conduct of artillery ﬁre in the offense would be broken down into three types of ﬁre preparatory ﬁre ﬁre support of the attack and ﬁresupport in depth during the attack in the offense preparatory ﬁre would be conducted to destroy cfc cps and observation facilities cause the collapse of defensive organization and clear path through obstacles for infantry tanks artillery andengineers fire would be sustained for 10 to 20 minutes in preparationfor hasty attack or 30 to 40 minutes for deliberate attack preparatory ﬁre would normally be divided into four phases 1st phase cfc front platoon area suppressive ﬁre 2nd phase cfc company reserve area 3rd phase cfc battalion reserve area 4th phase cfc front platoon area annihilation ﬁre preparatory ﬁre probably would not be divided into phases when visibil ity is poor and observation of ﬁre is not possible or when cfc has goneinto hasty defense and has not yet constructed its defensive positions nka ﬁre support of the attack would be conducted to assist the advance of maneuver units by shifting ﬁres at preplanned rates normally2 to 3 minutes deeper into the defense for this purpose several basic ﬁring phase lines would be established at 200 to 400m intervals from theoffensive start line out to 2500 m into the cfcs defensive depth 1st basic firing phase line cfc obstacle area 2nd basic firing phase line cfc defensive frontline 3rd basic firing phase line cfc reserves80the supporting artillery unit or artillery group would provide general support to the maneuver unit by providing rolling barrage or successiveﬁre concentrations longrange artillery and the corps artillery groupwould conduct counterbattery ﬁre and ﬁre on command and communication facilities when the maneuver unit cannot suppress cfc resistance with its own ﬁrepower some units from the supporting artilleryunits would be attached to provide direct support to the attacking unit fire support in depth during the attack would provide ﬁre for exploi tation units penetrating into the depth of the cfc defense the artillerywhich is in direct support of the penetrating force would have the mission to continue suppressing cfc

primarily by aaa units besides combating aircraft aaa units whenneeded will reinforce ground ﬁrepower against ground targets thelarger aaa weapons have limited antiarmor capability the tactical

the pri mary responsibility for reconnaissance and surveillance this includesall aspects of the area of operations to include weather and terrain andcfc capabilities however every echelon of each of the armed servicesis expected to conduct military reconnaissance and surveillance in support of nka offensive operations by echelon regimental reconnaissance and surveillance would extend into the rear of cfc regiment and that of front line division divisionwould be expected to cover cfc divisions rear area and that of frontline corps corps would be tasked to cover the rear area of cfc corpsas well as the rear area of the next higher cfc echelon reconnaissance84assets at the service and national level are expected to cover the entire rear area of cfc nkaf aerial reconnaissance is expected to acquire information on the nature of cfc locations groupings and activities along broad front ina relatively short period of time surveillance photography and radardetection would be performed by

tactics in the defense the defense would be used by nka in an attempt to gain time preventtroop losses or cover unit short of personnel defensive area wouldbe selected because it gives mutual support and provides allarounddefense nka doctrine calls for three types of defensive operationsposition defense mobile defense and retrograde operations the position defense would be used to hold or destroy cfcs attack or to hold key terrain or key area mobile defense would be used to gain time exact losses on cfc forces and preserve combat strengthwhile losing ground nka retrograde or disengagement operations would be used to gain time to plan for the next operation or to restorecombat capability in all three types of nka defensive operations theorganization and composition would be similar but the conduct wouldbe different nka defensive plans will vary depending on the type of defense required and the status of contact with cfc forces the integration ofmechanized artillery armor aaa and antitank ﬁre support bothorganic and adjacent units and the use of engineers camouﬂage anddeception will all be vital elements of nka defensive operation however nka planning and execution of antitank defense may well be thenumber one priority when preparing for cfc attack86generally when in the defense the nka will organize and manage the conduct of the defense into four defensive echelonszones and areasthe security echelon the main defensive echelon or main defense linethe rear area defense echelon and the antitank support area distancesfrontages and depths are situational dependent they will be adjustedby nka defenders in accordance with time to prepare the defense terrain and combat strength of both nka defenders and cfc forcesexpected to attack the security echelon will consist of three zones the general outpost the combat outpost and local security each will be organized for the purpose of holding and frustrating attacking cfc forces while gaining timethe security echelon will be reinforced by engineer artillery and armorunits the main purposes of the security echelon will be to ncause early deployment of cfc forces into attack formations nprevent cfc surprise attacks nhamper cfc forces from conducting reconnaissance and artilleryobservation nmislead cfc forces in ﬁnding the actual location of the main defensive echelon and nprovide concealed lookouts during the withdrawal of nka forces the general outpost will be established approximately 10 to 15 km for ward of the defensive front line and would be manned by reinforcedbattalion it would be established by division or army group and wouldnot have to be deployed if there is not enough time its mission will be toimpede the cfc advance and to cause early deployment the combat outpost will consist of reinforced platoon and would be established approximately 1 to 2 km forward of the defensive front linethe division would establish it and the regiment would be responsiblefor this outpost its mission will be to prevent cfc surprise attacks confuse cfc reconnaissance and deceive cfc as to the location of themain defense echelon87local security will consist of small number of nka troops and would be established approximately 200 to 400 m forward of the defensivefront line under authority of the forward company commander the main defensive echelon would contain most of the defenses ﬁre power nka units with the strongest ﬁrepower and most of the antitankweapons would be assigned missions within this echelon the maindefensive echelon is organized into two smaller echelons and defensiveperimeter would be established to check cfc attacks from any direction the ﬁrst echelon of the main defensive echelon would be responsible for determining whether cfc is moving to conduct deliberate attackand if so where if cfc forces are moving to attack combat securitydetachment or smaller unit would be dispatched to conduct reconnaissance in force or limited spoiling attacks respectively tanks dug in atthe front line will engage at 1000 m if cfc forces reach the front lineand threaten penetration defending forces will strengthen their ﬂanksand engage with all available ﬁre support as cfc enters the defensivearea tanks and antitank teams will attempt to ambush and destroy theattackers mobility and inﬂict heavy combat losses if cfc reaches thispoint the nka defenders would probably commit their reserves the second echelon of the main defensive echelon would be responsi ble for holding one or two blocking positions or to counterattack toregain the initiative and drive out penetrating cfc forces if cfcattempts ﬂanking movement company from the second echelon willtake defensive positions on that ﬂank the rear area defense echelon would usually be 8 to 12 km deep posi tions will have been prepared in advance this echelon would be used toprevent an advance following the penetration of the main defense echelon to slow cfc advance to provide logistical support during thedefense or to execute counterattack underground positions artilleryand rear area service support will be located in this area mobile unitsthat could conduct counterattacks or serve as reinforcements will be88deployed here nka reserves will be deployed in such manner that allows counterattack in any direction the nka considers antitank defense as one of the most vital compo nents of the defense and will establish the antitank support area atsa nka doctrine calls for the employment of from two to ﬁveantitank guns within every 100 m of the defensive front the maneuver unit would establish the atsa and locate it where it would be inaccessible to tanks or ifvs nka forces assigned to theatsa would be tasked to establish several indirect ﬁre rolling barrierﬁre lines and direct ﬁre antitank security lines along potential cfc tankapproach routes antitank security lines would be established in the forward security zone near the defensive front line and in the depth of themain defensive zone rolling barrier ﬁre lines would be established parallel to the main defensive line starting 300 to 400 m forward of thedefensive front line from this point outward additional lines would beestablished at intervals of 300 to 500 m each ﬁre sector should beobservable from ground op and located at point that cfc tanks cannot bypass in antitank defense nka artillery units will attempt to deliver battalion size salvos of antitank support ﬁre before cfc tanks can advance towithin the effective ranges of antitank weapons at the request of theop several battalions may concentrate ﬁre on key areas ﬁring at maximum rate if cfc penetrates the ﬁre areas and the tank advance continues the artillery units would shift ﬁre to subsequent ﬁre areas duringrolling barrier ﬁres whenever cfc tanks advance within 1000 m ofantitank gun positions antitank guns would engage with direct ﬁre individual antitank guns will also conduct ambush ﬁres from positions along high speed avenues of approach in addition antitank obstacles willbe positioned so that they can receive protecting ﬁre from antitank weapons the nka will also make use of both manmade and natural obstacles 89defensive frontages and depths

actual location north korean antilanding operations considering the devastating effect that amphibious operations hadagainst north korean offensive operations during the korean war theemphasis by north korean military planners on lessons learned fromthat war and cfcs capability to conduct operations from the sea it canbe assumed that north korea has made extensive preparations to opposea cfc amphibious task force atf composed of usrok navy andmarine amphibious forces to date north korea is limited in its capability to project military power beyond the korean peninsula and as such is limited in conducting signiﬁcant conventional military operations against cfc atf in the earlyphases of the preparation embarkation rehearsal movement andassault perma cycle of amphibious operations during the preparation embarkation and rehearsal stages north korea will attempt to collect information and intelligence against cfcs amphibious forceshowever other considerations such as north koreas emphasis on itssof the ranges of nkn submarines and some nkaf aircraft and thedevelopment of long range missiles cannot be discounted during the assault phase north korea antilanding operations will

brigades and 7 independent battalions the sof has ﬁve basic missions conducting reconnaissanceperforming combat operations in concert with conventional operationsestablishing second front in the enemys rear area countering the cfcspecial operations in north korean rear areas and maintaining internalsecurity the mpaf has two primary commands that control special operations units the reconnaissance bureau and the light infantry trainingguidance bureau north korea classiﬁes its special operations units asreconnaissance light infantry or sniper note though light infantry units will perform sof missions all nka divisions and brigades will have light infantry element whichwill be forward deployed to conduct conventional infantry tactics in theoffense light infantry sof missions will include combat operationsconducted by company or battalion size units against military politicalor economic targets sniper operations basically are the same as lightinfantry sof except they are conducted in teamsize units north koreas sof will perform operations at the strategic operational and tactical levels basically strategic operations will support national ormpaf objectives operational operations will support corps objectivesand tactical operations will support maneuver divisions and brigades103sof strategic missions will include reconnaissance sniper and agent operations strategic reconnaissance will be intended to ascertain cfcintentions develop targeting information conduct poststrike assessments of cfc units and facilities and assess the potential reactions ofthe south korean civilian and military populace sniper missions willinclude attacking critical nodes such as special weapon delivery systems and storage facilities command control and communicationsfacilities of combined ﬁeld command and higher and air and air defensefacilities in addition snipers will attempt to assassinate kidnap andorinterrogate key personnel to hinder allied operations and lower morale sof operational missions will include reconnaissance sniper and light infantry operations operational reconnaissance will be conducted toascertain cfc intentions develop targeting information for ssms andlongrange artillery conduct poststrike assessments and determine thestatus of locs chokepoints and cfc reserve locations at the operational level sniper missions will be similar to those at the strategic levelbut will also include attacking port facilities and major locs lightinfantry units will concentrate on attacking division and higher command posts capturing key terrain to assist maneuvering units and locating cfc reserve forces the tactical mission of the sof will be to support maneuver divisions and brigades objectives with light infantry operations the organicreconnaissance element of the maneuver unit will perform tacticalreconnaissance both the light infantry and reconnaissance elementswill develop targets for destruction these targets will include cfccommand control and communications facilities air and air defensesites cfc force concentrations and locs light infantry units willconcentrate on attacking brigade and division command posts capturingkey terrain and locating and destroying cfc reserve forces personnel selection for sof units come from politically reliable troops who are members in good standing of the korean workers party andwho have served 4 to 7 years in the combat branches only under special104circumstances language capabilities and technical skills will they be recruited and trained directly from civilian status the training of sof personnel is believed to take 12 to 24 weeks or longer depending on the skill levels the skill and training that sofpersonnel receive such as inﬁltration mountaineering night operationsswimming martial arts airborne intelligence collection demolitionand rigorous physical ﬁtness are typical of elite units throughout theworld discipline is strong and harsh with an emphasis placed on intensive physical training and political indoctrination when training iscompleted the trainee is awarded senior nco or junior ofﬁcer rankand assigned to an operational unit for the remainder of his career during combat operations it can be expected that many deepstrike sof personnel will be attired in civilian clothing or south korean military uniforms inﬁltrations will normally occur at night or during periods of limited visibility with the assistance of escorts who are familiar with the area the equipment carried by most sof personnel will vary considerably depending on the mission typical equipment will include dagger andor bayonet pistols to include silenced versions riﬂes ak47 orm16 submachine guns hand grenadesdemolitions rocket launchersrpg7 or at3 60mm mortars or other allied weapons north korean sof inﬁltration methods into cfc rear areas will include overland through tunnels under the dmz air and from the sea thenkaf will support sof operations with airborne inﬁltration and resupply missions the primary aerial insertion aircraft will be the an2colt and helicopters the nkn will support sof operations by usingamphibious operations covert sea inﬁltration and resupply the principal vessels that will be used to support these operations will be thekong bang iiiiii nampo ab lcpa aircushioned andnampo lcps in addition minisubmarine and semisubmersibleinsertion craft

surveillance and reporting and troop discipline at all levels isessential for limiting infectious disease and environmental health risks the primary infectious disease risks are from scrub typhus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome korean hemorrhagic fever and japaneseencephalitis risks from food and waterborne diseases include diarrheal diseases typhoid and paratyphoid fevers and hepatitis risksmay vary among geographic areas and seasons environmental healthrisks are primarily attributable to extremes of heat and cold dependingon the region and season and poor food and water sanitation unregulated industry and agriculture heavily pollute air water and soilresources preventive countermeasures are the key to combat strength and their implementation and continued emphasis must be command responsibility use of local and regional food water and ice sources withoutproper inspection and approval by us medical personnel militarypublic health veterinary and preventive medicine units

is an acute mosquitoborne infec tion of the central nervous system it is frequently associated with ricegrowing areas greatest risk period is from may through late septemberit is found countrywide in areas where mosquitobreeding sites and pigrearing areas coexist the last major epidemic of japanese encephalitisin the rok occurred during 1982 with 1197 reported cases amonglocal nationals human cases of the disease have decreased in the rokpartially because of national vaccination program and changes in agricultural practices korean hemorrhagic fever this was disease of historic signiﬁcance to us military forces in the korean war the disease continues toexhibit low level of annual incidence 0 to 5 cases among us forcesper year primary transmission is from inhaling airborne dust particlescontaminated with infective rodent excreta or saliva risk occurs countrywide and yearround although peak disease incidence occurs october through december elevated risk is associated with dusty dryconditions and peak rodent populations korean hemorrhagic fever ischaracterized by an abrupt onset of fever of 3 to 8 days durationprostration backache headache abdominal pain anorexia and vomiting 149 typhus typhus includes any of several forms of infectious diseases caused by microorganisms of the genus rickettsia it is characterizedby severe headache sustained fever depression and red rashes mitesare the primary vector of scrub typhus an infection prevalent wherescrub brush and secondary growth vegetation coexist in south korea90 percent of all scrub typhus cases occurred between october anddecember louseborne epidemic and ﬂeaborne murine typhus arecontracted by scratching louse and ﬂea feces into the skin respectivelylouseborne typhus has been responsible for large epidemics in koreaand is still threat under adverse circumstances such as war or naturaldisaster sporadic outbreaks of ﬂeaborne typhus have occurred aroundseaports and warehouse areas helminthic infections these infections include ascariasis clonorchia sis and hookworm infection transmission primarily occurs when theskin comes in contact with soil or water containing any of large varietyof parasitic intestinal worms rabies before 1975 rabies was serious concern on the korean pen insula since 1976 there have been only two cases of human rabies inthe rok with none occurring since 1984

threat for troops deployed to the korean peninsula bacterial viral parasitic and viral causes are all possible local food and water should be considered contaminated unless otherwise indicatedby medical personnel if you get travelers diarrhea drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated 150 hepatitis hepatitis infection rates are moderate to high in local populations most us personnel have immunity and are susceptible to this disease enure shots are up to date prior to deployment cholera extensive countrywide outbreaks occurred throughout the summers of 1995 and 1996 and affected

usually are plentiful but seasonal shortages occur the rokswater sources include streams springs wells lakes and reservoirs supplies are adequate although shortages have been reported in urban areasduring summer in the dprk major cities use slow sand ﬁltration and chlorination to treat water however contamination occurs during distribution becauseof seepage and back siphoning although some urban water supplies aredelivered via individual house hookups most households obtain waterfrom public taps in the rok municipal water is supplied to more than50 percent of the population countrywide and to nearly 100 percent inthe larger cities roks drinking water needs are not being met becauseof inadequate treatment and storage capacities obsolete equipment andlagging government investment

against disease n avoid stagnant water stagnant water is breeding ground for both diseases and diseasecarrying insects like mosquitos areas withmany stagnant pools such as rice paddies marshes or junk pilesshould be avoided if possible 154 n protect yourself against mosquito bites to reduce the risk of contract ing malaria and japanese encephalitis protection from mosquitos and other biting ﬂies can be accomplished by the use of screened eating and sleeping quarters including head and bed nets and by limiting the amount of outside activity during the eveningnight hours ifpossible use plenty of insect repellent and keep sleeves rolled downespecially during field operations and at night the repellent lotionshould be applied to exposed skin including ears face and neck itsarea of application should extend 2 to 3 inches under the edges of theuniform to prevent biting insects from crawling into those areas n keep mites out of the campsite this can be done by clearing camp sites of nonwoody low brush and scrub vegetation and by the useof insect repellent on the skin and clothing n avoid breathing dust and dirt to reduce risk of contracting korean hemorrhagic fever use dust masks when necessary other dust control measures include wet sweeping wetting roads etc n maintain an effective complete police of the area particularly in the field the number of mosquitos and other hazardous pests mites ticks ﬂeas and rodents in the area will be greatly reduced by theeliminationproper disposal of all open waterholding containerssuch as empty cans tires etc waste materials and human waste n avoid extended contact of bare skin with the soil particularly in rural areas many parasites can penetrate the skin poor sanitation practices throughout the korean peninsula greatly increase the risk ofthis type of infection particularly in rural areas and areas where thesoil is moist and rotting vegetation is present the soil in these areasmay be contaminated with infected animal feces so direct contactwith bare skin can result in infection prevention of infection involvesminimizing soilskin contact as much as possible so do not gobarefoot even in the campsite avoid sleeping on bare groundduring ﬁeld operations do not use mud or vegetation for camouﬂage 155 n keep as dry as possible many disease organisms are transmitted to man by direct skin contact with water or wet vegetation to avoidbecoming infected by these organisms avoid fresh water contactwhen the mission permits swimming wading and crossing flooded fields should be avoided to the greatest extent possible also keeping dry will greatly reduce the likelihood of having skin problems n limit contact with local wild and domestic animals adopting pets from local animal populations is strictly forbidden if bitten orscratched by an animal thoroughly cleanse the woundskin area withsoap or detergent even if there is broken skin and seek medicalassistance immediately this includes snake bites n avoid engaging in sexual activities with local persons particularly prostitutes all deploying personnel must be educated and convinced of the serious risk of hivstd infection associated with prostitutes abstinence is your best protection against infection with an std though not 100 percent effective condoms will greatly reduce yourrisk of becoming infected with an std n be extremely careful about eating and drinking the safest bet is to restrict the diet to food and drink only from approved sources partic ularly during field operations high risk food items raw seafood or shellﬁsh fresh eggs dairy products and lettuce or other uncookedvegetables should be avoided unless from ofﬁcially approvedsources do not use local water for drinking or brushing teeth local ice is also considered unreliable if local water must be used boil ordisinfect with iodine tablets per label instructions ordinarychlorine bleach 2 to 4 drops per quart allow 30 minutes contactwill also disinfect water make sure all food especially meat is thoroughly cooked and served hot avoid salads or raw foods of any kind fresh fruit is safe for consumption if you peel it dairy products represent avery high risk of disease if not pasteurized 156 n maintain as strict standard of personal hygiene as possible at all times one of the best ways to stay healthy when in an unsanitary environment is to frequent handwashing particularly prior to meals toothbrushing or touching the eyesface any open cuts or scrapesshould be treated with disinfectant and cleaned repeatedly untilhealed sanitary disposal of human waste ﬂy control and enforcedhandwashing should be priority measures in the ﬁeld n see medic if you are sick report to appropriate medic if diarrhea cough fever weakness or any symptom that

individual protective measures individual protective measures are the conscious actions which people take to guard themselves against physical harm these measures caninvolve simple acts such as locking your car and avoiding areas wherecrime is rampant when physical protection measures are combinedthey form personal security program the object of which is to makeyourself harder target the following checklists contain basic individual protective measures that if understood and followed may signiﬁcantly reduce your vulnerability towards the security threats overseasforeign intelligence security services and terrorist organizations ifyou are detained or taken hostage following the measures listed in thesechecklists may inﬂuence and improve your treatment n avoid any actions or activities that are illegal improper or indiscreet n guard your conversation and keep sensitive papers in your custody at all times n take it for granted that you are under surveillance by both technical and physical means including communications monitoring telephone telex mail and radio photography search eavesdropping in hotels ofﬁces and apartments n do not discuss sensitive matters on the telephone in your room in car particularly in front of an assigned driver protective measures against foreign intelligence and security services e2 n do not leave sensitive personal or business papers in your room in the hotel safe in locked suitcase or briefcase in unattended cars ofﬁces trains or planes open to photography from the ceiling in wastebaskets as drafts or doodles n do not try to defeat surveillance by trying to slip away from follow ers or by trying to locate bugs in your room these actions willonly generate more interest in you if you feel you are under surveillance act as natural as possible get to the safest location possibleyour ofﬁce hotel us embassy and contact your superior n avoid offers of sexual companionship they may lead to room raid photography and blackmail prostitutes in many countries report tothe police work for criminal organization or are sympathetic toinsurgent or terrorist organizations in other words antius othersmay be employed by an intelligence service n be suspicious of casual acquaintances and quick friendships with local citizens in intelligenceterrorist threat countries in many countries people tend to stay away from foreigners and do not readily oreasily make contact many who actively seek out friendships withamericans may do so as result of government orders or at the leastfor personal gain in your personal contacts follow these guidelines n do not attempt to keep up with your hosts in social drinking n do not engage in black market activity for money or goods n do not sell your possessions n do not bring in or purchase illegal drugs e3 n do not bring in pornography n do not bring in religious literature for distribution you may bring one bible koran or other religious material for your own personaluse n do not seek out religious or political dissidents n do not take ashtrays towels menus glasses or other mementos from hotels or restaurants n do not accept packages letters etc from local citizens for delivery to the us n do not make political comments or engage in political activity n do not be lured into clandestine meetings with wouldbe informants or defectors n be careful about taking pictures in some countries it is unwise to take photographs of scenes that could be used to make unfavorablecomparisons between us and latin standards of living or other cultural differences avoid taking any photographs from moving busestrains or aircraft the following picture subjects are clearly prohibited in most coun tries where an intelligence or terroristinsurgent threat is evident police or military installations and personnel bridges fortiﬁcations railroad facilities tunnels elevated trains border areas industrial complexes port complexes airports e4 most intelligence and security services in threat countries detain persons for wide range of real or imagined wrongs the best advice of courseis to do nothing that would give foreign service the least reason to pickyou up if you are arrested or detained by host nation intelligence orsecurity however remember the following n always ask to contact the us embassy you are entitled to do so under international diplomatic and consular agreements to whichmost countries are signatories n phrase your request appropriately in third world countries how ever making demands could lead to physical abuse n do not admit to wrongdoing or sign anything part of the detention ritual in some threat countries is written report you will be asked ortold to sign decline to do so and continue demanding to contact theembassy or consulate n do not agree to help your detainer the foreign intelligence or secu rity service may offer you the opportunity to help them in return forreleasing you foregoing prosecution or not informing your employeror spouse of your indiscretion if they will not take simple delaya ﬁrm commitment by saying that you have to think it over n report to your supervisor immediately once your supervisor is informed the embassy or consulate security ofﬁcer needs to beinformed depending on the circumstances and your status theembassy or consulate may have to provide you assistance in departing the country expeditiously n report to your units security ofﬁcer and your services criminal inves tigative branch upon returning to the us this is especially importantif you were unable to report to the embassy or consulate in countryremember you will not be able to outwit foreign intelligence organization do not compound your error by betraying your country what to do if you are detained e5 terrorism may seem like mindless violence committed without logic or purpose but it isnt terrorists attack soft and undefended targets bothpeople and facilities to gain political objectives they see as out of reachby less violent means many of todays terrorists view one as innocent thus injury and loss of life are justiﬁed as acceptable means togain the notoriety generated by violent act in order to support theircause because of their distinctive dress speech patterns and outgoing person alities americans are often highly visible and easily recognized whenthey are abroad the obvious association of us military personnel withtheir government enhances their potential media and political worth ascasualties or hostages other us citizens are also at risk includingpolitical ﬁgures police intelligence personnel and vips such as businessmen and celebrities therefore you must develop comprehensive personal security pro gram to safeguard yourself while traveling abroad an awareness of thethreat and the practice of security procedures like those advocated incrime prevention programs are adequate precautions for the majorityof people while total protection is impossible basic common senseprecautions such as an awareness of any local threat elimination of predictable travel and lifestyle routines and security consciousness at yourquarters or work locations signiﬁcantly reduce the probability of successof terrorist attacks to realistically evaluat your individual security program you must understand how terrorists select and identify their victims terroristsgenerally classify targets in terms of accessibility vulnerability andpolitical worth symbolic nature these perceptions may not be basedon the persons actual position but rather the image of wealth or importance they represent to the public for each potential target risk versus gain assessment is conducted to determine if terrorist can victimize protective measures against the foreign terrorist threat e6 target without ramiﬁcations to the terrorist organization it is during this phase that the terrorist determines if target is hard or soft ahard target is someone who is aware of the threat of terrorism andadjusts his personal habits accordingly soft targets are oblivious to thethreat and their surroundings making an easy target identiﬁcation by name is another targeting method gathered from air craft manifests unitduty rosters public documents whos who or thesocial register personnel ﬁles discarded mail or personal papers intrash many targets are selected based upon their easily identiﬁable symbols or trademarks such as uniforms luggage seabags or dufﬂe bagsblatant national symbols currency tatoos and clothing and decals andbumper stickers security while traveling travel on temporary duty tadtdy abroad may require you to stay in commercial hotels being away from your home duty station requiresincreasing your security planning and awareness this is especiallyimportant when choosing and checking into hotel and during your residence there the recent experiences with airport bombings and airplane hijacking suggest some simple precautions n you should not travel on commercial aircraft outside the continental us in uniform n prior to traveling by commercial aircraft you should screen your wallet and other personal items removing any documents that iscredit cards club membership cards etc which would reveal yourmilitary afﬁliation note current usmc policy requires service members to wear two id tags with metal necklaces when on ofﬁcial business also the e7 current id card must be in possession at all times these require ments include travel to or through terrorist areas in view of theserequirements the service member must be prepared to remove andconceal these and any other items which would identify them as military personnel in the event of skyjacking n you should stay alert to any suspicious activity when traveling and keep in mind that the less time you spend in waiting areas and lobbies the better this means adjusting your schedule to reduce yourwait at these locations n you should not discuss your military afﬁliation with anyone during your travels because it increases your chances of being singled out asa symbolic victim n in case of an incident you should not confront terrorist or present threatening image the lower proﬁle you present the less likely youwill become victim or bargaining chip for the terrorists and yoursurvivability increases surviving hostage situation the probability of anyone becoming hostage is very remote however as member of the armed forces you should always consider yourselfa potential hostage or terrorist victim and reﬂect this in planning youraffairs both personal and professional you should have an uptodatewill provide next of kin with an appropriate powersofattorney andtake measures to ensure your dependents ﬁnancial security if necessaryexperience has shown that concern for the welfare of family members isa source of great stress to kidnap victims do not be depressed if negotiation efforts appear to be taking long time remember chance of survival actually increases with time thephysical and psychological stress while hostage could seem overpowering but the key to your wellbeing is to approach captivity as e8 sion maintaining emotional control alertness and introducing order into each day of captivity will ensure your success and survival withhonor during interaction with captors maintaining selfrespect and dignity can be keys to retaining status as human being in the captors eyescomplying with instructions avoiding provocative conversations political religious etc and establishing positive relationship willincrease survivability being polite and freely discussing insigniﬁcantand nonessential matters can reinforce this relationship under circumstance should classiﬁed information be divulged if forced topresent terrorist demands to the media make it clear that the demandsare those of the captors and that the plea is not made on your ownbehalf you must remember that you are an american service memberconduct yourself with dignity and honor while maintaining yourbearing hostages sometimes are killed during rescue attempts consequently you should take measures to protect yourself during such an actiondrop to the ﬂoor immediately remaining still and avoiding any suddenmovement select safe corner if it offers more security than the ﬂoordo not attempt to assist the rescuing forces but wait for instructionsafter the rescue do not make any comment to the media until you havebeen debriefed by appropriate us authorities f1 appendix f first aidhot and cold weather survival first aid first aid is the immediate treatment administered to casualty before they can reach medical assistance prompt and correct ﬁrst aid for wounds will not only speed healing but will often save lifeand that life may be yours the most important points are to remain calm and use common sense this short guide is intended as an emergency reference the tactical situation and the expertise of the personnel present may inﬂuence treatment decisions the four priority lifesaving steps in ﬁrst aid are restore breathing and pulse stop bleedingprotect the woundprevent or treat shock vital signs to feel for pulse 1 place the tips of index and middle ﬁngers on the thumb side of the casualtys wrist to feel for pulse do not use your thumb as this will confuse the casualtys pulse with your own 2 if pulse cannot be felt at the wrist check the carotid pulse gently with your ﬁngertips it is located in groove next to the windpipe deep in the neck or the femoral pulse deep in the groin 3 once pulse has been located count the number of beats in 15 sec onds and multiply by 4 or if the pulse is very slow or irregular count for 60 seconds pulse rate may vary depending on the casualtys condition f2 the normal adult male heart rate is between 70 to 80 beats minute for female the rate is 75 to 80 and for young child 82 to 180 however excitement exercise or fever may increase the rate be sure to note whether the pulse is weak full bounding or irregular look and listen for breathing look for the rise and fall of the chest if it is cold there may be frost on the casualtys breath place your ear near their mouth and listen for breathing note whether the breathing is regular rapid shallow or shows signs of difﬁculty check airway for obstructions check for wounds and injuries look at the casualty from head to foot checking for bleeding open wounds external signs of internal injuries and other problems remember that many wounds particularly bullet wounds have both an entrance and exit hole check for both cpr artiﬁcial respiration if the casualty is not breathing check airway and remove any obstruc tions using hooked ﬁngers mouthtomouth method with patient lying on back hold jaw well open while bending head back to prevent tongue from falling and blocking airway hold nostrils closed with other hand place mouth over patients mouth and exhale watch for chest to rise as you blow gently into patients lungs if chest does not rise perform an abdominal thrust to remove any obstruction the heimlich maneuver take breath while watching for fall of casualtys exhale for child do not blow exhale normally or in the case of baby in gentle puffs blowing forcefully into childs mouth can damage delicate lungs f3 armlift method if mouth to mouth technique is not possible due to facial injury or nbc contamination use the armlift method with casualty on back check airway for obstructions and kneel behind the casualtys head grasp the casualtys hands and place them on the lower ribs rock forward pressing downward and forcing air out of the casualtys lungs when you meet ﬁrm resistance lift the arms upward and backward as far as possible this process of lifting and stretching the arms increases the size of the chest cavity and draws air into the lungs repeat cycle of pressliftstretch repeat either method as quickly as possible for ﬁrst six inﬂations then at 12 repetitions per minute until normal breathing is reestablished dont give up if pulse start alternating cardiac resuscitation and artiﬁcial respira tion give 2 full breaths for each cycle of 15 compressions in single rescuer cpr cardiac resuscitation regardless of the method of artiﬁcial respiration if there is pulse and after 10 to 15 seconds there is apparent improvement in the casualtys condition cardiac resuscitation external heart massage should be started there is time to lose if the rescuer cant feel pulse he is going to have to circulate the blood as well as breathe for the casualty external chest compression the casualty must be always in the hor izontal and supine lying on their back position when external chest compression is performed during cardiac arrest even during properly performed chest compression inadequate blood ﬂow to the brain may exist when the body is in an upright position 1 with the middle and index ﬁngers of the lower hand locate the lower margin of the casualtys rib cage on the side next to the rescuer 2 run the ﬁngers along the rib cage to the notch where the ribs meet the sternum in the center of the lower chest f4 3 with the middle ﬁnger on the notch place the index ﬁnger next to the middle ﬁnger on the lower end of the sternum 4 place the heel of the other hand which had been used on the fore head to maintain head position on the lower half of the sternum and just next to the index ﬁnger which is next to the middle ﬁnger that located the notch the long axis of the heel of your hand should be placed on the long axis of the breastbone this will keep the main line of force of compression on the breastbone and decrease the chance of rib fracture 5 remove the ﬁrst hand from the notch and place it on top of the hand on the sternum so that hands are parallel and directed straight away from the rescuer 6 the ﬁngers may be either extended or interlaced but must be kept off the chest 7 straighten the elbows by locking them and position your shoulders directly over your hands so that the thrust for external chest compression is straight down if the thrust is other than straight down the torso has tendency to roll part of the effort is lost and the chest compression is less effective and requires an inefﬁcient amount of effort 8 to compress the sternum of normalsize adult you must push with enough force to depress the breastbone 1 12 to 2 inches with each compression you want to squeeze the heart or increase the pressure within the chest so that blood moves through the body you must compress at rate of 80 to 100 times per minute 9 if you use the weight of your body you do not depend on the strength of your arms and shoulders as much instead of having to push from your shoulders you let the natural weight of your body falling forward provide the force to depress the casualtys sternum keep arms straight 10 do not lift your hands off the chest or change their position in any way because correct hand position may be lost bouncing compressions must be avoided since they are less effective and are more likely to cause injury and additional problems f5bleeding external bleeding falls into the following classiﬁcations arterial blood vessels called arteries carry blood away from the heart and through the body cut artery issues bright red blood from the wound in distinct spurts or pulses this is the most serious type of bleeding and needs to be controlled promptly venous venous blood is blood that is returning to the heart through blood vessels called veins steady ﬂow of dark red maroon or bluish blood characterizes bleeding from vein capillary the capillaries are extremely small vessels that connect the arteries with the veins capillary bleeding most commonly occurs in minor cuts and scrapes some methods for bleeding control are direct pressure elevation or tourniquet direct pressure the most effective way to control external bleeding is by applying pressure directly over the wound it has to be both ﬁrm enough to stop the bleeding and maintained long enough to seal off the damaged surface if bleeding continues after having applied direct pressure for 30 minutes apply pressure dressing thick dressing of gauze or other suitable material applied directly over the wound and held in place with tightly wrapped bandage elevation raising an injured extremity as high as possible above the hearts level slows blood loss by aiding the return of the blood to the heart and lowering the blood pressure at the wound however elevation alone will not control bleeding entirely you must also apply direct pressure over the wound tourniquet use tourniquet only when direct pressure over the bleed ing point and all other methods failed to control the bleeding if you leave tourniquet in place too long the damage to the tissues can lead to gangrene and loss of the limb later an improperly applied tourniquet can also cause permanent damage to the nerves and other tissues at the site on the constriction f6 if you must use tourniquet place it around the extremity between the wound and the heart 5 to 10 cms about the wound site never place it directly over the wound or fracture use stick as handle to tighten it only enough to stop the blood ﬂow when you have tightened the tourniquet bind the free end of the stick to the limb to prevent unwinding after you secure the tourniquet clean and bandage the wound sucking chest wound 1 examine casualty and expose large area around the wound remember to check for exit wound on opposite side cut away clothing if necessary 2 all penetrating chest wounds will be treated as sucking chest wounds note the characteristic hissing sucking and ﬂuttering noise that is produced as the patient breathes may not be present 3 sucking chest wound must be closed immediately by any means available use the palm of your hand initially to seal the wound and prevent additional air from entering the chest thoracic cavity the wound should be sealed after the patient forcibly exhales treatment should not be delayed to prepare dressings 4 prepare an air tight occlusive dressing of plastic sterility should be maintained to prevent further wound contamination the rescuer might consider using the inside of the plastic wrappers from trauma pads iv bags or other medical supplies as these are relatively sterile the occlusive dressing should be at least 2 inches wider than the diameter of the wound 5 cut plastic to required size place in palm of hand clean side up and apply directly to the wound secure three sides of the plastic to the patient with 3inch adhesive tape have the patient forcibly exhale at the end of the exhalation seal the remaining side with adhesive tape when sweating prevents maintaining seal ie tape does not stick to the patient or if the wound is massive trauma pads should be placed with cravats f7 6 have the casualty lie on the injured side to allow the lung on the uninjured side to expand more freely treat for shock and evacuate 7 reassess patients vital signs frequently respiration rate and quality breath sounds blood pressure and pulse 8 should the patient develop increasing respiratory difﬁculty and extreme restlessness and anxiety air trapped in the chest cavity tension pneumothorax must be suspected the signs of tension pneumothorax are blueness of skin cyanosisb tracheal deviationc weak rapid pulsed decreased or lowered blood pressure hypotensionif tension pneumothorax is suspected immediately lift on corner of the occlusive dressing to break the seal and allow the release of excessive air pressure from the thoracic cavity the patients condition should improve as the pressure is released the occlusive dressing should then be resealed after the patient forcibly exhales other wounds head elevate head clean the airway and protect wounded position head to allow drainage from mouth do not give morphine jaw clean and maintain airway stop bleeding with direct pressure do not bandage mouth shut support jaw position head to allow drainage from mouth belly do not touch or replace organs use loose dry sterile dressing give food or liquids shock signssymptoms pale clammy weak skin nervousness and thirst they may pass out f8 first aid 1 lay patient on back elevate feet loosen clothing keep warm 2 feed hot liquids if conscious3 turn head to side if unconscious remember shock can kill sprains fractures and dislocations signssymptoms localized pain and swelling possibly accompanied by discoloration if fractured bone protrudes through the surface of the skin it is considered compound fracture and the wound should be treated accordingly dislocations and fractures may exhibit obvious deformity first aid 1 remove clothing around the site of the affected area or dislocation if necessary cut clothing rather than causing further injury or discomfort 2 prior to and following splinting check blood circulation and for feeling 3 splint all fractures in manner which immobilizes both the joint above and the joint below the fracture site 4 fracture joints should gently be returned to splinting position if this can be accomplished without using excessive force or causing the patient to experience extreme pain 5 joints that cannot be gently returned to splinting position should be splinted in their current position 6 straighten fracture of long bone with gentle traction prior to splinting 7 cover all open wounds with sterile dressings prior to application of splint 8 pad all splints to prevent excessive pressure9 immobilize fractures prior to evacuating f9 10 splint fractures of the lower arm with the hand in position of func tion 11 apply gentle traction while splinting12 leave ﬁngers and toes exposed if possible13 splint should not impair circulation14 elevate the extremity following immobilization where possible15 elevate the injury and for sprains apply ice to the affected area peri odically for approximately 24 to 48 hours following the injury 16 for dislocations immobilize and apply ice to the affected area peri odically for approximately 24 to 48 hours following the injury hot weather survival key factor in hot weather survival is understanding the relationship between physical activity air temperature and water consumption your bodys normal temperature is 369 c 986 f your body gets rid of excess heat cools off by sweating the principle cause of water loss if person stops sweating during periods of high air temperature and heavy work or exercise he will quickly develop heat stroke this is medical emergency that requires immediate medical attention the ﬁgure on page f10 shows daily water requirements for various work levels understanding how the air temperature and your physical activity affect your water requirements allows you to take measures to get the most from your water supply these measures are n find shade get out of the sun n place something between you and the hot ground n limit your movements n conserve your sweat wear your complete uniform to include your tshirt your clothing will absorb your sweat keeping it against yourskin so that you gain its cooling effect f10 b c30 25 20 15 10 5 0 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 daily mean air temperature

day is 50 degrees c horizontal scale ones water requirement for the day will be approximately 25 liters vertical scale f11 n do not allow your thirst to be guide for your need for water you are already 2 percent dehydrated by the time you crave ﬂuids drinking water at regular intervals helps your body remain cool anddecreases sweating conserve your ﬂuids by reducing activity duringthe heat

irritability and nausea 610 percent loss results in dizziness headache labored breathing salivation indistinct speech and inability to walk an 1120 percent loss results in delirium swollen tongue inability to swallow dim vision painful urination and numbness greater than 20 percent ﬂuid loss is usually fatal always drink adequate amounts of ﬂuid at the ﬁrst signs of dehydration get in the shade keep cool loosen clothes and rest consume water with little dissolved salt pinch per pint heat cramps the loss of salt due to excessive sweating causes heat cramps symp toms are moderate to severe muscle cramps in legs arms andor abdomen these symptoms may start as mild muscular discomfort you should now stop all activity get in the shade and drink water if you fail to recognize the early symptoms and continue your physical activity you will have severe muscle cramps and pain treat as for heat exhaustion below heat exhaustion large loss of body water and salt causes heat exhaustion symptoms are headache mental confusion irritability excessive sweating weakness dizziness cramps and pale moist cold clammy skin immediately get the casualty under shade make them lie on stretcher or similar item about 45 cm off the ground loosen their clothing sprinkle f12 with water and fan the casualty have them drink small amounts of water every 3 minutes ensure they stay quiet and rest heat stroke this is severe heat injury caused by extreme loss of water and salt and the bodys inability to cool itself the casualty may die if not cooled immediately symptoms are lack of sweat hot and dry skin headache dizziness fast pulse nausea and vomiting and mental confusion leading to unconsciousness immediately get the casualty to shade loosen clothing and lay them on stretcher or similar item 45 cm off the ground pour water on and fan them massage their arms legs and body if the casualty regains consciousness let them drink small amounts of water every 3 minutes cold weather survival effects of cold in extreme cold soldier can become numb and indifferent to non essential tasks essential tasks require more time and effort it has been repeatedly demonstrated that at temperatures lower than 10 f all other problems lose signiﬁcance in the personal battle for survival the human body must be protected to remain functional it must be kept clean dry and reasonably warm and normal body processes must be maintained rest and nourishment are vital remember four basic rules n keep in shape n drink plenty of water n eat to keep ﬁt n maintain positive attitude windchill when high wind is blowing we feel much colder than when it is calm windchill is measure of the combined effects of wind and temperature to effectively gauge it some scale must be used the most commonly used is the windchill chart the windchill chart shown on page f13 f13 is simple and practical guide showing when cold weather is dan gerous and when exposed ﬂesh is likely to freeze cold weather clothing cold weather clothing systems use the design principles of insulate layer and ventilate insulation reduces the amount of body heat lost to the environment by regulating the amount of insulation you can regulate the amount of body heat lost layering several layers of clothing provide more insulation and ﬂexi bility than one heavy garment even if the heavy garment is as thick as the combined layers the secret is dead air space between layers the more dead air space the greater the insulating value layers can be wind speed knots mph calm calm 3 6 5 7 10 10 11 15 16 1915 20 20 23

temperature by allowing the wearer to get rid of excess heat and body moisture ventilate either by opening the clothing or by removing insulating layers before you start to sweat remember the acronym cold to quickly check your adherence to the cold weather clothing principles keep it c lean avoid verheating wear it l oose and in layers and keep it d ry removing snow and frost before entering shelter is particularly important in keeping clothing dry effects of cold weather on nourishment caloric intake basic fact of cold weather operations is that soldiers must eat more than usual to function in cold weather the greater part of what you eat and drink maintains body heat while small proportion produces energy for physical work approximately 4500 calories per day are necessary to do hard continuous work fluids the body loses liquid at an exceptional rate in arctic conditions due to evaporation exertion and low humidity however carefully you adjust clothing and ventilation the heavy exertion of movement on foot and preparation of bivouacs and defenses exacts its toll in sweat and loss of moisture in the breath these liquids must be regularly replaced preferably by hot drinks which if they contain sugar have the additional advantage of providing extra calories cold injuries the destructive inﬂuence of cold on the human body falls into two cate gories nonfreezing and freezing injuries nonfreezing injuries chilbains this is superﬁcial tissue injury of the hands ears or nose which occurs after prolonged exposure of the bare skin to temperatures above freezing it appears most often when high winds and high humidity accompany low but nonfreezing temperatures symptoms include an initial pallor of the exposed areas there will be redness swelling f15 increased warmth and sensation of itching after rewarming superﬁ cial blisters or ulcers may appear with repeated episodes treatment n in the initial stages gradually rewarm exposed areas at room temperature n if the face is involved you may simply hold warm hand to the area n if the hands are affected place them in the armpits or crotch nif blisters form gently cleanse the area and protect it to avoid infection prevention navoid prolonged exposure to the elements nprotect the obvious exposed areas with adequate clothing and covering trench footimmersion foot trench foot and immersion foot are injuries caused by the prolonged exposure of skin to cold water or dampness at temperatures usually ranging from just above freezing to 50f in the early stages the feet and toes are cold numb and

cold temperatures also cause loss of body heat which can result in hypothermia symptoms include uncontrollable shivering trouble walking and poor coordination difﬁculty speaking sluggish thinking disorientation and an almost total disinterest in the surroundings in later stages shivering stops and is replaced by strong muscular rigidity exposed skin may become blue and puffy when the casualtys temperature drops below 86f cardiac irregularities occur treatment nprevent any further heat loss nget the casualty out of the wind and into the best available shelter nreplace wet clothing with dry wrap casualty in warm blankets or in sleeping bag if one is available nplace as much insulation as possible between the casualty and theground nadd heat by the best available means to the casualtys neck groinand sides of the chest caution do not apply heat to extremities nif the casualty is conscious give him warm ﬂuids if able to eat givecandy or sweetened foods nif casualty is unconscious he should be remain on his back withhead tilted back to ensure open airway ndo not massage the casualty ndo not give alcohol to the casualty nget the casualty to medical help as quickly as possible prevention nstay physically ﬁt nkeep active nuse the uniform properly and keep it dry neat properly and oftenf17ndrink plenty of ﬂuids at least 35 quarts per day when performing hard work nbe prepared for and know how to deal with rapid changes in weather nbivouac early before fatigue impairs judgement dehydration dehydration is often an overlooked cold weather injury see page f11 prevention nthe minimum daily ﬂuid requirement for persons doing hard physical work in the cold is 35 quarts per day nby the time you feel thirsty you are already dehydrated drinkwhenever you have chance particularly at halts during movementon foot nall canteens should be full before any type of movement duringwhich resupply will be difﬁcult ndo not drink coffee when water is scarce it will pass through youalmost as fast as you drink it water should be your ﬁrst choice ncheck urine spots in the snow dark yellow or brown indicates dehydration carbon monoxide poisoning carbon monoxide co is deadly odorless colorless poison given off by stoves lanterns and engine exhaust there are various symptoms including headache dizziness impaired vision confusion nausea palpitations weakness andor muscle pain bright red color appears on lips and skin casualty may become drowsy and collapse without warning treatment nmove casualty to open air nkeep casualty still and warm nadminister mouthtomouth resuscitation if casualty is not breathing or is breathing irregularly nadminister cardiopulmonary resuscitation if necessaryf18nmedevac as soon as possible prevention nensure that stoves and lanterns are functioning properly nuse stoves and lanterns in wellventilated areas nensure that tents are wellventilated nmake sure vent holes are used in snow shelters ndo not warm yourself by engine exhaust snow blindness snow blindness is temporary visual disturbance caused by ultraviolet radiation reﬂected from the snow into the eyes the danger of snow blindness is greater on cloudy day than it is on clear day because one does not have brightness as warning symptoms appear 2 to 12 hours after exposure and includes gritty and painful feeling in the eyes tears ﬂow excessively headache blurred vision and objects develop pinkish tinge treatment nrest in darkness ncover eyes with cool bandage nanalgesics or sedatives nthe injury will usually heal itself from 1 to 5 days wounds in cold weather casualties should be given ﬁrst aid treatment protected from the cold and shock effects and evacuated to an aid station without delay they should be placed in casualty bag sleeping bag or the best available substitute remember also that wounds bleed easily because the low temperature keeps blood from clotting increased bleeding increases the likelihood of shock wounds open to weather freeze quickly the body loses heat in the area around the injury as blood soaks the skin around the wound and clothing is usually torn therefore early ﬁrst aid treatment becomes even more important at low temperatures shock shock is caused by reduction of the effective circulating blood volume shock can be caused by severe injuries loss of blood pain and f19many other factors the normal reaction of the body to severe cold is very similar to its reaction to shock therefore shock usually develops more rapidly and progresses more deeply in extreme cold than in warmer temperatures symptoms include apprehension sweating pallor rapidfaint pulse coldclammy skin and thirst treatment nreassure the casualty pain can be reduced with proper positioning good bandaging and splinting nposition the stretcher so that the casualtys head and chest is lowerthan his lower body and legs about 1foot difference is right donot do this if it will cause discomfort to the casualty nkeep the casualty warm normal temperature is best ndo not move the casualty any more than necessary this does notmean movement over distance but moving casualty from onestretcher to another unnecessary lifting or turning over when bandaging or splinting or moving casualty from sleeping bag into acasualty bag etc nloosen the clothing at the neck chest and waist weather permitting nif the casualty is conscious give sips of warm soup tea cocoa coffee or another available liquid but not alcohol nthe casualty should receive medical attention as soon as possible freezing injury frostbite frostbite is the injury of tissue caused by exposure to freezing temperatures frostbite can cause the loss of limbs or other serious permanent injury it is the most common injury and is almost always preventable it seldom occurs in individuals who maintain adequate heat production frostbite is most commonly associated with an overall body heat deﬁcit resulting from inadequate equipment lack of food lack of water exhaustion injury or combination of such factors the feet are most vulnerable to serious frostbite and must receive constant attention superﬁcial frostbite this injury involves only the skin or the tissue immediately beneath it there is certain amount of whiteness or waxy appearance around the affected area frost nip superﬁcial frostf20bite which usually affects the nose face or ears appears as small patch of white on the skin after rewarming the frostbitten area will ﬁrst be numb mottled blue or purple and then will swell sting and burn for some time in more severe cases blisters will occur within 24 to 36 hours beneath the outer layer of the skin these will slowly dry up and become hard and black in about 2 weeks generally swelling of the injured area will subside if the casualty stays in bed or at complete rest it will last much longer if the casualty refuses to cooperate throbbing aching and burning of the injured part may persist for several weeks depending on the severity of the exposure after the swelling ﬁnally disappears the skin will peel and remain red tender and extremely sensitive to even mild cold and it may perspire abnormally for long time deep frostbite this is much more serious injury its damage not only involves the skin and the tissue immediately beneath it but also affects the deep tissue including the bone it is usually accompanied by large blisters in marked contrast to superﬁcial frostbite these blisters take from 3 days to week to develop swelling of the entire hand or foot will take place and may last for month or more during this period of swelling there may be marked limitation of mobility of the injured areas and blue violet or gray the worst discoloration takes place after the ﬁrst 2 days aching throbbing and shooting pains may be experienced for as long as 2 to 8 weeks treatment nfor frost nip on the face place hand or warm piece of clothing over the affected area do not rub ncold hands can be rewarmed by placing them in the casualtys arm pits or crotch cold feet can be placed against another persons stomach nremove wet or constricting clothing and protect the extremity fromfurther injury with blankets or any other dry material nsmoking drinking alcohol andor applying salves or ointments arestrictly forbidden nfor anything other than superﬁcial frostbite place the casualty in ashelter to prevent further injury attempt should be made to thawf21the frozen part medevac immediately if thawing has occurred the casualty should be considered litter patient nfollow the 15minute rule if the extremities can not be rewarmed within 15 minutes ie capillaries reﬁll feeling returns toes and ﬁngers begin to move the casualty must be treated as deep frostbitecasualty evacuate the casualty taking care to keep the affectedparts warm as
