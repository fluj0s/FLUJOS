discourse on current road home policy and procedures commentary on the restructuring of road home appeals i introduction i submitted my resignation to icf on february 21 2008 and it was accepted by icf human resources on the same day my last day is scheduled for thursday 28 2008 as an employee of the appeals office shortly after its inception i feel that it is incumbent upon to voice few matters regarding the state of the appeals department and pending office of community development policy i have listed some concerns below in particular order please take note that this list is by means an exhaustive one but details some areas that are most immediate logically problematic or simply were lodged uncomfortably in my craw i have emailed these assessments sentiments and opinions to many of my colleagues please consider this authorization to forward or print this particular document and distribute it to any parties that might benefit from its contents and would not be strictly prohibited from viewing it i am not nearly as knowledgeable about the road home hierarchy as some of you i have the utmost faith that each recipient will make good use of this particular missive however i do respectively request that amendments or edits be made to this letter that is unless you see typo ii recent and dramatic changes and proposed changes to the appeals process contacting applicants the very cornerstone and linchpin of the judicial process is strict impartiality it is the single most important characteristic of this particular mechanism and must be preserved at any cost the failure to safeguard against bias even the appearance of such undermines the credibility of any agency board or body that renders decision road home appeals was modeled in part on the appellate division of the judicial system an applicant receives determination pertaining to eligibility and the amount of their grant award if the applicant disagrees with an aspect of that award they raise that issue with the appeals department the individuals employed in appeals then review the documents on file request additional documents and determine if the applicants claim is valid and change to their overall grant award is warranted the process was objective and in line with the appellate model upon which it was patterned the newly presented practice of allowing individuals that draft reports and determine whether an applicants contention holds water is antithetical to the appeals process and engenders allegations of bias favoritism and prejudice it really is quite simple previously the individual that was addressing and ultimately determining the validity of an applicants appeal was expressly prohibited from speaking to the applicant it was wise practice to ensure that any applicant that maintained that they had been treated unfairly would not be able to cite to any contact that they might have had with the individual drafting their adr as reason for that unfavorable result in the court system ex parte communications between judge and one party are almost always prohibited this rule of court was promulgated to maintain the integrity of the court by protecting against claims of bias this rule of court has been hallowed by usage and consecrated by time and the reason for its staying power is clear objectivity and the appearance of objectivity must be upheld it is my contention that it would be unwise for appeals to depart from its current practice and allow this type of contact its introduction would belie the objectivity necessary to carry out the goals of our department b manner of restructuring department in middecember joan greer took over for acting manager mickey tassin mickey had filled the position after the departure of nicole lachance since that time the appeals department has slowed and almost come to complete stop the responsibility for this ineffectiveness must rest squarely on ms greers shoulders the practices implemented by ms greer and her regime have not proven sound and have taken far too long to put into place the causal explanations for the current state of appeals are legion and i have chosen to cite few of the most obvious defects sloppy and poorly defined internal audit was performed by individuals assigned by ms greer to assess the problems in the appeals office i do not believe clear set of goals were in mind but rather decision reached prior to any audit to model appeals after something that she already knew the resolutions department appeals has completely different mission than that of resolutions and the attempt to morph appeals into resolutions was not warranted and illconceived i maintain it was easier for ms greer to turn it into something previously known than to thoroughly investigate and then formulate plan for an improved appeals department in short not nearly enough research and investigation was done to clearly understand what elements of the appeals process would have benefited from change the continued halt and as of yet unapproved procedures and processes are illustrative of this shoddy internal audit weeks into the process and management and her appointees still did not understand some of the most basic concepts of appeals policy unfortunately far more time was spent trying to hide this lack of knowledge while holding onto their newfound positions with whiteknuckled grip than admitting their ignorance of appeals practices and procedures it was frequently the case that our new superiors and qc personnel lacked the requisite knowledge to be reviewing our work often appeals personnel work was improperly failed by qc due to this absence of knowledge lamentably many qc workers and freshly installed appeals employees did not even seem to want to try to get up to speed but instead put their minds to petty squabbles about why in fact they were correct i fail to see how this was productive in many instances management and newly appointed staff have proven combative defensive and rude the transitions could have been much smoother but the aforementioned character traits coupled with clear absence of people skills hindered any success that appeals might have enjoyed c failure to establish clear chain of command and communication upon acceptance of the managers position on an interim basis ms greer rarely if ever made herself available for consultation even if she was wearing many hats she should have been here far more if this was not possible she should have hired someone immediately to take charge in her absence furthermore with the avoidable loss of our assistant manager laila kuperman many questions were left unanswered as analysts advisors and specialists found themselves set adrift on rudderless ship with indication that clarification would be forthcoming myriad of question were posed to ms greer via email requesting policy elucidation procedure clarification and sufficiency of available documentation the vast majority received reply furthermore many matters concerning policy were given short shrift in one instance our former appraisal point of contact poc for the appeals department was told not to concern herself with policy matters but instead to produce reports policy is the engine that drives our determinations it is necessary component of every decision made by appeals any decision made without supporting policy is arbitrary and unjust any decision to approve an additional award or deny matter raised by the applicant must be based on approved policy any determination that relies on proposed policy to justify its result is invalid all approved policy should be made available and determination should contravene that policy unless it is absolutely demanded by alj decision impressive numbers and these numbers have yet to be realized in terms of production do little good if the determinations are improper and inconsistent with policy in the rare instances where meetings clarifying policy and procedure were held they often did not address key concerns it was abundantly clear that ms greer and the staff that she imported often didnt fully comprehend policy and procedure and made changes not fully appreciating the ramifications of their actions in addition when more experienced personnel would present problems with their proposed changes or trouble areas that required definitive resolution these concerns were not given the attention they deserved although countless examples of this behavior exist i will name few to provide support to my assertion the appeals department went weeks after losing catherine lyles our former appraisals poc before another individual was appointed to the position appeals personnel could not create act issues and appraisal questions were not addressed the individual that currently holds this position does not possess ample knowledge of the subject area at this time to competently fill this post the new appraisal poc should have been trained by our previous one unfortunately this was not done furthermore qaqc procedures were pieced together haphazardly where individuals without the proper training were placed in the role of quality control qc personnel were given disproportionate amount of power to the amount of substantive knowledge that was in their possession analysts were soon deluged with failed reports many of which were failed due to the fact that the qc personnel did not fully understand appeals processes and various aspects of homeowners policy to add insult to injury qc personnel often proved truculent debating policy matters and procedures with analysts and act appraisal experts when they clearly lacked the foundational information to support their conclusions many of the individuals that are currently qcing appeals efforts received little or training in the area of appeals how can someone ensure quality when they dont understand the very building blocks that make up the finished product how does obstinacy and combativeness benefit the applicant these questions are of the rhetorical variety but are easily answered and should have been asked prior to any attempt at restructuring the appeals department was undertaken lastly one individual is currently assigned over 100 state remands the louisiana state legislature during special session recently stated that 100 cases per person were too much for one person to handle t bergeron is certainly capable employee who has demonstrated amazing patience and perseverance but i happen to concur with the sentiment expressed by our appointed officials mrs bergeron has made repeated request to management for help with her overwhelming work load but until recently measures have been taken on her behalf after well over month of requests managements response has been to afford ms bergeron temporary helper strausbaugh who is not even fully at ms bergerons disposal this slipshod prophylactic measure employed by management does not remedy the situation it is my contention that team of less than three employees devoted to the task of addressing state remands fulltime could dispense with these files in an orderly and timely fashion anything less is discourteous to the applicant and deleterious to the already tattered public image of the road home d failure to retain key personnel critical failing on the part of current management was their inability or unwillingness to retain key appeals personnel the retention of longstanding appeals employees would have smoothed the transition and helped new employees gain the valuable training they so desperately need however management failed to subscribe to this school of thought but instead felt that practice of systematic ostracizing and solid cronyisms proved more prudent course of action since joan greer assumed the role of the interim manager the following individuals have resigned from appeals l kuperman c lyles harrison d lamonica and s watson many of these individuals held supervisory positions and jobs that required specialized knowledge it should also be noted that m tassin road home employee with extensive road home experience was removed from her role as acting manager and relocated to audit response the present management has opted to fill these slots with the following personnel 1 interim mgr joan greer the mere fact that ms greer serves as director of the homeowners assistance program does not mean she knows anything about the appellate process and certainly does not make her the right choice for appeals manager in corporation directors have duty to make decisions in the best interest of the corporation i maintain that her installation as interim manager was selfserving and not in the best interest of the road home as director it was her charge to find an individual that would be available for questions and handle the day to day operations of appeals ms greer has failed to satisfactorily perform these tasks i believe the previous paragraphs and present state of the appeals department substantiates this claim 2 assistant mgr w moreau it is my understanding that mr moreau has background in banking and mortgage industry i cannot speak to whether or not he is suitable for the position however i do know that he is unfamiliar with appeals and has road home experience i cannot see how this constitutes an upgrade from his predecessor laila kuperman who had substantial road home exposure and appeals experience as well as laudable leadership qualities 3 aedwards appraisals poc i know that she is longtime road home employee that has served in many capacities however she has not demonstrated any in depth knowledge of appeal or appraisal policy and practices in fact her actions have demonstrated to the contrary at minimum ms edwards would have benefited from thorough and extensive tutorial from ms lyles who formerly occupied that post it was the duty of any management personnel to keep and place individuals best suited to do the job in positions vital to the success of any business if coordination with human resources is necessary to secure the best staff for these positions then this should be of paramount concern to management upon inspection it does not appear that this was done if fact i believe that management would be hard pressed to argue that the employees currently filling these posts are better informed and are better fit for the these roles than their predecessors i certainly welcome them to try iii potential problems with proposed policy and assertions made at appeals meeting on 02222008 i would like to focus on few subjects that were discussed in the meeting held by ms greer in the appeals department on february 22 2008 the first issue raised is merely to underscore ms greers inability to comprehend the true nature of state remands the two other issues are matters of policy that were presented in that meeting that may have negative repercussions and might meet with some resistance if challenged by the applicant at the state level it is my hope if ocd has not already recognized and provided answers to these potential difficulties my suggestions might help them in future formulation of polices that touch on these areas the fallacy every state remand is mistake by us j greer 02222008 in an effort to improve road home policy frequent changes to policy by ocd are often deemed necessary however the amorphous and nebulous nature of road home policy as codified by ocd renders ms greers statement not even species it appears to be false and is in fact so furthermore the inability to clearly convey ocd policy to employees with consistent practice to disseminate information is not the fault of the analyst but rather the failure of management to establish clear uniform procedures to interpret policy and convey the information to the relevant road home personnel it is obvious mistake was made but that mistake was not necessarily by the drafter of an adr it is far more likely that the failure resides with the inability to circulate vital and up to date information to key personnel that distribute the road home decision to the applicant furthermore an administrative law judges alj decision is not always consistent with prevailing policy see below b proposed policy assignees will not be allowed to appeal grant award the denial of assignees the right to appeal is proper j greer 02222008 the assignee stands in the shoes of the assignor although the underlying logic pertaining to precluding the assignee from appeal appears proper on its face i believe that it will meet with alj resistance at later date the rationale for denial if i understood correctly is that the buyer assignee agreed the value of the property was sufficient upon agreement to purchase the damaged residence the assignee as buyer should be satisfied with the value they agreed to at close unfortunately an inherent problem appears to exist that will certainly meet with resistance when brought before an alj an alj is not judge of law but rather judge of equity and not bound by the policies set forth by ocd frequently an alj will remand case back to the road home and request an amendment to an applicants award that is inconsistent or directly contradicts current road home policy aljs will look at the totality of the circumstances when rendering their decision and decide what the alj deems to be an equitable result when an applicant seller assigns their rights they also delegate their duties to the delegateebuyer the buyer must adhere to the covenants that were originally agreed to by the seller why then should the assignee buyer not receive all the benefits that were due to the assignor seller if the value of the property was incorrect for the original applicant it was improperly valued for the assignee the assignee should not be constrained by the covenants required by the road home but precluded from pursuing all the rights previous available to the seller the seller obtained these rights legally and assigned them with explicit limitation placed on this assignment at the time of assignment the road home is in position to place ex post facto limitations on these assignment of rights this restriction is not just and i believe that eventually the aljs will view it the same way c proposed policy applicants who submitted an appraisal should not be allowed to contest the value of that appraisal if that value is used to calculate the applicants award 02222008 j greer during the application process applicants were requested to provide great deal of documentation to facilitate the calculation of their grant award one of the documents that road home called for to aid in the valuation of the applicants damaged property were appraisals in many cases the applicant complied and offered an appraisal to the road home it is now suggested that policy demands that these applicants should not be allowed to appeal their psv value if it is the actual prestorm value provided by an applicantsupplied appraisal the failure to allow these applicants to appeal their prestorm value is simply not fair the rationale for denying applicants the right to appeal when they have supplied an appraisal that is used to determine the applicants compensation award is simply this the applicant submitted the appraisal so how can they take issue with the value unfortunately several patent flaws are apparent upon close inspection first the applicant was never informed that if they submitted an appraisal that this would be the final value used to arrive at their grant award they received notice of this fact they merely submitted appraisals in the hopes that they would receive grant funds the applicant was never apprised that any appraisal submitted might be the final value used to determine their grant award it is clear that this is problematic and the very reason why we currently send out psv letters to applicants the applicant must be accorded due process provided notice and should not be penalized for providing documentation without understanding the true import of their submission to do so would be unjust secondly there is guarantee that the value provided by the applicant is an accurate value of the damage property it is quite possible that an appraiser might have made mistake the sole fact that an applicant provided an appraisal does not mean that they agreed that the value they provided was the true value of their property to reiterate the applicants submission of an appraisal does not logically indicate an assent to its value the appraisal they provided might be the only valuation ever performed on the property the applicant was then resigned to either submitting appraisal or the one that had been performed on the property it is possible that the appraisal proffered by the applicant provided an inaccurate value the road home invalidates applicant appraisals daily the applicant should be allowed recourse to challenge the value of the appraisal regardless of who provided it in conclusion the underlying justification for denying applicants who supplied an appraisal that is used in their grant calculation the right to appeal is not logically sound eventually if used to create policy it will be discovered it is flawed and will require redraft but not until several remands have made their way back to ms bergerons desk with this in mind current road home policy should grant these applicants the opportunity to ask for 1004 appraisal like any other applicant contesting psv iv conclusion first i have truly enjoyed working with many of you and feel that i am richer from the experience of having met and interacted with you on daily basis i cannot say that i will miss working in appeals but i can genuinely say that i will miss working with many of you i wish each of you the best while here at the road home and as many of you are now actively pursuing employment outside of appeals i would like to wish you the best in your respective job searches second the morale and production of the appeals department must be at an all time low even with recent and necessary ocd mandates that have lengthened the processes of our department many of the impediments to overall efficiency have originated from management is the appeals department better or worse than when headed by n lachance has the morale of appeals employees ever been lower would this virtual slowdown actually have been tolerated if our interim manager were not also director of homeowners assistance program i believe an objective response to these questions even by the parties they are directed toward would demand response in the negative will there be any real change that will result from this particular critique i suspect that only time will tell but my gut reaction is that an honest response would also require negative one i would like to thank every reader for their time wishing the all the very best i am respectfully s watson disclaimer this particular document is in way to be considered as legal advice but merely observational suggestions based on policy and experiences witnessed while at the road home although i encourage the dissemination of this particular message i stress that all actions taken on your part are your own and should only be made after thorough contemplation note the thoughts and opinions of this article are mine and mine alone the mere fact that an individual is named in this article should not be construed as an endorsement of any of my positions final note i have penned this letter in order to accurately portray the current state of the appeals office of the road home in the hopes that some changes might occur the applicants and taxpayers deserve better i believe that after true and thorough audit whether internal or external road home executives and elected officials alike would inexorably be drawn to the same conclusion
