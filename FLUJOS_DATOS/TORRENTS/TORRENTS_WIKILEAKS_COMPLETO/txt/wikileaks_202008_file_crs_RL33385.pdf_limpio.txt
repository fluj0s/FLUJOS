sales of overthe counter cold and allergy medication introduction in response to rising rates of meth amphetamine production and abuse across the country many elected officials and law enforcement officers have been exploring new methods of curtailing such activitie s one regulatory option gaining in popularity is to target the precursor chemicals that are key ingredients in methamphetamine production by placing restrictions on ove rthecounter otc sa of certain drug products most notably cold and allerg medicines that contain ephedrine pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine1 because drug products that contain these three precursor chemi cals can easily be converted into methamphetamine and because such medications are readily ava ilable at many reta il outlets limiting retail sales and reducing the opportunity for thef t of these medications is expected to reduce methamphetamine production and abuse in general federal and state legislative efforts to limit sales of otc cold and allergy remedies that contain methamphetamine precursor chemicals include proposals to require such products to be placed behind the counter restrict sales to licensed pharmacies only via prohibition on sales in other retail stores limit the number of packages that can be purchase d in single transaction and require customers to provide identification nd signature upon purchase proponents of such restrictions argue that such limits are the best way to prevent methamphetamine related crime but opponents c ontend that these restri ctions limit access for law abiding citizens who simply wish to buy medicine at the local convenience store when they catch cold2 current regulation of otc medications that contain methamphetamine precursor chemicals consists of patchwork of federal nd state laws in an array of areas at the federal level the drug enforcement agency dea enforces the controlled substances act csa which is federal statute that establishes criminal and civil sanctions for the unlawful po ssession manufacturing distribution orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33385crs2 3 21 usc 801 et seq for more information on the controlled substances act see crs report 97141

of fda approved drug products are regulated transactions if the ag determines that the drug or group of drugs is being diverted to obtain th listed chemical for purposes of producing controlled

drug administration fda regulates otc drugs under the federal food drug nd cosmetic act ffdca which governs among other things the safety and efficacy of otc medications including the approval manufacturing and distribution of such drugs4 at the state level state law enforcem ent agencies oversee the enforcement of state controlled substances laws and st ate boards of pharmacy regulate pharmacy practice thus some of the laws that govern otc medications that contain methamphetamine precursor chemicals vary from state to state until recently states had been taking more active role with respect to strengthening the sales restrictions on such drug products but the 109th congress recently enacted more stringent requirements with respect to methampheta mine or meth precursor chemicals as part of the reauthorization of the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act pl 109177 both fe deral and state laws are detailed below federal law as noted above the csa is federal stat ute that establishes criminal and civil sanctions for the unlawful possession manuf acturing distribution or importation of controlled substances the primary purpose of the csa is to facilitate the legal distribution of controlled substances for legitimate medical purposes while preventing their diversion for illegal manuf acture distribution and use over the years however the scope of the csa has expanded from controlling illegal drugs to regulating the chemicals that are used in the illicit production of those drugs since many of these precursor chemicals have legitimate uses their regulation is generally less stringent and some like ephedrine pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine are legally marketed as noncontrolled in gredients in certain otc drug products even though they are otherwise listed ch emicals that are regulated under the csa5 currently federal law places some restrictions on retail sales of pr oducts containing methamphetamine precursor chemi cals in general under the csa sales of listed chemicals that are contained in dr ug products that are lawfully marketed or distributed under the ffdca are with some exceptions not regulated transactions6 which means that retailers are not subject to the statutes detailed registration recordhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33385crs3 7 id at 823h 830 8 21 cfr 131007 130971 9 21 usc 80239av and 48 10 id at 80246 and 49 11

notion that the effort to regulate cont rolled substances s hould not unduly interfere with public access to otc drug products that have legitima medical uses more specifically under the csa any transaction by regulated seller or distributor in scheduled listed che mical product defined as product that contains ephedrine pse udoephedrine or phenylpropa nolamine and that may be lawfully marketed or distributed under th ffdca is not regulated transaction when such products are sold or purchased at retail meaning they are sold or purchased for personal use9 the term regulated seller is defined to include grocery stores general merchandise stores drug st ores mobile retail ve ndors or ot her entities whose sale of otc products that contai n methamphetamine precursor chemicals are limited almost exclusively to sales for personal use10 due to concerns about the illicit produc tion and distribution of controlled substances such as methamphetamine however retail sales of such scheduled listed chemical products are subject to number of restrictions despite the fact that they are not deemed to be regulated transacti ons under the csa for example retail sales of drug products that contain metham phetamine precursor chemicals are limited to more that 36 grams of ephedrine ps eudoephedrine or phe nylpropanolamine per person per day likewise re gulated sellers are prohib ited from selling such products in nonliquid form including gel caps unless the pr oduct is packaged in blister packs each blister containing not more than 2 dosage units or where the use of blister packs is technically infeasible the product is packaged in unit dose packets or pouches11 individuals are also prohibited from knowingly purchasing more than 9 grams of ephedrine pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamin at retail or more than 75 grams of such substances by mail order during 30day period12 in addition the csa makes it unlawful for an individual to possess listed chemical such as ephedrine pseudoephedr ine or phenylpropa nolamine with intent to engage in the unauthorized manufacture of controlled substance or to possess or distribute listed chemical while knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the chemical will be used in the unauthorized manufacture of controlled substance13 under the recent amendments the statute also authorizes the attorney general ag to

chemicals14 makes it unlawful for individuals to manufacture such chemicals in excess of the established quota15 and establishes new requirements regarding the im portation of such chemicals16 as noted above the fda also has regu latory authority over otc drugs that contain methamphetamine precursor chemicals it is the ffdca that governs among other things the safety and efficacy of otc medications including the approval manufacturing and distribution of such drugs17 under the statute there are two regulatory classifications for drugs eith er prescription or otc in general otc drugs unlike prescription drugs do not pose risk of misuse or abuse and can be safely and effectively used without the s upervision of medical practitioner thus otc drugs are usually publicly available fo r consumers to purchase for treatment of selfdiagnosed conditions because the ffdcas regulatory scheme appears to contain only two classifications for drugs either prescr iption or otc it is unclear whether the fda has the legal authority to establish third classification for drugs that could be sold behind the counter btc with th advice and assistance of licensed pharmacist category for btc drugs would make such medications more available than prescription drugs but would preserve some degree of profe ssional oversight for drugs that pose more risks than the av erage otc medication indeed some states have begun requiring pharmacies to move cold medications behind the counter in an effort to prevent their diversion for methamphetamine production because it is uncertain whether the fda has the legal authority to establish btc classification for drugs however it is unclear whether the fda could short of reclassifying otc drug products that contain methampheta mine precursor chemicals as prescription drugs impose restrictions similar to the btc requirements established in some states18 on the other hand the dea does have aut hority to impose sales restrictions on regulated chemicals including the authority to require that drug products that contain listed chemicals be kept be hind the counter where only retail employees have access and the agency has long imposed this requirement with respect to singleentity ephedrine drug products whic h are medications that contain ephedrine as the sole active medicinal ingredient19 this requirement applies to all retail outlets not just pharmacies and is designed to make it more difficult for the product to be stolen off store shelves this type of btc requirement allows retail establishments to continue to sell such medications and should be di stinguished from proposals to establish ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33385crs5 20 pl 109177 711b1 to be codi fied at 21 usc 830e1a 21 id 22 pl 109177 711b1 to be

as grocery stores and convenience stores from selling such drug products recent amendments to the csa have greatly expanded the number of otc drug products subject to the deatype of bt c requirements under these amendments which do not take effect until september 30 2006 retail llers of scheduled listed chemical products must place such pr oducts behind the counter meaning that customers may not have direct access to th product before the sa is made sellers can comply with this btc requirement by storing such products in locked cabinet that is located in an area to which the customers do not have direct access and they must deliver the product directly into the custody of the purchaser sellers who are mobile retail vendors must pl ace such products in locked cabinet and may not sell more than 75 grams of ephedrine ps euoephedrine or phe nylpropanolamine per customer during 30day period20 in addition under the amendments the ller must maintain logbook of sales of scheduled listed chemical products that identifies the product the quantity purchased the names and addresses of purchasers and the dates and times of the sales in order to purchase otc drug products containi ng methamphetamine precursor chemicals customers must pr esent photo identification sign the logbook and provide their names addresses and dates and times of sale and the seller must verify that the information entered into the logbook corresponds to the information on the photo identification and is otherwise correct finally the seller must maintain each entry in the logbook for at least two years these log book requirements however do not apply to purchases of dr ug products that contain more than 60 milligrams of pseudoephedrine21 under the amendments employees who are responsible for delivering drug products containing methamphetamine precurs or chemicals into customers custody or for obtaining payment for such products must undergo training to ensure that they understand the new csa require ments and sellers are re quired to certify to the ag that the seller has agreed to comply with the new statutory requirements and that the employees have participated in such training22 it is important to note that the bt c and logbook requirements do not apply to retail sales of otc pr oducts containing methamphetamin precursor chemicals if the seller is subject to the csas mail order reporting requirements under these requirements individuals who sell otc products c ontaining methamphetamine precursor chemicals via the postal service or any private or commercial carrier must with limited exceptions submit monthly report to the ag this report must include information regarding the name of the customer the quantity of the precursorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33385crs6 23 21 usc

mandate courts have recognized both express and implied forms of preemption 27 21 usc 903 provision of the csa shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the congress to occupy the fiel

in mailorder transactions involvi ng scheduled listed ch emical products must confirm the identify of the purchaser and they may not sell products containing more than 75 grams of ephedrine pse udoephedrine or pheny lpropanolamine per customer during 30day period24 furthermore it is important to note that the ag may exempt certain scheduled listed chemical products from the requireme nts of the csa amendments if the ag determines that the product cannot be used in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine25 finally the amendments specify that the csas preemption provisions remain in effect26 under the statutes exis ting preemption requirements27 federal controlled substances law preempts state law where state requirements are weaker but not where state requirements are stronger thus despite the recent csa amendments states remain free to enact stronger laws with respect to methamphetamine precursor drugs state laws as noted above state boards of pharmacy regulate the practice of pharmacy and state law enforcement agencies oversee stat controlled substances laws while states are not permitted to enact laws in these areas that are less strict than federal law states may pass laws that are stricter and several states have done so with respect to cold medications that contain methamphetamine precursor chemicals most of these new laws have establishe d additional sales restric tions on such medications including requiring these drugs to be placed behind the counter limiting the amount that can be purchased requiring customers to provide identification and signature upon purchase and placing such drug products on the schedule of controlled substances thus effectiv ely eliminating sales by nonpharmacy retail stores the first state to establish such re strictions was oklahoma which in 2004 enacted new law designed to crack down on the illegal production and abuse of methamphetamine in the state under th new law oklahoma added drug products containing pseudoephedrine except for co mbination products in liquid or gel formhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33385crs7 28 63 okl st 2212 29 2005 ore als 706 30 national conference of state legislatures

recently oregon further strengthened its laws with regard to cold medications that contain methamphetamine precursor chemicals enacted in 2005 the new legislation adds ephedrine pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine to schedule iii of its controlled substances schedule29 making oregon the first state in the nation to require prescriptions for medications that contain these chemicals over the past two years at least thirtynine states have followed the lead of oklahoma and oregon by enacting laws that place additiona l sales restrictions on cold medications and other products that contain thamphetamine precursor chemicals30 in addition out of concern about theft of cold remedies and in search of uniform sales policy in the face of differing state requirements several national chain stores that sell drugs containing thamphetamine precursor chemicals have voluntarily adopted new practices with respect to these products by requiring identification moving such products be hind the counter and limiting the number of packages that can be purchas ed in singe transaction31 the recent amendments to the csa are likely to result in further changes to pharmacy practices with respect to otc products containing thamphetamine precursor chemicals meanwhile drug manufacturers who are fearful of reduced profits in the wake of new sales restrictions are reportedly i nvestigating how to develop alternative drug products that cannot be as readily conve rted into methamphetamine32
