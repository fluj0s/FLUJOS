postimplementation review of unhcrs management sy stem renewal project msrp project management and sup ply chain modules ar200416603 executive summary between october 2004 and january 2005 oios conduct ed postimplementation review of unhcrs management system renewal project msrp at headquarters this report covers certain project management issues training and sec urity as well as functional issues concerning the implementation of the supply chain modules debrie fing meetings were held with the head supply management service in november 2004 and with the director msrp project in february 2005 comments and clarifications provided at the debriefings and in response to the draft report have been considered and incorporated in this final report overall assessment oios assessed the project management of msrp and th implementation of the supply chain modules as average overall they were adequately managed however some improvements in project management training and it security are wa rranted further in view of the field rollout of msrp number of measures are required to adequate ly support inventory and warehousing processes and to ensure information on items receiv ed in the field is complete project management although detailed msrp objectives had been establis hed early on related quantifiable goals were not fully developed also benchmarking msrp results was difficult as the legacy systems work processes within finance and supply m anagement had not been sufficiently measured and documented the msrp governance board did not meet regularly si nce april 2004 leaving vacuum for msrp reporting on performance and continuing activi ties to ensure continuity of project oversight an alternate chairperson should be desig nated during phase i of the system implementation change management was neglected this aspect has now been included with the field rollout as it is considered vital component of successful system change access to data from the legacy systems needs to be improved so that users can obtain information required for accounts processing and fi nancial reporting training general training for msrp was offered at an early s tage of the project information on the training sessions and the attendance of staff was n ot complete and results from user satisfaction surveys were inconclusive the setup of help facilities and subsequent training after the initial golive sessions needed some adju stments the msrp project team has considered many of these issues before the field ro llout access controls security issues and access to data from legacy systems unhcr needs to develop general security policy th at can be used as base line for all ict matters in future also given the frequent rotati on of staff members regular updating of user accounts and their access to msrp needs to be ensured the msrp project team agreed to address these matters supply management procurement activities were generally well supporte d by msrp however for the interim period until the system is fully operational organ izationwide some issues need attention like confirming the receipt of items in the field msrp should be used to develop performance indicato rs for sms also some reports in msrp did not give complete and accurate information asset management assettrak data need to be verified and cleaned prio r to loading in msrp that work should be aligned with the system rollout to the field procurement actions for nonexpendable property sho uld be the basis for the initial data input into the msrp asset management module thus avoidin g an information gap pending field offices recording of assets in assettrak inventories unhcr operates different types of warehouses inclu ding central warehouses for specialized or emergency stocks for dispatching to various loca tions as well as local warehouses normally providing nonfood items for country or re gional programmes due to this diversity unhcr needs flexible inventorywarehou system with some adjustments and upgrades msrp may sufficiently meet this need value tracking of inventories also needs to be considered particularly for highvalue stock that should be disclosed in the financial statements preparedness for field rollout oios considers that unhcr has prepared well the fie ld rollout starting in 2005 some issues may still need further attention and conside ration of importance is the access control and updating of static data such as vendor payment information bank account numbers etc the msrp project team agreed to attend to these mat ters workflow and processes need to be aligned with msrp to ensure smooth transition between msrp and fmis in the field particularly on paperb ased information also staff in smaller field offices who are not specialized in one area need to be able to manage the new msrp processes the msrp project team agreed to cover these issues during the field rollout june 2005 table of contents chapter paragraphs i introduction 1 3 ii

acknowledgement 54 i introduction 1 between october 2004 and january 2005 oios conducted postimplementation review of the unhcrs management system renewal pro ject msrp separate audit report was issued in april 2005 on issues related t the implementation of the finance modules this report deals with project management training security issues and the implementation of the supply chain modules the udit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the professional pr actice of internal auditing and was largely based on information systems audit and control asso ciation isaca guidelines 2 msrp was officially launched in mid 2002 on 5 january 2004 the finance and supply chain modules at headquarters went live th supply chain modules consist of three main components purchasing inventory and asset ma nagement within phase i activities of msrp the main objective of msrp is to enhance unhc rs operational and business management capability through realtime access to i nformation faster processing of transactions and timely decisionmaking the aim wa s to allow unhcr to increase the effectiveness of delivering services 3 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the head supply management service sms and with the msrp project director their comments as provided during the meetings have been reflected in this report also draft of this report was shared with sms and the msrp projec t director in march 2005 some clarifications from sms were received in april 2005 and they are reflected in this final report further comments were received from the msrp pro ject team ii audit objectives 4 the main objectives of the review were to assess whether the msrp project objectives had been achieved assess the adequacy of procedures and controls over the processing of data determine if the information processing complies wi th established business rules and is accurate reliable and generated timely iii audit scope and methodology 5 oios conducted general review of msrp pro ject management training and selected aspects of user access and related security arrange ments more detailed review was conducted of the msrp system performance including procedures applied in sms for msrp data input and processing 6 oios reviewed relevant documentation and in terviewed number of staff from the msrp project team and sms oios performed data int egrity tests to examine the accuracy completeness consistency and authorization of data recorded in msrp during 2004 our tests focused on the processes at headquarters 7 the review of project management training and access controls and related security was mainly based on interviews and relevant documen ts such as minutes of the governance board and business owners meetings and other repor ts 2 iv audit findings and recommendations project management msrp objectives and governance board 8 the development and initial startup of msr p was set up as project managed by project director its mission statement was defi ned in the project charter as to develop business processes and system solutions that enable all msrp stakeholders to perform current and expanded operational and financial functions wi th greatly heightened efficiency 9 the project objectives were listed as follo ws square4 create the financial and supply chain processes and systems which will allow unhcr to provide the highest level of accountabilit to its executive committee and to donors square4 increase the speed and accuracy at which goods will be purchased and distributed to unhcr beneficiaries while ensuring the most efficient possible use of funds square4 improve organization management through the improve d availability of timely accurate accounting budgeting procurement and dis tribution of information square4 achieve administrative cost savings through heighte ned operating efficiency square4 build software infrastructure that can leverage c urrent and future technologies and allow unhcr to realize system effi ciencies 10 the original project plan for implementing the finance and supply chain modules at headquarters was very ambitious the time frame fr om formal project kickoff in november 2002 to goinglive was only some 14 mont hs the original idea of sharing code and experiences with undp which was also implement ing an erp system based on peoplesoft did not materialize this required add itional efforts from the msrp team which could not bank on undps experience as planned cou pled with possibly inadequate planning insufficient user training and technical problems related to the hosting services arrangements this required the msrp project team t commit considerable resources for production support after the system had gone live i n january 2004 yet the governance board was consistently informed that the project wa s being delivered within time and budget 11 generally project should have definit scope with clear objectives one essential element is measurability in the case of msrp mea surable objectives had not been defined before launching the project terms like greatly heightened efficiency highest accountability etc are not complete without align ing them with quantifiable goals before commencing msrp implementation unhcr had not measur ed times or costs or assessed the efficiency of processes previously in place stablished benchmarks were therefore not available to compare with the msrp implementation 12 according to studies of erp projects ma jor risk for an erp project is to become challenged implementation as replacement of lega cy systems msrp may support business processes and ensure business continuity however its performance and output may be somewhat short of the expected delivery of strategi c advantage and full business process 3 improvements that were originally anticipated for the organization the resource and confidence losses may be difficult to measure and r ectify recommendation head2right the unhcr division of information services and telecommunications dist should ensure that future project plans and objective settings are quantifiable and re monitored for tracking success and detecting deviat ions from initial plans rec 12 13 the basic function of postimplementatio n review is to evaluate whether the business objectives of project were achieved erp literature lists critical success factors for an implementation phase as senior management suppo rt and commitment to project alignment of people processes and technology anti cipated benefits from erp implementation project motivation behind erp imple mentation business vs system led and scope of user training 14 initially msrp obtained strong senior man agement support the msrp governance board headed by the deputy high commissioner closel oversaw the project until april 2004 there were regular monthly governance board m eetings however since then meetings were held at larger intervals only in august 2004 february 2005 and may 2005 recommendation head2right the unhcr division of information services and telecommunications should reactivate the regular etings of the msrp governance board designation of an alternate chairperson would be advisable to ensure that regular schedule can be met in the absence of the chairperson rec 13 b change management 15 change management has been defined to incl ude communications of project results training and transition management transition man agement was defined to be responsible for helping the organisation anticipate and manage changes in process execution and process ownership at the organisational macro level part icularly where changes will have an impact upon staff resources roles and workload trans ition strategy was prepared and presented to business owners in august 2003 and submitted to the governance board in september 2003 16 in january 2004 after goinglive the the n project director presented the final outcome of phase 1 delivered ontime over 2m under budg et actually 90 percent of these savings us 18 million had been saved on chang management it would appear that the critical success factor of alignment of people pro cesses and technology was not sufficiently ensured presentation to business owners meetin g in may 2003 stated that customisations were done based on greatest enduser benefit for t he least amount of customisation also change management was defined not to include compr ehensive organizational change therefore such an approach of avoiding customizati ons to peoplesoft combined with minimal organizational change could not result in an optimal outcome noncustomized 4 system will not fully support the way to work nor w ill work processes comply with the practices anticipated by the system design 17 in oios opinion change management review of processes requiring inputwork by different units would have been beneficial to ensure timely actions for example to streamline invoice verification which is cumbersome such review would require team comprising of peoplesoft technical experts and functional expe rts from the relevant units involved 18 as pointed out earlier the objectives of msrp were defined very broadly while the motivation behind msrp implementation was listed in business terms it seems that the driving force was rather the need to replace old gacy systems without process redesign and concrete quantifiable goals the expected business benefits may not be realized without realizing business benefits msrp despite all effo rts may be seen as just an expensive legacy system replacement recommendation head2right the unhcr divisions of information services and telecommunications should consider strengthening ch ange management with process redesign over organizationa l boundaries for increased efficiency rec 14 c data from legacy systems 19 data from various legacy systems like pur rec purrund and fmis was archived for easy access and use along with the msrp data presently this database has the facility to run about 100 different reports due to the diverg ence of the data structure and format between msrp and the legacy databases extracting c ertain reports and analyzing the results has become cumbersome for example report by ve ndor covering the period 2000 to 2005 may have to be generated in the legacy database for the period 20002003 and in msrp for the periods thereafter 20 oios noted that the number of users having knowledge and access to this database was very limited however the access to this data is vital particularly as msrp and the legacy systems were not run in parallel major use for this data will be inter alia for running number of statistical reports for differe nt users sms frs etc preparing accounting reconciliations on receivables payables etc settling queries on implementing partner installmen ts when msrp is rolledout to field locations facilitating closure of operational projects imple mented between 1994 and 2003 that are still open 21 also the users may need additional inform ation that is not provided by the existing reports obtaining consolidated information for ex tended periods drawn from both systems may not be cost effective but unhcr should assess whether further investment in report development is necessary finally oios foresees need for some basic training in extracting and using this data d user satisfaction survey 22 an integral part of the process in any sys tem development project is to take stock of 5 lessons learned user satisfaction survey is nor mally used to measure such results which can also provide valuable information on areas that still need attention two user satisfaction surveys were launched in 2004 on 14 february and 1 5 june it would appear that the first one was initiated too early and meaningful conclus ions could not be drawn from the rather low number of replies and the actual results were not published the second survey only resulted in five replies comprehensive feedback from msrp users is therefore not available recommendation head2right the unhcr division of information services and telecommunications should conduct user satisfacti on survey of the finance and supply chain modules re c 15 b training 23 as part of the msrp implementation the pro ject team undertook major effort to train all users the training sessions focused on i ndividual modules which concentrated on various functionalities within the system like acc ounts payable commitments etc for most staff members to be able to use the system attend ance to several training sessions was necessary while oios appreciates the achievement m ade some issues surfaced that should be considered for future training like square4 the training material was mostly on how to use peop lesoft number of participants felt that this was too technical approach and wou ld have appreciated more explanations on how do i do my work by using msrp participants would have benefited from more knowledge on msrp and its integ rated functionality as well as information on changes to their daily work square4 the knowledge of unhcr operations among the trainer s varied considerably for the supply chain all the trainers were unhcr staff members with relevant experience on the finance modules mostly outside consultants were used who had excellent peoplesoft skills but limited unhcr knowl edge therefore participants felt that they did not always receive sufficient ex planation on the actual peoplesoft usage within unhcr environment square4 the timeliness of training is essential as skills trained for but not subsequently put into use would soon fade the training was mostly d elivered in timely manner however in some cases staff members received train ing in january 2004 and started to use the system only in april or may 2004 square4 msrp team did not keep complete record of the tra ining sessions and the attendants oios requested list of all participants and the m odules they attended but such information was not available square4 the training modules did not include systematic f eedback for further development or adjustments for example shortcomings of training m aterial could have been addressed if exceptions had been listed during the training square4 online help within msrp did not work effectively d uring the most part of 2004 24 oios is pleased to note that the training plans for the field rollout have taken into account many of the above issues however as alre ady discussed training is very important aspect of successful erp implementation as msrp is an integrated system any errors or omissions made in previous stages require additiona l effort for subsequent rectifications making everyone understand the unhcr way of using peoplesoft and the effects of ones 6 actions or nonactions on other peoples work would help to maximize the benefits of msrp 25 according to the project charter training and maintenance manuals were to be handed over to the finance policy and training unit and to the supply chain unit oios was not aware of any plans how frs and sms were sys tematically going to handle training of new users in headquarters in order to avoid sim ilar problems after the field rollout the msrp team will need to ensure that staff replacemen ts will be trained in timely manner given the frequent rotation of staff msrp training cannot remain onetime effort linked to the implementation of the system but needs to be p rovided on an ongoing basis recommendation head2right the unhcr division of information services and telecommunications should in consultation with the users maintain training facilities for new users who did not benefit from the initial msrp training rec 16 c security issues 26 although an it security audit was not envi saged within the scope of this post implementation review oios would like to comment n some security setups with msrp since unhcr does not have an organization wide info rmation security policy the msrp team developed an application security strategy for the financial and supply chain modules however we could not establish if the usersbusine ss owners had considered and approved such security strategy as msrp is being rolledou t to the field and the human resources and payroll modules with very sensitive personnel data there is an urgent need for unhcr it security policy to be developed recommendation head2right the unhcr division of information services and telecommunications should develop unhcr wide it security policy which should be approved by senior management such policy should become baseline for more detailed msrp functional security procedures rec 17 27 as msrp is currently running in project mo the security officer granting access rights to the system works within the msrp team such an arrangement is contrary to normal segregation of duties in it functions to co mply with best practises dist should consider moving this function outside the msrp team 28 oios received snapshot of msrp usage n 1 october 2004 which showed that msrp had 719 registered users in production environ ment of which 132 had never logged in and 151 had not used the system during the two prev ious months the users include several test users including superhypermega user ch test users might have extraordinarily large user rights which could leave system vulnera ble if passwords were not properly guarded 29 in addition there is mechanism in plac to ensure that user access rights are reliably tracked and updated within msrp especiall when staff members move from one 7 post to another also this cannot be tracked with in msrp as personnel data is not yet integrated to the system therefore an interim asure is needed outside msrp recommendation head2right the msrp project team should develop together with business owners mechanism to ensure that access control and user updates are properly handled so that staff changes are correctly reflected in msrp rec 18 d supply chain modules process redesign 30 oios was pleased to note that sms had star ted already under the integrated systems project isp the predecessor of msrp to design n ew supply chain processes sms was therefore in position to base customization reque sts on new and fully documented process sms also introduced new procurement manual chapt er 8 of the unhcr manual in december 2003 just before msrp went live as res ult users adjusted to new processes and the system supporting it at the same time 31 during introduction of msrp sms had one s taff member with computer expertise providing inhouse system support this appears to have positively influenced the users ability to use the system and greatly facilitated i nformation flow between sms and msrp b supply management 32 since january 2004 msrp has replaced the old purchasing legacy systems at headquarters during 2004 sms created over 1800 pu rchase orders po in the new system at total value of some us 96 million they conta ined some 7000 po lines procurement of it and telecom equipment has created major workload for procurement while their value accounted for some 22 per cent of the total procure ment value in 2004 they required 64 per cent of all po lines created in 2004 in contrast vehicle purchases accounted for some 12 per cent of unhcrs procurement value but constituted only two per cent of sms workload in terms of creating and maintaining po lines in the s ystem 33 there is single reason for such differe nt workload needs it may be caused partially by the system itself and partially by the processes for purchasing also within msrp each different budget code requires the creation of parate po line po might contain 50 identical computers but if paid from 20 different cost centres the resulting po will have 20 lines 34 general assessment indicates that msrp h as not yet delivered noticeable added value in this area compared to the old legacy syste ms in terms of efficiency of processing requisitions oios identified two main reasons for this 35 firstly msrp is only installed at headqua rters so information is not readily available from or to the field therefore the supply chain p rocess within the system is currently limited to headquarters actions where it starts with users bureaux itts sms etc who create purchase requisitions it also means that some int erim measures needed to be applied until the system becomes fully operational organization w ide for example receipt in the field of 8 items that were procured from headquarters cannot b monitored within msrp oios noted that over us 20 million about 25 per cent of the value of all pos initiated by sms was spent annually on essential nonfood items like bl ankets jerry cans kitchen sets tents tarpaulins and plastic sheets however due to lim ited functionality the tracking and controlling of receiving reports from field locatio ns could not be done within msrp the purrund legacy system covered this function until i t was turned off by january 2004 in this regard msrp in its current state falls behi nd the level of service of the legacy system 36 absence of tracking receiving reports is material internal control weakness and more cooperation is required from the field locations to ensure that such basic control is effectively in place while this deficiency will be resolved wi th the completion of the field rollout oios would reiterate that alternate arrangements should be in place to confirm receipt of goods by the field offices and to obtain assurance of the co mpletion of the procurement cycle with the absence of confirmation of receipt of goods unhcr risks to forego potential insurance claims if damages or losses are not confirmed on timely basis recommendation head2right the unhcr supply management service should ensure t hat the interim tracking of receipt of goods in the fie ld which is performed outside msrp is complete and reliable rec 19 37 secondly the data available in msrp is t fully used after an audit of headquarters procurement in 2002 oios recommended that sms shou ld develop performance indicators for major steps in the procurement process to asses s the level of achievement of procurement objectives this was meant to benchmark the workfl ow and monitor the procurement process as well as assisting to search for further improvements to date sms has not established concrete measures based on msrp data to create such performance monitoring recommendation head2right the unhcr supply management service should develop system for performance indicators and make maximum use of msrp data for performance monitoring rec 20 38 unhcr is not yet using workflow functional ity in msrp eg access to some functions has not been fully aligned with functiona l authorities thus it is possible for someone to create purchase requisition and charge it to different budget than hisher own also within sms current setup enables staff to cr eate and approve their own purchase orders in addition approval limits have not been fully set up so any purchases exceeding normal limits or requiring further management appro val or other submissions like to the committee on contracts needed to be tracked or fol lowed up separately outside the system in other words there were warning messages or utomatic reaction from the system to comply with any such requirements oios regrets th at such issues were addressed within the first year of msrp being operational 39 oios noticed that reports currently in th system did not always provide reliable information for example oios was guided to use report procurement value by po date which in practice did not provide accurate i nformation for some reason data from beginning of year 2004 was missing and the results included data outside the set parameters the problem seems to have been resolved since but msrp team and users should make sure that reports provide accurate reliable and complet information 9 recommendation head2right the unhcr supply management service should ensure t hat standard msrp reports on procurement are complete nd accurate rec 21 c asset management 40 the msrp asset management function current ly covers headquarters activities only towards end of 2003 data from the headquarters ass ettrak system was transferred to msrp during 2004 only assets procured at headqua rters were recorded in msrp 41 quality of reports within any information system depends largely on the quality of data input to make sure that only reliable data i s transferred to msrp each of the 127 field offices running assettrak need to verify and clean their data otherwise current problems with asset management information in assettrak will be carried forward sms explained that although the data verification and clean up d started in 2004 it was progressing slowly mainly due to limited resources within the asset management unit recommendation head2right the unhcr supply management service should coordina the timetable of assettrak data migration to msrp w ith the field rollout plans adequate human resources for data verification and cleanup need to be provided to sure that only reliable data is transferred to msrp rec 22 42 oios tested the current use of field asset track by obtaining procurement information of terrain vehicles for which purchase orders had b een raised between january and june 2004 for delivery to various field locations there were 30 purchase orders for 147 vehicles with value of some us 4 million by november 2004 none of these vehicles had been entered in the assettrak system at headquarters by february 2 005 some 40 per cent of the vehicles had been registered however that was 8 to 12 months fter the procurement although purchase information on assets is held in transit account within msrp such long gap in recording assets should be avoided sms explained that it was considering options to re duce this gap in nonexpendable property reporting within msrp recommendation head2right the unhcr supply management service should ensure t hat information on nonexpendable property items that is available in the msrp purchasing module flows direc tly into the asset management module thus avoiding an infor mation gap pending field offices recording of such items in assettrak rec 23 d inventories 43 at the time of the audit only three of hcrs warehouses ie the central emergency stockpile ces in copenhagen the teleco m tcom warehouse and the it warehouse at headquarters were included in msrp lthough msrp has been in use from january 2004 oios was told that inventory reportin g was not reliably available until november 2004 different organizational units mana ge each of these three warehouses and 10 the inventory values vary greatly the warehouses re financed through regional var projects which should provide each warehouse the f lexibility to replenish stock and ensure that they always have some buffer stock for immedia distribution the related budgets for purchasesstock replenishments in 2005 are ces us 475000 tcom us 500000 and it us 100000 44 sms manages ces directly and it considers that msrp provides adequate tools for their needs it also nominally manages the it war ehouse however in practice itts is in charge of initiating distribution of items from the warehouse and initiating procurement of it equipment the telecommunication unit of itts mana ges the tcom warehouse 45 while all three warehouses fulfil similar basic functions oios observed that their problems after msrp implementation differed for ces the problems mainly related to emergency s ituations where for example trucks held by suppliers had to be shipped out quic kly even before they could be physically tagged while msrp requires that all non expendable property be asset tagged before they can be entered and processedtra cked further within the system for the tcom warehouse problems related to differe nces between expected functions and the actual system capabilities the expectation gaps have not been addressed fully or there were some problems with processes that had been put in place to workaround some requirements or functionalities of the new sys tem for example msrp does not assist with tracking of backorders when the numbe r of items in stock were not sufficient to meet requests that were made furthe rmore some consumable type of items at the tcom warehouse are ordered when needed instead of replenishing stock levels resulting in multiple small orders for the it warehouse the procedures were the same however with significantly increased budget under the var project fast moving items could be replenished regularly hence reduce the number of pos during 2004 unhcr purchased almost 2900 computers also some new processes for transferring funds bet ween operational projects and the var project had been established when items that d been released from stock were replenished by the users bureaux this process r equired spreadsheet report from msrp and collection of other paper based documentat ion which in some instances took months to complete 46 msrp does not include the peoplesoft wareh ouse module however the msrp inventory module provides some warehousing function s but not all as mentioned earlier there is limitation of handling and tracking bac korders in the system also handling of partial deliveries from suppliers is cumbersome ctivity requiring detailed and continued reconciliations between pos and invoices conseque ntly the it warehouse staff has informed suppliers that they will normally only acc ept complete deliveries at the tcom warehouse oios noted po with 16 different deliver ies another challenge facing the warehouse staff is that msrp does not automatically apply the firstinfirstout principle on releasedelivery requests as the system is based on tracking tag numbers sometimes major editing of requests is needed to ensure proper agei ng norms and normal flow of stock items 47 as warehousing was not considered unhcr core function detailed functionality was not considered necessary for msrp but as unhc r operates warehouses for many of its programmes in many field locations either by itsel f or with implementing partners there are several different inventory systems in place using msrp in some of these warehouses or 11 providing data to and from msrp could support prope r and efficient handling of items in stocks currently as part of the field rollout pl anning unhcr is considering what kind of inventory functions should be provided for field of fices 48 oios noted in an audit of unhcr central em ergency and regional stockpiles that unhcr was spending some us 12 million per year in rent and running costs for worldwide warehousing services these costs indicate that the warehouses may contain material stock levels in accordance with the system accounting standards 49 iv if inventory is material it should be disclosed as an asset in n ote to the financial statements whether such data is stored in msrp or not should be clearly dec ided before the field rollout sms stated that an enhanced version of the commodity tracking system cts was useful in tracking inventory values until the msrp field rollout was complete recommendation head2right the unhcr supply management service should ensure t hat appropriate inventory and warehousing processes are incorporated within msrp taking also into account the financial statement requirements these processes s hould be consistently applied and with clearly defined roles and responsibilities for all users rec 24 preparedness for field rollout 49 oios was concerned with the msrp and suppl chain preparedness status for the field rollout starting in 2005 apart from technic limitations particularly the inactive workflow and some shortcomings in creating purchase requisitions and purchase orders there were some issues outside msrp that have not been sa tisfactorily dealt with 50 for example roles and responsibilities fo r creating and changing static data in msrp such as vendor information have not been ful ly defined for ensuring smooth field usage important vendor information like bank acc ount numbers should be entered and changed only under wellcontrolled process with ad equate separation of duties still simple procedures will be needed for the multiple smaller local bank payments currently the msrp team enters such information centrally which need subsequent approval from finance in headquarters recommendation head2right the msrp project team should establish proper proce dures and controls over the completeness and accuracy of the vendor data input and their subsequent changes re c 25 51 checking as well as storing physical suppo rt documentation for payments should be made as simple as possible still ensuring proper s crutiny msrp processes electronic data but in reality lot of physical documents are sti ll necessary oios reviewed draft purchase order payment instruction which required seven ste ps for the physical documents to pass through various organizational units including fou r times between sms and finance section if there are questions on invoices such as paymen t terms specifications acknowledged receipts or other matters some streamlining may be required in order not to build up bottlenecks within the work process processing wi thin msrp would be preferable on such matters however as the system cannot handle physi cal documents solution outside the system may be needed 12 recommendation head2right the msrp project team in cooperation with the divis ion of finance and supply management should endeavour to simplify the paper workflow and to align the physic processing documents to the msrp workflow rec 26 52 msrp requires precise and complete informa tion and specifications on requisitions creating such requisitions using the system in the field can be challenge at small unhcr offices which do not have dedicated supply staff w ith specialized skills unhcr may want to consider whether sms should take the role of cre ating the requisitions in msrp in such instances recommendation head2right the unhcr msrp project team should consider in consultation with the main users that processes in msrp will be manageable for parttimers in smaller field of fices otherwise sufficient helpassistance facilities nee d to be available for them rec 27 53 numerous oios audits have identified vario us problems with asset management in field locations for example timely recording of new assets or changes to existing data was frequently neglected msrp as mere information s ystem will not by itself solve such problems proper processes with designated focal point for recording and checking assets need to be established at the country level and emb edded within msrp before the field rollout recommendation head2right the unhcr supply management service should strength the asset management process in the field to ensure assets are properly tracked and controlled rec 28 v acknowledgement 54 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff and managers of sms and the m srp project team egbert c kaltenbach chief unhcr audit service office of internal oversight services
