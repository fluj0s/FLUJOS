for wines and dairy products particularly which some countries consider to be protected intellectual property and others consider to be generic or semigeneric terms has become contentious international trade issue what does the trips agreement say about the protection of geographical indications the trips agreement provides two levels of protection for geographical indications and

in the system exceptions to the protection of geographical indications include where term has been used for at least 10 years prior to april 15 1994 or in good faith if prior to that date where term is also subject to good faith trademark rights where term has significance as personal name and where term has become identified with the common name for good or service why was protection of

junejuly 2002 pp 1823 crs3 proposed multilateral registry for geographical indications3 the euswiss proposal would have eliminated most of the exceptions in article 24 which permit the use for example of such names as chablis burgundy or champagne based on prior or good faith use the united states on the other hand while pressing for strong intellectual property protections in general proposed more limited protections for geographical indications4 the united states proposed simply 1 that member countries would protect geographical indications of any products through registration of certification or collective marks see below and 2 that appellations of origin of wines that had not become generic names would be guaranteed protection against misleading use the resulting trips provisions for geographical indications represented compromise between these two positions and postponed debate over multilateral registry for wines and spirits and over extending higher protections to agricultural geographical indications the trips compromise on protection of geographical indications reflects more the eus expansive proposals than the united states more modest ones how are geographical indications protected httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21569 in the united states5 in the united states geographical indications are protected under the us trademark act 15 usc 1051 et seq section 4 of the trademark act 15 usc 1054 provides for the registration of certification marks including indications of regional origin the kinds of certification marks recognized in the trademark act include marks that certify that goods or services originate in specific geographic region these would be the kinds of marks most likely viewed as geographical indications under trips6 parties asserting rights to use geographical indication can obtain formal protection via use of the trademark system through registration as certification mark7 the us system for recognition for geographic indications applies equally to foreign geographic indications an example is us registration 571798 roquefort for that french cheese other means also would be available to protect geographical indications see footnote 5

this use is main point of contention in both multilateral and bilateral negotiations with the eu what gi issues are being debated in the doha round two issues concerning geographical indications are under consideration in the doha development agenda negotiations concerning multilateral registry for wine and spirits and debate over extending additional protections for agricultural geographical indications 1 negotiating multilateral registry for wine and spirits the ministerial declaration launching the doha round of multilateral trade negotiations established the fifth wto ministerial conference september 1014 2003 in cancun mexico as the deadline for completing negotiations for multilateral system of notification and registration9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21569 in the negotiations the eu has proposed multilateral system of notification and registration that would create obligations for wto member countries to grant exclusive rights for individual geographic indications rather than allow interested parties to apply for protection according to countrys national legal procedures10 participation would be voluntary but the multilateral registry would have mandatory effect so that notification of geographical indication by one country creates presumption that it must be protected everywhere under the eu proposal country would be required to grant exclusive rights to producers in the notifying country unless it successfully challenged the notification in wto dispute settlement the eu lists among the advantages of registry with mandatory effect the following it would provide information to members about which geographical indications are protected in each members territory it would make operational the protections extended to geographical indications for wines and spirits provided in trips article 23 without requiring members to enact new legislation or administrative procedures it would provide transparency and legal certainty to international trade in wine and spirits 8 names treated as semigeneric are angelica burgundy claret chablis champagne chianti malaga marsala madeira moselle port rhine wine or hock sauterne haut sauterne sherry and tokay

traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights implementation of article 234 of the trips agreement relating to the establishment of multilateral system of notification and registration of geographic indications communication from the european communities and their member states ipcw107 and ipcw107rev1 july 28 1998 and june 22 2000 crs5 the united states japan chile canada new zealand australia and others have all expressed concern about registry with mandatory effect on grounds that it would lead to new and costly administrative burdens and legal obligations they see the proposed multilateral registry as clearing house for information about the protection of specific geographical indications in each country applications for protection of geographical indications would be made through existing legal procedures in wto member country while multilateral negotiations have been underway the united states and the eu have been negotiating bilateral wine agreement principal eu objective is to secure an end to us use of semigeneric names for wines see footnote 5 the eu is also seeking protection for what it calls traditional terms applied to wines such as tawny or ruby red among others principal us objective is to gain acceptance by the eu of us winemaking practices because the eu only permits wine made in accordance with its regulations to be sold in the eu substantial amount of us wine is blocked from that market australia and more recently canada have concluded bilateral wine agreements with the eu which contain mutual recognition of wine making practices and agreement by australia and canada to phase out the use of the generic names still permitted under us law httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21569 2 extending additional protection to geographical indications for agricultural products the second issue under debate in the trips council is that of extending the protection of geographical indications provided for in article 23 of the trips agreement to products other than wines and spirits this and other socalled implementation issues of importance to developing countries were to have been addressed by the end of 2002 but were not proposals to extend protection accorded wines and spirits to other agricultural products have been made by the eu11 and by group of european and developing countries12 additional protection for geographical indications of agricultural products is viewed as corollary of efforts to liberalize agricultural trade and to promote trade of goods with higher added value for example the eu explicitly links extending protection for geographical indications to its strategy to promote the development of quality agricultural products13 proponents also argue that increased protection would bring more effective protection of consumers negotiations on this issue are taking place in the trips council but the eu has linked reaching agreement on geographical indications to its willingness to deal with the agricultural negotiating issues of market access domestic support and export subsidies 11 the eus revised proposal for registry of geographical indications ipcw107rev1 applies not only to wines and spirits but also to agricultural products 12 world trade organization council for traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights proposal from bulgaria cuba the czech republic egypt iceland india jamaica kenya liechtenstein mauritius nigeria pakistan slovenia sri lanka switzerland turkey and venezuela ipcw247rev 1 may 17 2002 13 john baize eus new farm policy signals the way on quality world perspectives pp 45 july 2 2003 crs6 conversely the united states and number of other countries argue that the existing level of protection provided by trips enables countries to maintain access to existing markets maintains ongoing access to trade opportunities in new and emerging markets provides adequate protection to producers and consumers and does not impose new administrative costs and legal obligations on members14 additional costs cited by the united states include potential for consumer confusion from renaming and relabeling products potential producer conflicts within the wto and heightened risk of wto disputes the debate over extending protection for geographical indications of agricultural products is reflected in the us request for consultations the first step in wto dispute settlement with the eu on eu regulations for the protection of geographical indications for wines and spirits community regulation 149399 and for other agricultural products community regulation 208192 the us request which has been joined by australia argues that the eu regulations violate the trips agreement article 22 by requiring specific bilateral agreements rather than recourse to national legal systems before according recognition to other countries registered geographical indications commentators have suggested that this possible challenge to eu regulations anticipates httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21569 that eu enlargement to include 10 central and eastern european countries could create additional problems for us registered trademark owners visavis eu protected geographical names15 case in point is the usowned budweiser beer trademark which although registered in number of eu countries could come into question if the czech republic registers and claims the name budweiser even in translation as protected geographical indication in the eu outlook and congressional role decisions about geographical indications will be on the agenda of the wto ministerial conference in cancun the chairman of the agriculture negotiating group has identified geographical indications for agricultural products as an unresolved issue16 congress is closely monitoring the doha negotiations the house agriculture committee has scheduled oversight hearings on the protection of geographical indications for agricultural products should negotiations result in agreements that require changes in us law covering geographical indications congress would take up legislation to implement such an agreement under expedited fast track procedures established in the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 14 world trade organization council for traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights extension of the protection of geographical indications for wines and spirits
