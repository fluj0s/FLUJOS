the right to marry violated the states constitution1 similarly state supreme courts in new jersey2 california3 and connecticut4 found that denying samesex couples the right to marry violated their state constitutions in addition the calif ornia and connecticut courts found that parallel statutory structures including domestic partnershi ps andor civil unions were not the constitutional equivalent of civil marriage however in new jersey the court left open the option for the state legislatur to provide parallel statutory structure which would allow samesex couples to enjoy the same rights privileges and burdens as married oppositesex couples5 currently neither federal law nor any state law affirmatively allows gay or lesbian couples to marry on the federa l level congress

the institution of marriage it allows all states territori possessions and indian tribes to refuse to recognize an act of any other jurisdiction that designates relationship between individuals of the same sex as marriage in part doma states state territory or possession of the united states or indian tribe shall be required to give effect to any public act record or judicial proceeding of any

of any act of congress or of any ruling regulation or interpretation of the various administ rative bureaus and agencies of the united states the word marriage means only legal union between one man

the manner in which such acts records and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof opponents argue that although congress s authority to pass laws that enable acts judgments and the like to be given effect in other states it has constitutional power to pass law permitting states to deny full faith and credit to another states laws and judgments38 conversely some argue th at doma does nothing more than simply restate the power granted to the states by the full faith and credit clause39 while there is judicial precedent on this issue it would appear that congresssgeneral authority to prescri bethe effect of public acts arguably gives it discretion to define the effect so that particular public act is not due full faith and credit it would appear that the plain reading of the clause would encompass both expansion and contraction 40 equal protection congresss authority to legislate in th is manner under the full faith and credit clause if the analysis set out above is accepted does not conclude the matter there are constitutional constraints upon federal legi slation one that is relevant is the equal protection clause and the effect of the supreme courts decision in romer v evans 41 which struck down under the equal protection clause referendumadopted provision of the colorado constitution wh ich repealed local ordinances that provided civilrights protections for gay persons and which prohibited all governmental action designed to protect homosexuals from discrimination the court held that under the equal prot ection clause legi slation adverse to homosexuals was to be scrutinized under rational basis st andard of review42 the classification failed to pass even this ferential standard of review because it imposed special disability on homosexuals not visited on any other class of people and it could not be justified by any of the arguments made by the state the state argued that its purpose for the amendment was twofold 1 to respect the freedom of association rights of other citizens such as landlords and employers who objected to homosexuality and 2 to serve the states interest in conserving resources to fight discrimination against other protected groups doma can be distinguished from the colorado amendment domas legislative history indicates that it was intended to protect federalism interests and state

efining which acts records and judicial continuedexclusive state concern moreover it permits but does not require states to deny recognition to samesex marriages in other states affording states with strong public policy concerns the discretion to effectuate that policy thus it can be argued that doma is grounded not in hostility to homosexuals but in an intent to afford the states the discretion to act as their public policy on samesex marriage dictates substantive due process right to privacy another possibly applicable constitutional constraint is the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and the effect of the supreme courts decision in lawrence v texas 43 which struck down under the due process clause state statute criminalizing certain private sexual acts between homosexuals the court held that the fourteenth amendments due process privacy guarantee extends to protect consensual sex between adult homosexuals the court noted that the due process right to privacy protects certain personal decisions from governmental interference these personal decisions include issues regarding contraceptives abortion marriage procreation and family relations44 the court extended this right to privacy to cover adult consensual homosexual sodomy it is currently unclear what impact if any the courts decision in lawrence will have on legal challenges to laws prohibiting samesex marriage on the one hand this decision can be viewed as affirming broad constitutional right to sexual privacy conversely the court distinguis hed this case from cases involving minors and whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter45 courts may seek to distinguish statutes prohibiting samesex marriage from stat utes criminalizing homosexual conduct courts may view the preservation of th institution of marriage as sufficient justification for statutes ba nning samesex marriage mo reover courts may view the public recognition of marriage differently than the sexual conduct of homosexuals in the privacy of their own homes interstate recognition of marriage doma opponents take the position that the full faith and credit clause would obligate states to recognize samesex marriag contracted in other states in which they are authorized this conclusion is far from evident as this clause applies principally to the interstate recognition and enforcement of judgments46 it is settledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31994crs7 46 continued proceedings are afforded full faith and credit 47 restatement

faith and credit regardless of other states public policies provided the issuing state had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter47 the full faith and credit clause has rarely been used by courts to validate marriages because marriages are not legal judgments questions concerning the validity of an outofstate marriage are generally resolved without reference to the full faith and credit clause in the legal sense marriage is civil contract created by the state which establishes certain duties and confers certain benefits48 validly entering the contract creates the marital status the duties and benefits attached by state are incidents of that status as such the general tendency ba sed on comity rather than on compulsion under the full faith and credit clause is to recognize marriages contracted in other states even if they could not have been celebrate d in the recognizing state the general rule of validation for marriage is to look to the law of the place where the marriage was celebrated marriage satisfying the contracting states requirements will usually be held valid everywhere49 many states provide by statute that marriage that is valid where contracted is valid within the state this place of celebration rule is then subject to number of exceptions most of which are narrowly construed the most common exception to the place of celebration rule is for marriages deemed ry to the forums strong public policy several states such as connecticut50 idaho51 illinois52 kansas53 missouri54 pennsylvania55 south carolina56 and tennessee57 provide

2001 bostonbased homosexual rights group gay and lesbian advocates and defenders glad filed suit against the massachusetts department of public health on behalf of seven sames ex couples the plaintiffs claimed that refusing samesex couples the opportunity to apply for marriage license violates massachusetts law nd various portions of the massachusetts constitution glads brief argued the exis tence of fundamental right to marry the person of ones choosing in the due process provisions of the massachusetts constitution and asserted that the marriage laws which allow both men and women

finally the historical purpose of marri age the trial court found th at based on history and the actions of the peoples elected representatives right to samesex marriage was not so rooted in tradition

couraging procreation63 on november 18 2003 the massachusetts supreme judicial court overruled the lower court and held that under the massachusetts cons tituti on the commonwealth could not deny the protecti ons benefits and ob ligations attendant on marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry64 the court concluded that interpreting the statutory term marriage to apply only to male female unions lacked rational basis for either due process or equal protection purposes under the states cons titution moreover the court f ound that such limitation was not justified by the states interest in providing favorable setting for procreation and had rational relationship to the states interests in ensuring that children be raised in optimal settings and in conservation of state and private financial resources65 the court reasoned that the laws of civil marriage did not privilege procreative heterosexual inte rcourse nor contain any requirement that applicants for marriage licenses attest to their ability or intention to conceive children by coitus moreover the court reasone d that the state has power to provide varying levels of protection to children based on the circum stances of birth as for the states interest in conserving scarce state and private financial resources the court found that the state failed to produce any ev idence to support its assertion that same sex couples were less fina ncially interdependent th an oppositesex couples in addition massachusetts marriage laws do not condition receipt of public and private financial benefits to married individuals on demonstra tion of financ ial dependence on each other66 as this decision is based on the commonwealths constitution it is not reviewable by the us supreme cour t the court stayed its decision for 180 days to give the legislature time to enact legislation as it may deem appropriate in light of this opinion67 on february 3 2004 the court ruled in an advisory opinion

massachusetts decision st ate supreme courts in new jersey california and connectic ut addressed the issue of samesex marriage70 the california and connecticut cases posed slightly different question than the one presented in massachusetts as california and connecticut legislatures enacted parallel statutory schemes in the form of domestic partnerships and civil unions granting the states samesex couples the sa rights and benefits as well as the obligations of civil marriage as such the legal issue before the california and connecticut supreme courts was whether in light of both marriage and domestic partnershipcivil union statutes the failure to designate the official relationship of samesex couples as marriage vi olates the states constitutions71 while the california supreme court held that the privacy due process and equal protection provisions of the states constitution guarantee the basic right of civil marriage to all individuals and couples regardless of their sexual orientation72 the connecticut supreme court focused on th equal protection provision of the state constitution73 in addressing the privacy and due process challeng the california majority first looked at the nature and scope of the rig ht to marry relying on judicial precedent and legislative history74 the court concluded that the fundamental nature of the substantive rights embodied in the right to marry and their central importance to ones opportunity to live ppy meaningful and satisfying life as full member of society require that the state constitution be interpreted to protect this right not to be eliminated or abrogated by the legislature or by the electorate through the statutory initiative process75 in reaching its conclusion the court discussed the societal benefits of marriage including child welfare and the role that marriage plays in facilitating stable family setting76 furthermore the court described marriage as the basic unit or building block of society77 the court noted that while marriage serves vital societal interest judicial precedent also demonstrated that the right to marry is an integral component of an individualshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31994crs11 78

that continue to treat sex race and religion as suspect classificationsinterest in personal autonomy protected by the privacy and liberty interest provisions of the california constitution78 while the california court acknowledged that the constitutional right to marry did not obligate the state to afford specific tax or other governme ntal benefits on the basis of couples family rela tion the right to marry does obligate the state to take affirmative action to grant official public recognition to the couples relationship as family79 thus the court concluded that the california constitution guarantees samesex couples the same substantive constitutional rights as oppositesex couples to choose ones life partner and ter with that person in com mitted officially recognized and protected family relationship that enjoys all of the constitutionally based incidents of marriage80 in addressing the equa l protection question the california and connecticut supreme courts used different standards of review in matter of first impression the california supreme court determined that strict scrutiny was the appropriate standard of review for sexu orientation disc rimination according to the california court classification or discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is analogous to race gender81 or religious discrimination as th types of classifications are based on characteristics that bear relationship to ones ability to perform or contribute to society82 as such the california c ourt expanded protection against sexual orientation discrimination by determining that strict scrutiny was the appropriate review under the heightened standard of strict scrutiny the state had to establish 1 compelling state interest and 2 that th differential treatme nt was necessary to achieve the compelling state interest the court concluded that the designation of marriage would not have an impact on oppos itesex couples however the court concluded that separate and differently named family for samesex couples would be harmful to the couples as well as thei r offspring due to possible perception that such union is of lesser stature in comparison to relationships of oppositesex couples the court concluded that the st ates domestic partne rship law provides insufficient protections to samesex coupl specifically the court stated

benefits to samesex couples whether marriage or some other term is matter left to the democratic process as this decision is based solely on new jerseys state constitution it is not reviewable by the us supreme courtretaining the designati on of marriage exclusively fo r oppositesex couples and providing only separate and distinct signation for samesex couples may well have the effect of perpetuating more general premise now emphatically rejected by this state that gay individuals nd samesex couples are in some respects secondclass citizens as such the court found such distinction unconstitutional under the california constitution83 the connecticut supreme court agreed with the california supreme courts finding that laws discriminating against homosexuals must be subjected to higher level of scrutiny however the connecticut court declined to use strict scrutiny analysis instead the court used vari ety of factors to determine that sexual orientation is quasisuspect class an alogous to gender thus warranting an intermediate scrutiny analysis84 in exploring the nature of homosexual identity the history of societal views regarding homosexuality and the limitation of political power possessed by homosexuals the c ourt found that homosexuals suffered history of invidious discrimination based on characteristics not within their control that bear relation to their ability to perform or contribute to society85 therefore the court concluded that homos exuals are quasisuspect class requiring the state to advance sufficiently persuasive justification for denying samesex couples the right to marry as in the massachusetts and calif ornia decisions the connecticut supreme court rejected the states justifications of promoting uniformity and preserving the traditi onal definition of marriage86 similarly on october 25 2006 the new je rsey supreme court held that the states constitution requires that samesex couples be granted the same legal rights as married heterosexual couples however the court declined to label those rights and instead ordered the state legislature to amend its marriage statutes or enact new statutory scheme granting the states samesex couples th rights of married couples within 180 days87 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31994crs13 88 this was an unanimous decision as to prov iding benefits and protections to samesex couples the dissent concurred in granting be nefits and protections but dissented in that they believed that the name marriage was also required id 89 id at 212 90 id at 215 91 id 92 id at 218 stating that in light of the policie s reflected in the statutory and decisional laws of the state we cannot find leg itimate public need for an unequal legal scheme of benefits and privileges that disadvantages committed samesex couples 93 id at 217in its 43 decision88 the majority separated the plaintiffs equal protection argument into two questions 1 whet her committed samesex couples have constitutional right to the benefits and privileges afforded to married heterosexual couples and 2 if so whether they have the constitutional right to have their permanent committed relationship recognized by the name marriage89 i n addressing the first question the court discussed new jerseys recent history of passing laws providing benef its to samesex couples fo r example the state forbids sexual orientation di scrimination and allo ws samesex couples to become foster parents as well as adopt children the cour t concluded that the states statutes and judicial opinions provide committed sames ex couples with strong interest in equality of treatment90 moreover the court concluded that although the states domestic partnership act provided samesex couples with some important rights the act failed to bridge the inequality ga p between committed samesex couples and married oppositesex couples91 the court held that the state has legitimate interest in denying the benefits and privileges of marriage to samesex couples92 in assessing the public need for denying committed samesex couples the full benefits and privileges that flow from marriage the court rejected the states argument of uniformity with other states and concluded that the disparate treatment of committed samesex couples directly disadvantages their children moreover the court concluded that there is rational basis for on the one hand giving gays and sbians full civil rights in their status as individuals and on the other giving them an incomplete set of rights when they follow the inclination of their sexual orientation and enter into committed samesex relationships93 as such the court found that denying committed samesex couples the financial and social bene fits and privileges given to married heterosexual couples bears substantial relationship to legitimate government purpose however the court held that there is fundamental due pro cess right to same sex marriage encompassed within the concept of liberty guaranteed by the state constitution in reaching its decision the cour t adopted the general standard followed by the us supreme court in construi ng the due process clause of the 14th amendment of the us constitution th court found that there was legal or historical basis for samesex marriage nor an ything to suggest that the framers of the federal or state constitutions considered it fundamental ri

in our nations history94 as result the court declined to find fundamental right to same sex marriage instead the court ordered the legislature to provide to committed samesex couples th full rights and benefits enjoyed by heterosexual couples95 the court provided two options to the legislature 1 amend the ma rriage statutes to include sa mesex couples or 2 enact parallel statutory structure by another name in which samesex couples would receive the same rights and benefits as we ll as the burdens and obligations of civil marriage96 although the aforementioned opinions deal exclusively with state constitution97 an arizona court of appeals exercising its discretion to accept jurisdiction based on the issue of first imp ression held that the fundamental right to marry protected by the 14th amendment of the us constitution as well as the arizona constitution did not encompass th right to marry samesex partner98 moreover the court found that the state d legitimate intere st in encouraging procreation and child rearing within the marital relationship and limiting that relationship to oppositesex couples in light of the supreme courts recent decision in lawrence the petitioners argued that the arizona statute prohibiting samesex marriages violated their fundamental right to marry and their righ t to equal protection under the laws both of which are guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions the arizona court rejected the petitioners argument that the supreme court in lawrence implicitly recognized that the fundamental right to marry includes the freedom to choose samesex spouse99 the court viewed the lawrence language as acknowledging homosexual persons right to define his or her own existence and achieve the type of individual fulfillment that is the hallmark of free society by entering homosexual relationship100 however the court declined to view the language ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31994crs15 101 see also morrison v sadler 2003 wl 23119998 ind super

sex the designation on the birt h certificate usually controls the sex designation on all later documents143 some courts have held that sexual identity for purposes of marriage is determined by the

subsequently identify w ith and conform his or her biology to another sex upon adulthood145 conclusion states currently possess the authority to decide whether to recognize an outof state marriage the full faith and credit cl ause has rarely been used by states to validate marriages because marriages are not legal judgments with respect to cases decided under the full faith and cred it clause that involve conflicting state statutes the supreme court generally examines the significant aggregation of contacts the forum has with the parties and the occurrence or transaction to decide which states law to apply similarly based upon generally accepte d legal principles states routinely decide whether marriage validly contracted in another jurisdiction will be recognized instate by examining whether it has significant relationship with the spouses and the marriage congress is empowered under the full faith and credit clause of the constitution to prescribe the manner that public acts commonly understood to mean legislative acts records and proceedings sh all be proved and the effect of such acts records and proceedings in other states146 the supreme courts decisions in romer v
