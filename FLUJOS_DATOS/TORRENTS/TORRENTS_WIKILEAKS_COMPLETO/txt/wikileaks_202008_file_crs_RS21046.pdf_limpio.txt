depression hence unemployment was high unused productive capacity was extensive and wholesale and retail prices were declining after war started in europe on september 1 1939 the united states

defense the president deems vital to the defense of the united states3 despite higher taxes and cuts in nondefense spending the large increase in defense related spending plus the absorption of significant proportion of the manpower pool by the armed forces began generating inflationary pressures as unemployment fell and unused plant capacity diminished the us government attempted to lessen inflationary pressure by encouraging the general public to buy savings bonds which were now called defense bonds4 on may 1 1941 the treasury issued new savings bond series e5 because of the comparatively high rate offered on these securities limit of 5000 maturity value was placed on the amount one person could acquire in any one calendar year6 after the united states entered the second world war in december 1941 defense spending soared savings bonds were renamed war bonds during the second world war existing taxes were raised new taxes imposed and price and wage controls implemented in addition production controls were instituted and rationing system established the production of many consumer products such as automobiles and refrigerators ended controls were imposed on consumer credit and stock market credit7 the treasury and the federal reserve fixed interest rates on treasury securities at low levels to keep interest costs low the federal reserve conducted an easy money policy hence the banks had plenty of reserves although this policy kept interest costs low it contributed to inflationary pressures because the money supply expanded as war production expanded inflationary pressures increased dramatically rising employment and extensive overtime resulted in surging growth of wage incomes despite higher taxes workers had more disposable income in order to assist in lessening inflationary pressures and reducing black market activity the war savings staff at the treasury managed series of eight war loan drives employees were encouraged to purchase war bonds through payroll deduction plans while the general population purchased war bonds the us government decided to promote the purchase of treasury marketrisk securities notes bills bonds certificates and tax notes to large individual and corporate investors8 these marketrisk securities were simply regular treasury marketable securities that is they were bought and sold on financial markets victory fund committees consisting of bankers and members of the securities industry were established in each federal reserve district to assist the treasuryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21046crs4

marketrisk securities which were called victory loans9 henry morgenthau secretary of the treasury combined the war savings staff managed by the treasury and the victory fund committees into new organization called the war finance division which reported to the treasury10 from may 1 1941 through december 1945 the war finance division and its predecessors were responsible for the sale of nearly 186 billion worth of government securities of this more than 54 billion was in the form of war savings bonds bonds alone accounted for 337 billion11 according to most economi c historians the war loan drives were successful in encouraging the average workers to purchase war bonds and those with greater financial resources to purchase victory loans these sales absorbed potential consumer spending that would have exacerbated inflation and expanded blackmarket activity the purchase of war bonds represented much new net savings because small savers had limited alternative saving instruments the war loan drives had strong patriotic appeal involved 6 million volunteers and utilized extensive donated advertising each war loan drive was unique fusion of nationalism and consumerism seeking to stir the conscience of americans it invoked both their financial and moral stake in the war the sale of war bonds provided way in which patriotic attitudes and the spirit of sacrifice could be expressed12 neither war bonds nor victory loans were earmarked for defense spending during the second world war however defense related spending reached over 90 of federal outlays

return and semiannual inflation rate single annual rate called the composite rate reflects the combined effects of the fixed rate and the semiannual inflation rate the fixed rate is selected by the treasury and is in effect when bond is issued and applies until the bond matures the semiannual inflation rate reflects the percentage change in the cpiu consumer price index for all urban consumers current economic and financial conditions the present economy is vastly different from that of the second world war war bonds were then marketed to reduce consumer spending the current economy however has low rate of inflation and rising unemployment controls exist on prices wages production interest rates on marketable treasury securities or installment loans goods and services are rationed instead of attempting to reduce consumer spending many federal officials are concerned about maintaining consumer spending currently the us economy is in recession with rising unemployment and declining real gross domestic product the federal reserve has implemented an expansionary monetary policy through numerous reductions in the federal funds rate and an increase in the rate of growth of the money supply many macroeconomists are advocating federal actions to raise aggregate demand such as further interest rate cuts increased federal spending and additional tax cuts moreover the us financial system is more complex sophisticated diverse and deregulated than in the world war two era small savers have an array of savings vehicles for example they can invest funds in money market funds and certificates of deposit cds of financial institutions today savings bonds are almost always substitute mechanism for personal savings from that perspective the sale of war bonds would be expected to have minimal effect on national savings and the economy policy options the treasury departments designation on december 11 2001 of series ee savings bonds as patriot bonds to contribute to the war on global terrorism will likely forestall further congressional legislative action congress could still pass legislation to achieve thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21046crs6 15 telephone interview with treasury official on sept 26 2001 this estimate was made by the treasury in may 2001 using model developed by the treasurysame purpose or it could rely on charitable donations brief discussion of these two options follows create war bond congress could decide that specific statutory endorsement of the decision to issue patriot bonds perhaps under different name would add to the bonds attractiveness as savings alternative some funds used to purchase these war bonds would likely represent the substitution of the war bonds for some other form of savings the us treasury estimates that for every 1 billion of savings bonds sold the treasury saves 7 million annually in interest costs over the financing cost of alternative treasury instruments15 these savings however have an insignificant effect on the total economy many economists believe the macroeconomic effects of the issuance of war bonds would be negligible the opportunity to buy war bonds would give the public direct sense of participation in recovery from the september attacks and the pursuit of terrorists spending for disaster relief and antiterrorism however is expected to be far higher than funds raised from the issuance of war bonds rely on charitable donations some would argue that because economic and financial market conditions today differ so much from those of the second world war new war bond issue is unnecessary an alternative would be to have citizens contribute to charitable organizations in his televised speech on september 15 2001 president george bush stated that people could make donations through the web site httpwwwlibertyuniteorg this web site titled american liberty partnership lists numerous charities and allows people to make online donations private donations would give people sense of participation and sacrifice for the common good and permit activities that are not under governments control some economists believe the macroeconomic effects would be limited because much of the money donated would merely substitute for other charitable causes to the extent that contributio ns reduced private consumption this decline in aggregate demand would be largely offset when the donations are spent for disaster relief
