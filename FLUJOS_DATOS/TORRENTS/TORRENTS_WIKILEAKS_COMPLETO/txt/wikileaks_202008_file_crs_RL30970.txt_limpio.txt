in russia and other soviet successor states context and issues for congress summary health issues in the eurasian states of the former soviet union have received increased us attention in recent years as part of this concern january 2000 us national intelligence estimate nie highlighted global threats posed to us citizens and interests by increasing tuberculosis hepatitis hivaids and other infectious diseases outside us borders while mostly focusing on disease threats emanating from africa and asia the nie also highlighted emerging disease threats in eurasia it warned that increased political military social and economic disorder in the eurasian states could be worsened by the spread of disease thereby setting back their democratic and free market reforms and that such instability might further complicate us arms control cooperation and efforts to contain the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in addition the nie cautioned that eurasian militaries and populations could face increased illhealth harming the national security of the eurasian states and diminishing the effectiveness of the militaries in international peacekeeping also ill military forces and populations could become agents for the spread of diseases among us forces involved in international exercises and training and to the us homeland population after the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 the spread of anthrax by mail later in the year and other incidents there were heightened policy concerns about biological terrorism and disease threats to the us homeland these concerns are increasingly informing the debate over health policy and aid to eurasia where the major foci of us policy long have been democratic and economic reforms and arms control and health aid has been viewed as complementing reforms and as justified on humanitarian grounds congressional concerns about health conditions in eurasia have been reflected in legislative language and other actions although us health aid for eurasia has long been overshadowed by other us aid priorities it increased as percentage of all us foreign assistance to eurasia in fy2002 partly as response to 911 the dollar amounts of health aid funded under the authority of the freedom support act and carried out by the us agency for international development in fy2003 declined from fy2002 for most eurasian countries however other agency and program budgets provide healthrelated aid that fills this gap to some extent but much of this assistance tends to be focused on narrow programs such as transporting medical cargoes retraining scientists or peace corps activities this report provides an overview of health conditions in the eurasian states us aid efforts in recent years and issues

31 health in russia and other soviet successor states context and issues for congress introduction during the soviet era health information was closely guarded and government health statistics highly suspect the soviet government proclaimed the high quality of its socialized healthcare system soviet data showed numbers of hospital beds and doctors per capita as among the highest in the world and life spans comparable to those in other developed countries as became more apparent after the soviet collapse such data were often incomplete or falsified and covered up substantial and growing health problems the eurasian states of the former soviet union1 faced problems sustaining the huge expensive and ineffective healthcare systems they inherited health conditions seemed to deteriorate during the 1990s as measured by life expectancy at birth infant and maternal mortality drug addiction rates of infectious disease and other measures on some measures these states now face health challenges common to developing countries and these challenges are hindering their economic and democratic development according to many observers2 data on health and healthcare in the eurasian states are poor but some general conditions and trends may be discerned besides healthcare quality and access factors affecting health touched on but not analyzed in detail in this report include poverty rates conflict living and working conditions and the environment overview of us policy although health issues in the eurasian states have been lower priority in us assistance and relations than arms control and economic and democratic reforms they have been matter of us concern since the early 1990s and have received 1 the eurasian states also termed the newly independent states or nis are generally considered as including the western soviet successor states belarus moldova russia and ukraine the south caucasian states armenia azerbaijan and georgia and the central asian states kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan 2 according to the us agency for international development usaid the health of the population and the capacity of the health systems to serve them have worsened in the twelve countries of the eurasia region since the countries gained independence in 1991 budget justification to the congress fy2004 annex iii europe and eurasia p 527 crs2 increased attention in recent years us health assistance to eurasia began even before the collapse of the soviet union with publicprivate medical aid program to distribute pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to the soviet republics later the bush1 and clinton administrations led international efforts to address needs in eurasia including health needs the 1992 freedom support act pl 102511 the major authorization for aid to eurasia included the provision of medicine and medical supplies and equipment and other aid to create quality healthcare and family planning services as priorities of us assistance3 in the early 1990s however us and western donors lacked clear picture of health conditions in the eurasian states largely because of the mostly sanguine picture painted by soviet health officials and some donors tended to assume that shortterm aid infusion would put eurasian health systems back on their feet in short time it later became clear that the eurasian states faced massive health problems that would be hard to ameliorate increased attention in the united states to global disease threats included january 2000 unclassified national intelligence estimate nie on the implications for us national security of rising infectious disease outside us borders according to the nie infectious diseases could add to political military social and economic disorder in the eurasian states and could set back democratic and free market reforms such instability might further complicate us arms control cooperation and efforts to contain the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in addition the nie cautioned that eurasian militaries and populations could face increased illhealth harming the national security of the eurasian states and diminishing the effectiveness of the militaries in international peacekeeping also ill military forces and populations could become agents for the spread of diseases among us forces involved in international exercises and training and to the us homeland population4 post 911 after the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 the spread of anthrax by mail later in the year and the more recent foreign threats of new or lesserknown diseases such as the west nile virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars there were heightened policy concerns about biological terrorism and international disease threats to the us homeland and us foreign interests in september 2002 the national intelligence council issued followon report to its global infectious disease threat which highlighted the threat of hivaids and other infectious diseases in countries of strategic importance to the 3 silk road act language in pl 106113 signed into law in november 1999 also authorized enhanced policy and aid to support humanitarian needs in the south caucasus and central asia including the provision of medicines and medical equipment 4 cia national intelligence council the global infectious disease threat and its

threaten the united states since it is major hub of world travel with large number of citizens residing overseas the report states that major means of combating the infectious disease threat as well as biological terrorism include the establishment of effective global surveillance and response systems but that the lack of capacity funds and commitment in many eurasian states stymie such efforts in the bush2 administration secretary of state colin powell testified in march 2001 that increased foreign affairs expenditures for child survival and diseases were high priority including because hivaids is spreading into the new countries of the former soviet union and he termed hivaids national security concern6 us policymaking on health issues in eurasia involves the state departments bureau of european and eurasian affairs the office of the coordinator of us assistance to europe and eurasia the office of international health affairs and usaid and the department of health and human services hhs and other agencies the coordinator for assistance plays major role in integrating policy and implementation goals but interagency cooperation is challenged by new health emphases such as hivaids and other changes in funding usaid is the lead agency in implementing healthcare aid programs in the eurasian states its bureau of global health provides guidance to field offices and evaluates programs and needs through interagency agreements it works with hhss europe and north eurasia regional bureau of the office of global health affairs and with hhss centers for disease control and prevention cdc the office helps host the us russia health committee cdc has assumed greater prominence post911 in helping to implement often in cooperation with usaid efforts to prevent and control infectious diseases in eurasia including biological agents7 the cdc has emphasized that combating infectious diseases in eurasia protects us citizens at home and abroad serves humanitarian and

emphasizes that such aid serves humanitarian purposes and helps ensure the success of other us aid for democratization economic reforms and the security of the eurasian states and does not appear to highlight the us homeland security benefits of such aid9 in the state departmentusaid strategic plan for fy2004fy2009 eurasian healthcare issues are mentioned as affecting us security while the main rationale given for healthcare aid appears humanitarian rather than strategic the plan states that healthy world will be more stable and secure and prevent adverse conditions from spilling across our borders the problem of eurasian hivaids however is not stressed as security issue the state departments performance plans for fy2003 and for fy2004 do not highlight health problems in eurasia but the fy2003 plan does aver that the unmitigated spread of major virulent diseases poses direct threat to the american people the campaign against global diseases directly supports us national interests and major foreign policy goals such as promoting stable societies and economies the fy2004 plan does not explicitly link eurasian health to homeland security or other means to protect us citizens but includes health among second priority of enhancing global development10 congress has become increasingly concerned about the rising global threat of infectious diseases including hivaids tb and malaria and has authorized and appropriated funds reflecting that concern11 though primary attention in congress is focused currently on the threat these diseases pose in africa and much of the increased funding is directed to african programs there is some increased attention to health problems in eurasia and other regions members of the house banking committee hrept106548 in reporting the global aids and tuberculosis relief act of 2000 pl 106264 cited the january 2000 nie to the effect that increases in hivaids are threatening africa asia and eurasia on the appropriations side foreign

trafficking in persons pl 1087 excluded health aid from restrictions on assistance provided for russia and ukraine the conferees hrept10810 indicated that they wanted to sustain the momentum of the previous year on health reforms they directed that of the 60 million in health aid 15 million be provided for reproductive health and family planning and that some aid should be used to expand primary and advanced healthcare and to combat tb in central asia as in previous years they endorsed the eurasian healthcare work of the world council of hellenes and strongly recommended that not less than 25 million be provided to help make the initiative selfsustaining besides the health assistance programs carried out by usaid under the authority of the freedom support act some healthrelated programs are either funded under the freedom support act or under other agency budgets or authorities such as the peace corps biotechnical redirection programs carried out to retrain former biological warfare scientists in medical and pharmaceutical fields the excess property program of the defense department and transporting privately donated medical aid the csd account provided 575 million in fy2003 to russia ukraine and central asia to combat hivaids congress has generally appeared to support health assistance that amounts to few percent of the overall aid to eurasia see table 1 at the end of the report total us aid budgeted for fy1992fy2003 for health programs in eurasia was about 51 of about 245 billion of all aid for eurasia health aid has been dwarfed by that provided for democratization economic reform and arms control in early 2003 rep barbara boxer was among members generally calling for more emphasis on international health aid arguing the tragic events of september 11 2001 has forced the united states to broaden its concept of threat us national security is buttressed by combating infectious diseases before they reach us borders and is also served when diseases do not threaten global economic growth12 in keeping with this enhanced concern the senate in august 2002 approved s 2487 the bipartisan global pathogen surveillance act13 although not enacted into law by the 107th congress similar bill s 871 was introduced in the senate in april 2003 and hr 2329 was introduced in the house in june 2003 in introducing s 871 sen joseph biden stressed that us support for international surveillance to detect terroristrelated or naturally occurring disease outbreaks buttressed homeland security since travel or other means could permit pathogens to quickly enter the united states14 in may 2003 s 871 was incorporated substantially 12 washington quarterly spring 2003 pp 199207 13 s 2487 was described as lending an international dimension to the bioterrorism

authorizes 150 million over fy2004fy2005 in support of hr 1298 pl 10825 the united states leadership against hivaids tuberculosis and malaria act of 2003 rep alcee hastings and sen john mccain were among those who warned that eurasia represented coming hivaids crisis area that could harm global security and economics and sen jeff bingaman was among those mentioning this area in calling for adequate hivaids funding among other congressional activities sen richard lugar visited uzbekistan in august 2003 and reportedly discussed healthcare aid and medical training exchanges including funding for efforts by us and uzbek virologists to develop new infectious disease treatments15 in february 2001 rep curt weldon led bipartisan congressional delegation to visit legislators and medical officials in russia ukraine and moldova which included discussions of healthcare needs and us assistance16 in january 2003 he stressed the need for continued healthcare cooperation with russia and belarus17 health in the eurasian states context and current developments as part of the legacy of the former soviet union the eurasian states inherited large centralized healthcare apparatus that provided good care for some medical conditions but relied on outdated practices to treat other illnesses the health of soviet citizens lagged behind that of us and other western populations in terms of access to many new medical procedures and medicines and even in terms of prosaic measures such as the number of hospitals with plumbing and heat the healthcare system emphasized large number of specialized medical facilities with large staffs and prolonged hospitalizations rather than primary and preventive care including regular checkups the healthcare system was isolated from changing world standards of treatment of diseases such as tb it followed secretive practices that prevented the operation of competent disease surveillance system and it suffered from lack of medical supplies and equipment outside of the major medical centers after the eurasian states gained independence the new international borders 14 continued academies institute of medicine microbial threats to health

business relations that are still not satisfactory despite this shared legacy the eurasian states emerged from the soviet collapse with varying health situations some of the eurasian states had better healthcare facilities and healthier populations than others many observers have viewed central asias population as having suffered the most from inadequate healthcare during the soviet period the western eurasian states had older populations than the central asian states at the time of the soviet collapse reflecting differences in fertility and mortality environmental catastrophe affected health in several regions including the chernobyl area radiation fallout in ukraine and belarus chelyabinsk area radiation contamination in russia and kazakhstan semipalatinsk radiation from nuclear weapons testing in kazakhstan and the aral sea area desertification in kazakhstan and uzbekistan18 the eurasian states also differed in their rates of economic decline during the 1990s and in such related issues as healthcare funding the diets of the people and living conditions which affected infant survival and life expectancies conflicts in eurasia also damaged health leading to casualties injuries orphans and displaced persons who suffered physically and psychologically health challenges in all the eurasian states loom larger because of the very low percentages of gross domestic product gdp they have devoted to healthcare table 2 shows gdp per capita in the eurasian states and the percent going to health health spending levels are low in the eurasian states in comparison to the more than 8 on average spent in the organization for economic cooperation and development countries oecd composed mostly of european countries and the united states in most of the eurasian states central governments have devolved much fiscal and operational responsibility for healthcare to cashstrapped and illprepared localities resulting in chronic underfunding and the heavy reliance on legal or underthetable user fees to obtain healthcare in armenia and georgia most healthcare is paid for privately the juxtaposition of low government spending for healthcare and high poverty rates mean that large percentages of the populations throughout eurasia and particularly in central asia cannot afford to pay for healthcare in the postsoviet era demographers have been able to scrutinize previously suppressed health data and conduct analyses that suggest that some aspects of the health crisis in russia and other eurasian states can be traced back to the 1960s major indicator of overall health life expectancy peaked in the 1960s and began downward trend in russia and other republics of the former soviet union by the late 1960s perhaps caused by an increase in alcoholism violence tobacco use and poor diet another peak occurred in the mid1980s mostly attributed to government restrictions on alcohol consumption followed by decline that deepened after the soviet breakup though life expectancy in most eurasian states began to rise again 18 christopher murray and jose bobadilla in premature death in the new independent states washington dc national research council

biological arms control institute april 2003 and laurie garrett betrayal of trust new york hyperion 2000 crs8 after the mid1990s nonetheless life expectancy remains lower than in most european states life expectancy for males in the eurasian states in 2002 is 62 years see table 2 this compares unfavorably to 74 years for males from countries belonging to the oecd and 72 years for us males19 some policymakers and analysts have warned that adverse health trends in russia unprecedented for an urban literate society in the 21th century are contributing to dwindling population limiting its economic potential and reducing its influence on the international stage some even warn that such trends may raise the specter of political disintegration and the subsequent establishment of authoritarian rule hostile to western interests20 major causes of bad health in russia include cardiovascular disease cancer untreated chronic illnesses high blood pressure diabetes high cholesterol alcoholism contributing to homicide vehicular accidents and suicide drug abuse and infectious disease the threat of large increases in hivaids hepatitis and tb could further depress life expectancy although births in russia may have increased in 2003 perhaps partly because of an improved economy and larger cohort of females aged 2029 deaths continued to outpace them21 russia has only begun to address systematic healthcare reforms hospitals and clinics remain largely governmentowned though there are private physicians and private health insurance industry compulsory payroll contributions for healthcare began in 1993 but basic public health issues involving sanitation pharmaceuticals vaccinations ambulances and the distribution of medical staff countrywide remain unresolved while russian policy and us aid programs have emphasized the theoretical economic benefits of decentralization of healthcare to the regions some health experts have argued that decentralization has harmed healthcare at least in the short term in part because many public health issues are not fully addressable at the regional level22 perhaps reversing what some observers have termed policy of malign neglect of health issues by the russian government president vladimir putin in his 2001 stateofthenation address criticized the lack of fundamental reforms of the 19 russias demographic problems however are attributable not only to declining health but also to population dynamics including the ripple effects of world war ii and evolving family planning attitudes see us department of commerce

sovietera healthcare system the lack of federal and local budgetary support for healthcare inadequate functioning of the insurance system and the widespread demand by state hospitals and doctors for illicit underthetable payments in his stateofthenation address in 2003 putin pointed to increasing birth rates and progress in lowering infant mortality as positive trends but decried increasing death rates attributable to illness and injuries he stated that the government was moving to strengthen the medical insurance system to reduce the inequalities of the present system23 putins concerns were reflected in the trebling of the budget for healthcare in 20002003 and plans for 35 billion rubles 117 billion for healthcare in 2004 in 2001 russia launched an annual survey of childrens health and in 2003 putin ordered checkups for 34 million children faltering healthcare in central asia has been reflected in decreasing life spans high infant and maternal mortality rates and increases in cardiovascularcirculatory parasitic infectious and respiratory diseases while the spread of tb and hepatitis in central asia is most worrisome the office coordinating interagency and international aid efforts on hivaids the joint united nations program on hivaids or unaids has pointed to rising hivaids rates in kazakhstan and elsewhere in central asia as global concern24 poor sanitation and increasing drug abuse tobacco and alcohol use malnutrition diet deficiencies and tainted blood supplies contribute to declining health healthcare reforms have focused on making the healthcare system more efficient by closing excess hospitals and other means efforts to obtain more funding through taxes and payroll deductions have been disappointing resulting in heavy reliance on user fees for service tajikistan altered its constitution in referendum in june 2003 to remove provision guaranteeing free healthcare because in reality the government explained the majority of patients were required to pay for care and medicines only in kyrgyzstan has compulsory health insurance plan had some success25 kyrgyzstan has made the most progress in healthcare reform though its fragile economy places them at risk and tajikistan and turkmenistan the least the health consequences of poor quality healthcare seriously constrain economic development in the region according to many observers26 23 putin had received government report in january 2003 that estimated that only 31 of medical services were covered by state insurance and that the insurance program was shockingly mismanaged fbis

usaid central asian republics desk officer paper panel on public health and environmental issues harvard colloquium on international affairs march 11 2000 crs10 selected health indicators by looking at how country measures up in certain categories of health over time it is possible to get picture of the health situation in that country unfortunately another legacy of the soviet healthcare system is the lack of reliable health statistics the soviet union did not follow world health organization who methods for coming up with birth death and other data and the eurasian states are at various stages in implementing who data standards making it difficult to compare many health indicators across eurasia and with other countries reputable international organizations may not agree with each others estimates such as the uns human development report and the world banks world development report this report usually uses statistics from agencies although the agencies rely on governmentprovided data they sometimes prefer their own estimates and an estimate by one agency may not match that of another the statistics used in this paper should be used only as general view of the situation in and among the eurasian states and should not be assumed to be directly comparable to us or european health statistics most observers agree that the early 1990s saw major declines in health in virtually all eurasian states in terms of such measures as infant mortality alcoholism and cardiovascular disease the central asian states suffered the greatest declines in eurasia in life expectancy increased morbidity deterioration of conditions in hospitals and other health facilities and failures to control and prevent infectious diseases from 1995 onward as eurasian economies began to stabilize there were improvements or slowing declines in these health conditions concerning other problems such as infectious diseases tobacco use and drug addiction the situation has become worse in many of the states by most measures health in the eurasian states in 2003 continues to lag behind that in most developed countries childhood and maternal mortality rates table 2 shows mortality rates for children under five years of age according to usaid increasing mortality rates in the eurasian states among children under five years old are telling signs of the deterioration of healthcare and the plight of many families suffering from poverty and malnutrition27 usaid estimates that mortality rates for children under five years of age increased in all the eurasian states over the period 19901997 the worst record in all its geographic bureaus28 maternal mortality rates are much higher in the eurasian states than in many other european countries see table 5 causes include poor nutrition lack of maternal care and extremely high rates of abortion compared to the united states and most of europe high rates of abortion and maternal mortality are being reduced in several eurasian states by education and access to other contraceptive methods table 5 in russia concerns about morality and 27 infant mortality is generally used to determine the overall health of country however because most of the eurasian states still use the soviet system of measuring infant mortality which undercounts deaths this report uses under 5 years of age mortality statistics 28 usaid

population decline led the government in 2003 to propose banning many abortions and the legislature to cut off funding for family planning clinics29 childhood vaccination rates in eurasia declined dangerously in the late 1980s and early 1990s contributing to diphtheria epidemic in the early 1990s by the mid1990s this epidemic accounted for 90 of worldwide cases ukraine russia and tajikistan were hardest hit the bush1 administration and usaid collaborated with who in delivering vaccines and the united states later advocated international donor assistance for childhood immunizations by the latter 1990s diphtheria cases had declined greatly as had some other childhood diseases but stillinadequate vaccination rates raise the threat of new outbreaks30 report issued by unicef in july 2003 indicated that infant mortality rates in many eurasian states were considerably higher than data provided by eurasian governments and warned that its findings pointed to child survival crisis in the south caucasus and central asia the widest discrepancies between unicefs estimates and official data for the 1990s were found in azerbaijan where the estimate was 74 infant deaths for every 1000 live births versus an official rate of 17 per 1000 georgia 43 versus 16 kazakhstan 62 versus 24 and turkmenistan 74 versus 33 unicefs executive director carol bellamy stated that such flawed official statistics are danger to children because they keep governments and health workers and even parents in the dark on the true nature of the threats to child survival report on surveys issued by the us department of health and human services in april 2003 came to similar conclusions regarding eurasian government data on infant mortality31 perhaps partly in response to the international critiques uzbekistan decided to implement the who standards for reporting infant mortality the increase in infectious diseases the sharp deterioration of the health infrastructure due to economic conditions has contributed to dramatic increase in infectious disease cases increasing levels of infectious diseases such as tb hivaids and malaria have raised great concerns from the international community statistics for the eurasian states provided by unaids and the whos 29 the proposed restrictions on abortions after the twelfth week of pregnancy have fueled much debate russias human rights ombudsman

impacted by the large number of persons forced from their homes by warfare and discrimination since the breakup of the soviet union the high commissioner for refugees has estimated that during the 1990s as many as nine million people left their homes in eurasia these included refugees who fled their countrys warfare those displaced within their own country by war or returned from exile to find their homes and communities destroyed and those forced to leave their homes denied citizenship or declared aliens in their homeland under new residence or citizenship laws lack of routine health care and immunization poor food and sanitation exposure to disease and violence against vulnerable groups all result in declines in health among those living in crowded refugee camps or makeshift housing international humanitarian assistance to victims of either warfare or natural disasters always includes emergency health care and some routine preventive health assistance aid which does not necessarily improve the overall health picture in country but does address life threatening health needs major humanitarian emergencies caused by conflict have occurred in armenia azerbaijan georgia russia and tajikistan during the 1990s conflict resulted in the exile or displacement of over 15 million armenians azerbaijanis georgians and chechens and other residents of russia according to the high commissioner for refugees45 other population shifts have included ethnic russians leaving former republics where they are ethnic minorities and returning to russia 3 million between 1992 and 1996 and crimean tatars returning to their homeland in ukraine 250000 between 19881999 while aid agencies have responded to the urgent health needs of the refugees and some of the displaced their

obstacles in russia and other eurasian states including resistance from sovietera healthcare establishments and officials and skyrocketing poverty rates which have placed feeforservice healthcare out of reach for many people47 however the changes are seen by usaid as essential to the ability of the healthcare systems to modernize and function on their own without ongoing international donor

citizenshave the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of reform50 in keeping with the new emphasis usaids assistance activities in recent years have been divided into three broad strategic areas economic democratic and social transition or global health the objectives of social transition assistance include improving eurasian health and other social benefits and services usaid healthcare goals included helping the eurasian states to draw up healthcare and insurance legislation and policy focusing on communitybased primary health care to improve the costeffectiveness of healthcare budgets to improve the quality of healthcare to educate citizens about their personal healthcare rights and obligations and to reduce environmental and occupational health risks since 911 more health aid has

whether the result of nature or bioterrorism are among those that might spread to us shores particularly since 911 they emphasize the significance to homeland security of disease prevention and surveillance beyond us shores other observers urge not diluting recently focused us policy and assistance aimed at combating health problems in some areas of africa asia and latin america by shifting attention to eurasia they argue that infectious disease rates are not as great in eurasia so do not pose as severe near term threat to us interests some argue that us ties with russia and other eurasian states on arms control and eliminating terrorists are more important to us homeland security and that eurasian health matters are best left to the countries to solve on their own some broadly call for winding down or eliminating freedom support act assistance including for health programs to many or most of the eurasian states in line with plans to graduate or phase out this aid to countries that have made developmental progress others respond that few if any of the eurasian states have made much healthcare progress see below in addition to these issues of homeland security many observers stress that us interests in economic and political reforms in eurasia may be undermined by health problems in the countries adverse health trends in russia may be drag on economic reforms foster civil unrest encourage countervailing political authoritarianism and perhaps lead to more internationally belligerent nuclear armed russia62 even small increases in health aid may pay big dividends in discouraging such developments in russia some observers argue however as table 2 indicates governments of the eurasian states are spending very small percentage of their budgets on health without greater commitments by the states to healthcare us assistance appears at most palliative in addition the states must address the societal roots of health problems such as alcohol and drug abuse and homicides and suicides 61 the world bank beyond transition the world bank in europe and central asia june 2003 averting aids crises in eastern europe and central asia 2003 country briefs and projects database at httpwwwworldbankorg 62 nicholas eberstadt kennan institute february 5 2001 crs24 us security interests may be served by bolstering the health of eurasias military forces and civilian populations declining health in the military and security forces can harm their ability to combat terrorism and drug trafficking to ensure the safety and security of weapons of mass destruction and otherwise to defend the territorial integrity of the states if the military forces are less capable of carrying out these missions then us border customs and security aid recently boosted by the administration and congress may be less effective than anticipated according to this argument also terrorist groups may be able to gain more adherents when failing healthcare systems increase popular discontent us health aid has been considered by several eurasian military establishments as major benefit of military tomilitary cooperation according to us defense officials the us military also views the rise of infectious and other diseases in the eurasian states as risks to us troops during military training exchanges exercises and operations involving the eurasian states63 critics counter that the us military is always concerned about protecting personnel from disease and that eurasian military personnel are more dangerous than the personnel of other countries with large health problems how much can the united states do to improve health conditions in eurasia and what types of health aid are appropriate the united states faces competing priorities for its aid dollars and limits on its ability to fund healthcare reforms in eurasia observers who urge greater emphasis on us health aid to eurasia argue that small increases in aid may well pay big dividends in lowering disease rates and ameliorating social discontent in the eurasian states some call for much larger commitments to meet pressing health needs in eurasia perhaps by shifting aid from democratization and economic reform programs many urge caution in taking on new eurasian health aid commitments unilaterally the states face interrelated and costly healthcare public health infrastructure and environmental problems such as deteriorating hospitals failing water and sanitary systems radiation hazards in kazakhstans semipalatinsk nuclear testing site and the evaporation of the aral sea that demand largescale sustained and in many cases multinational attention congress and the administration have clashed for several years over how much aid to provide for eurasia annual us health aid to the eurasian states has averaged about 51 of total aid to the region rising somewhat after 911 due to cuts in freedom support act funding in recent years excepting 911related assistance in fy2002 the actual amount of health aid provided through usaid has steadily increased only to kyrgyzstan and tajikistan other healthrelated funding from agency budgets and other programs fills this gap to some degree but much of this assistance tends to be focused on narrow programs such as transporting medical cargoes retraining scientists or peace corps activities one way to address the need for more assistance would be to increase the percent of foreign aid devoted to health 63 the rise of diphtheria cases in russia in the early 1990s for instance was traced to soviet troops returning from afghanistan and to infected russian peacekeeping troops that were rotated out of tajikistan crs25 in eurasia or to establish congressional guidelines for the amount of aid to be provided for health assistance either of these changes would require further shifts in us policy which for long time focused on democratization and economic reforms and arms control also there may be need to consider longerterm health aid commitments particularly if us assistance is targeted more to healthcare institutionbuilding and reform efforts that aim to bolster the ability of the eurasian states to meet their own needs perhaps reflecting such partial shift in priorities and desire to insulate healthcare from cuts the administration appears to be requesting an amount for healthcare for eurasia for fy2004 that is slightly higher than that for fy2003 despite calling for overall cuts in freedom support act funding some observers have suggested that the administrations proposed millennium challenge account and the global aids initiative or other health programs might include health aid for some or all eurasian states fy2001 was the first year that congress included eurasia in the child survival and disease csd account where most us foreign assistance for health is provided possibly increasing the percent of foreign aid available for health in eurasia until that year health programs in eurasia were mainly funded through the freedom support act where health programs competed with other programs eurasia received 68 million in csd funds in fy2001 none in fy2002 and 575 million in fy2003 second possible change in health aid to eurasia would be to alter the distribution of aid among the countries table 1 shows the distribution of usaids bilateral health funds to the eurasian states in recent years the largest aid amounts have gone to armenia kazakhstan russia ukraine and uzbekistan much less health assistance has been provided to azerbaijan belarus moldova and turkmenistan the distribution of aid is not clearly matched to the health status of the states neither matching rankings of under five mortality table 2 nor rankings of health system performance in eurasia as determined by the world health organization64 instead number of considerations seem to influence decision making on the distribution of aid besides targeting it to the most needy eurasian states including the degree to which aid should be targeted to the closest or most strategic us friends or to the most democratic and marketoriented states such determinations are complicated by the added desirability of targeting us aid to eurasian states where governments are receptive honest and efficient at carrying out healthcare reforms although these conditions are scarcely met in any of the eurasian states65 in russia and other eurasian states many critics charge the governments are highly corrupt inefficient and not focused on health budgets policies and stewardship66 in such conditions us and international medical assistance to the 64 who the world health report 2000 health systems improving performance pp 200 203 65 who the world health report 2002 reducing risks

also proper stewardship to maximize healthcare performance dollar for dollar 66 nicholas eberstadt kennan institute february 5 2001 argues that the russian leadership has failed compared to other societies that have gone through economic turmoil to provide continued crs26 eurasian states risks being undermined or redirected for political purposes in some cases eurasian governments have blocked medical as well as other humanitarian aid to civilians for political and military purposes such as in chechnya using it as weapon to bring populations and separatist movements into line to help circumvent problems with governments some observers have argued that us health aid should focus more on highquality indigenous healthrelated ngos in eurasia to ensure that aid is used properly and to strengthen longterm selfhelp capabilities while others caution that in most of eurasia such local ngos are still hard to find among possibly clashing us aid objectives us health aid dedicated to disaster assistance or to idps and refugees in an eurasian state may shortchange health aid support for the rest of countrys population usaid family planning programs in eurasia must comply with policy promoting maternal health and the provision of modern contraception methods that counteract the inordinately high rates of abortion throughout the region likewise with hivaids spreading throughout eurasia primarily through injecting drug users us programs to curb the spread of the disease must comply with restrictions on us drug assistance programs many in congress suggest that other industrialized countries should bear greater share of eurasian health assistance us advocacy of greater western involvement has in the past acted to spur european donors for details on eurasian aid issues see crs issue brief ib95077 the former soviet union and us foreign assistance updated regularly usaid has argued that most eurasian states have made minimal progress in health sector reform since their independence and that it will take several more years before any are ready to have such aid phased out some of the states it warns have made progress or even lost ground67 in 2001 report analyzing the health situation in eurasia usaid judged armenia and georgia as making the most progress although still inadequate in health reforms kyrgyzstan was viewed as appearing dedicated to healthcare reform despite its lack of resources while azerbaijan turkmenistan belarus and tajikistan were judged as making progress usaid warned that near to mediumterm prospects for the eurasian countries are quite poor given the weak commitments of many of the countries to undertake health reforms and their frail capacity to implement them also corruption was major impediment to reforms it averred as were conflicts in the south caucasus and the diversion of scarce resources to fight epidemics usaid suggested possibly committing greater percentage of its country aid to building healthcare systems and stressing to the states that reforms in healthcare governance and free markets are closely interrelated 66 continued adequate healthcare partly because the russian population has not demanded it ukrainian demographer valentyna steshenko has been critical that neither the public in ukraine nor their leadership focus on the preservation and improvement of public health as
