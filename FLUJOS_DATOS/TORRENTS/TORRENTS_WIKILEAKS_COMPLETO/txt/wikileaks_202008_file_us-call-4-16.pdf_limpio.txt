operational environment lieutenant colonel christopher m holden task force 1 senior observercontroller jrtc operations group fm 30611 combined arms operations in urban terrain paragraph 1412 states that company team may be required to perform search as part of battalion task force or independently conduct of cordon and search operation is an infantry company collective task specified in training guidance for ongoing military operations in operation enduring freedom oef and operation iraqi freedom oif yet none of the infantry series field manuals fms defines or offers tactics techniques and procedures ttp for the cordon and search these articles on cordon and search procedures and trends from ongoing training at the joint readiness training center jrtc have been compiled in an effort to fill that doctrinal void and offer crucial tactical information on military operations and tasks associated with both oif and oef this handbook is intended for leaders at all levels that are involved in the combat readiness of our armed forces the authors are primarily jrtc observercontrollers ocs many with recent experience in theater who every month teach coach and mentor combat arms leaders deploying into combat operations conducting cordon and search operation in an urban area is the primary bread and butter stability operations and support operations critical task in the contemporary operating environment coe the coe contains many variables that affect operations these variables include the military capabilities of tough and adaptable enemy armed with improvised explosive devices ieds rocket propelled grenades rpgs and ak47s who generally do not abide by established laws of land warfare an ambiguous military and political situation criminal organizations unruly civilians on the battlefield information operations that include the impact of embedded media religious and cultural considerations and the challenging physical environments urban sprawl or hot desert all these variables combine to create challenging nonlinear battlefield for our armed forces lieutenant general ltg william wallace commander combined arms center stated during recent jrtc visit that the coe is harder less conventional and more simultaneous than ever before and he expressed the desire for all ctcs to replicate the tough coe found in afghanistan and iraq the goal of coe implementation in army training is to produce an objective force of leaders soldiers and units capable of rapidly adapting and optimizing capabilities to achieve mission objectives this complex task includes the cordon and search mission with its own multitude of sub tasks including how to tactically move to the targeted destination and return safely route and urban area reconnaissance patrol operations tactical convoys establishing checkpoints andor roadblocks reacting to civil disturbance operations reacting to sniper fire employing snipers and searching buildingroom for official use only vcordon and search handbookduring all operations commanders must constantly assess the situation in terms of the application and interrelation of mission enemy terrain and weather troops and support available time available and civil considerations metttc factors when considering the cordon and search operation in coe commanders will discover they must apply metttc differently than they would during normal offensive or defensive operations the enemy for example may be set of ambiguous threats and potential adversaries depending on metttc the commander must contemplate what type of cordon and search entry ie aggressive passive knock on the door bust down the door etc is in synch with their higher commanders intent are higher commanders one and two levels up oriented on winning hearts and minds or are they focused on stabilizing the area if the intent is balance between the two the level of aggressiveness may be more closely tied to executing cordon and knock ttp commanders and their staff must not only plan prepare and execute the cordon and search task they must also analyze the ramifications and repercussions of the action itself for time it was the practice of the 101st airborne division air assault to follow each cordon and search operation with an intense information operation campaign which included distributing soccer balls to the children to achieve balance between attaining target success and winning hearts and minds executing cordon and search in the coe is thinking mans game training and educating our leaders and soldiers on the intricacies of the cordon and search at home station is critical for the success of our joint forces on the coe battlefield at jrtc we are committed to teaching units the fundamentals of the cordon and search and we think this series of articles published by the center for army lessons learned call is an excellent starting pointcenter for army lessons learned vi for official use onlychapter 1 executing the cordon and search recent observed trends lieutenant colonel christopher m holden task force 1 senior observercontroller jrtc operations group what follows is summary of unit positive performance and needs emphasis observations based on the assessments of jrtc observercontrollers ocs as units executed cordon and search situational training exercises stxs and rotations under stressful and demanding contemporary operational environment coe executing cordon and search is challenging mission understanding the commanders intent considering the mission enemy terrain and weather troops and support available time available and civil considerations metttc and understanding stability operations and support operations soso doctrine are all crucial to becoming proficient in leading cordon and search operation soldiers and leaders at the jrtc train in complex tough stressful conditions that incorporate as many variables of the coe as possible fm 306 urban operations aptly states without tightly coordinated civilmilitary effort success will be difficult or impossible to achieve commanders who can understand and cope with the complexities of stability operations and support operations gain insights that directly apply to executing any urban operation company commander who was involved in more than 100 cordon and search missions explains this complex coe american soldiers are facing men with cell phone in one hand rocket propelled grenade rpg in the other and illconceived hatred in their heart this enemy is asymmetric in the most unpredictable way urban environments present so many threats ranging from rooftop shootings and driveby shootings to civil unrest against the cordon and search at jrtc units and soldiers face many of these same challenging coe variables while executing the cordon and search here at jrtc units face friction demanding timelines world class opposing force armed with multitude of weapons and an environment set up to replicate as nearly as possible the coe conducting cordon and search operations in the coe presents unique challenge for units in their initial phases of trainup for combat deployment success at jrtc does not mean killing the opposing forces opfor but rather showing constant improvement and demonstrating positive attitude to learn based on these criteria the units observed whose performance is described below were successful at jrtc for official use only 1cordon and search handbookthe trends the following trends are organized by battlefield operating system bos intelligence positive performance fire support officer fso

although lethal indirect fires have their limitations in the challenging urban environment fire support planning is critical targeting restrictions within builtup area and rules of engagement roe complexities may limit the use of indirect lethal fires however they must always be planned for once the fso and his fire support element team become involved in patrol debriefings distributing battalion intelligence summaries intsums focusing the cordon and search teams on priority intelligence requirements pir and helping link each of these teams with the proper information operations io theme they become major combat multipliers negotiations company commanders demonstrated excellent negotiation techniques and were effective when dealing with key personnel in the villages however it must noted that these commanders had previously engaged in rigorous bilateral preparatory training sessions at jrtc with foreign language speakers posing as arab village leaders these roleplayers engaged their us coalition counterparts with plethora of troublesome vignettes to include sewage water electricity academics trash sweat initiative problems pay issues cultural dilemmas or other issues needs emphasis searches in general unit searches of buildings vehicles and personnel were unsatisfactory they often missed critical pir such as caches maps and weapons units are not properly incorporating these searches in their rehearsals and troopleading procedures units must establish disciplined and standardized search standing operating procedures sops to ensure searches are systematic thorough pirfocused and executed in secure fashion target acquisition individual soldiers are not adequately identifying and reporting suspected threats units initial lack of combat focus and inattention allowed soldiers to miss threat until they were engaged often soldiers would engage perceived threat prior to properly identifying the target leading to innocent civilians being engaged company commanders andcenter for army lessons learned 2 for official use onlyplatoon leaders in conjunction with their fire support partners are studying black gray and white lists but the critical intelligence information is not getting down to soldier level maneuver positive performance sniper employment at the battalion level generally speaking the battalion staff principally the battalion s2 and s3 would ensure the battalion level scouts were pirfocused understood the proper rules of engagement planned for adequate fire control measures established backup communications and had trained their snipers note most snipers had graduated from the fort benning sniper course or some type of special operations sniper course at home station integrating and planning aviation attack aircraft aviation was integrated effectively during cordon and search operations initial planning for attack by fire positions fire control measures and task and purpose were outstanding however more emphasis must be placed on ground commanders providing followon tasks and purposes for the aviation team after the inner cordon is set rehearsing different contingencies during the full dress rehearsal will minimize fragmentary orders fragos friction and unnecessary chatter on the radio aviation team leaders and ground commanders often lost situational awareness when the ground commanders span of control was challenged during the search phase or when there was civilian disturbance the aviation liaison officer lno at minimum should attend the cordon and search rehearsal normally it is impossible for the actual pilots to attend the rehearsal due to crew rest see attached articles on aviation planning and execution during the cordon and search needs emphasis securityweapon posture during the initial stages of jrtc rotation units constantly had negligent weapon discharges during cordon and search operations unit leaders must establish standardized clearing procedures and maintain strict enforcement of the proper weapon fire control standards too many soldiers experienced negligent discharges because they failed to place their weapon back on safe after firing leaders were not checking units did not fix negligent discharges until the problem received the proper command emphasis it was mandated that the first noncommissioned officer nco in the soldiers chain of command must observe the soldier execute proper clearing procedures soldiers must look like they mean business firsthand reports from oif and operation enduring freedom oef state categorically that the enemy goes after the weak link soldiers for official use only 3cordon and search handbookwho are well rehearsed well armed and well versed on their task and purpose normally are fearsome threat the enemy attacks the weak soldiers with poor weapon posture who are not missionfocused and who look scared or unconfident establishing tactical check point tcp although most units train on establishing tcp prior to jrtc deployment company level leaders consistently overlooked sound tactical principles setting up the outer cordon by establishing series of tcps at primary avenues of approach is similar to the principles of setting up left and right far security when executing typical ranger school ambush ranger cadre coach their students to place the left and right security in covered and concealed locations that are far enough from the assaulting force to provide early warning and protection common deficiency during cordon and search operations was the emplacement of the outer cordon so close to the targeted building that it could not provide early warning for the inner cordon and search teams do not place your left and right security in close visual proximity to your assaulting element doing so denies your team both early warning and protection leaders need to recall the basic doctrinal principles of planning reconnaissance control security and common sense react to civil disturbance units are initially overwhelmed and intimidated by hostile crowds they are unwilling to take forceful action to control crowds units executed multiple iterations of crowd control during the course of the rotation and were normally trained on this task by end of exercise endex units must rehearse executing friendly ttp for hostile crowds as published per combined forces land

use onlychallenge of companydesignated scouts company sniper teams generally were plagued with poor communication they were unable to forward intelligence to higher headquarters additionally company snipers were normally not well versed in their contingency plans and when compromised often caused friction and crisis at company and battalion level snipers at the company level often lacked confidence in their engagement criteria and failed to engage key enemy high priority targets such as mortar teams blacklisted personnel and enemy carrying rpgs command and control positive performance situational awareness soldiers armed with mission knowledge are less likely to make mistakes than soldiers who lack situational awareness after each cordon and search iteration leaders at all levels came to understand the importance of planning preparing and executing proper troopleading procedures for the purpose of educating and preparing their soldiers for combat leaders realized how important it is to have all soldiers in possession of their assigned equipment prior to departure precombat inspections pcis through series of painful lessons such as flat tires weapon malfunctions batteries in the precision lightweight global positioning system gps receiver plgr or advanced combat optical sites or other problems leaders realized the importance of ensuring all equipment and weapons function properly precombat checks pccs threedimensional terrain models used to enhance soldier knowledge and plan for fire control contingencies were continuously improved during each cordon and search iteration company commanders went from conducting rehearsals on pinup map board to becoming believers in company full dress rehearsals attended by every soldier in the unit platoons and squads also improved in their conduct of specific rehearsals they learned the importance of warning orders that allow subordinates to know as soon as possible what their general task and purpose is going to be commanders were often challenged with time management initially company commanders often used the 23 to 13 rule rather than vice versa the after action review aar process always brought this deficiency to light and time management at all levels quickly improved see the subsequent cordon and search chapters that cover troop leader procedures in detail needs emphasis synchronization and condition setting despite the improved company rehearsals company commanders were challenged in articulating their vision and end state this caused major synchronization challenges between the inner and outer cordon and caused major gaps in time between the activations of the inner and outer cordon these lapses allowed hostile crowds to assemble for official use only 5cordon and search handbookand become almost impossible to control as for setting the conditions company inner cordons initially failed to prevent civilian disruption of the search and protect the search teams from threat activity the inner and outer cordon did not conduct operations simultaneously for example the unit commander would establish platoonsized outer cordon composed of mounted and dismounted assets in direct sight of the village occupants thus giving up the principle of surprise as result villagers would leave their village because inner cordon was set up nor were any command messages issued to ask the outer cordon soldiers what they were doing when the inner cordon and unit leadership allow too much time to elapse before approaching and informing the villagers of their intent the civilians andor the enemy will take advantage of this time gap to interfere with the friendly commanders decisionmaking cycle establishment of the inner and outer cordon should be rehearsed simultaneous action that helps set the conditions for successful operation again the commander must incorporate metttc in determining timing inner and outer cordon triggers and when to initiate information operations io in order to engage the villagers establishoperate company command post company commanders had problems establishing and operating company command post to receive collect and distribute critical information important information passed from the company commander to his command post during mission often failed to reach the battalion tactical operations center toc this lack of critical

fratricides both with bluefor units and against civilians on the battlefield cobs were common during initial cordon and search iterations these were attributed to numerous troopleading procedure errors including inadequate initial company rehearsals that did not incorporate fire control measures enemy attack contingencies limited repetitions of battle drills react to contact clear roomclear building etc during the rehearsal phase and failure to plan for direct fire within the village additionally most ground commanders leaders and soldiers were unaware of weapons effects on buildings and their orientation of fires from ground and air weapons such as 240b machine gun mg 50 cal and 25mm which caused the unnecessary deaths of numerous innocent cobscenter for army lessons learned 6 for

are therefore increasingly aware of their duties and responsibilities in these areas see comments under intelligence positive performance paragraph 1 battalion task force tf commanders after observing an initial array of jrtc company cordon and search missions began identifying several areas of concern such as setting the conditions io themes and the importance of village engagement consequently

operations needs emphasis integration of mortars as units get more involved with information operations effectsbased operations and the planning of nonlethal fires they consistently suffer degradation in indirect fire planning preparation and execution during cordon and search operations mortar platoons seldom if ever achieved the five points of accurate fires indirect fire accuracy challenges include the following ºunits did not properly requestreceive meteorological met messages ºunits did not properly coordinate to have the field artillery fa position azimuth determining system pads survey the mortar guns in order to allow commonality between the mortars and the fa firing batteries units did not establish an easting oriented line eol normally signifying the mortar platoon failed to properly declinate the aiming circle and ensure it was on line ºpoor target location was caused by untrained observers who were often disoriented and not properly trained and rehearsed in call for fire and registration procedures ºunsatisfactory declination and boresighting were often caused by poor leader pcis and fire direction center fdc failure to redeclinate after mortar platoonsection

accuracy information operations integration units were challenged with just about all aspects of io integration in cases where the tpt proven to be an outstanding combat multiplier in oif and oef was used messages during cordon and search were initially broadcast in arabic only messages need to be in both arabic and english to facilitate both friendly and villager situational awareness and understanding because of improper positioning of the tpt friendly forces and villagers did not always hear messages units need to rehearse tpt activation and the established triggers for movement units should assign ground maneuver leader to constantly check on whether or not the tpt broadcast can be heard one ttp battalion might consider is using the experience and tactical savvy of the command sergeant major to ensure the effectiveness of the tpt broadcasts at company level at minimum leader in the inner cordon must be selected who possesses solid communications with the tpt and the unit commander nonlethal fires were normally neither scripted nor rehearsed generally speaking most company commanders span of control could not support effective use of the tpt company commanders were normally competent in executing an inner and outer cordon but the preparation and execution of the proper tpt triggers to efficiently utilize the nonlethal fires were often above their skill level units that established battalionlevel tac composed both of mounted command and control c2 cell and the tpt during cordon and search was the best ttp observed in both combat operations and at jrtc the battalion tactical command post tac after the appropriate rehearsed trigger such as foothold becoming secure or specific building being cleared has been executed delivers the tpt forward to

countermobility survivability positive performance class cl iv concertina the majority of units planned and procured sufficient cl iv concertina in preparation for inner and outer cordon actions concertina is of supreme importance to canalize separate and block villagers as well as protect friendly search teams units must establish sound sops pcis and pccs to ensure the proper loading and transporting of concertina numerous and often humorous incidents of soldiers unable to quickly uncoil concertina at the proper time and place caused unnecessary friction in the operation needs emphasis antiimprovised explosive device ied measures units must continuously plan prepare and use antiimprovised explosive device ied measures as they execute cordon and search operations as more emphasis was placed on the inner and outer cordon synchronization units placed less time on route reconnaissance ied battle drills ied predictive analysis and ied event templates rehearsing all aspects of route travel to and from the objective is just as important as the cordon and search itself combat service support positive performance planning and executing casualty collection first sergeants and platoon sergeants were normally very proactive in planning and executing casualty collection each iteration showed constant improvement in treatment triage and evacuation it is critical that combat medics and designated combat lifesavers have their medic and combat lifesaver cls bags inspected for possession of proper cl viii supplies prior to this dangerous operation needs emphasis casualty evacuation casevac planning failure by battalion staffs to assign sufficient numbers of vehicles prepared for casualty evacuation resulted in first sergeants 1sgs and platoon sergeants psgs giving hey you tasks rather than having planned and rehearsed teams and vehicles normally leaders must assign casualty collection points ccps in secured buildings leaders must ensure via backbriefs and rehearsals that all soldiers are aware of these designated ccps commanders must plan for both air and ground evacuation the commanders must visualize the physical act of evacuating casualties that will in turn assist in providing guidance to noncommissioned officers for official use only 9cordon and search handbookncos and the executive officer xo company commanders should plan on having ground ambulances forward with their team forward medical team during complex operation involving battalion resources and based on metttc the battalion task force commander should consider establishing combat medical team forward with the tac having the forward medical team with the tac will decrease the company commanders span of control during this complex operation metttc consideration depending on anticipated casualties is to compose team of ground ambulances physician assistant pa or doctor and mobile security team depending on evacuation routes and distances as ttp consider pa in the advanced trauma mode positioned in the tac to go forward during both real combat missions and at jrtc this ttp saved many lives due to quick responsiveness treatment triage and evacuation conclusions perhaps it is best to look at the cordon and search as the coe in its purest form the trends above show that battlefield operating system bos integration and synchronization are the most consistent challenges in executing such operations the enemy is indistinct the battlefield is not only nonlinear the outer cordon the inner cordon and the search are noncontiguous elements of the same operation success depends on situational awareness integration and synchronization between those disparate elements just mounting cordon and search operation calls into play every mission task essential for training for oif and oef and as shown above in the case of fire support improvement in planning and executing nonlethal effectsbased operations cannot be allowed to degrade skills in providing lethal firescenter for army lessons learned 10 for official use onlychapter 2 fundamentals captain adam carson task force 1 jrtc operations group surprise it is doubtful you can completely surprise an insurgent in an area of operations however the use of surprise based on timing or method when emplacing the outer cordon inner cordon and search element will increase the probability of success of the mission using surprise to establish the cordon will prevent the escape of individual targets and protect the forces conducting the operation in the urban environment the quicker the cordon isolates the objective the greater the likelihood of achieving surprise timesensitive target may require an immediate launch whereas more deliberate target may allow for timing based on vulnerabilities speed speed is relative term if you go so fast that you miss targets of opportunity speed can become costly however time spent on the target area will increase the probability of taking friendly force casualties the commander needs to spend as little time as possible searching and disrupting the local population search team and outer cordon emplaced simultaneously or search team in first and cordons in second needs to be determined by mission enemy terrain and weather troops and support available time available and civil considerations metttc concentration the commander needs to assess the right combat force ratio to accomplish the mission and plan for using all his combat multipliers aviation snipers tactical psychological operations team tpt civil affairs ca female searchers video cameras digital cameras tactical human intelligence teams thts and local forces commander has to think of concentrating those assets at the right place and at the right time the right time may be

depending on language skills these elements give soldiers more capability to communicate with the local populace audacity cost versus reward the principle of audacity relies on opportunity either presented or created you set the conditions for created opportunity beware of an opportunity that presents itself it may be trap during the planning of any cordon and search mission always leave an open escape route in order to create opportunities video taping of search area may create information operations io and human intelligence humint opportunities most cordon and search missions will be

outer cordon captain theo k moore task force 1 jrtc operations group the outer cordon is an integral element in any cordon and search operation and it requires detailed planning effective coordination and meticulous integration and synchronization to achieve the combined arms effects lethal and nonlethal sought by the commander trends the following are some common mistakes made by outer cordon elements the outer cordon element is not given the correct task and purpose for example interdict versus block the outer cordon element is not given specific instructions or criteria for searching detaining and passing traffic through their positions and therefore is not an effectiveactive part of the search there is lack of communications between the outer cordon element and the other cordon and search elements which leads to an overall lack of situational awareness sa there is lack of direct fire plan necessary control measures weapons control status and engagement criteria elements are not well rehearsed and prepared to communicate with and execute searches of personnel and vehicles there is lack of personnel and vehiclepersonnel search and holding areas there is lack of overall synchronization between the outer cordon and the other elements missions and purposes the securityouter cordon element has several purposes to prevent the escape of targeted personnel and materials to protect the search element from threat reinforcement direct and indirect fires and personnel and vehicleborne improvised explosive devices and to participate in the search typical tactical tasks include interdict isolate block contain deny and secure the reserve element may be colocated with elements of the securityouter cordon element command and control c2 of the reserve element however will normally be retained by the cordon and search commander command and control the outer cordon element is under the command and control of the cordon and search commander the leader of the outer cordon element must for official use only 13cordon and search handbookdevelop and maintain situational awareness of his area of responsibility as well as the areas of the inner cordon and the search elements this will enable the leader to anticipate threat activity control direct and indirect fires and facilitate the achievement of the elements task and purpose communications systems and reporting procedures must be implemented to facilitate situational awareness sa for the entire element task organization doctrinally the outer cordon element is referred to as the security element and the security element leader may c2 both the inner and outer cordon elements the inner cordon element may also be task organized under the search element or be separate subordinate element altogether each subordinate outer cordon element traffic control point tcp blocking position must have designated leader and clear task and purpose depending upon the elements tactical task and factors of mission enemy terrain and weather troops and support available time available and civil considerations metttc weapon systems that serve best in support role may be task organized to achieve the outer cordons task and purpose weapon systems to consider are crewserved weapons javelin with the container launch unit clu and snipers or designated marksman special teams to consider within the outer cordon include detainee security teams interpreterslinguists personnel search teams including female soldiers video teams explosive ordnance disposal eod vehicle search teams fire support team fist considerations use of doctrinal tasks the commander of the cordon and search element must carefully consider the doctrinal task assigned to the securityouter cordon element the choice of task will likely be driven by what the search is oriented on personnel weapons or equipment and the factors of metttc it may also be driven by type and credibility of intelligence regardless the task should support the purpose and the purpose should be nested with that of the main effort if the outer cordon element is to be part of the search then both the doctrinal task interdict for example and special instructions should clearly indicate the commanders intent if they are not to be part of the search and are only to prevent ingressegress of personnel and vehicles block for example then the task should be assigned accordinglycenter for army lessons learned 14 for official use onlydoctrinal tasks require details detailed special instructions must be issued to the outer cordon element for executing searches of personnel and vehicles the assigned task purpose and factors of metttc will drive many of the following considerations who and what is to be searched and to what level of detail under what circumstances are vehicles and personnel searcheddetained under what circumstances are vehicles and personnel turned around and let go and is it different for traffic coming from inside the objective area versus traffic coming from the outside what traffic if any is to be allowed to pass through the outer cordon ºwhat criteria must be met to allow this action ºis it different for incoming and outgoing traffic in addition consider the following whowhat the search is oriented on and the credibility of the intelligence source or sources the time of day the cordon and search is to be executed vehicle and personnel traffic patternsvolume can drastically affect the ability of the outer cordon element to achieve their task and purpose any overall time constraints for the duration of the mission for example if we start at given time and take more than three hours do we risk dealing with peak morning traffic often you must strike balance between the thoroughness of the search capability and limitations of the forces employed and the degree of inconvenience to the local populace emplacement techniques and timing another item to consider is the technique for emplacing the outer cordon the outer cordon can be emplaced either simultaneously or sequentially choosing method deserves careful consideration and there are advantages and disadvantages to both techniques once you have determined what technique to use ensure that your order of march oom facilitates smooth synchronized execution for example if you are going to execute sequential occupation then the far side outer cordon elements should be first in oom so they can pass through the objective and set in simultaneously with the near side outer cordon elements the far side outer cordon elements should be followed by the near side outer cordon elements then the inner cordon element if this is separate element in the for official use only 15cordon and search handbooktask organization followed by the search element c2 node reserve and any combat service support css assets simultaneous occupation facilitates maintaining the element of surprise and with rapid synchronized emplacement of the inner cordon and search elements maximizes the units ability to ensure that targeted individualsmaterials do not escape the unit some of the disadvantages of simultaneous occupation are that it requires additional routes control measuresbattle tracking for example phase lines or check points to ensure that the positions are emplaced simultaneously makes control little more difficult for the commander potentially makes casualty evacuation casevac more difficult and spreads out the units combat power it may also increase the probability of the outer cordon elements coming into contact with

during execution of the mission position selectionforce protection force protection for the outer cordon element must be considered as well the level of force protection for the outer cordon element will largely be determined by the task purpose and factors of metttc the amount of class iv needed for an element given the tactical task of block would likely be much greater than the amount needed for an element tasked to interdict when selecting actual positions for the outer cordon elements you must consider many factors one of the considerations is optimal positioning for providing security

blocking position another method of executing the outer cordon is the blocking position the blocking position does not allow for the passage of personnel or vehicular traffic consider the ramifications of not allowing any traffic through the outer cordon this impact may be minimal when curfew is in effect but could cause riot if attempted when people are attempting to get to work consider that you may not achieve the elements purpose if by failing to search vehicles your element allows the targeted individual to pass the outer cordon once the blocking position is lifted the area will likely be too large to be covered entirely by blocking positions the use of patrols listening posts lpsobservation posts ops and snipers or designated marksmen will help ensure the effectiveness of the outer cordon if the blocking position is employed ensure that all personnel know the routes and positions of these additional elements and that these elements are protected from friendly fire by graphic control measures and the use of terrain andor manmade structures emplacement of crewserved weapons and sectors of fire are crucial to the direct fire plan consider the use of overt or covert employment of snipers they can be used to provide observation of fleeing personnel and precision fires ensure that the snipers have adequate security especially if they are employed in

independent operation rather it is an integral part of larger coordinated operation the cordon and search looked at one way the outer cordon secures the operational area and in doing so fixes the enemy stripping the initiative away from him the outer cordon is the initial barrier to enemy reinforcements and the final barrier across his possible escape the keys to success for the outer cordon are detailed planning rehearsals at all levels and maintaining situational awareness at all times the success of the overall operation and preservation of soldiers lives depends on itcenter for army lessons learned 20 for official use onlychapter 4 inner cordon captain frank baltazar task force 1 jrtc operations group the inner cordon protects the search element from threat activity such as direct fire grenades explosives or civil disturbances and prevents escape from the immediate areas typical tactical tasks include overwatch suppress and secure the inner cordon is the immediate reserve in the event of civil disturbance because the inner cordon is closest to the search element the inner cordon also observes and reports developments in its immediate area of interest the inner cordon is under the command and control c2 of the cordon and search commander the leader of the inner cordon must develop and maintain situational awareness concerning his area of responsibility his assigned sectors of immediate tactical concern to the inner cordon and the search element he must also do the same for his area of interest that extends outward to the exterior or outer cordon task organization doctrinally the inner cordon is not addressed however based on the tactical tasks additional weapon systems that serve best in support role may be task organized to facilitate the inner cordons task and purpose weapon systems to consider are crewserved weapons javelin with the container launch unit clu and snipers or designated marksman consider the following other special teams within the inner cordon snatch team interpreters personnel search team video team tactical human intelligence humint team tht consideration if the cordon and search is focused on one building or requires sequential clearing the entire search element will not be inside building therefore the search element may be able to accomplish some inner cordon responsibilities for example during an initial breach of the targeted building the search element not inside conducting clearing or searching operations may provide some overwatch in support by fire sbf position monitoring the progress of the search in another scenario the uncommitted search elements can provide some protection from civilians on the battlefield cob or civil disturbances in any case the inner cordon must have solid direct fire plan additionally the inner cordon must be prepared to assist with civil disturbances if the search element commits for official use only 21cordon and search handbookthe primary focus for planning should be for combat operation in military operations on urbanized terrain mout which will maintain the units initiative if the situation escalates when planning the emplacement of the inner cordon the primary planning focus should be on location where it supports the movement of the search element and isolates the target building alternate andor successive sbf positions must be planned in the event the search element shifts focus to alternate buildings leaders must determine the appropriate number of troops versus vehicles in the inner cordon things to consider are listed below population and probability of civil disturbances searching mosque versus house searching mosque raises the probability of civil disturbances vehicles provide firepower and mobility but they cannot talk to people or pacify crowds vehicles require open roads to turn around and maneuver cordon and search commanders must determine the battle handover line between the search element and inner cordon as part of their direct fire plan this will help determine when the inner cordon can engage when contact is made methods figure 1 method for the inner cordon requires security teams on each corner of the targeted building as displayed in figure 1 above the advantages of this method are that it prevents immediate infiltration or exfiltration of personnel and prevents cob from disrupting clearing or searching operations inside the targeted building the disadvantages of this method are that it does not facilitate direct fire plan and poses potential fratricide issues if the situation escalates depending on mission enemy terrain and weather troops and support available time available and civil considerationscenter for army lessons learned 22 for official use only5 64 3 17 8 2metttc this method will not facilitate battle drill 6 if required it minimizes the inner cordons sectors of fire or area of responsibility aor it also limits the inner cordons ability to maintain situational awareness over its area of interest ai another method for the inner cordon is to establish sbf positions to isolate the targeted building as an additional task the inner cordon must be prepared to react to civil disturbances the advantages of this method are it facilitates direct fire plan and forces are prepared if the situation escalates it provides the inner cordon wider view of its aor and its ai the immediate disadvantage is that it may impede the inner cordons reaction time to civil disturbances however as discussed earlier the search element may be able to provide some control of civil disturbances until either the inner cordon or reserve elements are able to execute the task figure 2 looking both ways units may find themselves conducting combination of the methods shown above depending on the situation for example the first method may be used by the uncommitted search elements while the actual inner cordon executes the second method in any case the inner cordon must look both ways to maintain situational awareness the inner cordon with the search element especially in the first method shown above minimizes situational awareness to central location with the inner cordon in an sbf role the threat area covered is broadened along with its ability to maintain situational awareness but in either case the inner cordon must look both ways that is maintain situational awareness on activities and actions inside the search area as well as activities and actions exterior to the inner cordon observationstrendstrends reversal units fail to provide local security and as

tactical tasks include clear seize secure or destroy task organization there are two scenarios that may require cordon and search one focuses on an area and the other on village if the cordon and search involves an area then it takes on the task organization of movement to contact or attack the task organization would include support assault and breach or reserve for example during tactical movement if convoy makes contact with an improvised explosive device ied after the cordon is emplaced search team may receive task to clear the surrounding area to destroy or seize enemy personnel the task organization of search element is similar in military operations in urbanized terrain mout or village situations in platoon attack of building the typical task organization is support breach and assault in order to maintain the initiative the search element should use the same task organization in the event the situation escalates fm 30611 combined arms operations in urban terrain provides

for official use onlycentral location if inhabitants appear hostile assemble them in central location this method provides the most control simplifies thorough search denies the belligerents an opportunity to conceal evidence and allows for detailed interrogation it has the disadvantage of taking the inhabitants away from their dwellings thus encouraging looting and possibly engendering further ill feelings home restriction restrict the inhabitants to their homes this prohibits movement of civilians allows them to stay in their dwellings and discourages looting the disadvantages of this method are that it makes control and interrogation difficult and gives inhabitants time to conceal evidence in their homes control heads of households the head of each household is told to remain in the front of the house while everyone else in the house is brought to central location during the search the head of the household can see that the search team will steal nothing often this is the best method for controlling the populace during search this head of the household can be used to open doors and containers to facilitate the search clearsearch the building the search element determines the method of clearing simultaneous or systematic based on the factors of metttc systematic clearing facilitates controlling the head of the household using this method allows the head of the household to see that the clearing team steals nothing and heshe can open doors and closets to facilitate the search prior to executing the search the building must be cleared and secured the

where possible detainees should not be allowed to talk to one another until they are screened in circumstances where suspicious activity is detected video taping the area and the personnel involved can be crucial all central holding areas should be videotaped for later exploitation likewise videotaping knock approach entry documents the operation for similar exploitation units should develop

task force 1 jrtc operations group every leader is taught from the earliest possible moment to maintain reserve appropriate to his mission and unit strength cordon and search operation is different however as is the case with all military missions certain trends have emerged regarding formation mission and execution of the reserve in cordon and search operations trends the three main problem areas for most reserves begin with mission planning first units fail to clearly identify priority of tasks for the reserve accordingly the reserve fails to rehearse the correct tasks second the reserve element fails to coordinate with the main effort and other units during mission planning as result the reserve has poor situational awareness during the entire operation third the commander does not give the reserve clear commitment criteria the reserve therefore cannot anticipate its commitment to the operation and is slow to react mission of the reserve the purpose of the reserve is to be prepared to reinforce andor accomplish the task and purpose of the units main effort in addition the commander may task the reserve to accomplish both the specified and implied tasks he sets during the planning execution and consolidationreorganization of the mission that means that the reserve leader must be intimately familiar with all aspects of the mission from its inception through its completion command of the reserve the reserve is under the command and control c2 of the cordon and search commander the reserve leader must coordinate with the commander to determine the mission essential tasks to be planned and rehearsed he must then coordinate with the main effort leader to understand the concept of the operation and identify tentative event or time to commit the reserve neither the reserve leader nor the main effort leader can commit the reserve everyone in the unit must understand that only the commander can commit the reserve task organization doctrinally company is the reserve for brigade platoon is the reserve for battalion and squad is the reserve for company however based on the units task and purpose commanders may determine through mission for official use only 31cordon and search handbookanalysis that larger or smaller reserve is required the combat power of the reserve must be in accordance with their task organization and the reserve must have all major equipment and personnel to accomplish the task or tasks assigned by the commander the reserve element is attached to the headquarters element during the operation and upon commitment from the commander will be under tactical control of the receiving unit normally the main effort it is important for the reserve leader to understand whom he will report to when that time will be and where he needs to maneuver his force other considerations the reserve must be positioned to weight the main effort to properly exploit success reinforce or maintain momentum facilitate destruction of enemy counterattacks andor provide local security for cordon and search mission the preceding list of tasks indicates the position of the reserve is paramount to the success of the unit the commander must identify through mission analysis and on the ground situational awareness where the reserve needs to be located and when to maneuver the element to different position the commander must identify the tasks the reserve may be committed to execute these tasks must be prioritized and given to the reserve leader so he can plan and rehearse these actions in accordance with the commanders plan probable tasks assigned to the reserve during cordon and search mission include but are not limited to the following reinforce inner cordon clear buildings search buildings secure safeguard and escort civilians or detainees block enemy escape routes imperative to the entire reserve integration is the commitment criteria the commander uses to identify when the reserve is needed commitment criteria are developed by the commander during mission analysis and disseminated to subordinate leaders subordinate leaders and more importantly the reserve leader then battle track the operation and anticipate committing the reserves to the operation all commitment criteria need not be met for the reserve to be committed but there must be plan on when to commit the reserve to the fight possible commitment criteria are as follows hostile crowd forming around inner cordon loss of main effort squad numerous rooms in building being searchedcenter for army lessons learned 32 for official use onlymore than five detainees enemy engages inner cordon conclusions formation and use of reserve force is standard fare in military operations and like all other military missions the overall cordon and search commander must set up his reserve leader for success through careful mission analysis and planning the wise commander selects capable reserve leader the ultimate success of the entire

better to keep the aircraft moving and make it harder target to hit consider conducting running fire engagements from an initial point ip engaging the target and returning to safe area to regroup for another attack the lead wingman concept where the wingman can suppress the target after the lead mans engagement and cover his break is excellent for this type of attack during running fire engagement aircrews must prevent overflight of friendly units coordination is required with ground units to suppress the enemys fire to protect the aircraft during their attack the 30mm on the ah64 50 cal on the oh58d and the 275inch rockets fired by both aircraft are ideal for this attack precisionguided weapons such as the hellfire missile can be used in congested urban terrain however their capabilities are limited aircrews can expect shortrange hellfire engagements and may have to reposition many times and seek out the best angle for attack hovering fire allows aircrews to unmask both laterally and

particularly vertical structures the air defense threat escalates within the urban area cca is procedure that is very similar to running or diving fire and ensures aviation fires destroy the enemy with minimal risk to friendly forces the cca technique allows aviation attack teams of two or three oh58ds or ah64s to engage targets with greater degree of accuracy and protection than they could with hover fire cca requires ground and aviation leaders to positively identify the target and coordinate the attack timing and direction the aircrews fly at napoftheearth noe altitudes at airspeeds of 80100 knots approximately 3001000 meters out from the target the aircrews execute cyclic climb to an altitude of 100300 feet at the specified altitude threatterrain dependent the aircraft is nosed over and the aircrews immediately engage the target with 275inch rockets or machine guns after employing their weapon systems the aircrews break left break right or fly straight ahead ºbreaking left or right exposes the larger side profile of the airframe to enemy fire ºflying straight ahead exposes the crew and aircraft to the effects of the ordnance they just fired or they may overfly previously undetected enemy forces ºdepending on the tactical situation it is best for the aircraft to break hard to one side and return to noe flight immediately the fires from the second helicopter

terrain features and smoke rounds from artillery or mortars already impacting on the target area illumination or tracer rounds or other ground fires to provide reference mark on the target the attack team leader then informs the infantry unit leader of the bp abf position or the series of positions his team will occupy that provides the best observation and fields of fire into the engagement or target area the bp or abf position is position from which the attack aircraft will engage the enemy with direct fire the bp or abf position is normally offset from the flank of the friendly ground position to ensure that rotor wash ammunition casing expenditure and the general signature of the aircraft does not interfere with operations on the ground the attack team leader then provides the infantry unit leader with his concept for the teams attack on the objective only on completion of coordination with the lowest unit in contact does the flight depart the holding area for the bp as the

urban combat aircrews require positive identification of the target and friendly positions prior to releasing ordnance the methods to mark friendly and enemy positions are limited only by the creativity of the ground forces and aircrews methods and techniques employed must be adapted to the conditions prevalent at the time some proven techniques for signaling or marking friendly positions include ºspray paint or bed sheets hung out of windows ºtraditional but simple signaling devices such as flares strobes and signaling mirrors ºuse of glint tape combat identification panels cips and infrared beacons some proven techniques for target marking or orientation on enemy positions include the use of smoke grenades laser pointers tracers or smoke from indirect fires fixedwing gun ships and rotarywing aircraft should expect detailed continuing directions including reference points to the target in addition to standard range and bearing aircrews and terminal guidance controllers must become familiar with the roof outline of buildings flat roofs pitched roofs domed roofs and roofs with towers or air conditioning units on top will aid in acquisition visually and thermally k aircrew urban threat considerations every building and structure in an urban area is potential enemy position the presence of snipers increases the vulnerability to ambush the difficulty in distinguishing combatants from noncombatants places participants under additional psychological stress the defending force normally has the advantage of familiarity with the terraincordon and search handbook for official use only 49center for army lessons learned 50 for official use onlyaircraft are more vulnerable to lowtech weapons in urban combat urban terrain provides excellent cover and concealment for variety of weapon systems coupled with the restrictions on airspace available for maneuver this makes these weapons more significant threat to aircraft than they normally are in open terrain some of these weapons include ºtank main gun modern fire control systems permit effective aircraft engagement by tanks with their main gun the development of effective antihelicopter ammunition such as the usfielded multipurpose antitank mpat round includes an airground fuse ºantitank guided munitions atgm most atgm have an effective range of between 3000 and 5000 meters and can engage helicopters in the same way they engage ground targets atgm are threat to rotarywing aircraft in an urban environment due to the restriction and compression of airspace and proximity to potential threat positions ºantiarmor rockets antiarmor rockets such as the light antitank weapon law at4 and rocketpropelled grenade rpg are readily available inexpensive and normally standard equipment at the small unit level even in irregular forces they are unguided have effective ranges of less than 500 meters and are real threat to rotarywing aircraft ºmedium cannons many armored personnel carriers atc and infantry fighting vehicles itv carry rapidfire cannons ranging from 20mm through 40mm that are effective against rotarywing aircraft ºsmall arms and machine guns small arms and machine guns can also become more significant threat in an urban environment generally 556mm and 762x39mm rifles are effective out to 500 meters 762mm machine guns and sniper rifles of similar caliber are effective to 1000 meters and 50cal127mm machine guns and sniper rifles are effective to 2000 meters another consideration is that these weapons can be placed on the upper floors of buildings above the helicopters to fire down on the helicopters since these are small light weapons they can be easily moved to unexpected positions easily l reconnaissance operations southwest asias varying terrain poses several challenges for aircrews conducting reconnaissance missions there are wide variety of small villagestowns and named areas of interest nai in flat areas as well asnestled on hill or arrayed on both sides of valley these areas make clear field of view fov for observation very difficult and sometimes unavailable without having an aircraft fly right up to or over the reconnaissance objective recommended employment technique for oh58d aircraft urban area with mountainous terrain in order to gain the valuable observation of the target area or to confirm or deny activity in the urban area it may be necessary to utilize the following ºthe aviation mission planning station amps of falcon view use amps to check the line of sight from vantage point close enough to the reconnaissance objective without compromising security for the aerial weapons team aet ºoverlapping fos overlap the fov of the aets from different angles to the target by choosing series of observation posts ops surrounding the objective area the aet will be able to cover two of the cardinal directions while still providing security to the other aircraft if needed keep movement between the lead and wing aircraft to provide total observation and gain situational awareness it may become necessary to place the lead aircraft at vantage point higher than the target to see the topside and the wing aircraft at the bottom side of the target in order to gain observation of the entire target ºobstacle fov conducting the technical map reconnaissance in conjunction with the amps is proven method to gain observation from the planning phase the only caution to gaining the best vantage point to the objective is taking into account the vegetation and manmade structures that become hindrance to there are times the best fov is accomplished by checking the riseovertherun and keeping the aet high enough to maintain the observation at times it may be prudent to be deceptive and maintain constant flight path past the objective area with the attitude to the aircraft flying abeam the target employing the azimuth of the mastmounted sight mms on the target this technique works well in restrictive terrain locations spurs and in valleys where the only observation may be right over the target because the fov is obstructed by natural or manmade obstacles ºkeep constant movement between the aets this allows the team to gain situational awareness of the entire reconnaissance area the natural response of people is to look up to the high ground when they hear the audible sound of an aircraft employing one aircraft on the high ground and drawing the attention of the villagers provides the lower aircraft the opportunity to gain observation andcordon and search handbook for official use only 51movement in and around the objective without drawing attention to itself and still be in position to support when required employ the flyby reconnaissance in locations where ops do not provide the best observation 2 recommended employment technique for oh58d urban area with flat terrain to gain the observation of the target area in this type of environment it may be necessary to employ the following ºmaintain constant orbit around the objective this technique provides the aet 360degree observation and affords on different axis of view in and out of the reconnaissance area the distance between the lead and wing aircraft may vary depending upon the size of the area but as the lead aircraft is conducting turn looking down road alley or linear area the wing aircraft can supportbackup the fov from the reverse side it becomes critical to employ the onboard systems and mms to augment the visual cues the aircrew employs to acquire targets this technique assists in reducing the dead spaceunobserved areas the lead aircraft may not be able to view after passing location on the ground it is still the wing aircrafts responsibility to follow and support with suppressive fires or observation at distance to the lead aircraft with enough reaction time to influence situation ºalternating right or left orbit around the objective when the standoff distance is greater than 1500 meters or so conduct left orbit around the reconnaissance area the copilot observer employs the mms to search the area in different fos and provides reconnaissance information on the objective area with the use of the onboard systems at standoff distance when the reconnaissance requires the aet to move in closer in order to gain more detailed picture or support ground element change the rotation around the target to right orbit this technique allows the aviator in the right seat to have observation on targets at closer range to employ suppressive fires quickly and to guide ground elements onto target cross talk between the aircrew is important to delineate between what targets are primary and alternate but the employment of suppressive fires and direct movement for the ground forces at this point becomes largely the responsibility of the right seater ºconduct observation at higher vantage point and slower airspeeds recognizing the obstacles of an urban flat area and the builtup features that obstruct an fov the aet has to adapt to the obstructions and gain observation by flying at higher altitude above the ground and operate at slower airspeeds employing these two techniques allows the aet to view the ground floor of buildingscenter for army lessons learned 52 for official use onlyroads or open areas that would be obstructed by some other natural or manmade obstacle small row of roadside trees or two or threestory building is an obstruction when attempting to gain observation on location where activity may occur by increasing the flight path above ground level agl the aet now has an advantage over unobserved locations increasing the agl observation coupled with reducing the airspeed only increases the amount of time the aet can maintain observation of target m employment of lasers airtoground laser use the kiowa warrior community uses an aim1 infrared ir marking system normally mounted on the 50 cal machine gun to provide direct red beam onto target when viewed under nightvision device nvd the aim1 laser has been removed from the 50 cal and placed inside the cockpit for the copilot to use as marking tool the copilot has the aim1 on lanyard and employs it to identify target during an airtoground walk on of target the aim1 is also used to 1 identify target handover tho 2 illuminate location on the ground for relief on station ros 3 mark lzpz for utility helicopters and 4 mark targets for ground forces this employment technique has paid big dividends in guiding wing aircraft or ground element onto target and marking with the laser beam reduces the error of identifying targets in congested areas when working with ground forces it becomes important to mark ground targets little higher than ground level in order to have the visible for the ground element what the aet observes from the air at higher elevation may not be visible to the ground force because other obstacles obstruct the groundlevel view groundtoground laser use most ground units employ pac4 laser marking system attached to their personal weapons or commanders pointer these lasers are the same style as the aim1 in that they are used to mark targets when using nvds the ground element can direct movement on to location for target identification or target acquisition to the aircrews flying in support of the ground plan recommended techniques for use of laser place the hit spot of the aim1 higher on target ie third story of house top of building to allow the ground force to view the target from the ground level this will allow them to maneuver into position on reference point and to acquire or to search an identified objective when city lights are intense the use of the aim1 is also better identified towards the top of building when viewed from the ground level key point for the walk on phase of employing the aim1 laser is to move the beam in zigzag or circular pattern for easier identification by the ground force this is useful to show ground path from the ground unit to the target bycordon and search handbook for official use only 53moving the laser hit spot just in front of the ground element as they continue to move use positive verbiage or terms to identify movement to the ground element even when laser spot is seen on target all references need to be in cardinal directions for ease of guidance when giving clock direction or variant to clock direction for guiding techniques to the ground forces it is imperative to call all movements off the ground element and not the attitude of the aircraft this is very important when calling directions in an urban environment and can be employed by calling direction and certain number of housesbuildings from the ground elements position to target location4 n video reconnaissance video reconnaissance is an

operations at the jrtc are the issue of rules of engagement roe and how they influence the scenario in exercising the units mission essential task list metl typically such operations focus on precision clearing operations and high intensity urban operations conducting precision clearing operations often generates great debate among commanders about the risks precision clearing operations present1 are such operations stacked against the attacker are they realistic are we really going to conduct precision clearing operations the answer to all three questions is yes mitigating the risks involved in such operations calls for better understanding of how they fit in the context of urban operations and mastery of the tactics techniques and procedures ttp involved precision clearing techniques do not replace other techniques currently being used to clear buildings and rooms during highintensity combat specifically they do not replace the clearing technique in which fragmentation or concussion grenade is thrown into room before the us forces enter precision room clearing techniques are used when the tactical situation calls for roombyroom clearing of relatively intact building in which enemy combatants and noncombatants may be intermixed this technique involves the increased risk of clearing building methodically rather than using overwhelming firepower to eliminate or neutralize all its inhabitants reference fm 30611 combined arms operations in urban terrainhigh intensity urban operations in surprising and threatening move the federal forces relied heavily on fuelair explosives and tactical missiles scud and scarab these systems suppressed the chechens both physically and psychologically and these assets were used to attack fighters hiding in basements such fire strikes were designed for maximum psychological pressureto demonstrate the hopelessness of further resistance against foe that could strike with impunity and that was invulnerable to countermeasures the tos1 heavy flame system multiple rocket launcher mounted on t72 tank chassis played particularly prominent role as terror weapon2 equally noteworthy was the battalions effective use of firepower which was in keeping with daniels slogan knock em all down his principle was to keep up continuous stream of fire from every available weapon ranging from rifle to medium artillery the division and corps artillery had remained south of aachen when the assault forces moved to their jumpoff points east of the city misleading the enemy as to the americans intended axis of advance and permitting the artillery to shoot parallel to the front of the assault troops this eliminated the danger of short rounds falling on friendly troops and allowed the infantry units to call down fire very close to their own positions by shelling german lines of communication daniel isolated objectives he also used artillery to drive defenders out of the upper floors of specific buildings direct fire from tanks tank destroyers antitank guns and machine guns also chased the enemy away from his firing positions machine guns commanded the streets along the axis of advance ready to cut down any evacuating germans daniels infantry stayed out of the streets whenever possible preferring to move from building to building by blowing holes in walls ideally by the time the infantry closed in on given strongpoint the germans would have been driven down into the cellars grenades and if necessary flamethrowers and demolition charges finished the job3 these two historical examples from grozny 2000 and aachen 1944 highlight high intensity operations conceptually standard highintensity room clearing drills mirror deliberate attack the task is to seize control of the room and the purpose is to neutralize the enemy in the room as in deliberate attack against any objective the assaulting elements move into position using covered and concealed routes the fragmentation and or concussion grenades are the preparatory fires used before the assault preparatory firesfragmentation and or concussion grenadesare initiated when soldiers are as close to the objective as they can get without being injured by the fires the assault element follows the preparatory fires onto the objective as closely as possible rapid violent assault overwhelms and destroys the enemy force to seize the

address another aspect of the end state desired by the white house stable democratic and friendly government in panama capable of exercising effective leadership as quickly as possible after the old regime had been swept away to help ensure that outcome us combat operations had to minimize the damage they inflicted planners considered the vast majority of panamanians themselves to be friendly or neutral toward the united states every effort had to be made not to put these people or their homes and belongings at risk unnecessarily nor could panamas political economic and social infrastructure be destroyed or even severely damaged if blue spoon hoped to achieve its strategic objectives4 as for the attacker one option is to assault the city directly from the march in medieval and early modern times however attacking armies did not typically have sufficient mobility to achieve the surprise necessary to make such tactic reasonable most often the attacker chose to conduct siege an option that allowed him to take his time make extensive preparations and culminate his operations with decisive assault on the city5 one might argue that precision clearing urban operations is an oxymoron that precision and urban battles are diametrically opposed but they are not if war is political power applied by military means then precision clearing urban operations are an effort to make sure the political goals are not destroyed by military means that is not new strategy the siege as an alternative to full assault allowed more precise threat of force to avoid full fledge attack if the defenders saw defeat as an inevitable consequence surrender became the preferred option that is if they knew the attacking force would not brutalize or even exterminate the citys population

an aqueduct in 1597 the spanish captured the city of amiens in northern france using ruse small group of spaniards disguised as peasants approached the city gateway at which point they pretended that their cart had broken wheel in the confusion that followed they rushed and captured the gate these techniques entailed risktaking and required boldness imagination and unique circumstances to be successful7 surgical urban operations are usually the domain of special operations forces sof the soviet seizure of kabul and us sof operations in panama and somalia used sof in conjunction with conventional forces they include missions such as raids recovery operations rescues and other special operations for example noncombatant recovery surgical urban operations are also not new phenomenon as illustrated by the actions of the austrians or the spanish referenced above room clearing using the strong wall technique there is common link between the categories of urban operations regardless of intensity roe or specific target soldiers will have to clear buildings room by room to neutralize possible threats the degree of force used in doing so will vary according to the operation in fullscale urban assault room clearing is still necessary as not all buildings will be blown down indeed much of the fighting will occur inside the buildings rather than in the streets room clearing in high intensity urban operations calls for use of preemptive fires the grenade through the window or door in precision clearing operations room clearing without preparatory fires is fundamental surgical operations rely on room clearing techniques that borrow from both along with highly developed shooting and very specific intelligence again all three categories of urban operations require soldiers to enter and clear buildingscenter for army lessons learned 62 for official use onlyprecision room clearing is rapidly and methodically seizing control of room or multiple rooms and all of its inhabitants both hostile and other by eliminating the threat dominating the room and controlling the situation the sequence for clearing room is actions at the breach or point of entry actions upon entry and fundamentals of room combat actions at the point of entry movement to the objective the movement technique used for approaching target building is dictated by several factors among these are the mission cover and concealment lighting conditions type of breach to be used and terrain b move close to but do not touch the building exterior staying close to the building makes soldiers harder to see from inside the building conversely the soldiers should avoid contact with the building especially banging against the walls with weapon or other piece of equipment c do not flag teammates train soldiers to maintain muzzle awareness at all times soldier should never stack with his weapons muzzle pointing at another soldier this is why weapons must be carried at low or high carry d use the path of least resistance the assault team should whenever possible line up on the side of the door that provides the path of least resistance upon entering the swinging door is an obstacle that can best be avoided by lining up on the correct side if the door opens inward the team should line up on the hinge side if the door opens outward the team should line up on the doorknob side lining up on the correct side will result in the fastest and smoothest entry possible see figures 1 and 2 for official use only 63cordon and search handbookfigure 1 the rule of thumb is that if

is ready if stealthy approach to the objective building is possible the thumbs backsqueeze up technique works well the 1 man assumes his position on the breach point first his eyes and weapon are oriented on the breach point when he feels comfortable with his position he will signal the 2 man by nodding his head the 2 man will acknowledge receipt by squeezing the 1 mans shoulder after he has received and acknowledged the nod of the 1 man the 2 man will pass the thumbs up signal back to the 3 man the 3 man will acknowledge by squeezing the 2 mans thumb and will then pass thumbs up back to the man behind him this will continue until the thumbs up signal has been passed back to the last man on the initial entry team the last man will then squeeze forward and each subsequent man will send the signal forward so that all in the team are aware that all others are prepared to enter example of countdown for execution 5 the assault starts on 5 4 action 3 action 2 snipers fire if you have snipers or designated marksman in an overwatch position with the threat elements in their sights 1 breach executed execute assault if soldiers are using tactical lights during their assault they remove the light covers prior to approaching the building if stealthy approach is impossible the team modifies the thumb backsqueeze up technique to increase speed of entry by reducing time at the entry point after movement to the objectivebuilding the 2 man maintains control of the 1 man just long enough to make sure the initial entry team is ready to enter and clear the first room this action must be rapid but remain controlled or the resulting confusion can be fatal actions upon entry the actions soldiers will execute upon entering room are clear the point of entry or breach point the first action to be taken by the soldier upon entry into room is to clear the fatal funnelthat area which surrounds the door for official use only 65cordon and search handbookthreshold this is the focal point of attention for anyone in the room by moving quickly the assault team members reduce the risk of being hit by hostile fire directed at the doorway figure 3 b engage immediate threat the next step is to engage any immediate threat encountered the following criteria defines an immediate threat ºany threat that blocks the movement of the soldier to his point of domination ºany hostile target that is too close to be ignored is an immediate threat although this factor is vague the decision of what is too close is in the final analysis the decision of the individual soldier general guideline of what is too close is whatever is within arms reach soldier must never turn completely around to engage target once he has passed target he must move on and not change his mind the engagement of perceived immediate threat cannot slow down the soldiers movement identify the threat by looking at the hands for threatening actions if the soldier has to slow down to aim the target is not an immediate threat slowing down would also endanger the team as whole by blocking them in the doorway and violating the principle of speed and the fundamental to dominate the roomcenter for army lessons learned 66 for official use onlystrong wall technique the fatal funnelc move to point of domination corners are the points of domination in any room the next action the assault team takes is to clear those corners and occupy them as points of domination the 1 man and the number 2 man are initially responsible for the corners if the 1 man and the 2 man are unable to clear the corners the 3 man and the 4 man must assume this critical responsibility each soldier has primary and secondary sector of fire see figures above note if one of the soldiers has weapon malfunction that soldier should sound off with weapon down take knee and work through his malfunction the other soldiers will scan his sector of fire this works because all sectors of fire are interlocking therefore providing redundant firepower to avoid fratricide the soldier should not stand up until one of his fellow soldiers moves to him and taps him on the shoulder d clear sector of fire every man has primary and secondary sector of fire route to his point of domination upon reaching the point of domination each soldier scans his sectors of fire from the point of domination each soldier will have primary and

each man to always execute the same action remember keep it simple g control the situation the actions of the assault team control the situation by dominating the room and eliminating any threat the assault team seizes control of the room and the initiative from the enemy inaction or slow execution gives the initiative back to any hostile element in the room live noncombatants or friendly personnel not engaged must also be controlled the control measures used can be both verbal and physical the team leader or designated team member must immediately begin speaking to any people in the room in loud commanding voice he must take charge verbal control may be difficult because of the loss of hearing resulting from explosives and firearms use verbiage should be short and to the point and it should be loud enough to be heard by those whose hearing may have been damaged by the sound of gunfire and explosives physical control must be firm but not overly harsh pain elicits response needlessly inflicting pain on friendly personnel may cause them to react in an unexpected manner such as fighting back this means possibly losing control rather than gaining it h search the dead searching the dead has only one function to ensure they longer pose threat with security move all weapons away from the dead and conduct an eye thump on each body to ensure they are truly dead i search the room there are two techniques cursory or detailed 1 cursory room search avoid opening drawers and moving items and unnecessary disruption of the room when you search it should be quick systematic and according to unit standing operating procedures sop 2 detailed room search these may be done based on the mission and time available on the objective j search the living searching the living should be cursory it can be standing modified search kneeling search or prone handcuffing search the situation will dictate the method of searching the living k ammunition casualty and equipment acesize activity location unit time and equipment salute reports for official use only 91cordon and search handbooksalute reports should be according to unit sop leaders must have friendly unit situational awareness the acesalute reports should consist of the status of the assigned sector secured or unsecured the status of the assaulters in the sector wounded dead the number and status of friendly noncombatants encountered the number and status of personnel of unknown disposition and the number and status of combatants encountered sending in the count allows commanders to reinforce subordinate leaders and to determine when the overall objective is completely secured it also allows the commander to set priorities for evacuation note consider doing this through hand and arm signals if soldiers start communicating their status it is very possible that the enemy in the room next door will gain information on your status l evacuate on command the last action is to evacuate the objective area on command the overall commander of the objective will make the determination as to when the assault teams are ready to evacuate from the objective if personnel or equipment recovery was the purpose of the clearing operation the personnel or equipment should be immediately evacuated from the target area and extracted with the assault team priorities for evacuation may be set in the operation order opord or based on the current situation if friendly personneladjacent units are outside the objective area they must be notified prior to the assault teams exiting the objective area to avoid fratricide once the assault teams leave the objective area they should return to normal patrolling procedures in case of counterattack by an enemy reaction force or any surviving enemy in the target area conclusion room clearing has always been fundamental to urban operations be they high intensity assaults as encountered in grozny 2000 or aachen 1944 precision clearing operations as in panama the success of medieval siege or the surgical operations conducted by the soviets in kabul or the austrians infiltrating an italian city in 1702 still it can be argued that the basic techniques in room clearing have become more central to basic soldier skills than they were in recent decades the expansion of urban areas the imbalance between opposing military forces or the strategic importance of an urban center means that one or both sides may choose to fight inside city coe recognizes this trend both attacker and defender will use roomclearing techniques in such struggle it should be apparent that casual familiarity with precision room clearing techniques is formula for disaster untrained or unrehearsed soldiers trying to breach defended building are as likely to kill each other as they are the enemy meanwhile skilled defender will devastate the amateur urban attackercenter for army lessons learned 92 for official use only1 thomas p odom metl mres

operations capture in many ways the many factors inherent in dealing with the complexity of the contemporary operational environment coe see chapter 1 cordon and search operations are also standard task in stability operations and support operations soso when one thinks of soso cordon and search operations come to mind but are cordon and search operations the decisive fight in soso or more task used to achieve the operational and strategic goals set forth by the campaign plan this article will examine the latter description with focus on hierarchy that places information operations io above the priorities inherent in cordon and search mission using this approach to cordon and search operations forces the tactical commander to consider io in all phases of such mission beginning with mission analysis and continuing all the way through execution and reorganization from the point that commander receives cordon and search operation from his superior that commander should examine how such an operation fits into his superiors io plan in an ideal world the superior should make his intent clear in less than ideal world the commander getting the mission may have to seek clarification taking the next highers intent into consideration battalion commander given the mission to conduct cordon and search mission in village or sector of city would first determine the goal of the search if it is arms what has the overall io message been with regard to arms have the locals been directed to surrender all arms have they been offered rewards if they chose to do so what are the consequences if they are found to be stockpiling arms or worse supplying arms to local insurgents the answers to these types of questions should drive parts of the mission analysis for cordon and search looking for weapons similar questions on possible insurgents local sympathizers and related io messages would drive mission analysis on cordon and search looking for suspected insurgents as standard portions of cordon and search operation are planned similar io considerations such as nonlethal effects should factor into that planning take for instance the inner and outer cordons in an area with an ongoing io attempting to calm an area and make the inhabitants more willing to cooperate the commander must relate the current success of that io with what he plans to do in establishing his inner and outer cordons an openly hostile area is clear challenge to both io goals and the success of cordon and search in such cases io planning must be integrated and synchronized with the cordon and search one way would be to embed tactical psychological teams tpt with the inner and outer cordons to explain the intent of the operation and perhaps lessen the level of hostility another consideration is the io aspects of special teams indigenous forces and local political legal or religious leaders there are special io related teams suggested as parts of each of the major components of cordon and for official use only 95cordon and search handbooksearch mission enemy terrain and weather troops and support available time available and civil considerations metttc may suggest those teams are useful or indicate they are not but part of the metttc evaluation of their usefulness and potential missions should include io aspects local civil defense army or other forces may play role in cordon and search since these forces will undoubtedly speak to the locals in the process of screening prisoners or other tasks the cordon and search commander should consider what io themes they might address similar thinking applies to using local leaders if an io has succeeded in establishing relationship with local mayor police chief or cleric commander planning cordon and search in their area should use those contacts as part of his io planning as noted above there are several situations where io should be embedded in the planning for cordon and search the io battle drill for cordon and search operations in appendix f is taken from the effects based operations handbook the central point of the battle drill is that io is often the decisive operation in soso cordon and search operation should support the overall effects sought in mounting that io and that means that io planning in cordon and search cannot be an afterthought the maneuver commander given such mission cannot simply wish it away by saying the civil affairs ca guys will come in behind us to fix things when we are donecenter for army lessons learned 96 for official use onlychapter 10 medical integration in information operations captain adrian gamez senior medical jrtc operations group medical operators must be integrated in the information operations io campaign and assist the io planners in developing medical plan designed to maintain the operational and tactical intent of the commander although medical is often an afterthought in stability operations and support operations soso what follows is technique commanders can use to modify behavior and win the hearts and minds of the people medical operations and nonlethal effects health service support in soso can be defined as those actions encompassing all military healthrelated activities or programs established to further us national goals objectives and missions health service support assists the development and refinement of hostnation hn medical infrastructure provides and maintains the basic necessities of life for the general population through hn civilian medical programs and provides assistance in establishing repairing or improving basic health and sanitation services sewers water energy academics transportation medical and security sweatms in soso the medical planner must be aware of other support agencies us governmental agencies allies coalition partners host nation hn nongovernmental organizations ngos private volunteer organizations pvos and religious groups may also operate in the area of operation the planner must be able to coordinate with these organizations when necessary the medical planner will have humanitarian affairs money provided to the brigade surgeons cell this money must be tracked vigorously to ensure that fraud waste andor abuse do not occur the table of organization toe dollars cannot be spent on humanitarian assistance operations it is illegal and violation of title x list of medical supplies is provided to task forces tfs to requisition specifically for medical operations do not deviate from the medical list provided these supplies will include sickcall type medications and some trauma supplies however the medical supplies are limited to prevent longterm medical dependence on us forces often this is hard pill to swallow for our medical providers ttp for medical in information operations as an active member of the io staff the medical planner advises the senior io planner on how to best use medical assets in support of soso medical planners produce operations orders based on s3 guidance s2 intelligence reports and civil affairs and psychological operations input in order to achieve the commanders io initiatives political economic psychological and military medical planners should request input for placement of medical assets from other supporting agencies medical planners should give clear guidance including specific tasks purpose and end state additionally any command messages that have to be distributed to the local population must be included in the operations order upon completion of for official use only 97cordon and search handbookmedical mission an afteraction review aar must be submitted back to the chief of the informationoperations cell the s2 will interpret the information provided the civil affairs cell will determine the additional needs of the local populace the psychological operations cell will determine if behavior is being modified and the medical unit will stay apprised of the activities of other medical units in the area of operations ao the majority of the medical missions are medical civil actions programs medcaps note medical planners not tactical planners plan medical missions example tactical operator planned medcap for subordinate medical element to assess town because the term assess was used the tasked medical unit sent preventive medicine team to assess the town however the civil affairs team wanted treatment team to assist the local population the confusion caused friction between the local national population and us forces medcaps in cordon and search operations medcaps can be used as part of decisive operations in support of io operations for example as task force tf plans cordon and search of town in order to look for suspected personnel the io cell must plan crisis management and talking points to explain to the local national population the reason for the cordon and search operation should the tactical commander elect to use medcap in support of the decisive operation heshe must articulate to the medical planner how long the medcap is scheduled to last the talking points who the local key leaders are and who will escort and provide security the medcap personnel must rehearse action on the objective the medcap operation itself and understand all command messages if medcap operation is embedded in the decisive operation it must be synchronized in key event synchronization matrix to determine when medical personnel will be called forward tactical commanders and medical planners do not let the medcap operation begin without security although the local population may understand the need for the cordon and search those innocently caught up in the operation may be upset or possibly hostile this hostility could prove lethal the medcap is sign of good faith not an apology for the operation that occurred medcaps and civil affairs we conduct health civil actions programs hchumanitarian assistance missions to improve our relationships with other nations by winning their hearts and minds the department of defense dod conducts these missions to improve the security interests of both the us and the country in which activities are to be carried out and to improve the specific operation readiness of the members of the armed forces who participate in the activities there are several types of health civil actions programs medical civil action programs medcaps are short duration primary medical care missions that provide treatment for acutecenter for army lessons learned 98 for official use onlyminor illnesses equivalent to army sick call for local nationals ln dental civil action programs dencaps are missions that provide emergency and preventive dental care and preventive oral hygiene instruction to underserved local nationals dental procedures such as extractions and sedative fillings may be done if it is determined that the patients overall health and wellbeing would be improved even though followup care is not available dental procedures that require followup treatment or extensive oral surgery will not be done veterinary civil action programs vetcaps are missions that provide primary veterinary medical care to local nationals and increase the availability of primary veterinary care to areas already covered by local national veterinarian by providing critical unavailable equipment supplies and training optical civil action programs optcaps are humanitarian assistance mission to provide eye care to local nationals in need optcap missions will continue until local national or nongovernmental organizations in certain location can provide eye care preventive medicine can be part of health civil action programs in ca units assigned preventive medicine personnel assess the public health capabilities of country but are not responsible for directly providing preventive medicine personnel as such preventive medicine personnel are assigned to ca companies detachments brigades and commands the number and type of preventive medicine personnel assigned is dependent upon the unit since the staffs role is advisory it has organic equipment and must coordinate for support from preventive medicine detachments and the area of operations ao supporting medical laboratory conclusions medical operations are true force multiplier in soso given the paramount importance of information operations in soso anything that commander can use to bolster his io plan should be employed as an integrated and synchronized element to achieve combined arms effects both lethal and nonlethal medical operations used in that manner support the overall io campaign and whatever localized operation is taking place medcap built into cordon and search operation offers dramatic offset to the negative aspects of such operations civil affairs team looking to extend us influence will find medcaps invaluable but regardless of mission the key to success in medical operations is the same

aviation into the cordon and search captain phil graham captain joel magsig captain chad ward jrtc aviation division cavalry and attack team army aviation provides critical element one integral to the success of combined arms operations attack and cavalry helicopters the ah64 apache and the oh58d kiowa warrior are vital to any ground maneuver commander involved in cordon and search operations their capabilities when fully integrated within the planning process enhance the ground commanders ability to succeed the joint readiness training center jrtc strives to incorporate an aviation component into each rotational exercise throughout the past year active and reserve components along with national guard units have capitalized on these training opportunities additionally jrtc routinely employs its own aviation assets the aviation division observercontrollers ocs and oh58c kiowa helicopters from the jrtc flight detachment to replicate cavalry and attack assets during rotations without friendly forces blufor aviation assets jrtc recently used these aviation assets in situational training exercises stx on cordon and search operations prior to standard forceonforce rotational operations the stx lanes prepare and train each companylevel ground maneuver commander for particular scenarios common to their future theater of operations the cordon and search lane provides an excellent opportunity to practice airground integration agi especially the detailed coordination required to succeed an aviation liaison officer lno in the planning phase enhances integration of aviation assets into the ground tactical plan members of the jrtc aviation division cavalryattack team served as both ocs and mission executors and the trends encountered during the cordon and search lane were consistent with both active and reserve component forces the following observations highlight several of the trends observed during these recent stx lanes the comments focus specifically on airground integration to assist ground maneuver commanders in preparation for cordon and search operations or any mission in which airground integration is critical maneuver element the first step in any airground integration is to recognize that cavalry and attack helicopter elements primarily serve as an additional maneuver element rather than just fires platforms this recognition dictates additional integrated planning requirements as well as the establishment of command and control c2 structure capable of handling both air and ground assets army aviation does not perform close air support cas cas typically relies on initial points ips away from the maneuver area and keeps air assets out of the mission until the ground maneuver commander requires immediate assistance for official use only 107cordon and search handbookinstead of cas army aviation integrates into each mission at the lowest level possible to enhance overall success close combat attacks ccas require detailed integration for success apaches and kiowa warriors execute wide range of missions security attack reconnaissance recon and tactical tasks destroy neutralize delay disrupt block much like any ground element in support of commanders mission these aircraft provide reconnaissance and observation enhancing the overall situational awareness as well as providing direct fire when required additionally aviation is adaptable and capable of changing on the fly as the mission responds to enemy actions as applied to the cordon and search mission in the stx lanes cavalry and attack helicopters provide the ground commander essential capabilities for the conduct of this operation the aircraft normally conduct route reconnaissance in support of ground movement to the objective with an initial observation and assessment of the situation within each objective the best results occurred when ground commanders focus initial observations according to specific intelligence requirements these observations might be the situation around the target building the location of specific vehicle or detection of anything attempting to exit the objective prior to the establishment the outer cordon cavalry and attack helicopters utilize sensorsvideo capabilities to gather requested information without alerting or heightening tensions of the people within the village once the cordon is set the initial plans call for aviation to provide area security outside the inner cordon and mostly beyond the outer cordon this task keeps the aviation element focused out away from the objective searching for elements attempting to influence the ground commanders mission focus out the typical scenario uses an opposing forces opfor technical vehicle and mortar team forcing cca opportunity during execution finally aviation assets accomplish an egress route recon once the ground element completes its mission within the objective or the helicopters fuel situation dictates an early departure plan for success the maneuver mind set dictates additional planning requirements for both air and ground for any operation to be successful all players must execute from the same page this remains true for airground integration especially during cordon and search operations to enhance the ground commanders success aviators must completely understand the ground maneuver plan air assets require the same mission planning products as any ground platoon maneuver graphics objective sketches imagery targetlist worksheet fire areas nfasrestricted fire areas rfas and the communication plan c2 additionally friendly marking techniques clearance of fires aviation rules of engagement roe and downed aviatoraircraft issues create additional situations that must be covered during planning and rehearsals preferably with the aviators present many of these issues can be addressed without designated mission and can be drilled at company level the stx lanes revealed an overreliance on the aviation liaison officer lno to develop the air portion of the ground commanders plan while any commander certainly relies on lno support many units lack general understanding of the capabilities and typical tasks of army aviation tocenter for army lessons learned 108 for official use onlyassist units as they prepare for future operations the cavalryattack team developed an agi smart card see appendix for ground units it provides the ground commander an immediate reference to address general agi questions without the presence of an aviation lno the c2 plan varied among the companies on the cordon and search lane most company c2 plans placed air assets on the company command net fm frequency hop while some chose to inject an intermediary control element placing air on an alternate net such as the fires net while the latter can succeed and may be required based on the competing tasks facing the ground commander only the companies that rehearsed and practiced this plan truly made it work using the command net provides the greatest amount of situational awareness sa to all assets army aviation enhanced that sa immediately through situation reports of important activity this proved crucial as numerous civilian vehicles approached the objectives along various avenues of approach alternate nets require additional time transmitting such key information to the critical players moreover alternate nets create additional problems and issues given only the ground commander has the authority to clear fires not the third party controlling the air assets the communication plan serves as vital item within the planning process the communications plan either enhanced or drastically hindered the overall mission items such as crypto net variables and timeofday as well as competing terminology such as unsecure and plain text affected actual execution those spending adequate time during planning to establish primary and contingency frequencies and ensure all personnel were trained on radio operations saw the benefits in the actual lane execution often aviators provided the ground personnel singlechannel unsecure plain text frequency as an initial communications linkup net and worse case contingency for communication cordon and search execution the initial aircraft checkin with ground elements sets the tone for success on any mission aviators must transmit the minimal essential information to the ground executors call signs total number of aircraft current location and estimated time of arrival eta ordnance available and available time onstation how long will fuel permit air to stay in the area possibly the most crucial piece of information ground forces should immediately return current situation report sitrep along with any critical updates or changes to the initial plan these requirements may increase based on the level of airground integration during the planning process operation may be hasty army aviation doctrine prescribes the use of the standard 9line close air support cas checkin brief as minimal reference for ground to transmit the pertinent data to any air platform the stx lanes reinforce this process as units ready to receive air assets proved ready to adapt to the cordon and search environment the air tasks prior to the establishment of the outer cordon never changed though some refined the observation tasks seeking more specific information within the objective several ground units altered the air tasks based on enemy actions inside the towns making use of the airs observation capabilities some ground maneuver commanders accepted risk beyond the outer cordon for official use only 109cordon and search handbookrefocusing air in search of snipers or other observation tasks inside the town focus in once each situation reached resolution the ground commanders returned air assets to the initial area security mission focus out this quick shift between focus out versus focus in only worked for those companies who tracked aviation much like one of their own maneuver platoons those companies capable of developing and refining both the ground and air tasks during the cordon and search proved most successful on the stx lanes lastly nearly every ground maneuver element found it relatively easy to communicate with air assets those who prepared the most during the planning process used products such as town sketches to vector air throughout the operation their terminology appeared the same as with any maneuver platoon element conclusion undoubtedly the basic element for any mission success is the ability to place all elements affecting the companylevel mission on common operating picture this includes army aviation assets crucial combat multiplier to any commander mission planning serves as the starting point to achieve this end however army aviation especially attack and cavalry platforms such as the apaches and kiowa warriors are ready to adjust and adapt to the battlefield environment just like any maneuver element the jrtc stx lanes provide unique opportunity for many ground maneuver commanders to execute the cordon and search mission with all the crucial assets typically found in
