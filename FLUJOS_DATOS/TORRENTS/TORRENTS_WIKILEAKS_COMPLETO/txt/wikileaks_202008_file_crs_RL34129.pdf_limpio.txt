retention among medicaid and schipeligible children qualifying states would receive cash payments as percentage of the state share of their medicaidschip expenditures though setting higher bar and paying lower percentage in schip as compared to medicaid the senate bill would also provide bonus payments but the payments would be for increasing child enrollment in medicaid not in schip in addition the senate bill doe s not require the implementation of the specific enrollment and retention efforts the payments would be based on fixeddollar amounts specified in the legislation th bonus payments in the agreement are structured after the house bill except alte red to yield smaller payments than under the house bill8 limitations on schi p matching rate under current law states can set their upper income eligib ility level for schip at the higher of 200 of the federal poverty level fpl or 50 percentage points bove their income eligibility level for medicaid children prior to sc hips enactment however by using existing flexibility to define what count s as income any state can raise its effective schip income eligibility vel above 200 fpl through the use of income disregards the house senate and agreement bills would not affect states ability to use income disregards however the senate and agreement bills would reduce the federal re imbursement rate for cost s associated with schip enrollees whose income would exceed 300 fpl without the use of certain disregards an exception would be pr ovided for states that on the date of enactment have federal pproval or have enacted state law to cover schip enrollees above 300 fpl eligibility with respect to eligibility the house bill would allow states to cover individuals up to age 21 rather than age 19 in their schip programs this provision is not in the agreement lthough some differences apply both the house and senate bills w ould allow broader coverage of pregnant women under schip in terms of eligibility and benefits when certain conditions are met the agreement follows the senate bill with some modifications based on the house bill the house bill would allow states to cover certain legal immigrants who meet applicable categorical and financial eligibility requirements ie pregnant women andor children under age 21 before such persons have been in the united states for minimum of five years as re quired under current law the senate bill and the agreement do not include comparable provisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34129crs5 9 express lane eligibility refers to specified agencies that would be permitted to streamline the medicaid and schip eligibility determination and intake process to make it easier for individuals to qualify for coverage section 1115 of the social security act allows the secretary of hhs to waive certain statutory requi rements to modify virtually all aspects of medicaid and schip as long as such changes further the goals of titles xix medicaid andor xxi schip states and the fe deral government have used the section 1115 waiver authority to cover nonmedicaid and schi p services limit benefit packages for certain groups cap program enrollment cover groups such as non pregnant childless adults that are not otherwise eligible among other purposes with respect to schip coverage of adult populations eg nonpregnant childless adults and parents of medicaid and schipelig ible children the house bill would allow for such coverage as long as states ensure that they have not instituted waiting list for their schip pr ogram and that they have an outreach program to reach all targeted lowin come children in families with annual incomes less than 200 fpl by st the senate and the agreement bills phase out schip coverage of nonpregnant childless adults after two years and in fy2009 federal reimbur sement for such coverage would be reduced to the medicaid federal medical assistance per centage fmap rate coverage of parents would still be llowed but beginning in fy2010 allowable spending under the waivers would be subject to set aside amount from separate allotment and would be matched at the states regu lar medicaid fmap rate unless the state is able to prove that it met certain coverage benchmarks related to performance in providing coverage to children finally in fy2011 and fy2012 the federal matching rate for costs associ ated with such parent coverage would be reduced to rate between the medicaid and schip rates for states that meet certain coverage benchmarks and to the states regular medicaid fmap for all other states enrollmentaccess each of the bills include provisions to facilitate access and enrollment in medicaid and schi p among the major provisions the house and the agreement bills would create state option to rely on finding from specified agencies to determine whether child under age 19 or an age specified by the state not to exceed 21 years of age has met one or more of the eligibility requirements eg income assets or resources citizenship or other criteria necessary to determine an individuals initial eligibility eligibility redetermination or renewal of eligibility for medical assist ance under medicaid or schip the senate bill by contrast would allow up to 10 states to use express lane9 eligibility determinations for medicaid and schip enrollment and renewal through threeyear demonstration program like the house and agreement bills the senate bill does not relieve states of their obligation to determine eligibility for medicaid and would require the state to inform families that they may qualify for lower premium payments or more comprehensive health coverage under medicaid if the familys income were directly evaluated by the state medicaid agency all three bills would drop the requirement for signatures on medicaid application form under pe nalty of perjury httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34129crs6 current law and regulations require that schip plans include procedures to ensure that schip coverage does not substitute for coverage provided in group health plans also known as crowdout in midaugust the administration issued guidance letter explaining how cms would apply existing requirements in reviewing state requests to extend schip eligibility to children with income levels exceeding 250 fpl including specifi ed crowdout strategies states would be required to implement w ithin one year the agreement also includes new crowdout provision it would require states already covering children with income exceeding 300 fpl and beginning in 2010 new states that propose to do so to describe how they will address crowdout and implement best practices to avoid crowdout to be deve loped by the secretary in consultation with the states beginning in 2010 these higher income states cannot have rate of public and private coverage for lowincome children that is less than the target rate of coverage for lowincome childre n measure to be calculated by the secretary representing the average rate of private and public coverage among the 10 states and dc with the highest percentage of such coverage states failing to meet this requirement in given fiscal year would not receive any federal schip payments for higher income children until they come into compliance with this rule states would develop corrective ac tion plans and the secretary would not be permitted to deny payments if there is reasonable likelihood that such plans would bring affected states into complia nce both the gao and the iom with 2 million appropriation w ould conduct related crow dout analyses on best practices and measurement accuracy respec tively this provision supersedes the august guidance letter citizenship documentation rules the house senate and agreement bills would make some similar modifications of existing medicaid citizenship documentation rules eg by requiring additional documentation options for federally recognized indian tribes and specifying the reasonable opportunity period for individuals who are required to present documentation however the senate and agreement bills would allow states to meet medicaid citizenship documentation requirements th rough name and social s ecurity number validation make citizenship documentation requirement for schip provide an enhanced match for certain administrative costs and require separate identification numbers for children born to women on emergency medicaid in contrast the house bill would make medicaid citizenship documen tation for children under age 21 state option allow express lane agencies to determine eligibility without citizenship documentation and requi re eligibility audits to ensu re that federal funds are not spent on individuals who are not legal residents premium assistanceemployer buyin the house bill would allow the secretary of health and human services to establish fiveyear demonstration project under which up to 10 states woul d be permitted to provide
