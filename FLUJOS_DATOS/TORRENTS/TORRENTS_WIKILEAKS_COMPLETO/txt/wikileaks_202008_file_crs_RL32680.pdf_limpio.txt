bulletins summary in september 2003 the office of manage ment and budget omb published proposed bulletin on peer review and information quality in the federal register that sought to establish proce ss by which all significant regulatory information would be peer reviewed the scope of the proposed bulletin was very broad covering virtua lly all agencies and defining regulatory information as any scientific or technical study that might be used by local state regional federal andor international regulatory bodies such inform ation would be subject to peer review if the agency could determine th at it could have clear and substantial impact on important public policies or im portant private sector decisions when disseminated the proposed bulletin placed additional peer revi ew requirements on especially significant regulatory informa tion and said agencies were required to notify omb in advance of any studies that might require peer review and how any such reviews would be conducted the proposed bulletin aroused controvers with some observers expressing concern that it could create centralized peer review system within omb that would be vulnerable to political manipulation or control by regulated entities omb received nearly 200 comments on the proposal and published substantially revised peer review bulletin in april 2004 that was broader in scope than the proposed bulletin in that it applied to i nfluential scie ntific information which includes but is not limited to regulatory information and highly influential scientific assessments however agencies were given substantial discretion to decide whether information is influential and therefore requires peer review the revised bulletin also allowed agencies to use the national academy of sciences for peer reviews or to use other procedures that had been approved by omb it also provided exemptions for certain classes of information such as information related to national security products by gove rnmentfunded scientists that are not represented as views of federal agency and routine statistical information however omb retained significant authority to decide when information is highly influential and therefore requires more specific peer review procedures and to approve alternative peer review procedures omb received more than 50 comments on the revised peer review bulletin many of which were supportive of the chan ges made to the proposal however some commenters believed the changes did not go far enough while ot hers believed that omb had significantly weakened the bulletin in january 2005 omb published final version of the bulletin with what it scribed as minor revisions to the version published in april 2004 eg requiring agen cies to disclose the identities of peer reviewers and to prepare an annual report on their peer review activities number of issues regarding the implementation of the bulletin remain unclear eg how much discretion agencies will be given to decide when and what kind of peer review is required this report will be updated when any further revisions to the bulletin are published or other significant events occur

bulletins on september 15 2003 the office of ma nagement and budget omb in coordination with the office of scien ce and technology policy ostp published proposed bulletin in the federal register on peer review and information quality the bulletin if made final would have established process by which all significant regulatory information and especially significant regulatory information would be peer reviewed1 omb described the term peer review in this context as scientifically rigorous review and critique of studys methods results and findings by others in the field w ith requisite training and expertise the proposed bulletin placed additional peer review requirements on especially significant regulatory information and sa id agencies were required to notify omb in advance of any studies that might requi re peer review the scope of the proposed bulletin was very broad coveri ng virtually all agencies and defining regulatory information as any scientific or tec hnical study that might be used by local state regional federal and or international regulatory bodies omb indicated it was issuing the bulletin because agencies peer review practices were inconsistent and governmentwide standards for peer revi ew would make regulatory science more competent and credible the proposed bulletin aroused substantia l controversy with some observers expressing concern that it could create centralized peer review system within omb that would be vulnerable to political manipulation or control by regulated entities omb received nearly 200 comments on th proposal including comments from members of congress trade associations public interest groups and recognized experts in the field of peer review and sc ientific research as result of those comments omb again in consultation w ith

term peer review is not xplicitly defined in ombs bulletins the supplementary information in the final bulletin describes peer review generally as one of the important procedures used in science to ensure that the quality of published information meets the standards of the scientific community it is form of deliberation involving an exchange of judgments about the appropriateness of methods and the strength of the authors inferences peer review occurs when draf t product is reviewed for quality by specialists who were not involved in producing the draft arguably the methods laid out in the bulletin for conducting peer review could also be considered an implicit definition of the conceptinformation the revised bulletin centere d on influential scie ntific information which includes but is not limited to regulatory information and highly influential scientific assessm ents in other ways though the revised bulletin was less inclusive and directive for example it gave agencies more discretion to determine when information required peer review and wh the more detailed review requirements for highly influential information were applicable also unlike the proposed bulletin the revised bulletin did not exclude individuals from being peer reviewers if they had received research grants from the agency disseminating the information being peer reviewed omb again re quested comments from the public on the bulletin on december 15 2004 omb published fi nal version of the peer review bulletin on its website3 the final bulletin was published in the federal register on january 14 20054 omb said this version refl ects minor revisions made in response to more than 50 comments from the public on the revised bulletin for example the final bulletin requires agencies to disclose the names of peer reviewers to the public and adds an annual reporting requi rement to allow omb to track how agencies are using the bulletin however agencies are still afforded substantial discretion to determine when and what type of peer review is required omb also retains substantial discretion in certain areas this report briefly descri bes ombs september 2003 peer review proposal

strengths and limitations of th overall product6 support for peer review some type of peer review has been used for centuries within the scientific community to judge the quality of science peer review can take many different forms and is used for variety of purpos for example it is used commonly by federal agencies to evaluate research pr oposals and plays major role in funding decisions in these cases it is often part of broader category of evaluation known as merit review peer review is also the usual method by which the editors of scientific publications evalua proposed research reports it even plays an important role in many research institutions including many government agencies in decisions about retention and promotion for individua l scientists and in reviewing research programs february 1999 report from th committee on science engineering and public policy concluded that expert review the most co mmon form of which is peer review is the most effective means of evaluating federally funded research programs7 peer review is also used for scientific and technical products relating to policies including regulations to determine whet her the underlying scientific findings are well supported for example such peer re view was established as environmental protection agency epa policy in 19938 in 1996 panel of leading economists concluded that peer review should be used for economic analyses supporting regulations with potentially large impact on the economy eg those whose annual economic costs exceed 1 billion9 the panel also indicat ed that reviewers should be selected based on their demons trated expertise and reputations in its peer review bulletins omb recognized the variety of ways that peer review is used omb said that independent peer review is especially important in the regulatory arena because federal agencies often develop or fund the science that underlies their regulations and then overs ee the peer review of those scientific studies

on sc ience to use the best available peer reviewed science and supporting studies in the 108th congress the water resources development act of 2003 hr 2557 would have generally required project

planning act of 2003 hr 1662 108th congress would have direct ed the secretary of the interior in making decisions about species protection to give greater weig ht to certain kinds of data that had been peer reviewed by qualified individuals as defined in the bill there have also been legislative effort s to require peer review more broadly for example in the 106th congress the senate consider ed but did not enact bipartisan legislation s 746 that woul d have required virt ually all agencies to provide for an independent peer review of any required risk assessments and costbenefit analyses of major rules that the agencies or th omb director reasonably anticipated were likely to have 500 million effect on the economy the bill would have required that peer reviews be conducte d through panels that were broadly representative and involved participants with re levant expertise who were independent of the agency however if an agency certified that adequate peer review had already been conducted and the omb director agreed further peer review would have been required in its comments on this legisl ation the general accounting office gao now the government accountability offi ce generally supported the use of peer review in this context noting that the rigorous independent review of economic analyses should help enhance the quality credibility and acceptability of agencies decisionmaking10 however gao cautioned that given the number of reviews contemplated agencies would need to plan carefully for the reviews and that the panels would need to reflect all points of view presidential support recent presidential administrations have also supported peer review as preferred mean s of assessing scien tific research both prospectively and retrospectively fo r example beginning with the fy1996 budget cycle omb and ostp have jointly pr ovided annual direction to agencies encouraging them to emphasize the funding of peerreviewed research over nonpeer reviewed

cautionary notes about peer review although the concept of peer review s generally received wide support some observers have also raised cautionary notes or mentioned certain limitations to the approach in particular situations for example as omb indicated in its 1997 testimony peer review costs can be significant for agencies in terms of both time and agency resources14 to pay for peer review proce dures agencies may have to divert resources from other areas eg regulatory enforcement or standards development scientists from academic institutions who perform peer reviews on voluntary basis may also incur opportunity costs with respect to other activities such as teaching and research other concerns have focused on how peer reviews have been implemented for example gao noted that peer review methods varied within and among federal agencies15 and that agencies economic analyses of major rules were often not peer reviewed16 number of observers have expre ssed concerns about the impact of peer review requirements on the pace of regulato ry activity with dditional requirements exacerbating what is already often regarded as an ossified rulemaking

limitations that reduced their effectiveness18 for example gao said that the staff office did not routinely ensure that panel members financial disclosures were complete or that they contained enough in formation to determin whether conflict of interest existed als panel members re portedly did not have to disclose information regarding previous positions on the matter being reviewed until the panels first meeting thereby making it difficult to determine the independence and balance of the panel member s until after they had been selected gao also reported that the panels policies nd

advisory boards peer review panels are i ndependent and balanced procedural flexibility or uniformity as noted previously gao reported that federal agencies peer review practices are not consistent19 however several studies of peer review in the federal gove rnment have suggested that rigidly uniform peer review procedures may not be desira ble for example 1996 national science and technology council report indicated that peer review implementation should be flexible and appropriate to the nature of scientific processes20 similarly in its 1999 report on peer review gao reported that ostp believed agen cies peer review practices should be flexible and tailored to agency missi ons and type of research and that specific uniform practices should not be dictated for ev ery agency or all

bulletin was being issued under the information quality act iqa and ombs general authorities to oversee the quality of agency information analys and regulatory actions22 the iqa also known as the data quality act was enacted in december 2000 as section 515 of the treasury and general govern ment appropriations act for fiscal year 2001 pl 106554 the act supplemented the paperwor k reduction act pra which already required omb to develop and oversee the imp lementation of polic ies principles standards and guidelines to apply to federal agency dissemination of public information23 the pra also required agencies to manage their information resources to improve the integrity quality and utility of information to all users within and outside the agency24 although little noticed at the time it wa s enacted the iqa has subsequently been the subject of signifi cant debate and controversy25 the act required omb to issue guidance to federal agencies designed to ensure the quality objectivity utility and integrity of information disseminated to the public it also required agencies to issue their own information quality guidelines and to establish administrative mechanisms that allow affected persons to seek correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agencies that does not comply with the omb guidance however it did not require either omb or the agencies to issue peer review bulletins omb published its final governmentwide iqa guidelines in the federal register in february 200226 in them omb encouraged but did not require the use of peer reviews in the development of agencydisseminated information specifically omb indicated that agenci can presume that data are sufficiently objective if they have been subject to an independent peer review process eg

sponsored peer review referencing the st andards in the above mentioned september 20 2001 memorandum issued by the oira administrator eg disclosure of reviewers prior technical or polic positions and sources of funding the final peer review bulletin also cited executive order 12866 and ombs authority to manage the agencies under th purview of the presidents constitutional authority to supervise the unitary execu tive branch as other authorities supporting the bulletins issuance27 eo 12866 says that oira within omb is the repository of expertise concerning regulatory issues and says that agencies should base their decisions on the best reas onably obtainable scientific technical economic or other information concerning the need for nd consequences of th intended regulation28 however the executive order does not sp ecifically mention peer review ombs proposed peer review bulletin when it published its proposed peer review bulletin in the federal register in september 2003 omb noted in the preamble to the bulletin the importance of peer review and the sometimes incons istent nature of its app lication for these reasons the office proposed requiring peer review for the most important scientific and technical information relevant to regulatory policies that agencies disseminate to the public29 omb said the new requirements would supplement but not supplant both its own information quality guidelines and any agencyspecific peer review requirements for regulatory information although omb noted that its bulletins are not laws or binding regulations as pr actical matter ombs instructions to the agencies carry substantial weight because of its authority to review agencies budget proposals and most significant regu lations before they are published in essence ombs bulletin proposed that each covered federal agency take three actions 1 have all significant regulatory information that the agencies intend to disseminate peer reviewed 2 have especially significant regulatory information peer reviewed according to even higher standards and 3 provide omb with information at least once each year about upcoming scientific studies that might support significant regulatory disseminati ons and the agencies plans for conducting peer reviews of those studies the propos ed bulletin also cont ained several other related requirements the bulletin defi ned agency broadly including cabinet departments and agencies independent agencies g epa and independent regulatory agencies eg the federal communications commission and the nuclear regulatory commissionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs9 30 the definition of an economically significant regulatory action can be found in section 3f1 of executive order 12866 peer review of significan t regulatory information the proposed bulletin defined significant regulatory informa tion as scientific or technical information th at qualifies as influential under ombs information quality guidelines and is relevant to regulatory policies ombs information quality guidelines define influential information as information that the agency can reasonably determine will have clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisi ons when it is disseminated to the public the proposed peer review bulletin said information is relevant to regulatory policies if it might be used by local st ate regional federal andor international regulatory bodies the bulletin indicated that the peer review for this type of information should be appropria and scientifically rigo rous but also said the appropriate peer review mechanism w ould depend on the nove lty and complexity of the science to be reviewed the benef it and cost implications and any controversy regarding the science for information at the lower end of those dimensions the proposed bulletin indicated that review by qualified specialists within separate part of the agency disseminating the information could satisfy the peer review requirement also as in the information quality guidelines agencies were allowed to presume that any studies that had already been independen tly peer reviewed did not have to be reexamined but the bulletin said this presumption is rebuttable based on persuasive showing in par ticular instance finally the bulletin said peer review was not needed for significant regulatory information related to national defense or foreign affairs or information that is di sseminated in the course of an individual agency adjudication or proceeding on permit application review of especially signi ficant regulatory information the proposed bulletin indicated that regulatory information should be considered especially significant and therefore subject to more specific peer review requirements if the agency intends to disseminate it in support of an economically significant regulatory action eg with 100 million annual impact on the economy30 b its dissemination would otherw ise have clear and substantial effect on important public po licies or important private sector decisions with an impact of 100 million in any year or c omb determines it is of significant interagency interest or is relevant to an administration policy priority the bulletin laid out series of proposed requi rements for these types of peer reviews for example it said agencies must select peer reviewers primarily ba sed on their scientific and technical expertise and strive to appoint reviewers who are independent of the agency and do not have any real or perceived conflicts of interest eg have fi nancial interest in the issue do not seek or receive substantial funding from th agency and have not conducted peer review for the agency or advocated position in recent yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs10 on the specific topic being examined if obtaining the requisite expertise requires the selection of panel member with perceived bias the bulletin said agencies must ensure that another reviewer with contrary bias is appoi nted to balance the panel provide peer reviewers with an explicit statement describing the purpose and scope of the review and sufficient information to understand the data met hods and conclusions of the material being reviewed permit other interested agencies and persons to submit comments and provide those comments to peer reviewers for their consideration and direct peer reviewers to issue final report describi ng the nature of their review and their findings and conclusions including any dissenting opinions the report mu st also describe the names affiliations and qualifications of all peer reviewers and any prior affiliations with the agency also agencies were instructed to consult with omb and ostp regarding the sufficiency of thei r planned peer review policies and on request to discuss with omb the sufficiency of their plans to review specific documents omb notification of up coming peer reviews the proposed bulletin indicated that at least once each year each agency must provide omb with summary description of any existing ongoing or contemplated studies that might support sign ificant regulatory information that the agency intends to disseminate within the next year each agency was also to provide omb with the agencys plan for conducting peer reviews of such studies under the bulletins requirements including an agen cy contact person om b indicated that to reduce paperwork this information was to be included in other reports being submitted to omb under executive order

comments on its website32 in addition to this formal commenting process omb and ostp s ponsored an open workshop on the peer review requirements in november 200333 the workshop was hosted by the national academy of sciences nas which subs equently endorsed th bulletins objectives but expressed several concerns omb said the comments that it received varied substantially with some highly favorable and others suggesting that the bulletin be withdrawn and reconsidered in gene ral supporters of the proposed bulletin reportedly indicated that peer review standards across the government were inconsistent and that more consistent use of peer review could increase the technical quality and credibility of regulatory science they also reportedly asserted that peer review could protect sciencebased regulations from political criticism and litigation for example the us chamber of co mmerce said that omb had provided bulletin of high quality and sound judgment nd strongly supported

national petrochemical refiners association strongly supported ombs proposed bulletin saying that it would correct the current variability in federal agency implementation of peer reviews by providing the needed guidance on process requirements35 omb said that many critics of the propos ed bulletin viewed it as an effort to inject political considerations into the world of science and to use the uncertainty that inevitably surrounds science as an excuse to delay new rules that could be costly to regulated entities they also reportedly said that the bulletin appeared more concerned about peer reviewers possible conflicts of interest with agencies than their potential conflicts with re gulated industries in its summary of the public comment s omb identified number of broad themes and noted how it responded to those comments36 specifically omb said the comments centered on such issues as the need for the bulletin its scope and applicability the prescriptive nature of the review process for especially significant information and the costs of implementing the bulletin need for th bulletin omb said many commenters indicated that it was unclear why the bulletin was needed for example the american public health association said it was unaware of any evidence that the current system is not working or any examples of inappropriate or flawed fede ral regulations being promul gated as result of failure to peer review37 in response omb said it woul d provide additional information in the revised bulletin on the importance of peer review and the variability of agencies peer review policies clarifications of scope and applicability number of commenters reportedly said the scope and applicability of the bulletin was unclear some commenters questioned the focus on regulatory information and said it would be difficult to know in advance whether particular study might be used in support of future regulatory action in its response to the comments omb said it would revise thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs13 38 office of management and b udget summary of comments 39 omb said that guidance for what constitutes good regulatory impact analysis is in omb circular a4 to view copy of this circular see httpwwwwhitehousegovomb circularsa004a4pdfbulletin to focus on influential scientific information instead of the potential regulatory impact of the information disseminated as noted previously the iqa guidelin state that information should be considered influential if the agency can reasonably determine that dissemination of the information will have or does have clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private decisions38 some commenters expressed concern that the criteria for requiring the more stringent peer review requirements for highly significant information were too broad in response omb said it would narrow the applicability of those requi rements to cover only scientific assessments that either ve 500 million annual effect on important public policie s or private sector decisions or involve novel complex or precedentse tting approaches or significant interagency interest omb said it agreed with comments questioning the applicability of the bulletins requirements to agencies regulatory impact analyses and said it would more clearly stat that those analyses would not be covered by the revised bulletin39 however omb went on to say that the bulletins requirements would cover the models and data underlying those analyses and enc ouraged agencies to have their regulatory impact analyses peer reviewed by government analysts omb also said it would clarify that the bulletin did not apply to products released by governmentf unded scientists that were not represented as the views of th agency supporting the research finally in response to several c oncerns omb said it would exempt from the bulletins coverage any timesens itive medical public health and safety disse minations and allow agency heads to waive or defer the bulletins require ments where warranted by compelling rationale agency discretion and p eer review procedures commenters also said that the proposed bulletin was too prescriptive in the procedures applicable to especially significant regulatory information and said extensive peer reviews would be costly and could lead to delays in regulatory decisions in response omb said that it would give agencies additional discretion in the revised bulletin to determine the level of peer review required for any particular document and to use alternative procedures if they could demonstrate that those procedures would meet the requirements in the governmentwide and agencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs14 40 to view copy of this letter see httpgovtaffsenategovindexcfmfuseaction pressreleasesdetailpressrelease_id694affiliationr this letter was not part of the 187 comments that omb listed on the proposed bulletin specific iqa guidelines the response incl uded significant discussion of the current and potential role of nas in conducting peer reviews in its comments nas had pointed to the role its committees have played in performing peer reviews of various agency programs activities policies and proposals in determining the appropriate level of review omb said agencies should consider the costs and benefits of peer review omb also emphasized that its role is not to veto studies but rather to ensure that they have the appr opriate level of review before implementation selection of reviewers omb also said it was incorporating suggestions regarding the selection of peer reviewers including that agencies solicit reviewers from the public and from scientific and professional societies one major concern of the commenters was that the criteria outlined in the proposed bulle tin eg discouragin g participation of reviewers who were seeking or receiving f unding via research grants from an agency could result in the most qualified revi ewers being excluded from consideration omb also said that the revised bulletin would make clear that the receipt of research grants through peerreviewed competitions does not disqualify potential reviewer public participation according to omb many of the commenters raised concerns about public participation in the peer re view process questioning mong other things whether that participation would be us eful and raising logistical considerations as result omb said it had decided to allow the agencies to decide whether public participation would be allowed and in what forms however omb said it would provide for public comment on the agencies peer re view plans for upcoming documents cost of implementing the bulletin finally omb said some of the comme nters requested that omb provide an estimate of the costs associated with implementation of the peer review bulletin for example in march 2004 letter to omb senators joseph lieberman and richard durbin said it was curious that oira an office known for insisting on cost benefit analysis provides estimate of costs nor documentation of the benefits gained or specific harms that will be redu ced by the proposal we suggest that the proposed rules do not pass ombs own test of good rulemaking40 omb estimated that there would be about 125 influential scientific documents covered each year that are related to ru lemaking and at least 1250 other documents each year that are unrelated to rulemaking omb said some of these documents may be exempt or otherwise not require p eer reviews eg they had already been adequately peer reviewed but did not quan tify that assertion omb said that high quality individual letter review would co st an agency about 5000 per document therefore assuming that 1000 of the 1250 documents required peer review andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs15 41 omb estimated that such study might cost 1 million and take two years to complete 42 letter to dr margo schwab

wwwwhitehousegovombinforeg2003iq186pdfcould be reviewed by letter omb said the cumulative cost of these reviews would be 5 million omb said one or two dozen of these documents could be considered highly influential scientific assessments requiring more intense peer review omb estimated that an average peer review of these documents would cost 50000 therefore if 20 of these highly influential assessments were peer reviewed the cost would be 1 million omb said these costs are likely large overestimates of the incremental costs of the bulletin because many agencies already engage in peer review practices the response also included an analysis that provided methodology for agencies to use in deci ding when more expensive peerreview study by nas would be costeffective41 other comments several other types of co mments were offered on the proposed guidelines that were not included in ombs summary for example omb watch questioned ombs authority to issue bulletin on peer review noting that the pra and the iqa do not explicitly provide the office with that responsibility and that congress had previously considered and rejected several proposals to mandate peer review omb watch said that if omb believes governmentwide peer review requirements are needed it should instead submit its ideas to congress for considerati on and possible authorization42 the american bar association aba noting that the proposed bulletin required peer review whenever the impact of the regulatory action would have exceeded 100 million recommended that omb limit the bulletins categorical requirement for peer review to those situations in which the scientific information is at least arguably complex novel or controversial43 the aba said peer review is simply not the correct mechanism to address significant use of routine established or accep ted scientific information the aba also said it agreed that one factor in determining whether an individual should be peer revi ewer is whether that individual is receiving or seeking substantial funding from the agency involved however the aba also said that an issue of equal concern is whether potential reviewer is r eceiving or seeking funding from private company or industry or citizen group with stake in the information involved httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs16 44 letter to dr margo schwab dec 12 2003 to view copy of this letter see

p a19the american association for th advancement of science aaas said it was concerned that one of the bulletins factors in selecting reviewers whether the prospective reviewer had advocated position on the matter at issue c ould exclude qualified scientist who had simply made statements based on preponderance of peer reviewed scientific evidence eg that particulate matter of certain size had been shown to cause asthma in children44 aaas said such statements should not be considered advocacy the organization also said that omb should make clear that individual comments in agencies peer review reports would not be associated with individual reviewers in march 2004 the aaas council adopted resolu tion strongly opposing the proposed bulletin and requesting that it be withdrawn45 the aeibrookings joint center for regulatory studies recommended among other things that omb or some other entity conduct an evaluation of the peer review program after certain amount of time to determine whethe r peer review actually led to material improvement in the quality of the regulatory analysis 46 aeibrookings said if omb could not develop reasonableapproach to evaluation it proba bly should not proceed with this effort ombs revised peer review bulletin the comments that omb received on th proposed bulletin led the office to release what it described as substantia lly revised bulletin in april 2004 the changes were characterized in the media as partial retreat in ombs initiative47 omb said the revised bulletin provided more extensive discussion of why governmentwide peer review guidance was needed gave agencies more discretion in determining the appropria type of peer review for specific products and more clearly indicated that the gu idance does not create any new rights for litigation also the revised bulletin permitted an agency under certain circumstances to use scientist as peer reviewer who had r eceived research grants from the agency practice that was discouraged in the propos ed bulletin the table appended to thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs17 48 the explanatory section on requirements in the revised document states that the bulletin addresses peer review of scientific inform ation disseminations th at contain findings or conclusions that represent the official position of one or more departments or agencies of the federal government however the term official position is not mentioned in the bulletin itself the revised bulletin does not in clude the term regulatory information the original proposed bulletin defines study as any research report data finding or other analysis while this definition is somewhat broader than the meaning usually ascribed to the term by scientists it is narrower than the definition of scientific information in the revised bulletin which includes any communica tion or representation of knowledge in any medium or form 49 foia is described in general management laws compendium coordinated by clinton t brass pp 2629 50 the disclaimer is required to say this info rmation is distributed solely for the purpose of predissemination peer review under applicable information quality guidelines it has not been formally disseminated by the agency and should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policyreport provides sidebyside comparison of the proposed and revised bulletins the sections below discuss similarities and differences in the documents changes in scope and application among the more notable changes made to the bulletin were revisions to the scope and applicability of the peer review requirements in general the scope of the revised bulletin was arguably much broader than the proposed bulletin for example whereas the proposed bulletin applied to significant regulatory information the revised bulletin applied to influential scientific information scope that included but was not limited to regulatory information48 however the revised bulletin also made it clear that certain types of information within this broad category did not have to be p eer reviewed including information distributed within the government or to contractors or grantees responses to requests under the free dom of information act foia the privacy act or faca49 correspondence with individuals press releases and distributions made to peer reviewers under the bulletin provided they contain disclaimer50 the revised bulletin also explicitly exempted from its requirements information that 1 was related to national security foreign affairs or international trade or treaties where compliance with the bulletin would interfere with the need for secrecyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs18 51 the proposed bulletin said agencies need not have peer review conducted on significant regulatory information that relates to national defense or foreign affairs 52 as noted previously omb has said that the data used to generate these analyses are covered by the peer review requirements also the bulletin did not indicate whether regulatory flexibility analyses under the regulatory flexibility act were exempt 53 the proposed bulletin allowed omb not the agencies to waive many of the bulletins requirements if an agency makes compelling case on grounds of an emergency imminent health hazard homeland security th reat or some other compelling rationale or promptness51 2 was produced by government funded scientists that was not represented as the views of the agency 3 was an agency regulatory impact analysis or regulatory flexibility analysis under executive order 1286652 or 4 was medical health or safety informati on that was time sensitive or ba sed on recent clinical trial that had already been adequately peer reviewed the bulletin also allowed agency heads to waive or defer the bulletin requirements where warranted by compelling rationale53 in structure the revised peer review bulletin was similar to the proposed bulletin in that it still essentially required agencies to take three actions to the extent permitted by law have peer review conducted on all influen tial scientific information that the agency intends to disseminate have all highly influential scientific assessments peer reviewed according to more specific and demanding standards and indicate what influential and highly influential information the agency plans to peer review in the future each of these required actions is descri bed more fully in the sections below influential scientific information the revised peer review bulletin defined the term influential scientific information as information the agency reasonably can determine that the dissemination of which will have or does have clear and substantial impact on important public policies or private sector decisions therefore in contrast to the proposed bulletin the peer review require ments in the revised bulletin were not limited to regulatory policies in addition to the limitations and exem ptions discussed above the revised bulletin said that agencies were also not required to conduct peer review of influential information that had already had an adequate peer review the bulletin gave agencies substantial discretion in determining whether prior review was adequate specifically stating that the earlier review need not comply with all of the requirements of this bulletin it also said that the sufficiency of the prior review depended on the novelty and complexity of the science to be reviewed and the benefit and cost implications language in the proposed bulletin about rebutting anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs19 54 specifically the revised bulletin says that the agency or the entity selecting peer reviewers must 1 ensure that reviewers who are federal employees comply with federal ethics requirements 2 apply or adapt those requirements to reviewers who are not federal employees and 3 consider the national academ of sciences conflict of interest policyagencys presumption regarding whether earlier peer reviews were sufficient was not included in the revised bulletin the revised bulletin like the proposed bu lletin also gave agencies discretion in determining the appropriate peer review mechanism for any information not previously reviewed with the level of rigor required again dependent on the novelty and complexity of the science to be reviewed and the benefit and cost implications the bulletin stated that appropriate reviews could range from examinations by other federal specialists to formal panels composed of independent experts the preamble to the bulletin indicated that so peer reviews coul d be done by letter eg when draft document covers only one discipline but said panels were preferable when time and resources permitted their use peer reviewers were to be selected based on their releva nt expertise and were not to have participated in developing the product bein g reviewed the revised bulletin also contained requirements to handle participation by scientists with conflicts of interest54 and said that the comments of peer reviewers or summary of those comments should be made available to the public when peer review is required in response to concerns that the trigger for peer reviews was too vague omb indi cated in the revised bulletin that the reviews were needed whenever an agency reasonably determines that scientific information will have or does have clear and substantial impact on important public policies or privat sector decisions this change did not appear to address one of the underlying concerns voiced in the comments on the proposed bulletin the definition of influential information is essentially the same as the one used to define significant information in the proposed bulletin the only difference is th broader applicability to nonregulatory information therefore agencies still ma find it difficult to determine whether particular study will at some point in the future have clear and substantial impact on important public policies much less im portant private sector decisions two agencies in analogous situations may reach different conclusions regarding the need for peer review as result the overall purpose of the guidelines more consistent application of peer review am ong federal agencies may not be achieved highly influential scientific assessments the revised bulletin contained number of additional peer re view requirements for scientific assessments that are highly influential these requirements were much more specific than those placed on influential scientific assessments differed in some respects from the requirements in the proposed bulletin and appeared to give omb and the agencies significant authority to determine when the requirements are applicable httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs20 when enhanced peer reviews are required the revised bulletin defined scientific assessmen t as an evaluation of body of scientific or technical knowledge which typically sy nthesizes multiple factua l inputs data models assumptions andor applies be st professional judgement to bridge uncertainties in the available information the term highl influential scientif ic assessment was defined in the revised bulletin as influential scientific information as defined in the previous section of this report that either the disseminating agency or omb determined met the abovementioned definition of scientific assessment and could have clear and substa ntial impact on important public policies or private sector decisi ons with potential effect of more than 500 million in any year or involved precedent setting novel and complex approaches or significant interagency interest as discussed previously in the pr oposed bulletin enhanced peer review requirements applied to especially significant influential information expected to be disseminated in support of regulatory action that could have 100 million impact in any year therefore although th dollar threshold for when enhanced peer review is required was higher in the revised bulletin 500 million instead of 100 million the peer review requirements were more broadly applicable in that they applied to more than just regulations also the language regarding precedent setting novel and complex approaches re placed criteria in the proposed bulletin in which omb alone could decide that certa in information required enhanced peer review because it was of significant interagency interest or relevant to an administration policy priority selection of reviewers the revised bulletin scribed in some detail how peer reviewers of highly influential scientific assessments should be selected but s till gave agencies substantial discretion in ma king the final decision for example the bulletin said that reviewers must be selected primarily on the basis of necessary expertise experience and skills and must be diverse enough to fairly represent different perspectives the revised bulletin also said that agencies must consider requesting the public to nominate reviewers and must generally bar participation by scientists employed by the agency spons oring the review as noted previously the proposed bulletin said agencies should s trive to select peer reviewers who were independent of the agency in additi on as in the proposed bulletin the revised bulletin said agencies should try to avoid repeated use of the same reviewer on multiple assignments however in significant departure from the proposed bulletin the revised bulletin also said that research grants awarded to scientist through competitive peerreviewed process did not disqualify th at scientist from serving on peer review panel the proposed bulletin indicated th at peer reviewers who were receiving or seeking substantial funding from the agency through contract or research grant should not be selected as peer reviewers also whereas the proposed bulletin advocated balancing panel members biases the revi sed bulletin contained language to that effect finally the revised bulletin said that agencies couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs21 55 the proposed bulletin would have permitted omb not the agency heads to waive the peer review requirementscommission entities independent of the agency to select peer reviewers and manage the process public comments the revised bulletin also ga ve agencies discretion in the area of public comments as noted prev iously the proposed peer review bulletin instructed agencies to permit interested agencies and persons to submit comments on the information being reviewe d and to provide those comments to the peer reviewers for their consideration in contrast the revised bulletin said that agencies could decide on their own whether to make the information at issue available for public comment but said agencies should consid er having public comment period and public meetings before the reviewers when there is sufficient public interest the revised bulletin did not indicat how agencies are to make this determination or how much public interest is sufficient to trigger the need for public comments the bulletin also said that if an agency decides to make draft assessment available to the public it must whenever prac ticable provide peer re viewers with summary or compilation of the comments received other requirements the revised bulletin cont ained several other types of requirements that were also in the propos ed bulletin for example the revised bulletin required agencies to provide reviewer s with sufficient information to allow them to understand the data assumptions nd analytic procedures used to support key findings or conclusions also agencies were required to instruct peer reviewers to prepare report summarizing their fi ndings and conclusions the report must contain the names affiliations and credentials of the reviewers agencies were in turn required to prepare written response to the report and both the report and the response must be posted on the agencys website alternative procedures the revised peer review bulletin said that an agency can 1 rely on scientific info rmation produced by nas 2 commission nas to peer review the information or 3 use an alternative procedure specifically approved by the oira administrator in consultation with ostp as noted previously the bulletin permitted the agency head to waive or defer some or all of the peer review requirements for influential scientific assessments and highly influential scientific assessments where warranted by compelling rationale55 if the requirements are waived however the bulletin said peer review should be conducted as soon as practicable thereafte r the proposed bulletin did not provide for alternative procedures omb authority as is apparent from the preceding discussion the revised peer review bulletin like the proposed bulletin gave omb significant authority to decide when agencies should use the mo re rigorous form of peer review specifically the revised bulletin indicated th at these procedures should be used when omb or the agency determines that scientific assessment 1 could have clear and substantial impact on impor tant public policies or pr ivate sector decisions with potential effect of more than 500 million in any year or 2 involves precedent setting novel and complex approaches or significant inte ragency interesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs22 56 in the proposed bulletin omb had similar au thority the agency could be required to conduct formal independent external peer revi ew if omb determined that the information was of significant interagency interest or was relevant to an administration policy prioritytherefore under this definition omb could unilaterally determine that certain information that an agency intends to disseminate is sufficiently novel or complex to trigger these highly influential additional peer review requirements56 also whereas the revised bulletin defined influentialscientific information as information that the agency can reasonable determine will have or does have clear and substantial impact on important public policies or private sector decisions the bulletin said that information should be considered highly in fluential if either the agency or omb determines it could have such an impact conceptually lower threshold than for information that is only influential omb retained significant authority over the peer review process in other ways for example omb could determine that an agencys alternative peer review procedures are sufficiently rigorous to replace the requirements in the revised bulletin upcoming peer reviews the proposed bulletin required agencies to notify omb at least once each year of any existing or upcoming studies that mig ht trigger the peer review requirements within the next year and of the agenci plans for conducting those peer reviews in contrast the revised bulletin required each covered agency to post an agenda on its website every six months delineating any information disseminations subject to peer review the revised bulletin was also much more specific about these notices than the proposed bulletin requiring each try on the agenda to contain detailed description of the peer review plan including the title subject and purpose of the plan with an agency contact how the review will be conducted panel or individual letters the anticipated number of reviewers and succinct description of the primary disciplines or types of expertise needed in the review each peer review plan was also required to describe how reviewers will be selected whether the public will be asked to nominate peer reviewers whether there will be opportunities for the public to comment on the information being reviewed and whether the agency will provide reviewer s with copies of any public comments before beginning their work the revised bulletin required agencies to establish mechanism to allow the public to comment on the adequacy of the peer review plans and must consider those comments httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs23 57 for ombs response to the comments provided on

review bulletin stating that although omb had made s ignificant revisions to the bulletin it nevertheless had failed to correct some of the most fundamental complaints60 specifically omb watch said that omb lacked the authority to issue the guidelines given 1 the lack of specific authority to do so in th statutes and orders cited and 2 that congress had not enacted legi slation designed to require peer review omb had not established that th ere was governmentwide peer review problem in need of governmentwide solutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs24 61 for copy of the chambers

control ove r federal peer review practices eg in determining when certain information requires more rigorous peer review and in approvi ng alternative peer review plans and recommends that some of thos responsibilities be given to the national academy of sciences the independence standard in the bulletin would diminish the ability of government scientists to participate as peer reviewers while not affecting sc ientists from industry the revised bulletin would likely significantly delay the regulatory process at agencies by adding several new layers of bureaucracy eg public comments on peer revi ews and peer review plans in its conclusion omb watc h recommended that omb withdraw the bulletin and instead convene an interagency committee to investigate peer review techniques and flaws or make changes in the bu lletin to address their concerns chamber of commerce the us chamber of commerce submitted comments on the revised bulletin in may 2004 stating that the revised bulle tin has fundamental problems that must be resolved and that it c ould not support the issuance of final bulletin until those problems are addressed61 the chamber said it had deep concerns about among other things the blanket exemption given to nas peer reviews the excessive discretion given to agencies in the implementation of the bulletin the absence of provisions allowing affected parties to contest any agency determination of applicability peer review type panel selection charge or other peer re view program element as it applies to specific case and insufficient limitations on the use of proprietary information and models in summary the chamber said that the changes omb made in issuing the revised bulletin are so severe and bilitating as to eliminate the public benefit of having common governmentwide minimum standard for peer reviewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs25 62 for copy of these members comments see httpwwwwhitehousegovombinforeg peer200425pdf 63 for copy of the aaas comments see http wwwaa asorgsppcstcdocs52804omb peerltrpdfmembers of congress in may 2004 twelve members of cong ress provided omb with comments on the revised bulletin stating that the revi sion did not address pr eviously expressed concerns that the proposal was unjustif ied overly broad burde nsome and did not appropriately guard against ppointment of reviewers with conflicts of interest or that it provided omb with excessive authority over the production and dissemination of gove rnment information62 the members said that the need for the bulletin remained unjustified that the exemptions in the revised bulletin resulted in an unbalanced approach and that it created considerable new burdens on agencies they also said that safeguards to ensure the integrity of the process for selection of reviewers have not been included in the bulle tin in particular they said there was requirement that agencies disclose publicly whether any panel members with conflict were selecte d in conclusion the members characterized the bulletin as wolf in sheeps clothing and said it wa s designed to prevent the dissemination of government information s tifle public debate and delay leg itimate government regulatory action they also said that the agencies not omb are the repository of scientific and technical expertise and said they s hould be given full authority to govern their own peer review procedures aaas aaas filed comment with omb in june 2004 saying that the revised version is much improved but raising several issues63 for example aaas questioned why omb said scientists seeking an exemption to the peer review requirements for info rmation produced by government funded scientists were only advised to incl ude disclaimer rather than required to do so suggested that agencies be required to make public the criteria for determining when outside entities would be commissioned to select peer reviewers or manage the peer review process and how these entities would be selected and overseen by the agencies and endorsed the idea of an interage ncy working group on peer review and recommended that the group be required to report to the public annually on its deliberati ons and findings and to conduct studies and hold meetings regarding the impact of the guidelines on science and the quality of the information produced the editor of aaass flagship

for being good listener64 other scientific societies number of other scientif ic societies also commented on the revised peer review bulletin for example an official in the association of american medical colleges was quoted in april 2004 as saying that omb had been very responsive and said the revised document i s much much more flexible65 in july 2004 after the comment period for the revised bulletin closed consortium of 13 scientific societies mostly in the life sciences released general statement on the role of scientific peer review in policy development66 the statement cited peer reviews as critically important tools for policy makers and laid out list of eight considerations the societies believe will help ensure that agency peer reviews are well designed and performed while several of the points were also made by other organizations some provided somewhat different emphasis for example the societies stressed that for scientific peer re view to be effective it should be insulated from politics as much as possible said peer review is not way to get the right answer for policy in many instances even the best data are subject to alternative interpretations and there is best answer said that while avoiding and ma naging conflicts of interests is important most scientific peer review rests on the presumed integrity of the reviewers stemming from professional standards of conduct to which scie ntists subscribe said it is critical to acknowledge the cultural differences among scientists policymakers and the public in developing and implementing an appropriate model for peer review for example science is inherently uncertain nd scientists must acknowledge that in their work including peer revi ew managers in contrast often are not in position to embrace that uncertainty but must make decisions in the face of it httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs27 67 the characterizations in this section of ombs changes in response to public comments are from ombs response to the comments provided on the revised peer review bulletin available at httpwwwwhitehousegovombinforegpeer2004peer_responsepdffinal peer review bulletin as noted previously on december 15 2004 omb released its final bulletin on peer review omb said that it had made minor revisions to the april version of the bulletin that were responsive to the publics comments67 perhaps most notably omb said that the final bulletin requires that agencies disclose to the public the names of peer reviewers for both influential scie ntific information and highly influential scientific assessments however the bulletin does not require agencies to disclose wh ich reviewers made which comments adds an annual reporting requirement to addre ss concerns about the lack of an enforcement mechanism thereby allowing omb to track how agencies are using the bull etin including provisions for waivers and exceptions omb also said it expects the public to monitor agencies actions under the bulletin requires agencies to designate at the time they plan peer review whether it should be considered i nfluential scientif ic information or highly influential scientific assessment provides additional criteria for what constitutes highly influential scientific assessment specifically the term now includes influential assessments that are novel controversial or precedent setting or have significant interagency interest omb also clarified that the 500 million impact test covers all impacts public or private sector that occur in any year broadened the applicability of the exemption for timesensitive health or safety information noting that it is not restricted to medical data from clinical trials that were subject to adequate peer review before the start of the trial requires agencies to adopt or adapt the national academy of sciences policy for committee selection with respect to evaluating conflicts of interests of peer reviewers who are not federal employees omb also reportedly made number of what appear to be less significant changes to the final bulletin for example omb said that the final version of the bulletin retains substantial degree of di scretion for the agencies but also clarifies the intent of its language concerning the adequacy of priorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs28 peer review and the use of ferrals and waivers to address concerns that the revised draft was too discretionary encourages agencies to provide public participation opportunities for reviews of highly influential ssessments but avoids strict mandate for public participation nd adds language to stress that agencies should avoid ope nended comment periods reinstates instructions that peer reviewers are to comment on scientific and technical questions and not to provide opinions on the policy implications provides rare exception to allo w premier government scientist from the department or agency that prepared an assessment to participate in peer review under certain circumstances concluding observations ombs peer review bulletin is likely to have significant effect on federal rulemaking and other forms of informa tion dissemination and public policy that effect is likely to be both direct through agencies and ombs enforcement of the bulletins requirements and indirect through references to the bulletin by others for example section 402 of the specialty crops competitiveness act of 2004 pl 108465 signed by the president on decem ber 21 2004 indicated that required peer review of the procedures and standa rds governing the consideration of certain import and export requests sha ll be consistent with the guidance by the office of management and budget pertaining to peer review and information quality some of the initial issues and concer ns raised by commenters on the proposed peer review bulletin were cl arified or otherwise addresse d in the revised and final versions of the bulletin perhaps most notably the bulletin now makes it clear that scientists are not prohibited from serving as peer reviewers if they receive research grants from the agency based on investigatorinitiated competitive peer reviewed proposals the bulletin also provides exem ptions from the peer review requirements for timesensitive medical public healt h and safety info rmation and other compelling circumstances however number of other issues remain unclear including 1 the amount of discretion that agencies will actually have in carrying out the bulletins requirements 2 the degr ee to which the bulletin will accomplish the stated goal of making federal peer revi ew practices more consistent and 3 the effects of the bulletin on agencies nd the federal rulemaking process agency discretion the final peer review bulletin appears to give federal agencies substantial discretion in determining whether peer re view is required for specific products and if so what type of peer review mechan ism is appropriate nd who should serve as peer reviewers for example the bulletin says agencies need not have peer review conducted on influential scie ntific information that d already been subject tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs29 adequate peer review to determine whether prior review was adequate agencies are dir ected to consider among other th ings whether the science is novel or complex and whether it is important to decision making notably though the final bulletin longer indicates that an adequate peer review need not comply with all of the requirements of the bulletin also the final bulletin says that information should be considered inf luential scientific in formation if the agency reasonably can determine that it will have or does have clear and substantial impact on important public po licies or private sector decisions the bulletin says that peer reviewers shoul d be selected to provide the necessary expertise experience and skills and the group of reviewers should be sufficiently broad and diverse to fairly represent th relevant scientific perspectives and knowledge on the other hand the final bulletin also gives omb substantial discretion in certain areas for example the bulletin i ndicates that omb can require agencies to use the more exacting procedures for highly influential scientific assessments if omb determines the information is scientific assessment that could have substantial impact on public policies or private sector decisions with potential impact of more than 500 m illion in any year or is novel controversial or precedent setting or has significant interagency interest also omb can unilaterally approve agencies use of alternative peer review procedures the amount of discretion that agencies will actually have in carrying out their peer review programs or conversely th amount of control that omb will retain will be apparent only throug h the bulletins implementation the amount of agency discretion or omb control could vary substantially from one administration to another consistency omb indicated that stronger peer review policies were needed because of the importance of the issue and citing 1999 gao report because of the variability in both the definition and impleme ntation of peer review across agencies omb went on to say that prior to the development of the bulletin there were government wide standards concerning when peer revi ew is required and if required what type of peer review processes are appropriate therefore omb said that the bulletin establishes minimum standards for when peer review is required for scientific information and the types of peer review that should be considered by agencies in different circumstances however the final bulletin may not pr ovide the desired consistency in peer review definition or impleme ntation as indicated above the bulletin leaves many key terms undefined or subject to interpre tation and gives the agencies substantial discretion regarding when certain actions should be taken eg when previous peer reviews are adequate and which reviewers should be selected ie those with the necessary expertise experience and skills to the extent that agencies are allowed to exercise discretion in these areas consistency may be forfeited on the other hand strict enforcement of uniform procedures established by omb carries with it different set of c oncerns about aggregation of power within the executive office of the president and may be resisted by federal agencies also as notedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680crs30 68 statement of sally katzen oira administrator before the senate committee on governmental affairs sept 12 1997 69 ben geman white house peer review requirements could delay standards greenwire volume 10 number 9 dec 17 2004 the article quoted program manager in the department of energy as saying that fficiency standards for residential furnaces and boilers commercial air conditioners and other equipment were being delayed for two years because of ombs peer review bulletinpreviously although gao reported that ag encies peer revi ew practices were inconsistent it did not recommend greater c onsistency and some view variation in those practices as appr opriate and desirable effects on agencies and rulemaking number of commenters expressed concer ns regarding the effect that adding new peer review requireme nts would have on what is already viewed by some observers as lengthy ossified federal rulemaking process somewhat related concerns have been voiced regarding the cost of the requirements to federal agencies with senators lieberman and durbin sugge sting that the requirements do not pass ombs own costbenefit st of good rulemaking in response omb provided estimates in the preamble to the revised bulletin indicating that it did not believe the costs would be prohibitive to the agenci as noted previously though in 1997 omb indicated that peer review costs could be significant in terms of both time and agency resources68 little empirical data are currently available regarding the cost of peer reviews how they affect the federal rulemaking process or their effect on the quality of the information being reviewed it is even less clear how the peer review requirements suggested by omb will affect those factors and there appears to be mechanism in place for collecting such data there are some indications however that the requirements coul d delay regulatory action69 the aeibrookings joint center for regulatory studies recommended that omb or some other entity build into the peer review program an evaluation to determine its effect on the quality of regulatory analyses any such evaluation could at least conceptually include an examination of the cost of the new peer review requirements to federal agencies and its effect on the pace of rulemaking to determine the effect of the peer review bulletin on these or other factors baseline information regarding the current state of the art would need to be gathered before the bulletins implementation even if the data indicate that peer review adds time to the early stages of the rulemaking process that time may be worth the investment if doing so reduces the likelihood of subsequent judicial challenges to the rules peer review may also provide agencies with preview of likely objections to rule during the notice and comment phase thereby allowing them to minimize any w eaknesses and respond quickly to adverse comments all of thes factors would have to be considered in any evaluation of the effect of peer review on the regulatory process httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680 crs31

bulletin selection of peer reviewers independence and balancepeer reviewers should not have participated in the development of the work product agency shall strive to appoint experts who are independent of the agency and do not possess real or perceived conflicts of interest one of the factors to consider in determining independence is whether the individual is currently receiving or seeking substantial funding from the agency through contract or research grant also consider whether the individual has previously advocated position on the specific matter at issue also consider whether the individual has conducted multiple peer reviews for the same agency in recent years if obtaining the appropriate expertise requires selecting reviewer with an apparent bias agencies should ensure that another reviewer with contrary bias is selectedsame as proposed bulletin agency or entity selecting the reviewers must bar participation by scientists employed by the agency sponsoring the review unless the reviewers service as peer reviewer defines the government employment ie special government employees however research grants that were awarded to scientists based on investigatorinitiated competitive peer reviewed proposals generally do not raise issues as to independence or conflicts similar provision agencies should avoid repeated use of the same reviewer on multiple assignments unless his or her participation is essential similar provisionreviewers shall not have participated in development of work product essentially the same as revised but adds exception for the rare case where the agency determines that premier government scientist 1 is employed in different agency of cabinetlevel department 2 is not in position of management or policy responsibility and 3 possesses essential expertise that cannot be obtained elsewhere similar provisionagencies shall avoid repeated use of the same reviewer unless participation is essential and cannot be obtained elsewhere similar provisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32680 crs33 issue proposed bulletin revised bulletin final bulletin agencies should avoid repeated use of the same reviewer on multiple assignments selection of peer review mechanism significant or influential informationagencies should select an appropriate peer review mechanism eg review within agency or formal review by independent body based on the novelty and complexity of the science to be reviewed the benefit and cost implications and any controversy regarding the sciencesame as proposed bulletin essentially the same criteria but also 1 the importance of the information to decisionmakers 2 the extent of prior peer review and 3 the factors regarding transparency see below public comments agencies are required to provide an opportunity for other interested agencies and persons to submit comments and must ensure that such comments are provided to the peer reviewers with ample time for consideration before the peer reviewers conclude their review and prepare their reportagencies are allowed but not required to obtain comments on draft scientific assessments if they do so they must whenever practical provide summary or compilation of those comments that address significant scientific and technical issues when there is sufficient public interest agencies must consider establishing public comment period on the peer reviewers draft report and sponsoring public meetingwhenever feasible and appropriate agencies are required to make the draft scientific assessment available to the public for comment when submitted for peer review and to sponsor public meeting if they do so agencies must whenever practical provide peer reviewers with access to the public comments alternatives to the bulletins proceduresno comparable language agencies may 1 rely on scientific information produced by nas 2 commission nas to peer review the information or 3 use an another procedure specifically
