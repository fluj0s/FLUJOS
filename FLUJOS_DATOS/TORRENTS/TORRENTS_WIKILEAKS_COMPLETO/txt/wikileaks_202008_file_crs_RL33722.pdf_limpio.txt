diarrhea and abdominal cramps within days of exposure an infection can lead to hus and in some cases death p ublic health laborator ies perform type of dna fingerprinting to determine whether sample taken from patient matches those taken from other patie nts and contaminated food during an outbreak the time from exposure to confirmation of an coli infection can take two to three weeks as the number of infections increase d an investigation that included fda cdc and state and local public health fficials was launched starting on september 14 and continuing into early october fda and cdc released nearly daily statements on the status of the investigation alerting the public to the number of cases states with confirmed cases spinach product reca lls agency actions and consumer advice on consumption of spinach products inve stigators were able to trace the outbreak back to several farm fields in the salinas valley of california while the investigation continues there is evidence th at nearby livestock feral pigs or other environmental sources may have contaminated one or more of the fields since the outbreak fda has advised grow ers of fresh produce that they need to develop and implement voluntary guidelines to pr event outbreaks of foodborne diseases fda has also announced that it will convene public meeting on the issue once the investigation is complete seve ral growers groups have called for their industry to use the best agricultural nd processing practices to prevent such outbreaks not least because losses to the industry from the spinach outbreak have been estimated at 100 million in october 2006 the house committee on energy and commerce asked fda to explain its role in detecting contaminat ed food particularly in the recent tainted spinach case the request sought details about the agencys food safety procedures used in emergency situations both proponents and opponents of the na tional uniformity for food act s 3128 hr 4167 have weighed in on how it would have affected the coli outbreak opponents believe that states ability to act would have been compromised while proponents claim that the legislation would not have affected state adulteration or inspection authorities legislators may address the recent coli outbreak during reauthorization of the farm bill in the 110th congress when the proposal for single food safety agency

of coli o157h7 infections associated with the c onsumption of tainted fresh spinach for several weeks the food and drug administr ation fda and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc investigated the situation as additional cases were identified nearly daily this report details the events as they unfolded and includes the number of cases the detection of the fi rst case and the process by which relevant agencies acted as subsequent cases were reported this report will be updated in response to any further developments background the public first became aware of new deadly strain of coli in 1982 during an outbreak associated with ground beef escherichia coli is bacterium normally found in the intestines of humans and animals most strains of coli are harmless several strains including serotype o157h7 may cause serious illness in humans though they are frequently found in livestock feces particularly in cattle manure in humans infection with coli o157h7 can cause diarrhea that is often bloody and accompanied by abdominal cramps fever may occur symptoms usually develop in two to four days but may emerge as quickly as day or up to week after exposure healthy adults can generally recover completely from infection within week some individuals however especi ally young children and the elderly can develop hemolytic ur emic syndrome hus as resu lt of infection hus can lead to serious kidney damage and even death in terms of treatment antibiotics are not indicated and may be harmful due to the severity of illness treatment of these infections often requires hos pitalization patients who ex perience kidney failure may need dialysis for the remainder of this report coli will refer to the coli o157h7 strain implicated in the spinach outbreak the process of coli case confirmation the cases of coli linked to spinach consumption as discussed in this report are confirmed meaning that victims have been shown by laboratory analysis of specimens to be infected with the organism there are number of reasons why confirmation may not occur for all vic tims of an outbreak though for serious illnesses such as coli the proportion of cases that ar investigated with laboratory testing is generally higher than with milder foodborne illness the time from the beginning of patients illness to confirmation of whether the patient is part of

typically takes from two to three weeks in the case of the coli outbreak in spinach the average time for conf irmation of cases was about 15 days1 in most cases of coli infection public health labor atories in states and some cities perform type of dna fingerprinting on coli samples investigators determine whether the dna fingerprinting pa ttern of the bacterium from one patient is the same as that from other infected patients and from conta minated food bacteria with the same dna fingerprint are likel to have come from the same source series of steps takes place between the point when patient is infected and the point when public health officials can conf irm whether the patient is part of an coli outbreak as result there is generally two to threeweek delay between the start of the illness and confirma tion of the patients connection to the outbreak this series breaks down as follows in the case of coli an incubation period from the time of eating contaminated food to the beginning of the first symptoms is typically two to four days the time from the first symptom until the person seeks medical care when diarrhea sample is collected for testing is generally one to five days the process of laboratory diagnosis which begins when patient provides sample and coli is subsequently obtained from the sample usually takes one to three days the time required to ship coli bacteria from laboratory to state public health authorities who will perform dna fingerprinting may take up to week depending on the transportation system w ithin state and the distance between clinical laboratory and public health department the time required for state public health officials to perfo rm dna fingerprinting on an coli sample and compare it with an outbreak pattern is ideally one day however with limited staff and space in public health laboratories during peri od when other emergencies may occur the process can take up to four days state health departments typically report laboratoryc onfirmed cases of foodborne illness to cdc on re gular basis during seri ous interstate outbreaks such as the coli outbreak linked to spinach state health department s would typically notify cdc of newly confirmed cases on daily basis to facilitate swift nationwide investigation in general disease reporting by states to cdc is voluntary but it may be required as condition of federal funding for certain state public health systems such as the pulsenet system described below the systems used to monitor foodborne illnesses the tracking and reporting of foodborne illnesses are c onducted in several ways pulsenet is national network of public health and food laboratories coordinated by the cdc the networ k consists of labs in state and local health department s and

illness with spinach consumption was based only on epidemiologic evidence the common finding among victims who were interviewed of history of recent spinach consumption september 14 2006 fda and cdc issued the first of nearly three weeks of daily consumer alerts about an coli outbreak in several st ates that was believed to be associated with the consumption of fresh produce at the time preliminary epidemiological evidence pointed to bagged fresh spinach as the possible cause of the outbreak fda advised consumers to avoid consuming bagged spinach it is notable that this productwide advisory was made based sole ly on epidemiologic evidence since at this point the outbreak or ganism had not yet been identified in any spinach products the agencies advised individuals who believed that they had experienced symptoms of illness after consuming bagged spinach to contact their physicians and physicians were urged to report suspected cases of coli infection to local and state public health officials as soon as possible the federal agencies reported that they were working with state and local agencies to determine the cause and scope of the outbreak eight states had reported

november 2 2006 several major supermarkets told growers that they had six weeks to establish new safety rules to prevent coli outbreaks13 t h consortium of stores vons ralphs and albertsons gr ocery chains and the costco wholesale corporation wanted growers to work with federal regulators academia and industry research scientis ts to standardize food safe ty requirements the group also called for process for updating food sa fety rules in response to the emergence of research findings on how diseases are spread from the farm to the dinner table if growers failed to achieve more stringent and enforceable farming practices the consortium indicated that it was prepared to set up its own certification system related congressional activities on october 24 2006 the house committee on energy and commerce asked fda to explain its role in detectin g contaminated food particularly the coli strain that tainted spinach in september 200614 the request asked fo r detailed information about the agencys food contamination preparedness and terrence assessment conducted in 2004 and how the assessment was being used in emergencies like the 2006 coli outbreak the committees letter asked the agency for the types of food commodities selected for vulnerability assessments under its 2004 assessment known as the fda security surveillance ssignment fssa and how the data were collected and analyzed fssa was conduc ted to determine the safety of food at special security events such as the g8 summit and the national political conventions the recent coli outbreak led opponents of the national uniformity for food act s 3128 hr 4167 which is scheduled to come before the senate in the closing days of the 109th congress to call for rejection of the bill the association of food and drug officials fdo has indicated that stat ability to react to future bacterial outbreaks would be compromise d while fda does not have authority to mandate recalls for most of the foods it re gulates the states generally do have this authority proponents of the bill argue that the legislation would not affect state adulteration or inspection au thorities supporters believe that state food regulators are simply wrong to say that the legisla tion standardizing food warning labels would have hindered states ability to recall spinach see crs report rl33559 food safety national uniformity for food act by donna v porter for further informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33722crs14 the house and senate agriculture co mmittees may address the recent outbreak of foodborne illness that occurred as result of spinach contaminated by coli possibly from animal manure when they take up reauthorization of the farm bill in the 110th congress some members have been longtime critics of the division of food safety responsibilities between usda which regulates m eat poultry and processed egg products and fda whic h regulates all other food products proposal for single food safety agency with increased powers may become pa rt of the debate while not mentioned in fda s reports of its investiga tion it is likely that the investigation was streamlined as result of certain new authorities granted to fda in comprehensive bioterrorism and public health preparedness gislation in the 107th congress pl 107188 the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 gave fda the aut hority to require that food processing facilities register with the agency which had not been previously required in addition processors were required to maintain records that fda could use to facilitate product tracebacks during outbreak investigations including in their records information about the source of in gredients coming into their facilities one step back and the customers to whom th ey shipped products one step forward final observations the federal and state systems for tracking and investigating the bacterial outbreak seem to have worked well once the clusters of coli infections were recognized in several states investigators were able to trace back to the likely location and source of the problem throug h mix of epidemiologic and laboratory investigation and multiagency coordi nation the fda and cdc provided alerts to the public and to health officials nd continued to do so through daily updates in addition cdc held conference call for 800 health care professionals on the investigation of the outbreak coli testing and trea tment of patients weak point in the system seems to be how best to intercept coli contamination before it enters the food chain while procedures are in pl ace to enhance the safety of meat products the vol untary federal guidelines for leafy greens seem to be ineffective or not fully impleme nted by growers and processors plans to develop more effective system announced by the produce industry may address this weakness in the food chain however ma ndatory requirements may need to be implemented by regulators to assure the public that leafy greens are safe for consumption while funding through market orders has been proposed by one group the question of whether this source of fundi ng or another source is used remains to be resolved oversight of the produce safety system will likely be needed in the final analysis the specific cause of the california spinach coli outbreak may never be known investig ators were able to devel op fairly good idea of how the contamination and outbreak occurred thanks to identifying information on bagged spinach and dna fingerprinting technol ogy while livestock and feral pigs were shown to be carriers of the implicated coli strain the precise pathway byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33722crs15 which the spinach became contaminated is as yet unclear best agricultural practices and haccp in processing ope rations are likely to help in preventing such outbreaks in the future
