sensitive but ltnclas sified 6112 1600 draft elements of possible initiative introduction the united states has had to adapt in many ways to new kind of global war as we learn more from experience the president has offered vision of new institutions to sustain our effort for years to come new department of homeland security transformed department of defense refocused and restructured intelligence community different kind of fbi these are just some examples of the way our goverrlment has been adjusting to new era in world politics with presidential leadership americas strategies and institutions continue to evolve in coming weeks and months we will be describing fresh approach to our overall strategy including the role of transformational diplomacy so that we can build up constructive altematives to violent extremism one of the issues in this new kind of war is what to do with the suspected terrorists captured by our side including our allies in the weeks after the mass murder of americans on 9lll the us government quickly devised some initial procedures to support urgent military operations in afghanistan and the intelligence and law enforcement efforts we were making around the world other governments around the world are now also struggling to cope with this challenge the dilemmas are not easy the individuals come from many countries and are often captured far from their original homes some of them are effectively stateless owing allegiance only to the extremist cause of transnational terrorist movement some are extremely dangerous some have information that may save lives perhaps even thousands of lives they do not fit readily into any existing system of criminal or military justice and while balancing the danger these individuals may present they must be treated humanely consistent with our values and the values of the free world sensitive but linclassifiedsensitive but ltnclas sified learning from experience the us will now lead in designing an international system for handling captured combatants in this new kind of global conflict outcomes an effective system for handling terrorists and terrorist suspects captured in this global war those who cannot properly be accommodated in the usual criminal process must be durable politically legally and within the coalition joining us in the fight it should therefore aim at the following outcomes hold the detainees who pose high risk of returning to the war and killing innocents and interrogate detainees who may have significant lifesaving intelligence bring to justice those detainees who have committed war crimes crimes against humanity like the mass murder of innocents gain broad sustainable understanding and acceptance from the american people and from the nations that join us in the worldwide coalition asainst violent extremism pass muster for years to come under american law and relevant standards of international law give workable clear and unambiguous guidelines for the professional and humane conduct expected from those who will operate the system necessities of new kind of war in briefly summarizing how the current system evolved it is important to convey the dilemmas the government faced in conducting the necessary combat intelligence and law enforcement operations after 9lll sensitive but unclassifiedsensitive but tinclas sified 3 the standard system for criminal justice does not fit the traditional formal system for prisoners of war does not apply the potential dangers of followon attacks were and are very real but thanks in part to the successes of the first phases in this global war we have now learned more about the enemy and can refine our approach for example hundreds of those originally detained at guantanamo have been returned to their home countries where some of them have been released the us has instituted procedures to review every case and nalrow down the number of individuals who must be detained either by us or others wherever possible we are returning individuals to their home country some of these countries though like the us are still struggling to design legal alrangements that can adapt to this challenge as in the civilian world of parole for violent criminals the us is accepting some risk in the process of transfer and release some of those released have already returned to the fight nevertheless the us will hold only those individuals who present high risk and will not or cannot be held by anyone else common values common standards the new kind of war forced the united states to develop new procedures as other nations face this challenge too the us will work with its key allies in this war to develop common approaches each nation will have its own specific procedures foreign terrorist fighting in afghanistan could be captured by afghans americans australians italians or forces from dozen other countries regardless of such chance elements the treatment of prisoner sensitive but inclas sifiedsensitive but tinclas sified 4 should be built on foundation of common values and basic standards system that is reasonably interoperable the president will therefore appoint special board which could be his existing foreign intelligence advisory board with the following charge recommend policy and legal foundation to the president that he can propose to the congress as basis for any needed legislation and that he can also use as basis for international discussion review general us government detainee policy and operations bvaluate issues of effectiveness and intelligence value recommend balanced path for detention and treatment that will achieve the longterm outcomes listed above the policies of government agencies other than dod cannot be walled off that wall will inevitably be broken anyway probably soon it is better that this administration do it and do it early in the second term so that the review is constructive and forwardlooking and form part of this presidents worldwide strategy against violent extremism the us will thus work with its key allies to agree upon common international foundation for national practice in the interim while lasting foundation is being developed the us needs clear guidelines applicable and interoperable worldwide for detention and treatment of captured enemy combatants in this global war as an interim approach the us will choose as matter of policy to treat such captives once they move into the regular detention system as if they were civilian detainees under the law of war this is the system generally being used by our forces in iraq we thus accept the applicability of the baseline article 3 that appears in all four of the geneva conventions on the law of war we would thus also draw upon the standards in the fourth geneva convention on the law of war sensitive but linclas sifiedsensitive but tnclas sified we are not saying that these detainees are necessarily entitled to this status to be clear we are giving tfiem temporary status tiey do not deserve but we are not doing this for them we are doing it for us adopting this interim approach allows us to handle the detainees on well understood basis that gives our forces clear unambiguous guidelines for conduct we are already applying these standards in our deadliest counterterrorism fight today the effective significance of the change is relatively modest given our experience and the procedures that have already evolved for screening custody interrogation and disposition in guantanamo afghanistan and iraq but the impact of the change and the clear alignment with geneva could be farreaching by harmonizingthese systems we will be better able to explain what we are already doing combatant status review tribunals administrative review boards etc this interim approach also is one that civilian courts are more likely to understand they will longer feel they must intervene to fill legal vacuum instead they will see an established framework to which civilian courts have traditionallv deferred this interim approach also is one that americans and the world are more likely to understand and accept as reasonable this interim approach allows our military and intelligence officials to conduct immediate postcapture interrogations on special basis in every country individuals are held temporarily away from public scrutiny often after just after they are apprehended in order to conduct humane but effective questioning and gather information while it is most current and operations on both sides are still ongoing this postcapture intelligence system will continue in small number of selected cases it will last for defined period measured in days or weeks not months or years in manner authorized and reviewed sensitive but tnclas sifiedsensitive but unclas sified 6 by senior civilian officials designated for this purpose by the president there is risk that some intelligence may be lost when enemy captives are ultimately placed in less coercive regular detention system as in our prior wars this risk should be recognized but accepted as necessary to maintain the integrity of the system and our common fundamental values the postcapture intelligence system may actually be more sustainable over the longhaul if it includes an appropriate transition stage so that people can be moved on to durable detention system as part of this interim system and as the number of detainees goes down the us will longer need to maintain detention facility in guantanamo that facility will close and we expect to transfer remaining detainees to facility in the united states training and accountability the us entered this new kind of war without large numbers of experts trained in the custody and interrogation of terrorists captured from across the world since then the us has learned from experience and has developed much stronger and more effective professional standards for the conduct of effective interro gations the us will establish stronger baselines of common training across the military departments across different federal agencies and reaching out to allies that share our interest in conducting effective humane interrogations of dangerous suspects abuses have occurred in detention and interrogations the us believes in holding those who have acted improperly accountable for their misconduct that process is already well underway one general officer has been relieved of command and demoted 15 individuals have been convicted by court martial sensitive but linclassifiedsensitive but tnclas sified 35 more have been referred to trial by court martial 84 more have received nonjudicial punishments and 44 more have been reprimanded or discharged hundreds of criminal investigations have either been completed or are continuing there have been at least ten major reviews assessments inspections and investigations of detention and interrogation operations nonetheless we recognize the interest in an investigation conducted outside of the departments and agencies involved the presidential board described above will therefore also be asked to assess past and ongoing department and agency investigations to insure their completeness and accuracy and to recommend processes for the future transparency if the us acts as if it has something to hide americans and the world will assume it does durable system for handling captured terrorist suspects will be conducted in manner that can withstand outside scrutiny further the mystery can be dispelled in way that builds understanding for the system and for the dilemmas each country must face if it joins in fighting these violent transnational organizations once individuals move into the longerterm detention system the system should be accessible to outside visits by properly orgarized representatives of relevant international institutions the press and foreign governments justice some individuals detained by the united states have committed war crimes crimes against humanity these individuals should finally be brought to justice sensitive but linclas sifiedsensitive but unclas sified military commissions should be limited to major criminals clearly guilty of war crimes we should stop using the system to try small fry otherwise the coinage is debased we trivialize the meaning of war crimes massive work has already occuffed to prepare for trial of conspirators in the 9ll1 attack this information has been gathered by the fbi by the cia and other intelligence agencies by the moussaoui prosecution team and by the 9171 commission among others khalid sheikh mohammed and others in custody should be brought to trial by military commission the presidents mititary commission order should be revised in various ways already being worked on by the interagency process to learn from experience and stand up under the kind of attention these trials will receive as these individuals are brought to trial aspects of their detention and interrogation will come to light this is fact it must be faced better to face it now and by this administration these individuals should be brought to justice we should not assume they can just be secretly detained for the rest of their lives without trial visible justice for the worst crime in american history cannot both begin and end with the strange case of zacarias moussaoui we place war criminals on trial not just for their benefit but for the larger purposes of our own society and civilization the basic facts about the treatment of some of these high value detainees are already known despite any initial publicity placing them on trial is ultimately the surest way of keeping these individuals from becoming objects of sympathy and reminding the world of what these people did sensitive but linclassifiedsensitive but unclas sified 9 again the american people will understand the need to hold individuals temporarily under special circumstances our intelligence system can continue but that intelligence system should allow genuine war criminals to receive the justice they deserve sensitive but iinclassified
