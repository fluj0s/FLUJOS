versions of hr 4 included provisions that sought to improve the cs program and raise collections so as to increase the economic independence of former welfare families and provide stable source of income for all singleparent families with noncustodial parent both versions of the bill provided incentives in the form of federal cost sharing to states to direct more of the child support coll ected on behalf of families to the families themselves thereby reducing the amount th at state and federa l governments retain often referred to as familyfirst policy under both bills families currently receiving tanf benefits as well as form er tanf recipients would have potentially received larger share of child suppor t that was collected on their behalf the approach used by the bills differed significantly however with regard to how states would help tanf families receive more child support under the house passed bill states would have been given federal cost sharing incentives to encourage states to increase or blish the amount of child support payments they pass through to tanf families and disregard in determining tanf benefits the senate finance committee version of the bill provided federal costsharing for the entire amount that the state di sregards and passes through to families moreover the housepassed bill provided more limited amount of federa l cost sharing for state passthrough and disregard policies than the senate finance committee bill both versions of the bill would have revised some cse enforcement tools and added others increased funding for the

fy1978 and fy2003 child support payments collected by cse agencies increased from 1 billion in fy1978 to 212 billion in fy2003 and the number of children whose paternity was tablished or acknowledged increased byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32258crs2 1274 from 111000 to 1525 million however the program still collects only 18 of child support obligations for which it has responsibility and collects payments for only 50 of its caseload moreover ocse data indicate that in fy2003 paternity had been established or acknowledged for about 77 of the nearly 10 million children on the cse caseload without legally identified fathers total expenditures for the cse program were 5213 billion in fy2003 of this total the federal share of state and local administr ative costs of the program was 3448

fail to financially support children who reside with cust odial parents in another st ate or who flee across state lines to avoid supporting them pl 104193 required states to implement expedited procedures that allow them to secure assets to satisfy an arrearage by intercepting or seizing periodic or lump sum payments such as unemployment and workers compensation lottery winnings awards judgements or settleme nts and assets of the debt or parent held by public or private retirement funds and financial institutions it required states to implement procedures under which the state would

orders financing the federal government currently reimburses each state 66 of the cost of administering its cse program it also re funds states 90 of the laboratory costs of establishing paternity in addition the fe deral government pays states an incentive payment to encourage them to operate ffective programs pl 104193 required the hhs secretary in consultation with the st ate cse directors to develop new cost neutral system of incentive payments to states pl 105200 the child support performance and incentive act of 1998 blished new costneutral incentive payment system1 the statutory limit of cse incentive payments for fy2004 is 454 million hr 4 major provisions related to child support enforcement background over the years the cse program has evolved into multifaceted program while costrecovery still remains an important function of the program other aspects of the program include service delivery and promotion of selfsufficiency and parental responsibility even when one of th parents is longer living in the home the cse program has helped strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on consistent and continuing basis and by helping some families to remain selfsufficient and off public assistance by providing the requisite cse services child support payments now are generally recognized as very important income source for singleparent families on average child support constitutes 17 of family inco for households that receive it 2001 data among poor families who receive it child suppor t constitutes about 30 of family income 2001 data2 both versions of hr 4 sought to improve the cse program and raise collections so as to increase the economic independence of former welfare families and provide stable source of income for all singleparent families with noncustodial parent although both versions of the bill shared identical objectives with respect to simplifying cse assignment and distribution rules and strengthening the familyfirst policies st arted in the 1996 welfare reform law the approaches used differed both versions of the bill revised some cse enforcement tools andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32258crs4 added others the senateappr oved version of hr 4 included larger list of cse provisions than did the housepassed bill this section of the report does not disc uss all of the cse provisions included in hr 4 for description of all of th cse provisions in hr 4 as passed by the house and approved by the senate finance committee see table 1 in the last section of this report which provides sidebyside bill comparison assignment of child support rights as condition of receiving tanf bene fits family must assign their child support rights to the state assignment rules determine who s legal claim on the child support payments owed by the nonc ustodial parent the child support assignment covers any child support th at accrues while the family receives tanf benefits as well as any child support that accrued before the family started receiving tanf benefits assigned child support collections are not paid to families but rather this revenue is kept by states and the federal government as partial reimbursement for welfare benefits nonwelfare families who apply for cse services do not assign their child support righ ts to the state and thereby receive all of the child support collected on their behalf an extremely important feature of the ssignment process is the date on which an assignment was entered if the assign ment was entered on or before september 30 1997 then preassistance and duringa ssistance arrearages are permanently assigned to the state if the assign ment was entered on or after october 1 1997 then only the arrearages which accumulate while the family receives assistance are permanently assigned the familys preassistance arrearages are temporarily assigned and the right to those arrearages goes back to the family when it leaves tanf unless the arrearages are collected through the federal income tax refund offset program hr 4 as passed by the house did not make any changes regarding the child support assignment rules in contrast under hr 4 as approved by the senate finance committee the child support assign ment would have onl covered any child support that accrued while the family received tanf benefits this meant that any child support arrearages that accrued be fore the family started receiving tanf benefits would not have to be assigned to the state even temporarily and thereby any child support collected on be half of the formertanf family for preassistance arrearages would have gone to the family distribution of child support distribution rules determine the order in which child support collections are paid in accordance with the assignment rules in other words the distribution rules determine which claim is paid first when child support collection occurs the order of payment of the child support coll ection is of trem endous impor tance b ecause in many cases pastdue child support i arrearages are never fully paidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32258crs5 3 under old law the first 50 of

child support collections pl 104 193 required states to pay the federal gove rnment the federal governments share of child support collections collected on behalf of tanf families this means that the state and not the federal government b ears the entire cost of any child support passed through to and disregarded by fa milies as of august 2004 21 states were continuing the 50 or higher in several st ates passthrough and disregard policy that had been in effect pre19964 both versions of hr 4 would have pr ovided incentives in the form of federal cost sharing to states to direct more of the child support collected on behalf of tanf families to the fa milies themselves as opposed to using such collections to reimburse state and federal coffers for welfare benefits paid to the families often referred to as familyfirst policy however the approaches of the bills differed with respect to the limitation on the federal costsharing and whether to help states pay for the current cost of their cse passthrough and disr egard policies or to encourage states to establish such policies or increase the passthrough and disregard already in place hr 4 as passed by the house would have allowed states to increase the amount of collected child support they pay to fa milies receiving tanf benefits and would not have required the state to pay the fe deral government the federal share of the increased payments the subsidized child support passthrough payments would have been the amount above any payments the state was making on december 31 2001 in other words the h ousepassed bill intended to increase the amount of child support that was passed through to tanf fa milies and disregarded by the state the housepassed bill would have limited the new payments to the greater of 100 per month or 50 per month more than the state previously was sharing with the family in order for the federal government to share in the cost of an increase in the child support passthrough the state would ve been required to disregard ie not count the child support collection paid to the family in determining the familys tanf benefithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32258crs6 5 as mentioned above these rules do not pply to child support collections obtained by intercepting federal income tax refunds if child support arrearages are collected via the federal income tax refund offset program th law stipulates that the state and federal government are to retain those collectionsunlike the housepassed bill under the bill approved by th senate finance committee the federal government would have shared in the costs of the entire amount of current passthrough and disregar d policies used by states hr 4 as approved by the senate finance committee would have allowed states to pay up to 400 per month in child support collected on behalf of tanf or foster care family 600 per month to family with tw or more children to the family and would not have required the state to pay th federal government the federal share of those payments in order for the federal g overnment to share in the cost of the child support passthrough the state would have b een required to disregard ie not count the child support collection paid to the family in determining the familys tanf benefit former tanf families pursuant to the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104 193 beginning on october 1 2000 states mu st distribute to former tanf families the following child support collections first before the state and the federal government are reimbursed this is often referred to as the familyfirst policy 1 all current child support 2 any ch ild support arrearages that accrue after the family leaves tanf these arrearages are called neverassigned arrearages plus 3 any arrearages that accrued before the family began receiving tanf benefits5 any child support arrearages that accrue during the time the family is on tanf belong to the state and federal government one of the goals of the 1996 welfare reform law with regard to cse distribution provisions was to create distribution priority that favored families once they leave the tanf rolls thus generally speaking under current law child support that accrues before and after family receives tanf goes to the family whereas child support that accrues while the family is receiving tanf go to the state this additional family income is expected to reduce dependence on public assistance by both promoting exit from tanf and preventing entry and reentry to tanf hr 4 as passed by the house would have given states the option of distributing to former tanf families the full amount of child support collected on their behalf ie both current support and all child s upport arrearages including arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program under the house passed bill the federal government would ve shared with the states the costs of paying child support arrearages accrued wh ile the family received tanf as well as costs associated with passing through to the family child support collected through the federal income tax ref und offset program if the state chose the familyfirst option similarly hr 4 as approved by the
