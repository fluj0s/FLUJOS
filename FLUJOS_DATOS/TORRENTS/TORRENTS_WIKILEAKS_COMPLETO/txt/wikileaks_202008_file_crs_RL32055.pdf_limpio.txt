legislation in the 108th congress summary climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions were an issue in the 108th congress as they were over the preceding d ecade bills directly addressing climate change issues ranged from those focused primarily on climate change research hr 1578 and s 1164 to comprehensive emissions cap and trading programs for all six greenhouse gases s 139 and hr 4067 additional bills focused on ghg reporting and registries hr 6 senatepassed hr 1245 s 17 and s 194 or on power plant emissions of carbon dioxid hr 2042 s 139 s 366 and s 843 these climate change bills differed within and across categories among the climate change research bills there were common and divergent research focuses for example few bills including s 139 and s 1164 would have directed research on historical instances of climate change to develop climate change models additional bills focused on research to examine vulnerabilities to climate change in the united states particularly with resp ect to human health environmental and economic outcomes furthermore some bills would have promoted research on political and technological opti ons to reduce ghg emissions among the six bills with ghg reporting nd registry requirements there were also differences the primary differe nce between reporting bills was how each determined which entities mu st report hr 6 senate version hr 1245 hr 4067 and s 139 would have established ghg emission th resholds usually around 10000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equi valent per year above which an entity must submit records of its ghg emissions however hr 6 and hr 1245 excluded farms from the reporting requirement the remaining bills s 17 and s 194 would have tasked the administrator of the environmental protection agency epa with establishing the threshold requirement there were also similarities and differences between cap and trade bills specifically hr 2024 s 366 and s 843 w ould have focused on fossil fuelfired electric generating facilities while s 139 and hr 4067 woul d have covered broader array of sources furthermor hr 2024 s 366 and s 843 would have capped one ghg carbon dioxide while s 139 and hr 4067 would have capped all six ghgs this report briefly discusses basic concepts on which these bills were based and compares major provisions of the bills in each of the following categories climate change

since 1992 when the united states ratif ied the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc number of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertak in the united states to decrease greenhouse gas emissions most of these po licies have been blished primarily to achieve energy or environmental goals wh ile also having the effect of reducing ghg emissions1 in the 108th congress numerous bills were intr oduced that directly or indirectly addressed climate change most bills focused on energy efficiency energy conservation or nonfossil fuels however the focus of this report is on bills that directly addressed climate change not on bills that would have had indirect or ancillary impacts on greenhouse gas emissions this report describes and compares climaterelated bills which fall into three major categories 1 those that would have established climate change research programs to further examine the origins and effects of climate change hr 62 hr 1578 hr 4067 s 17 s 139 and s 1164 2 those that would have establishe d ghg monitoring systems as basis for research or for any future reduction program hr 6 hr 1245 hr 4067 s 17 s 139 and s 194 and 3 those that would have established marketbased programs to directly limit emissions of co2 the primary greenhouse gas hr 2024 s 139 hr 4067 s 366 and s 843 the major provisions of these bills are categorized in appendix 1 and summarized in appendix 2 while the body of this report describes what each bill would have done none of these bills became law in the 108th congress if members wish to enact similar legislation in the 109th congress or later new bills must be introduced climate change research bills global climate change is complex issue while most scientists agree that the climate

and would have identified options to achieve those aims research provisions in broader bills in addition to the research bills hr 1578 and s 1164 four bills hr 6 hr 4067 s 17 and s 139 included climate change research provisions as part of broader climate change bill specifically research in hr 6 would have focused on climate change mitigation technology climate change adaptation and resolving scie ntific and economic uncertainty the research provisions in s 17 focused on national assessment of climate change impacts and review of methods to addre ss climate change research under s 139 would have focuse d on technology transfer barriers the impact of the kyoto protocol on the united states climate change impacts and possible methods to reduce ghg emissions the research provisions of hr 4067 were similar to those under s 139 except th at hr 4067 did not address technology transfer or the impacts to the kyoto prot ocol and added section on agricultural

the administrator of the epa establish national ghg database and develop methods and standards to measure and verify ghg emissions in addition to their different ghg repor ting strategies these bills

three other bills hr 2042 s 366 and s 843 would have focused on reducing carbon dioxide from electric utilities each of these bills would have used marketbased trading mechanisms to limit ghg emissions cap and tr ade programs set strict limits on specific emissions from particular group of sources allowing individual sources to trade reductions this flexibility in who makes reductions l eads to lower costs one method is to allocate emissions allowances to each source allowances can be bought or sold in wellfunctioning market entities that f ace relatively low emissionreduction costs
