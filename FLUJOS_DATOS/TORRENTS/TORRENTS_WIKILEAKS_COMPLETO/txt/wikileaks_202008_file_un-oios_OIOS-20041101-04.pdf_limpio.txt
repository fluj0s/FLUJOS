to be exercised in consultation with the controller 8 at the time of audit unog had not sought rene wal of the authority for its coc under the new financial rule 10513 b oios s been informed that dm is currently preparing an stai to that effect in the meantime to avoid operating without formal legal basis unog should seek from the asgocss and the c ontroller confirmation of its authority to operate its committee on contracts 9 furthermore the revised procurement manual paragraph 3244 issued in february 2004 had established threshold levels for offices away from headquarters oahs the threshold levels for oahs is 200000 or less with different values delegated to different categories of procurement officers of equivalent ra nks at headquarters according to the delegation under the old financial rule 11017 c unog coc considered all cases above 150000 without sending them to the headq uarters committee on contracts hcc under the revised financial rules and rev ised the procurement manual unog should obtain from the asgocss and the contro ller the applicable threshold levels to unog and seek confirmation of the existing syste m of deciding all the cases above these levels recommendation head2right the division of administration of unog should seek from the asgocss and the controller confirmation of the egation of authority to establish the unog coc and the applicable thresh old levels in conformity with the new financial rule 10513 b and the revised 3 procurement manual rec 01 10 unog stated that the delegation of authority was be ing finalized by hqs and should reach shortly oios would record as implemented the recommendatio n on the receipt and verification of the delegation of authority 2 composition of the committee 11 unog office instruction 6rev7 of 1986 stipula tes that the coc shall be composed of five members ie the director division of adm inistration doaunog as the chairperson the chief budget management systems s erviceunog also the alternate chairperson the chief of general servicesunog t he director programme support services division of unctad and the principal legal officerunog as members each member is required to designate to the doa one or t wo alternates belonging to hisher service the dg approved the nomination of the regu lar members and their alternates however periodic changes to the composition of the coc were made on adhoc basis without formal notification and the oi of 1986 remained out dated unog stated that several attempts have been made since 1986 to review and update the membership and procedure of the committee on contracts and the hcc was approached on several occasions for advice these initiatives have not been successful 12 currently the coc is composed of the doa as th chairperson the chief of frmsunog also the alternate chairperson the hea d programme planning and assessmentunctad the chief central support servi ces cssunog and the senior legal affairs officerunog as members the four ternates include the chief participation entitlements and contributions secti onunjspf the chief of finance sectionunog the chief of claims payment and compe nsation fund administrationuncc and the chief buildings and engineering sectionun og oios noted that the unog coc is chaired by d2 and includes three d1s and p5 considering the relatively small number of cases handled by the coc and comparing the compo sition of the unog coc with those of the hcc and of the unov coc oios is not convinced that the unog coc requires such number of senior staff members the hcc which hand significantly higher number of cases and volume in financial terms is chaired by full time chairman only at p5 level while the unov coc is chaired by staff member at the d1 level and other members are at p5 level oios therefore believes that the unog co c should be chaired by staff member at the d1 level with other members at d1 or lower levels 13 furthermore the current membership needs to be revised to be broaderbased and to provide adequate representation to the various divi sions and other entities covered by the unog coc it reviews cases relating to unctad uncc ece ocha ohchr unfccc unccd and so on however the current compo sition of the coc included mostly staff members of the unog division of administratio n during the audit oios understood that the chief css had expressed his reservation bout his membership of the coc given his direct supervisory authority for the unog purchase and transportation section and given his role as one of the major requisitioners in view of these responsibilities he has not been attending the coc meetings oios concurs with his v iew and the proposed action by the doa to replace his membership in view of the above in oios opinion the composition of the coc should be revised 4 3 term of membership 14 while revising the coc composition unog needs to revise also the term of membership under the revised procurement manual 232 2 member of the hcc except the chairperson shall serve maximum term of three years renewable once after two successive appointments member shall w ait for at least period of one year before being reappointed to the hcc since unog coc is not local committee on contract lcc and has authority and responsibiliti similar to those of the hcc in oios opinion unog should adhere to this stipulation recommendation head2right the unog division of administration should revise t he composition of its coc to be broaderbased and incl ude members from various client offices at the d1 level or bel ow membership term should be aligned with the hcc term as stated in the revised procurement manual rec 02 15 unog agreed with the need to revise the membership of the committee and agreed in principle with the limitation of the duration of th membership however unog underlined the fact that in order to review properly the case s the members of the committee need to have thorough knowledge of the financial regulati ons and rules and of the principles governing procurement in addition individuals wit h the required background were sometimes reluctant to become members lest their p articipation in the committees would jeopardize the performance of their regular functio ns oios will retain the recommendation for followup relating to the revision of the compo sition of the coc 4 approval of coc recommendations 16 currently the recommendations of the coc relat ing to the cases reviewed are submitted to the dg of unog for approval the dg ma kes the final decision whether to accept or reject with recorded reasons the recomme ndations made by the coc in oios opinion with the implementation of the recommended revisions to the composition of the coc the director division of administration could discharge the responsibility to approve the coc recommendations this would also be in conf ormity with the new delegation of procurement authority envisaged in the new finan cial rule 10513 at unhq the asgocss on behalf of the usgdm makes the decisio n at unhcr decisions are made by the controller d2 level at unov the dg has delegated the authority to approve the recommendations of the coc to the director divisio n for management d2 level on the same lines oios believes that at unog the authorit should be delegated to the director division of administration recommendation head2right the directorgeneral unog should consider delegati ng the authority to approve the coc recommendations to the director division of administration subject to the recommended change i n the composition of the coc and the new delegation of procurement visaged in the new financial rule 10513 rec 03 5 17 unog stated that the directorgeneral concurred with the recommendation which will be implemented upon receipt of the new delegat ion of authority oios will retain the recommendation for followup of the implementatio n 5 the secretary of the coc 18 according to the draft revision of oi 6rev8 f 1998 the doa shall designate the secretary of the coc the main functions of the sec retary are arranging and coordinating coc meetings circulation of documentation draftin g the minutes and recommendations and maintaining permanent record of all the minutes and case presentations reviewed by the coc and so on the administrative officer in the office of the doa the chairperson has been designated as the secretary for better coordinatio n of coc functions unog while reconstituting the coc as recommended in this repor t should designate new secretary preferably from the office of the new chairperson in accordance with the provisions of the revised procurement manual 254 1 the secretary should have some procurement experience furthermore since adhoc rrangements were made when the regular secretary was not available regular alte rnate secretary of the coc needs to be assigned to ensure continuity of the functions 6 rules of procedures 19 the dg of unog establishes the coc through the issuance of office instructions oi the oi also provides brief guidelines regardi ng the composition functions and the procedures for the coc oios reviewed oi6rev7 da ted october 1986 and the subsequent draft revision oi6rev dated 8 july 1998 which is an internal twopage document that summarizes who can be designated as coc chairman an d membersalternates coc functions and procedures and is limited to stating that the secretary draws up of the minutes for approval by the directorgeneral the draft oi also states that the audit and management consulting division now the internal audit divisio n ii of oios shall be represented in the committee as an observer which is longer the ca as oios ceased to participate in the coc deliberations 20 in addition to the oi the secretary of the com mittee through memorandum in december 1993 established some procedures for the c oc subsequently in october 2002 the present secretary proposed new set of brief r ules of procedures which does not appear to have been adopted by the coc 21 in oios opinion the rules of procedures needs to be more comprehensive to effectively guide the functioning of the coc they should clearly define the composition of the coc the roles and responsibilities of the chai rperson and members various procedures and matters relating to the operations of the coc including convening of meetings quorum presenting and approval of cases the role of pts nd the requisitioning offices requirements for submission of cases emergency and expost fact cases and so on the rules of procedures should also clearly establish the delega tion of authority from unhq in oios view comprehensive rules of procedures would also enable the various user departments to have better understanding and appreciation of the functions of the coc moreover significant number of issues noticed during the aud it could be addressed by establishing and publishing comprehensive rules of procedures along similar provisions of section 12 of the revised procurement manual 6 recommendation head2right the unog division of administration in consultatio n with the chairperson of the headquarters committee on cts hcc should establish comprehensive rules of procedures for the functioning of the coc rec 04 22 unog agreed and stated that this recommendation wo uld be implemented alongside recommendations 2 and 3 upon receipt of the delega tion of authority oios will consider the recommendation as implemented on the receipt and ve rification of the new rules of procedures 7 training of members 23 it is essential that coc members have clear u nderstanding of the revisions in the financial regulations and rules as well as the p rocurement manual as well as the impact of these revisions on the members role in t he coc and the decision criteria for the coc thus the members of the coc and their alterna tes should be given the opportunity to attend workshop or short training programme on the revised financial regulations and rules governing procurement and the revised procurement manual in particular on the source selection process oios learnt that og purchase and transportation section is preparing short presentation for the benefit f the members of the coc in addition oios would suggest comprehensive workshop or training for the members oios recommended that unog should organise short training programm or workshop on the revised financial regulations and rules governing procureme nt and their implications on the functions of the coc unog stated that the training should be conducted b the chairman of the headquarters committee on contracts b operations of the coc 1 planning the case submissions 24 planning of the case submissions needs to be hanced to help ensure their proper and timely review by the coc most of the meetings wer held in the months of november and december and significant number of cases were rus hed during the meetings at the end of the year for example out of the 19 meetings held in 2003 six 32 per cent were held in november and december 2003 at these six meetings the coc considered 25 cases out of the total 63 cases 40 per cent for the whole year these rush cases provided only minimum time for scrutiny by the coc members although the coc has expressed its concerns time and again the issue remains to be addressed oios recognizes that the responsibility for timely submission mainly rests with the requisition ers nonetheless the chairperson of the coc needs to reiterate to them the importance of ap propriate procurement planning to give enough time for the coc to properly review their ca ses on time oios recommended that the requisitioners should be reminded to adequately pla n its requirements in advance so that the procurement and transportation section could comple the procurement process and submit the proposals for timely review by the coc unog stated that such reminder was provided verballyin writing informallyformally on reg ular basis to client offices 2 scheduling of meetings 25 according to the coc rules of the procedures of december 1993 and the proposed 7 rules of procedure of october 2002 the meetings of the coc would be held on tuesday afternoons however this fixed schedule was not ad hered to during the review period the meetings were organized on need basis on any day of the week although the caseload for the coc may not warrant regular weekly meetings in oios opinion it would be effective if the coc would meet on the tuesday of the week on wh ich the coc meeting is organized this would facilitate proper planning for the coc m embers staff members of pts and the secretary to organize distribute and consider the cases oios recommended that unog should reestablish the practice of meeting on sp ecific day to consider the cases unog stated that since members of the committee have oth er functions it was indeed desirable that meetings take always place on the same day of the w eek this being said and for the same reason they may not always be available on the pre established day in addition the committee should keep in mind the interest of the rganization and show some degree of flexibility in order to avoid blocking projects for strictly procedural reasons oios believes that the option of alternate members should be used effectively for scheduling meetings on preestablished days 3 attendance at the meetings 26 oios is satisfied that the quorum was always ma intained at the coc meetings and that at least three members were present at the meetings oios is also satisfied that the representatives of the purchase and transportation section and the representatives of the requisitioning offices were present during the meet ings to provide clarifications or additional information on the cases in 2001 the chairperson and two committee members the chief gss and the head programming planning assessment unctad attended most of the meetings however the attendance by the legal and the finance representatives was irregular at some meetings in 2002 and 2003 both the regular and their alternate members did not attend the meetings the frequent and adhoc change s in the membership during the review period were attributable to the lack of participati on by some members and the alternates as the coc is composed to include various expertise th at are needed to ensure proper and effective review of the cases presented oios belie ves that the presence of expert members or their alternates is necessary at all coc meetings oios recommended that unog should ensure that the expert members or their alternates regularly attend the meetings unog clarified that it was indeed highly desirable that expert members attend the meeting but it is not always possible in view of their other professi onal commitments unog also clarified that the committee was free to suspend the consider ation of any specific case and to refer it for legal or financial opinion if deemed necessary 4 documentation to the coc 27 oios found some shortcomings in the timeliness and the completeness of the documents submitted by the requisitioners and pts t the coc according to the revised procurement manual and the rules of procedures the proposed cases should be distributed to the members at least 48 hours in advance for the m eeting on tuesday afternoon the cases should be distributed by friday afternoon during t he discussions with the members oios learnt that this 48hour requirement was not adhere d to on several occasions when the cases were distributed only the day before the meeting g iving them minimum time to review the cases oios would like to reiterate adherence to th minimum 48hour requirement 28 regarding the completeness of the documents oi noted that there were certain 8 inadequacies there was clear format for the sub mission of the cases and at times important information was not provided or the neces sary documents like price evaluation was not properly clarified or the price comparison tabl were not properly validated during the discussions with the members oios learnt that at t imes the members were given large volume of documents that were not adequately refere nced and the members had to spend time to get to understand the presentation and the price calculations oios recommended that the purchase and transportation sectionunog should develop standard format for the submission of cases and ensure that case presentati ons submitted to the coc are concise and complete all submissions should be distributed to the coc members at least 48 hours in advance of the coc meeting unog stated that pts was in the process of establis hing an electronic version of its standard report format to enhance the processing of cases 5 minutes of the meetings 29 the secretary records drafts and submits the m inutes of the meetings to the chairperson who signs them as approved the secret ary then signs and forwards them to the dg for approval of the coc recommendations oios ted that the draft minutes were not circulated for review and comments of coc members w ho attended the meeting in oios opinion it is important that the draft minutes are circulated to all the members so that they could verify and comment about the contents of the minutes this would also avoid any misunderstanding and disagreement on the minutes t the hcc and at the unov coc members review the minutes before submission to the chairperson for his signature 30 regarding the contents the minutes only summar ized the issues that were discussed during the meeting unog stated that the minutes are comprehensive mmary of discussions and clarifications oios believes that the coc secretariat should ensur that the minutes include an account of the various issues di scussed in arriving at the recommendation of the coc oios is satisfied that the minutes of the coc were finalized within the stipulated days after the coc meeting oios recommended that the chairperson of the coc should ensure that before approval of the minutes of the c oc meetings comprehensive and detailed draft minutes are prepared and reviewed by all the members present during the meeting unog confirmed the minutes are now systematically c irculated to the committee members who were present at the meeting for their comments before they are submitted to the chairperson for approval v further actions required on recommendations 31 oios monitors the implementation of its audit r ecommendations for reporting to the secretarygeneral and to the general assembly the responses
