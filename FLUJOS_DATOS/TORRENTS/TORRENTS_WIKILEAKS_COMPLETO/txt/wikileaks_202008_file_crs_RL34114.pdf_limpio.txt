related to the power of congress to investigate generally speaking congresss authority to investigate and obtain information including but not limited to confidential information is extremely broad while there is express provision of the constitution or specific statute authorizing the conduct of congressional oversight or investigations the supreme court has firmly established that such power is essential to the legislative function as to be implied from the general vesting of legislative powers in congress the broad legislative authority to seek and enforce informational demands was unequivocally established in two supreme court rulings arising out of the 1920s teapot dome scandal in mcgrain v daugherty 1 which arose out of the exercise of the senates inherent contempt power the supreme court described the power of inquiry with the accompanying process to enforce it as an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function in sinclair v united states2 different witness at the congressional hearings refused to provide answers and was prosecuted for contempt of congress the witness had noted that lawsuit had been commenced between the government and the ma mmoth oil company and declared i shall reserve any evidence i may be able to give for those courts and shall respectfully decline to answer any questions propounded by your committee the supreme court upheld the witnesss conviction for contempt of congress the court considered and rejected in unequivocal terms the witnesss contention that the pendency of lawsuits provided an excuse for withholding information neither the laws directing that such lawsuits be instituted nor the lawsuits themselves operated to divest the senate or the committee of power further to investigate the actual administration of the land laws subsequent supreme court rulings have consistently reiterated and reinforced the breadth of congresss investigative authority for example in eastland v united states servicemen s fund 3 the court explained that the scope of congresss power of inquiry is as penetrating and far 1 273 us 135 17475 1927 2 279 us 263 1929 3 421 us 491 504 n 15 1975 quoting barenblatt v

to enact and appropriate under the constitution in addition the court in watkins v united states 4 described the breadth of the power of inquiry according to the court congresss power to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process that power is broad it encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes the court did not limit the power of congressional inquiry to cases of wrongdoing it emphasized however that congresss investigative power is at its peak when the subject is alleged waste fraud abuse or maladministration within government department the investigative power the court stated comprehends probes into departments of the federal government to expose corruption inefficiency or waste the first congresses held inquiries dealing with suspected corruption or mismanagement by government officials and subsequently in series of decisions the court recognized the danger to effective and honest conduct of the government if the legislative power to probe corruption in the executive branch were unduly hampered accordingly the court now clearly recognizes the power of the congress to inquire into and publicize corruption maladministration or inefficiencies in the agencies of government the inherent contempt power is not specified in statute or constitutional provision but has been deemed implicit in the constitutions grant to congress of all legislative powers in an inherent contempt proceeding the offender is tried at the bar of the house or senate and can be held in custody until such time as the contemnor provides the testimony or documents sought or until the end of the session inherent contempt was most often used as means of coercion not punishment statutory criminal contempt provision was first enacted by congress in 1857 in part because of the inadequacies of proceedings under the inherent power in cases of criminal contempt the offender is cited by the subcommittee the committee and the full house or senate with subsequent indictment by grand jury and prosecution by the us attorney criminal contempt unlike inherent contempt is intended as means of punishing the contemnor for non compliance rather than to obtain the information sought statutory civil contempt procedure applicable only to the senate was enacted in 1978 under that procedure witness who refuses to testify before senate committee or provide documents sought by the committee can after being served with court order be held in cont empt of court and incarcerated until he agrees to testify moreover the house and senate have authorized standing or special committees to seek civil enforcement of subpoenas

the english parliament and by the american colonial assemblies congresss first assertion of its contempt authority occurred in 1795 shortly after the ratification of the constitution at the time three members of the house of representatives reported that they had been offered what they interpreted to be bribe by men named robert randall and charles whitney the house of representatives interpreted these allegations as sufficient evidence of an attempt to corrupt its proceedings and reported resolution ordering their arrest and detention by the sergeantatarms pending further action by the house the matter was then referred to special committee on privileges which reported out resolution recommending that formal proceedings be instituted against messrs randall and whitney at the bar of the house in addition the resolution provided that the accused be questioned by written interrogatories submitted by the speaker of the house with both the 4 354 us 178 187 1957

ting the scope of congresss contempt power6 the case arose when representative louis williams of north carolina introduced letter before the house from john anderson which representative williams interpreted as an attempt to bribe him following its 1795 precedent the house adopted resolution ordering the sergeantatarms to arrest mr anderson bring him before th bar of the house upon mr andersons arrest however debate erupted on the floor of the house as the motion for referral to the committee on privileges to adopt procedures was considered several members objected to the houses assertion of an inherent contempt power they argued as the minority senators had in mr duanes contempt that neither the constitution nor the general laws afforded the congress such an inherent power to punish for actions that occurred elsewhere relying on the 1795 precedent and examples from the british parliament and state legislatures the committee was formed and it adopted resolution requiring mr anderson to be br ought before the bar of the house for questioning by the speaker at his appearance mr anderson like mr randall and mr whitney before him was afforded counsel and permitted to present the testimony of eleven witnesses ultimately mr anderson was found in contempt of congress and was ordered to be reprimanded by the speaker for the outrage he committed and discharged into the custody of the sergeantat arms mr anderson subsequently filed suit against mr thomas dunn the sergeantatarms of the house alleging assault battery and false imprisonment mr dunn responded by asserting that he was carrying out the lawful orders of the house of representatives the supreme court heard the case in february of 1821 and concluded that the congress possessed the inherent authority to punish for contempt and dismissed the charges against mr dunn the court noted that while the constitution does not explicitly grant either house of congress the authority to punish for contempt except in situations involving its own members such power is necessary for congress to protect itself the court asserted that if the house of representatives did not possess the power of contempt it would be exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness caprice or even conspiracy may meditate against it the courts decision in anderson does not define the specific actions that would constitute contempt rather it adopted deferential posture noting that it is only necessary to observe that there is noth ing on the facts of the record from which it can appear on what evidence the warrant was issued and we do not presume that the house of representatives would have issued it without fully establishing the facts charged on the individual 7 5 see crs report rl34097 congresss contempt power

centered on those actions committed in its presence that obstruct its deliberative proceedings the court noted that congress could supplement this power to punish for contempt committed in its presence by enacting statute which would prohibit all other insults which there is any necessity for providing the court in anderson also endorsed the existing parliamentary practice that the contemnor could not be held beyond the end of the legislative session according to the court since the existence of the power that imprisons is indispensable to its continuance and although the legislative power continues perpetual the legislative body ceases to exist on the moment of its adjournment or periodical dissolution it follows that imprisonment must terminate with that adjournment

pool in which the united states had suffered losses as creditor the committee was by resolution given the power to subpoena both persons and records pursuant to its investigation acting under its authority the committee issued subpoena duces tecum to one hallet kilbourn the manager of the real estate pool when mr kilbourn refused to produce certain papers or answer questions before the committee he was arrested and tried under the houses inherent contempt power the house ad judged mr kilbourn in contempt and ordered him detained by the sergeantatarms until he purged himself of contempt by releasing the requested documents and answering the committees questions mr kilbourn filed suit against the speaker the members of the committee and the sergeantat arms for false arrest the lower court held in favor of the defendant dismissing the suit mr kilbourn appealed and the supreme court reversed holding that congress did not have general power to punish for contempt while the court appe ared to recognize that congress possessed an inherent contempt power it declined to follow anderson v dunn s expansive view of congresss authority the court held that the investigation into the real estate pool was not undertaken by the committee pursuant to one of congresss constitutional responsibilities but rather was an attempt to pry into the personal finances of private individuals subject that could not conceivably result in the enactment of valid legislation according to the court because congress was acting beyond its constitutional responsibilities mr k ilbourn was not legally required to answer the questions asked of him finally in dicta the court indicated that the contempt power might be upheld where congress was acting pursuant to certain specific constitutional prerogatives such as disciplining its members judging their elections or conducting impeachment proceedings although the precedential value of kilbourn has been significantly limited by subsequent case law the case continues to be cited for the proposition that the house has power to probe into private affairs such as the personal finances of an individual on which legislation could not be enacted the doubts raised by kilbourn about the scope of congresss contempt power have 8 id at 231 9 103 us 168 1881

power in investigations conducted pursuant to congresss authority to discipline its members to judge the elections of its members and most importantly to probe the business and conduct of individuals to the extent that the matters are subject to congressional regulation for example in mcgrain v daugherty which involved senate investigation into the claimed failure of the attorney general to prosecute certain antitrust violations subpoena was issued to the brother of the attorney general mallie daugherty the president of an ohio bank when daugherty refused to comply the senate exercised its inherent contempt power and ordered its sergeantatarms to take him into custody the grant of writ of habeas corpus was appealed to the supreme court the courts opinion in the case considered the inve stigatory and contempt powers of congress to be implicit in the grant of legislative power the court distinguished kilbourn which was an investigation into purely personal affairs from the instant case which was probe of the operation of the department of justice according to the court the subject was plainly one on which legislation could be had and would be mate rially aided by information the investigation was calculated to elicit 10 the court in mcgrain was willing to presume that the investigation had been undertaken to assist the committee in its legislative efforts

legislate effectively the validity of the inherent contempt power was upheld in the early supreme court decision in anderson v dunn and reiterated in mcgrain v daugherty under the inherent contempt power the individual is brought before the house or senate by the sergeantatarms tried at the bar of the body and can be imprisoned in the capitol jail the purpose of the imprisonment or other sanction may be either punitive11 or coercive12 thus the witness can be imprisoned for specified period of time as punishment or for an indefinite period but not at least by the house beyond the end of session of the congress until he agrees to comply when witness is cited for contempt under the inhe rent contempt process prompt judicial review appears to be available by means of petition for writ of habeas corpus in such habeas proceeding the issues decided by the court might be limited to whether the house or senate acted in manner within its jurisdiction and b whether the contempt proceedings complied with minimum due process standards while congress would not have to afford contemnor the whole panoply of procedural rights available to defendant in criminal proceedings notice and an opportunity to be heard would have to be granted also some of the requirements imposed by the courts under the statutory criminal contempt proc edure eg pertinency of the question asked to the committees investigation might be mandated by the due process clause in the case of inherent contempt proceedings although many of the inherent contempt precedents have involved incarceration of the contemnor there may be an argument for the imposition of monetary fines as an alternative such fine would potentially have the advantage of avoiding court proceeding on habeas corpus grounds as the contemnor would never be jailed or detained drawing on the analogous authority 10 id at 177 11 jurney v maccracken 294 us 125 147 1935 12 mcgrain v daugherty 273 us at 161

it appears possible to argue that congress in its exercise of similar inherent function could impose fines as opposed to incarceration additional support for this argument appears to be contained in dicta from the 1821 supreme court decision in anderson v dunn in addition kilbourn v thompson suggested that in certain cases where the congress had authority to investigate it may compel testimony in the same manner and by use of the same means as court of justice in like cases in comparison with the other types of contem pt proceedings inherent contempt has the distinction of not requiring the cooperation or as sistance of either the executive or judicial branches the house or senate can on its own conduct summary proceedings and cite the offender for contempt furthermore although the contemnor can seek judicial review by means of petition for writ of habeas corpus the scope of such review may be relatively limited compared to the plenary review accorded by the courts in cases of conviction under the criminal contempt statute there are also certain limitations on the inhere nt contempt process though the contemnor can be incarcerated until he agrees to comply with the subpoena imprisonment may not extend beyond the end of the current session of congress moreover inherent contempt has been described as unseemly cumbersome timeconsuming and relatively ineffective especially for modern congress with heavy legislative workload that would be interrupted by trial at the bar because of these drawbacks the inherent contempt process has not been used by either body since 1934 proceedings under the inherent contempt power might be facilitated however if the initial factfinding and examination of witnesses were to be held before special committee which could be directed to submit findings and recommendations to the full bodywith only the final decision as to guilt being made by the full house or senate although generally the proceedings in inherent contempt cases appear to have been conducted at the bar of the house of congress involved in at least few instances proceedings were conducted initially or primarily before committee but with the final decision as to whether to hold the person in contempt being made by the full body past practice and the supreme courts 1993 decision in nixon v united states 13 upholding the senates ability to conduct impeachment trials in committee appears to provide support for the utilization of such committees to avoid lengthy floor proceedings14

eight of which can be considered successful in that the contemnor was meted out punishment agreed to testify or produce documents such inherent contempt proceedings however involved trial at the bar of the chamber concerned and therefore were seen by some as timeconsuming cumbersome and in some instances ineffectivebecause punishment could not be extended beyond houses adjournment date in 1857 st atutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted largely as result of particular proceeding brought in the house of representatives that year the statute provides for judicial trial of the contemnor by

enactment most contempt proceedings continued to be handled at the bar of the house rather than by the criminal contempt method apparently because members felt that they would not be able to obtain the desired information from the witness after the criminal proceedings had been instituted with only minor amendments those statutory provisions are co dified today as 2 usc 192 and 194 which state every person who having been summoned as witness by the authority of either house of congress to give testimony or to produce papers upon any matter under inquiry before either house or any joint committee established by joint or concurrent resolution of the two houses of congress or any committee of either house of congress willfully makes default or who having appeared refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry shall be deemed guilty of misdemeanor punishable by fine of not more than 100000 nor less than 100 and imprisonment in common jail for not less than one month nor more than twelve months 15 whenever witness summoned as mentioned in section 192 of this title fails to appear to testify or fails to produce any books papers records or documents as required or whenever any witness so summoned refuses to answer any question pertinent to the subject under inquiry before either house or any joint committee established by joint or concurrent resolution of the two houses of congress or any committee or subcommittee of either house of congress and the fact of such failure or failures is reported to either house while congress is in session or when congress is not in session statement of fact constituting such failure is reported to and filed with the president of the senate or the speaker of the house it shall be the duty of the said president of the senate or speaker of the house as the case may be to certify and he shall so certify the statement of facts aforesaid under the seal of the senate or house as the case may be to the appropriate united states attorney whose duty it shall be to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action 16 the legislative debate over the criminal contempt statute reveals that it was prompted by the obstruction of house select committees investigation into allegations of misconduct that had been made against several members of the house of representatives according to reports the investigation was hindered by the refusal of newspaper reporter james w simonton to provide answers to certain questions posed by the committee the select committee responded by reporting resolution citing mr simonton for contempt as well as introducing bill that was intended to more effectually enforce the attendance of witnesses on the summons of either house of congress and to compel them to discover testimony it appears that there were printed house or senate committee reports on the measure though it was considered in the house by the select committee and in the senate by the judiciary committee under 2 usc 192 person who has been summoned as witness by either house or committee thereof to testify or to produce documents and who fails to do so or who appears but refuses to respond to questions is guilty of misdemeanor punishable by fine of up to 100000 and imprisonment for up to one year 2 usc 194 establishes the procedure to be followed by the house or senate if it chooses to refer recalcitrant witness to the courts for criminal prosecution rather than try him at the bar of the house or senate under the procedure 15 2 usc 192 2000 as result of congressional classification of offenses the penalty for contempt of congress is class misdemeanor thus the 1000 maximum fine under 192 has been increased to 100000 see 18 usc 3559 3571 2000 16 2 usc 194 2000

under the statute 1 approval by committee 2 calling up and reading the committee report on the floor 3 either if congress is in session house approval of resolution authorizing the speaker to certify the report to the us attorney for prosecution or if congress is not in session an independent determination by the speaker to certify the report and 4 certification by the speaker to the appropriate us attorney for prosecution the criminal contempt statute and corresponding pr ocedure are punitive in nature it is used when the house or senate wants to punish recalcitrant witness and by doing so to deter others from similar contumacious conduct the criminal sanction is not coercive because the witness generally will not be able to purge himself by testifying or supplying subpoenaed documents after he has been voted in contempt by the committee and the house or senate consequently once witness has been voted in contempt he lacks an incentive for cooperating with the committee however although the courts have rejected arguments that defendants had purged themselves in few instances the house has certified to the us attorney that further proceedings concerning contempts were not necessary where compliance with subpoenas occurred after contempt citations had been voted but before referral of the cases to grand juries under the statute after contempt has been certified by the president of the senate or the speaker it is the duty of the united states attorney to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action it remains unclear whether the duty of the us attorney to present the contempt to the grand jury is mandatory or discretionary 17

g4g155g138g151g140g145g561 the department of justice doj has taken the position that congress cannot as matter of statutory or constitutional law invoke either its inherent contempt authority or the criminal contempt of congress procedures against an exec utive branch official acting on instructions by the president to assert executive privilege in response to congressional subpoena this view is most fully articulated in two opinions by the dojs office of legal counsel olc from the mid1980s 18 and has been the basis of several recent claims with respect to pending congressional investigations the position of the doj was prompted by the outcome of an investigation by two house committees into the environmental protection agencys epa implementation of provisions of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 superfund subpoenas were issued by both committees seeking documents contained in epa s litigation files at the direction of president

transportation approved criminal contempt of congress citation and forwarded it to the full house for its consideration on december 16 1982 the full house of representatives voted 259105 to adopt the contempt citation before the speaker of the house could transmit the citation to the united states attorney for the district of columbia for presentation to grand jury the doj filed lawsuit seeking to enjoin the transmission of the citation and to have the houses action declared unconstitutional as an intrusion into the presidents authority to withhold such informatio n from the congress according to the doj the houses action imposed an unwarranted burden on executive privilege and interferes with the executives ability to carry out the laws the district court for the district of columbia dismissed the dojs suit on the grounds that judicial intervention in executivelegislative disputes should be delayed until all possibilities for settlement have been exhausted 19 in addition the court noted that ultimate judicial resolution of the validity of the presidents claim of executive privilege could only occur during the course of the trial for contempt of congress the doj did not appeal the courts ruling opting instead to resume negotiations which resulted in full disclosure and release of the all the subpoenaed documents to the congress throughout the litigation and subsequent negotiations however the us attorney refused to present the contempt citation to grand jury for its consideration on the grounds that notwithstanding the mandatory language of the criminal contempt statute he had discretion with respect to whether to make the presentation the issue was never resolved because the ultimate settlement agreement included withdrawal of the houses contempt citation in its initial 1984 opinion olc revisited the statutory legal and constitutional issues that were not judicially resolved by the superfund dispute the opinion concluded that as function of prosecutorial discretion us attorney is not required to refer contempt citation to grand jury or otherwise to prosecute an executive bran ch official who is carrying out the presidents direction to assert executive privilege next the olc opinion determined that review of the legislative history of the 1857 enactment of the criminal contempt statute and its subsequent implementation demonstrates that congress did not intend the statute to apply to executive officials who carry out presidential directive to assert executive privilege finally as matter of constitutional law the opinion concludes that simply the threat of criminal contempt would unduly chill the presidents ability to effectively protect presumptively privileged executive branch deliberations according to the olc opinion the presidents exercise of this privilege particularly when based upon the written legal advice of the attorney general is presumptively valid because many of the documents over which the president may wish to assert privilege are in the custody of department head claim of privilege over those documents can be perfected only with the assistance of that official if one house of congress could make it crime simply to assert the presidents presumptively valid claim even if court subsequently were to agree that the privilege claim were valid the exercise of the privilege would be so burdened as to be nullified because congress has other methods available to test the validity of privilege claim and to obtain the documents that it seeks even the threat of criminal prosecution for asserting the claim is an unreasonable unwarranted and therefore intolerable burden on the exercise by the president of his functions under the constitution 20 19 see generally united states v united states house of

contempt statute as that was the authority invoked by congress in the superfund dispute in brief footnote however the opinion contains discussion of congresss inherent contempt power summarily concluding that the same rationale that makes the criminal contempt statute inapplicable and unconstitutional as applied to executive branch officials apply to the inherent contempt authority we believe that this same conclusion would apply to any attempt by congress to utilize its inherent civil contempt powers to arrest bri ng to trial and punish an executive official who asserted presidential claim of executive privilege the legislative history of the criminal contempt statute indicates that the reach of the statute was intended to be coextensive with congress inherent civil contempt powers except with respect to the penalties imposed therefore the same reasoning that suggests that the statute could not constitutionally be applied against presidential assertion of privilege applies to congress inherent contempt powers as well 21 the 1986 olc opinion reiterates the 1984 reasoning adding the observation that the power had not been used since 1935 at that time over 50 years and that it seems unlikely that congress would dispatch the sergeantatarms to arrest and imprison an executive branch official who claimed executive privilege the 1986 olc opinion also suggests that then current supreme court opinions indicated that it was more wary of congress exercising judicial authority and therefore might revisit the question of the continued constitutional validity of the inherent contempt power factual legal and constitutional aspects of these olc opinions are open to question and potentially limitations for example with respect to the argument that us attorney cannot be statutorily required to submit contempt citation to grand jury despite the plain language of the law such statement appears to be analogous to grant of socalled pocket immunity by the president to anyone who asserts executive privilege on his behalf the courts have concluded that the government or in this case the president may informally grant immunity from prosecution which is in the nature of contract and therefore its effect is strongly influenced by contract law principles moreover principles of due process require that the government adhere to the terms of any immunity agreement it makes it appears that president has implicitly immunized executive branch officials from violations of congressional enactments at least oncein 1996 during dispute over the constitutionality of statute that made it requirement for all public printing to be done by the government printing office at the time the doj in an opinion from olc argued that the requirement was unconstitutional on its face directed the executive branch departments not to comply with the statute as passed by congress and noted that executive branch officials who are involved in making decisions that violate the statute face little to litigation risk including it appears risk of prosecution under the antdeficiency act for which the doj is solely responsible such claim of immunization in the contempt context whether express or implicit would raise significant constitutional questions while it is true that the president can immunize persons from criminal prosecution it does not appear that he has authority to immunize witness from congressional inherent contempt proceeding arguably an inherent contempt proceeding takes place wholly outside the criminal code is not subject to executive execution of the laws and prosecutorial discretion and thus appears completely beyond the reach of the executive branch furthermore as previously indicated inherent contempt unlike criminal contempt is not intended to punish but rather to coerce compliance with congressional directive thus finding of inherent contempt against an executive branch officials would not 21 id

presidents pardon power22as an inherent contempt arguably is not an offense against the united states but rather is an offense against house of congress likewise it appears that the same arguments would be applicable to potential civil contempt by congress the assertion that the legislative history of the 1857 statute establishing the criminal contempt process demonstrates that it was not intended to be used against executive branch official does not appear to be supported by the historical record the floor debates leading to the enactment of the statute make it clear that the legislation was intended as an alternative to not substitute for the inherent contempt authority this understanding has been reflected in numerous supreme court opinions upholding the use of the criminal contempt statute close review of the floor debate indicates that representative h marshall expressly pointed out that the broad language of the bill proposes to punish equally the cabinet officer and the culprit who may have insulted the dignity of this house by an attempt to corrupt representative of the people moreover language from the floor debate indicates that congress was aware of the effect that this language would have on the ability of persons to claim privileges before congress specifically the sponsor of the bill representative orr was asked about the potential instances in which the proposed legislation might interfere with recognized common law and other governmental privileges such as the attorneyclient privilege to support an investigation such as one that probed the propriety of secret service fund to be used upon the discretion of the executive department or to support inquiries about diplomatic matters representative orr responded that the house has and would continue to follow the practice of the british parliament which does not exempt witness from testifying upon any such ground he is not excused from testifying there that is the common law of parliament later in the same debate proposed amendment to expressly recognize the attorneyclient privilege in the statute was overwhelmingly defeated with respect to the secret service fund representative orr explained that this house has already exercised the power and authority of forcing disclosure as to what disposition had been made for the secretservice fund and it is right and proper that is should be so under our governmentunder our system of lawsunder our constitutioni should protest against the use of any money by an executive authority where the house had not the right to know how every dollar had been expended and for what purpose representative orrs reference was to contentious investigation in 1846 regarding charges that daniel webster while secretary of state had improperly disbursed monies from cret contingency fund used by the president for clandestine foreign operations the charges led the committee to issue subpoenas to former presidents john quincy adams and john tyler president polk sent the house list of the amounts in the contingent fund for the relevant period which was prior to his term but refused to furnish documentation of the uses that had been made of the expenditures on the grounds that sitting president should not publically reveal the confidences of his predecessors president polks refusal to provide the information was mooted by the actions of the two investigatory committees established by the house former president tyler testified and former president adams filed deposition detailing the uses of the fund during their administrations in addition president polks secretary of state james buchanan was subpoenaed and testified ultimately mr webster was found innocent of any wrongdoing from these references it appears

investigative prerogatives visa vis the executive branch it therefore appears arguable that in the context of the debate the contempt statute was not intended to preclude the houses ability to engage in oversight of the executive branch finally olcs contention that the criminal contempt statute has only been used once in the burfordsuperfund dispute appears to be based on the fact that the contempt of anne burford was the only contempt voted on by the full house of representatives significantly prior to the superfund dispute committees and subcommittees of the house of representatives had voted contempt citations against secretary of state henry kissinger 1975 secretary of commerce rogers c b morton 1975 secretary of hea lth education and welfare joseph califano jr 1978 secretary

subcommittee generally such suit will be brought by the senate legal counsel on behalf of the senate or senate committee or subcommittee pursuant to the statute the senate may ask court to directly

the enforcement of or declaratory judgement concerning subpoena the court will first review the subpoenas validity if the court finds that the subpoena does not meet applicable legal standards for enforcement it does not have jurisdiction to enjoin the congressional proceeding because of the limited scope of the jurisdictional statute and because of speech or debate clause immunity for congressional investigations when the court is petitioned solely to enforce congressional subpoena the courts jurisdiction is limited to the matter congress brings before it that is whether or not to aid congress in enforcing the subpoena if the individual still refuses to comply he may be tried by 23 see crs contempt report supra note 8 at 2733

sanctions being imposed to coerce their compliance without affecting the right of the senate to institute criminal contempt proceedings or to try an individua1 for contempt at the bar of the senate this procedure gives the senate the option of civil action to enforce subpoena civil contempt might be employed when the senate is more concerned with securing compliance with the subpoena or with clarifying legal issues than with punishing the contemnor unlike criminal contempt in civil contempt sanctions imprisonment andor fine can be imposed until the subpoenaed party agrees to comply thereby creating an incentive for compliance namely the termination of punishment since the statutes enactment in 1979 the senate has authorized the office of senate legal counsel to seek civil enforcement of document subpoena at least 6 times the last in 1995 none has been against executive branch officials the civil contempt process is arguably more expeditious than criminal proceeding where court may more closely scrutinize congressional procedures and give greater weight to the defendants constitutional rights the civil contempt procedure also provides an element of flexibility allowing the subpoenaed party to raise possible constitutional and other defenses eg the privilege against selfincrimination lack of compliance with congressional procedures or an inability to comply with the subpoena without risking criminal prosecution civil contempt however has limitations most notable is that the statute granting jurisdiction to the courts to hear such cases is by its terms inapplicable in the case of subpoena issued to an officer or employee of the federal government acting in their official capacity enacted as part of the ethics in government act of 1978 early drafts of the civil contempt statute did not include an exception for federal government officers and employees acting within the scope of their duties it appears that the section was drafted primarily in response to the district courts dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of an ervin committees request for declaratory judgment regarding the lawfulness of its subpoena of president nixons tape recordings thus one of the purposes of the statute was to expressly confer jurisdiction upon courts to determine the validity of congressional requests for information during the course of the debates regarding this legislation the executive branch strongly opposed conferring jurisdiction upon the federal courts to decide such sensitive issues between congress and the executive branch testifying before subcommittee of the senate committee on governmental operations thenassistant attorney general antonin scalia argued that weighing the legislatures need for information against the executives need for confidentiality is the very type of political question from which the courts should abstain in response congress amended the proposed legislation excluding from its scope federal officers and employees acting in their official capacity however as noted in report from the house judiciary committee in 1988 the exclusion was to apply only in cases in which the president had directed the recipient of the subpoena not to comply with its terms 24

iran irancontra as part of this resolution the house provided the following authorization 3 the select committee is authorized to require by subpoena or otherwise the attendance and testimony of such witnesses as it deems necessary including all inte lligence materials however classified white house materials and to obtain evidence in other appropriate countries with the cooperation of their govern ments 8 the select committee shall be authorized to respond to any judicial or other process or to make any applications to court upon consultation with the speaker consistent with house rule l 25 the combination of broad subpoena authority that expressly encompassed the white house and the ability to make any applications to court arguably suggests that the house contemplated the possibility that civil suit seeking enforcement of subpoena against white house official was possible by virtue of the resolutions language it appears reasonable to conclude that the house decided to leave the decision in the hands of the select committee consistent with house rule l now house rule viii governing subpoenas it may be noted then that while the house select committee did not attempt to seek judicial enforcement of any of its subpoenas the authorization resolution did not preclude the possibility revi ew of modern house precedents indicates at least 5 other special or select committees that have been granted via house resolution both subpoena authority as well as the ability to seek and participate in judicial actions potential hurdle to resolution by the house of representatives authorizing the pursuit of civil court order is the jurisdiction of the federal courts such jurisdiction specifically federal district court jurisdiction where civil action for enforcement of congressional subpoena would be brought is derived from both article iii of the constitution and federal statute article iii of the constitution states in relevant part that the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution the laws of the united states the supreme court has interpreted the language arising under broadly essentially permitting federal jurisdiction to be found whenever federal law is potentially important ingredient of case conversely the federalquestion jurisdiction statute first enacted in 1875 while containing almost identical language to article iii has been interpreted by the court to be much narrower in scope but the fact that the statutory jurisdiction provided by congress is narrower than the constitutions grant of judicial power may give rise to an argument that the statutory grant of jurisdiction cannot be used by the house should it merely adopt resolution authorizing subpoena enforcement proceeding to be brought in court following this argument to its conclusion might suggest that both houses of congress must pass law signed by the president which authorizes civil enforcement action to be brought in federal district court because mere onehouse resolution will not suffice to provide such jurisdiction 25 see hres 12 100th cong 1st sess 3 8 1987 emphasis added

argument it therefore remains unclear whether the existing statutory language for jurisdiction can be definitively said to be inadequate rather the limited supreme court and other federal court precedent that exists may be read to suggest that the current statutory basis is sufficient to establish jurisdiction for civil action of the type contemplated here if the representative of the congressional committee is specifically authorized by house of congress to act in 1928 the supreme court decided reed v the county commissioners of delaware county pennsylvania26 which involved special committee of the united states senate charged by senate resolution with investigating the means used to influence the nomination of candidates for the senate the special committee was authorized to require by subpoena or otherwise the attendance of witnesses the production of books papers and documents and to do such other acts as may be necessary in the matter of said investigation during the course of its investigation into the disputed election of william b wilson of pennsylvania to the senate the committee sought to obtain the boxes ballots and other things used in connection with the election the county commissioners who were the gal custodians of said materials refused to provide them to the committee thus necessitating the lawsuit the supreme court after affirming the powers of the senate to obtain evidence related to matter committed to it by the constitution and having passed laws calculated to facilitate such investigations nevertheless held that it was without jurisdiction to decide the case the senate had relied on the resolutions phrase such other acts as may be necessary to justify its authority to bring such suit according to the court however that phrase may not be taken to include everything that under any circumstances might be covered by its words as result the court held that the senate did not intend to authorize the committee or anticipate that there might be need to invoke the power of the judicial department petitioners are not authorized by law to sue the court in reed made mention of the jurisdictional statute that existed at the time rather the court appears to have relied on the fact that the senate did not specifically authorize the committee to sue therefore absent particular language granting the power to sue in court there can be basis for judicial jurisdiction over such suit read in this manner reed appears to suggest that had the senate resolution specifically mentioned the power to sue the court may have accepted jurisdiction and decided the case on its merits such reading of reed is supported by recent district court ruling involving the question of whether congress authorized judicial enforcement of member demands for information from executive branch agencies in waxman v thompson 27 2006 opinion of the district court for the central district of california the plaintiffs all minority members of the house government reform committee sought court order pursuant to 5 usc 2954 and 7211often times referred to as the rule of sevengranting them access to department of health and human services records related to the anticipated costs of the medicare prescription drug and modernization act of 2003 the court in dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction addressed the argument made by the plaintiffs that 5 usc 2954 which requires that an executive agency on request of the committee on government operations of the house of representatives or of any seven members thereof shall submit any information requested of it relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee implicitly delegate d to members to right to sue to enforce their informational demands the court in rejecting this argument relied on the supreme courts holding in reed v county commissioners specifically the court noted that reed s holding put 26 277 us 376 1928 27 waxman v thompson 043467

sue to enforce investigatory demands explicit if it wished to ensure that such power existed according to the court like the senate resolution at issue in reed because 2954 is silent with respect to civil enforcement it stands to reason that the congress never intended to provide the members with the power to seek civil judicial orders to enforce their document demands the argument that mere onehouse resolution is not sufficient to provide jurisdiction also derives support from the ruling in senate select committee on presidential campaign activities v nixon 28 1973 decision by the district court for the district of columbia in senate select committee the court held that there was jurisdictional statute available that authorizes the court to hear and decide the merits of the committees request for declaratory judgment mandatory injunction and writ of mandamus arising from president nixons refusal to produce tape recording and other documents sought by the committee pursuant to subpoena duces tecum in reaching its conclusion the court addressed several potential bases for jurisdiction 28 usc 1345 united states as plaintiff 28 u sc 1361 action to compel an officer of the united states to perform his duty 5 usc 701706 the administrative procedure act and of particular relevance here 28 usc 1331 the federal question jurisdiction statute focusing on 28 usc 1331 the court noted that the statute at the time contained minimum amount in controversy requirement of 10000 exclusive of interest and costs the court stated that the satisfaction of minimum amountincontroversy is not technicality it is requirement imposed by congress which the courts may not dispense with at their pleasure because the select committee could not establish theory under which the amount in controversy requirement was satisfied the court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction senate select committee may still be cited for the proposition that absent specific congressional enactment congress may not seek to enforce subpoena in federal court it is important to note however that not only have subsequent cases held that where fundamental constitutional rights are involved this court has been willing to find satisfaction of the jurisdictional amount requirement for federal question jurisdiction 29 but also that congress specifically removed the amount in controversy requirement for federal question jurisdiction in 1980 given these developments combined with the reading of reed v county commissioners suggested above it appears possible to argue that specifically authorized congressional committee may bring civil action to enforce subpoena using 28 usc 1331 as basis for federal question jurisdiction such an argument has been suggested by the district court in waxman v thompson the ruleofseven case discussed above according to the court in waxman the holdings of reed senate select committee and united states v att 30a case involving the intervention by house committee chai rman into lawsuit by the department of justice which was attempting to enjoin compliance with committee subpoena by att suggest that legislative branch suits to enforce requests for information from the executive branch are justiciable if authorized by one or both houses of congress while we have found instance where committee of either the house or senate has attempted to use this argument to 28 366 f supp 51 ddc 1973 29 united states v american telephone telegraph co 551 f2d 384 389 dc cir 1976 citing committee for gi rights v callaway

meaning of the statute and reasonable interpretation of the existing case law although as indicated there have been attemp ts by house of congress to seek civil enforcement of subpoenas in federal court authoriz ed solely by resolution of single house there have been situations that appear to be closely analogous on several occasions the house of representatives has authorized via house resolution the intervention by counsel representing house committee into civil litigation involving congressional subpoenas while some may still argue that law passed by both houses and signed by the president conferring jurisdiction is required it may be plausibly argued that taken together the combination of reed s requirement that congressional authorization to sue be by express language the willingness of federal courts to accept properly authorized interventions and the fact that the federal question jurisdiction statute longer contains an amount in controversy requirement suggest that if an authorization resolution by the house can be obtained there is likelihood that reviewing court will find legal impediment to seeking civil enforcement of subpoenas or other committee orders 31

subcommittee on commercial and administrative law the committee has resulted in the first legal confrontation over congresss contempt authority since the early 1980s and the first civil lawsuit filed by house of congress in an attempt to enforce its prerogatives after an extensive investigation which involved numerous witness interviews and several congressional hearings the committee ultimately sought information relating to the resignations directly from the white house 32 after several attempts to obtain the information sought informally on june 13 2007 the committee issued and served subpoenas on ms harriet miers the former white house counsel and mr joshua bolten the white house chief of staff and custodian of white house records33 ms mierss subpoena was for both documents and testimony about her role if any in the resignations while mr boltens subpoena was only for white house records and documents related to the resignations in response to the committees action the white house via its counsel fred f fielding notified the committee that it did not intend to comply with the subpoena to mr bolten on the grounds of executive privilege as result the white house has not produced any documents in response to mr boltens subpoena and has also not yet provided privilege log or any information describing the contents of the documents being withheld with respect to the subpoena to ms miers mr fielding first sent letter to ms mierss private attorney containing notice of the presidents assertion of executive privilege over information related to this investigation and suggested that ms miers refrain from producing any documents 31 see crs contempt report supra note 8 at 3746 32 see generally hrept 110423 2007 available at httpjudiciaryhousegovmediapdfs

second letter to ms mierss attorney that indicated that she was not to provide testimony pursuant to the subpoena on the grounds that any such testimony would also be covered by the presidents assertion of executive privilege35 subsequently ms mierss attorney notified the committee that as result of the presidents claim of executive privilege ms miers would not appear at the scheduled hearing36 on july 25 2007 the committee voted to hold ms miers and mr bolten in contempt of congress for failure to comply with the duly issued subpoenas37 the full house of representatives voted to hold ms miers and mr bolten in criminal contempt of congress on february 14 2008 for their failure to comply with the committees subpoenas38 in addition to invoking the criminal contempt statutes the resolutions adopted by the house of representatives expressly authorized the filing of civil lawsuit in the event that the department of justice would not pursue the criminal contempt actions 39 on february 28 2008 pursuant to 2 usc 194 the speaker of the house certified the report to the us attorney for the district of columbia for presentation to the grand jury40 the next day the attorney general sent letter to the speaker stating that the department of justice will not bring the congressional contempt citations before grand jury or take any other action to prosecute mr bolten or ms miers41 on march 10 2008 pursuant to the resolution adopted by the house of representatives civil suit was filed in the united states district court for the district of columbia seeking declaratory judgment and other appropriate relief including injunctive relief to enforce the committees subpoenas 42 pursuant to the federal rules of civil procedure on april 10 2008 the committee requested partial summary judgment on the grounds that there are genuine issues regarding any material facts and therefore the committee argued that it is entitled to judgment as matter of law43 the department
