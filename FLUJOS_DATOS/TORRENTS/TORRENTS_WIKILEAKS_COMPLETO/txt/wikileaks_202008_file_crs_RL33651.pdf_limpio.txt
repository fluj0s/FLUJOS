organization nrsro since then growing numbe r of federal state and foreign government statutes and regulations have adopted nrsro ratings as reference points or triggers but there is statutory defi nition of an nrsro when rating agency requests nrsro status it applies to the sec division of market regulation for nrsro designation and through what is known as the noaction letter process1 the

spond that they were themselves the victims of corporate deceit exist along side criticism that the nrsro selection process is an anticompetitive mechanism that impedes nonnrsros access to the more profitable segments of the rating industry the congressional response to the per ceived problems surrounding the nrsro process and its potentially undesirable consequences s led to the introduction of two bills in the 109th congress hr 2990 fitzpatr ick the credit rating agency duopoly relief act of 2006 passed the house on july 12 2006 in vote closely divided along partisan lines soon afte rwards

secs current noactionletterbased nrsro designation process with its central focus on whether an agency is nationally recognized as an issuer of credible ratings and with its indefinite decision making time frames both would amend the s ecurities exchange act of 1934 to allow interested entities with at least three consecutive years as rating agencies to register with the sec as nrsros which would involve the submission of performance measurement statistics description of their rating methodology details of ethics policies and disclosure of conflicts of interest under both bills once the sec received credit agencys application to register as an nrsro it would have up to 120 days with the possibility of an extens ion if deemed necessary to determine whether to deny or grant the registration s 3850 would allow the sec to reject rating agencys application for nrsro registration if it determined the applicant lacked sufficient financial and managerial resources hr 2990 has such requirement s 3850 would require nrsro applicants to provide written certifications from at least 10 of their institutional customers to the sec applicants would also have to provide list of their 20
