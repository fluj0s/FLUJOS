personaldependency exemption frequently the dependency exemption arises in the case of taxpayer supporting handicapped or mentally impaired indivi dual the dependency exemption has value of 3000 for 2002 the personaldependency exemption is indexed to inflation and thus is likely to rise in future years in order to claim dependency exempti on for any person under present law five tests must be met 1 gross income test taxpayer cannot claim person other than the taxpayers child under the ag of 19 or who qualifies as student under the age of 24 as dependent if the person had gross income of more than the exemption amount for the tax year in question 3000 in 2002 tax exempt income is not included in the dependents gr oss income gross income is measured before allowing for expenses of earning income or other items deductible for inco tax purposes for example an individual with rental prope rty collecting 3200 in rent with 1000 in rental expenses could not be claimed as dependent since his or her gross income exceeds the personaldependency exemption amount even though his or her adjusted gross income is only 2200 2 support test the taxpayer must furnish more than onehalf of the support of that person for the taxable year excludable income not counted in the gross income test such as social security and railroad retirement is counted in determining whether the taxpayer has furnis hed over half of the dependents support 3 member of household or rela tionship person need not be related to the taxpayer to qualify as dependent if he or she is member of the taxpayers household and lives with him or her for the entire year certain pendent relatives need not live with the taxpayer or be memb er of the taxpayers household to be claimed as an exemption parents and grandparents for example may be claimed as pendents even though they live in separate domiciles 4 citizenship test dependent must be citizen or national of the united states or resident of the united states or resident of canada mexico th panama canal zone or the republic of panama for some part of the year to be claimed as an exemption by the taxpayer 5 joint return test taxpayer is not allowed an exemption for dependent if the dependent files joint tax returnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31563crs3 1 prior law provided an extra personal exemption for blindness the tax reform act of 1986 provided an additional standard deduction in lieu of this personal exemption for further information see crs report rs20555 the additional standard tax deduction for the blind description and assessment by louis

talley 3 please note that reimbursed expens are not deductible see page 9head of household filing status current law provides an add itional benefit for single taxpayers with qualifying dependent single taxpayer with dependent not only receives the dependency exemption but also moves from single taxpayer status and tax rates to head of household taxpayer status and rates h ead of household rates are approximately in the middle between the higher rates of singles and the lower rates of married taxpayers filing jointly also the standard deduction for head of household is higher than for singles but lower than for joint returns there is reduction in rates or increase in the standard deduction amount for married taxpayers who can claim dependent additional standard deduction for the blind in addition to the personaldependency exemption and the standard deduction taxpayer is allowed an additional sta ndard deduction1 if heshe is elderly 65 years of age or older or blind on the last day of the taxable year this additional amount is 900 for an elderly or blind married individual or surviving spouse and 1150 for an elderly or blind unmarri ed individual for tax year 2002 these

medical expenses2 in excess of 75 of the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer may be deducted3 taxpayer may include amounts paid on behalf of person who qualifies as dependent additionally he may include expenses on behalf of person who would qualify as dependent except for exceeding the limit for the gross income test or except for filing joint return with his or her sp ouse qualified medical

prescription dr ugs the only nonprescription drug eligible for inclusion is insulin the determination of what constitutes medical care for purposes of the medical expense deduction is of special importa nce to the handicapped three special categories are enumerated below residence in sanitarium or nursing home if an individual is in sanitarium or nursing home because of physical or mental disability and the availability of medical care is principal reason for his being there the entire cost of maintenance including meals and lodging may be included in medical expenses for purposes of the dical expense deduction the tax court found in w b counts and mildred p counts petitioners v commissioner of internal revenue respondent that in summary the present regulations provide that the cost of inpatient hospital care including the costs of meals and lodging at the hospital is an expenditure for medical care as that term is defined in section 213e1a it is recognized that such costs of maintena nce at an institution other than hospital may constitute expenses for medical care that whether such costs incurred at an institution other than hospital are deductible as medical expenses is factual question the answer to which depends not upon the nature of the institution but upon the condition of the person and the care which he receives that the cost of nursing attention is an expense for medical care that if and we note that the regulations do not require the principal reason for the persons presence in an institution is the availability of medical ca re for him then the costs of meals and lodging furnished as necessary incident to such care for as long as the person requires the care are deductible and that if the availability of medical care is not principal reason for the persons presence at the institution the costs of meals and lodging are not deemed expens for medical care although even in this event the expenses for nursing atte ntion are considered costs of medical care and are deductible an example in subdivision v b of the regulations deals with the case of person who resides at home for the aged because of personal or family considerations and not because he requires medical or nursing attention in this event it is provided that the persons costs of meals and lodging are not embraced within the term medi cal care but that his costs of nursing attention are deductible4 special schooling for handicapped dependents payments for sending mentally or physically handicappe d dependent to special school may be deducte d as medical expenses if the principal reason for his or her attendance is the institutions special resources for alleviating his or her handicap the cost of meals and lodging supplied by such special school and the cost of ordinary education furnished that is incidental to the special services furnished by the school may also be incl uded as medical expenses deducting the cost of attending school for the mentally retarded as medical expense is expressly allowable under irs re gulation 12131e1vahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31563crs5 capital expenditures capital expenditures incurred by physically handicapped
