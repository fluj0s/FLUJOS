have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 usc 2241 to hear legal challenges on behalf of persons detained at the us naval station in guantanamo bay cuba in connection with the war against terrorism rasul v bush the pentagon established administrative hearings called combatant status review tribunals csrts to allow the detainees to contest their status as enemy combatants and informed them of their right to pursue relief in federal court by seeking writ of habeas corpus lawyers subsequently filed dozens of petitions on behalf of the detainees in the district court for the district of columbia where district court judges reached inconsistent conclusions as to whether the detainees have any enforceable rights to challenge their treatment and detention in december 2005 congress passed the detainee treatment act of 2005 dta to divest the courts of jurisdiction to hear some detainees challenges by eliminating the federal courts statutory jurisdiction over habeas claims by aliens detained at guantanamo bay as well as other causes of action based on their treatment or living conditions the dta provides instead for limited appeals of csrt determinations or final decisions of military commissions after the supreme court rejected the view that the dta left it without jurisdiction to review habeas challenge to the validity of military commissions in the case of hamdan v rumsfeld the 109 th congress enacted the military commissions act of 2006 mca pl 109366 to authorize the president to convene military commissions and to amend the dta to further reduce access to federal courts by alien enemy combatants wherever held by eliminating pending and future causes of action other than the limited review of military proceedings permitted under the dta in june 2008 the supreme court held in the case of boumediene v bush that aliens designated as enemy combatants and detained at guantanamo bay have the constitutional privilege of habeas corpus the court also found that mca 7 which limited judicial review of executive determinations of the petitioners enemy combatant status did not provide an adequate habeas substitute and therefore acted as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas the immediate impact of the boumediene decision is that detainees at guantanamo may petition federal district court for habeas review of the legality and possibly the circumstances of their detention perhaps including challenges to the jurisdiction of military commissions pertinent legislation includes hr 267 s 185 s 576 s 1547 s 1548 hr 1415 hr 1416 hr 1585 hr 4986 hr 1189 hr 2543

hamdi v rumsfeld 1 divided supreme court declared that state of war is not blank check for the presidentand ruled that persons deemed enemy combatants have the right to challenge their detention before judge or other neutral decisionmaker the court did not decide whether the same right applies to aliens held as enemy combatants outside of the united states but held in rasul v bush2 that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions by or on behalf of such detainees the latter decision reversed the holding of the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit which had agreed with the bush administration that us court has jurisdiction to hear petitions for habeas corpus by or on behalf of the detainees because they are aliens and are detained outside the sovereign territory of the united states lawyers filed dozens of petitions on behalf of the detainees in the district court for the district of columbia where judges reached conflicting conclusions as to whether the detainees have any enforceable rights to challenge their treatment and detention after the supreme court granted certiorari to hear challenge by one of the detainees to his trial by military tribunal congress passed the detainee treatment act of 2005 dta the dta requires uniform standards for interrogation of persons in the custody of the department of defense dod and expressly bans cruel inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees in the custody of any us agency at the same time however it divested the courts of jurisdiction to hear challenges by those detained at guantanamo bay based on their treatment or living conditions the dta also eliminated the federal courts statutory jurisdiction over habeas claims by aliens challenging their detention at guantanamo bay but provided for limited appeals of status determinations made pursuant to the dod procedures for combatant status review tribunals csrts or by military commissions in hamdan v rumsfeld decided june 29 2006 the supreme court rejected the governments argument that the dta divested it of jurisdiction to hear that case and reviewed the validity of military commissions established to try suspected terrorists of violations of the law of war pursuant to president bushs military order the court did not revisit its 2004 opinion in hamdi v rumsfeld upholding the presidents authority to detain individuals in connection with antiterrorism operations and did not resolve whether the petitioner could claim prisonerofwar pow status but held that in undertaking to try hamdan and subject him to criminal punishment the executive is bound to comply with the rule of law that prevails in this jurisdiction in response to the courts decision the 109 th congress enacted the military commissions act of 2006 mca pl 109366 to authorize the presiden t to convene military commissions and to amend the dta to further reduce the access of aliens in us custody to federal court by expressly eliminating court jurisdiction over all pending and future causes of action other than the limited review of military proceedings permitted under the dta federal district judge dismissed hamdans new petition for habeas corpus on the basis of the dta as amended holding that the mca is not suspension of the writ of habeas corpus within the meaning of the constitution3 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit is sued an order dismissing other detainee cases 1 542 us 507 2004 2 542 us 466 2004 3 hamdan v rumsfeld 464 f supp 2d 9 ddc 2006

petitioners request for review5 but later granted the petitioners motion to reconsider6 in the consolidated cases of boumediene v bush and odah v united states 7 decided june 12 2008 the supreme court held that aliens designated as enemy combatants and detained at guantanamo bay have the constitutional privilege of habeas corpus the court also found that mca 7 which applied dta review procedures to petitioners claims did not provide an adequate habeas substitute and therefore acted as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas the immediate impact of the boumediene decision is that detainees at guantanamo may petition federal district court for habeas review of the circumstances of their detention although the court held that dta review pro cedures were an inadequate substitute for habeas it made judgment as to whether the csrts as currently constituted satisfy due process standards and emphasized that both the dta and the csrt process remain intact 8 whether these procedures violate due process standards facially or as applied in given case and whether particular detainee is being unlawfully held are issues that will be addressed by the district court when reviewing the habeas claims of guantanamo detainees in the meantime the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit addressed whether it retained jurisdiction under the mca to hear petition on behalf of an alien arrested in the united states and detained as an enemy combatant in 2007 the court granted habeas relief to resident alien who was arrested in illinois on criminal charges but then transferred to south carolina and detained in military custody as an enemy combatant9 while one judge on the panel dissented with respect to the holding that the detention wa s not authorized by congress all three judges on the panel agreed that the mca did not divest it of jurisdiction to hear the petition notwithstanding the mcas lack of geographical limits the government asked for and was granted rehearing banc 10 on rehearing the full circuit agreed that the jurisdictional issue had been resolved by the recent supreme court boumediene decision but found little agreement on the other issue presented11 as result the case is remanded to the district court for hearing to determine whether the petitioner is properly detained to be an enemy combatant the petitioner has reportedly asked the supreme court to intervene this report provides an overview of the csrt procedures summarizes court cases related to the detentions and the use of military commissions and summarizes the detainee treatment act as amended by the military commissions act of 2006 analyzing its effects on detaineerelated litigation in federal court the report summarizes pending legislation and provides an analysis

in february 2002 that taliban detainees are covered under the geneva conventions12 while qaeda detainees are not13 but that none of the detainees qualifies for the status of prisoner of war pow14 the administration deemed all of them to be unlawful enemy combatants and claimed the right to detain them without trial or continue to hold them even if they are acquitted by military tribunal fifteen of the detainees had been determined by the president to be subject to his military order mo of november 13 2001 15 making them eligible for trial by military commission16 the supreme court however found that the procedural rules established by the department of defense to govern the military commissions were not established in accordance with the uniform code of military justice ucmj17 the following sections trace the judicial developments with respect to the detention of alleged enemy combatants g20g138g156g158g149g561g159g495g561g4g158g156g145g343g350g561 petitioners were two australians and twelve kuwaitis petition on behalf of two uk citizens was mooted by their release who were captured during hostilities in afghanistan and were being held in military custody at the guantanamo bay naval base cuba the administration argued and the court below had agreed that under the 1950 supreme court case johnson v eisentrager 19 the privilege of litigation does not extend to aliens in military custody who have presence in any territory over which the united states is sovereign the court distinguished rasul by noting that eisentrager concerned the constitutional right to habeas corpus rather than the right as implemented by statute the rasul court did not reach the constitutional issue but found authority for federal court jurisdiction in 28 usc 2241 which grants courts the authority to hear applications for habeas corpus within their respective jurisdictions by any person who claims to be held in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states20 12 the two most relevant conventions are the geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war august 12 1949 6 ust 3317 hereinafter gpw and the geneva convention relative to

geographical scope according to the citizenship of the detainee justice kennedy in concurring opinion would have found jurisdiction over the guantanamo detainees based on the facts that guantanamo is effectively us territory and is far removed from any hostilities and that the detainees are being held indefinitely without the benefit of any legal procee ding to determine their status noting that the writ of habeas corpus writ has evolved as the primary means to challenge executive detentions especially those without trial the court held that jurisdiction over habeas petitions does not turn on sovereignty over the territory where detainees are held even if the habeas statute were presumed not to extend extraterritorially as the government urged the court found that the complete jurisdiction and control the united states exercises under its lease with cuba would suffice to bring the detainees within the territorial and historical scope of the writ without expressly overruling eisentrager the court distinguished the cases at issue to find eisentrager inapplicable eisentrager listed six factors that precluded those petitioners from seeking habeas relief each petitioner is an enemy alien b has never been or resided in the united states c was captured outside of our territory and there held in military custody as prisoner of war d was tried and convicted by military commission sitting outside the united states for offenses against laws of war committed outside the united states f and is at all times imprisoned outside the united states 21 the rasul court noted that the guantanamo petitioners in contrast are not nationals of countries at war with the united states and they deny that they have engaged in or plotted acts of aggression against the united states they have never been afforded access to any tribunal much less charged with and convicted of wrongdoing and for more than two years they have been imprisoned in territory over which the united states exercises exclusive jurisdiction and control as to the petitioners claims based on statutes other than the habeas statute which included the federal question statute22 as well as the alien tort statute23 the court applied the same reasoning to conclude that nothing precluded the detainees from bringing such claims before federal court24 the courts opinion left many questions unanswered it did not clarify which of the eisentrager or rasul factors would control under different set of facts25 the opinion did not address whether persons detained by the us military abroad in locations where the united states does continued justice scalia with chief justice rehnquist and justice thomas dissented arguing that the habeas statute on its face requires federal district court with territorial jurisdiction over the detainee the dissenters would have read braden as distinguishing ahrens rather than overruling it for more analysis of the rasul opinion see crs report rs21884 the supreme court 2003 term

courts the hamdan opinion seems to indicate that majority of the court regarded eisentrager as ruling denying relief on the merits rather than ruling precluding jurisdiction altogether26 under this view it may be argued there was statutory bar precluding detainees in us custody overseas from petitioning for habeas relief in us courts although it may be substantially more difficult for such prisoners to identify statutory or constitutional infraction that would enable them to prevail on the merits the court did not decide the merits of the petitions although in footnote the majority opined that petitioners allegationsthat although they have engaged neither in combat nor in acts of terrorism against the united states they have been held in executive detention for more than two years in territory subject to the longterm exclusive jurisdiction and control of the united states without access to counsel and without bein g charged with any wrongdoingunquestionably describe custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states the opinion left to lower courts such issues as whether the detentions are authorized by congress who may be detained and what evidence might be adduced to determine whether person is an enemy combatant or whether the geneva conventions afford the detainees any protections the court did not address the extent to which congress might alter federal court jurisdiction over detainees habeas petitions but boumediene appears to foreclose the option of eliminating it completely at least without an adequate substitute procedure this issue is discussed more fully below g5g152g150g139g138g157g138g151g157g561g21g157g138g157g158g156g561g20g142g159g146g142g160g561g22g155g146g139g158g151g138g149g156g561 in

determine pow status during traditional wars27 detainees who are determined not to be enemy combatants are to be transferred to their country of citizenship or otherwise dealt with consistent with domestic and international obligations and us foreign policy28 csrts have confirmed the status of at least 520 enemy combatants any new detainees that might be transported to guantanamo bay will go before csrt the csrts are not empowered to determine whether the enemy combatants are unlawful or lawful which led two military commission judges to hold that csrt determinations are inadequate to

the authority to detain foreign emy combatants outside the united states for the duration of the war against qaeda and the taliban and that the courts have virtually power to review the conditions under which such prisoners are held noting that the prisoners had been captured and detained pursuant to the presidents military order53 judge leon agreed with the government that 1 nonresident aliens detained under such circumstances have rights under the constitution 2 existing federal law renders their custody unlawful 3 legally binding treaty is applicable and 4 international law is not binding under these circumstances54 judge leon rejected the petitioners contention that their arrest outside of afghanistan and away from any active battlefield meant that they coul d not be enemy combatants within the meaning of the law of war finding instead that the aumf contains geographical boundaries55 and gives the president virtually unlimited authority to exercise his war power wherever enemy combatants are found56 the circumstances behind the offbattlefield captures did however apparently preclude the petitioners from claiming their detentions violate the geneva conventions 57 other

finding that the detainees do have rights under the us constitution and international treaties and thus denied the governments motion to dismiss the eleven challenges before the court specifically judge green held that the detainees are entitled to due process of law under the fifth amendment and that the csrt procedures do not meet that standard interpreting the history of supreme court rulings on the availability of constitutional rights in territori under the control of the american government though not part of its sovereign territory judge green concluded that the inquiry turns on the fundamental nature of the constitutional rights being asserted rather than the citizenship of the person asserting them accepting that the right not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law is fundamental constitutional right the judge applied balancing test to determine what process is due in light of the governments significant interest in safeguarding national security 61 judge green rejected the governments stance that the csrts provided more than sufficient due process for the detainees instead she identified tw categories of defects she objected to the csrts failure to provide the detainees with access to material evidence upon which the tribunal affirmed their enemy combatant status and the failure to permit the assistance of counsel to compensate for the lack of access these circumstances she said deprived detainees of meaningful opportunity to challenge the evidence against them second in particular cases the judge found that the csrts handling of accusations of torture and the vague and potentially overbroad definition of enemy combatant could violate the due process rights of detainees citing detainees statements and news reports of abuse judge green noted that the possibility that evidence was obtain ed involuntarily from the accused or from other witnesses whether by interrogators at guantanamo or by foreign intelligence officials elsewhere could make such evidence unreliable and thus constitutionally inadmissible as basis on which to determine whether detainee is an enemy combatant judge green objected to the definition of enemy combatant because it appears to cover individuals who never committed belligerent act or who never directly supported hostilities against the us or its allies she noted that continued mca see

district judge robertson agreed finding inherent authority in the president as commanderinchief of the armed forces to create such tribunals outside of the existing statutory authority with which the military commission rules did not comply he also concluded that the geneva conventions apply to the whole of the conflict in afghanistan including under their protections all persons detained in connection with the hostilities there 67 and that hamdan was thus entitled to be treated as prisoner of war until his status was determined to be otherwise by competent tribunal in accordance with

before reaching the merits of the case the supreme court declined to accept the governments argument that congress by passing the dta had stripped the court of its jurisdiction to review habeas corpus challenges by or on behalf of guantanamo detainees whose petitions had already been filed 70 the court also declined to dismiss the appeal as urged by the government on the basis that federal courts should abstain from intervening in cases before military tribunals that have not been finally decided71 noting the dissimilarities between military commission trials and ordinary courtsmartial of service members pursuant to procedures established by congress72 the governments argument that the petitioner had rights conferred by the geneva conventions that could be adjudicated in federal court likewise did not persuade the court to dismiss the case regardless of whether the geneva conventions provide rights enforceable in article iii courts the court found that congress by incorporating the law of war into ucmj article 21 73 brought the geneva conventions within the scope of law to be applied by courts justice scalia joined by justices thomas and alito dissented arguing that the dta

with the governments position that congress had authorized the commissions either when it passed the authorization to use military continued whether this provision applies to pending cases the court found that the provis ion did not apply to hamdans petition because the case did not fall under either of the categories of cases over which the dta had created appellate review in the dc circuit the

aumf activated the presidents war powers it did not view the aumf as expanding the presidents powers beyond the authorization set forth in the ucmj the court also noted that the dta while recognizing the existence of military commissions does not specifically authorize them at most these statutes acknowledge general presidential authority to convene military commissions in circumstances where justified under the constitution and laws including the law of war76

those detained under us authority to challenge their detention on the basis that it violates any statute the constitution or treaty77 the dc circuit nevertheless held that the geneva conventions are never enforceable in federal courts78 the supreme court disagreed finding the conventions were applicable as incorporated by ucmj article 21 because compliance with the law of war is the condition upon which the authority set forth in article 21 is granted 79 in response to the alternative holding by the court below that hamdan as putative member of qaeda was not entitled to any of the protections accorded by the geneva conventions the court concluded that common article 3 of the geneva conventions applies even to members of qaeda according to them minimum baseline of protections including protection from the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples 80 while recognizing that common article 3 obviously tolerates great degree of flexibility in trying individuals captured during armed conflict and that its requirements are general ones crafted to accommodate wide variety of legal systems the court found that the military commissions under mco 1 did not meet these criteria in particular the military commissions did not qualify as regularly constituted because they deviated too far in the courts view from the rules that apply to courtsmartial without satisfactory explanation of the need for such deviation 81 justice alito joined by justices scalia and thomas dissented arguing that the court is bound to defer to the presidents plausible interpretation of the treaty language 75 pl

declared the military commissions as constituted under the presidents military order to be illegal it left open the possibility that changes to the military commission rules could cure any defects by bringing them within the law of war and conformity with the ucmj or by asking congress to authorize or craft rules tailored to the global war on terrorism gwot the court did not resolve the extent to which the detainees as aliens held outside of us territory have constitutional rights enforceable in federal court the decision may affect the treatment of detainees outside of their criminal trials for example in interrogations for intelligence purposes common article 3 of the geneva conventions mandates that all persons taking active part in hostilities including those who have laid down their arms or been incapacitated by capture or injury are to be treated humanely and protected from violence to life and person torture and outrages upon personal dignity in particular humiliating and degrading treatment insofar as these protections are incorporated in the ucmj and other laws it would seem the court is ready to interpret and adjudicate them to the extent it retains jurisdiction to do so it is not clear how the court views the scope of the gwot however because its decisions on the merits have been limited to cases arising out of hostilities in afghanistan the opinion reaffirms the holding in rasul v bush 82 that the aumf does not provide the president blank check and by finding in favor of noncitizen held overseas seems to have expanded the hamdi comment that whatever power the united states constitution envisions for the executive in its exchanges with other nations or with enemy organizations in times of conflict it most assuredly envisions role for all three branches when individual liberties are at stake83 the dissenting views also relied in good measure on actions taken by congress seemingly repudiating the view expressed earlier by the executive that any efforts by congress to legislate with respect to persons captured detained and possibly tried in connection with the gwot would be an unconstitutional intrusion into powers held exclusively by the president 84 expressly or implicitly all eight participating justices applied the framework set forth by justice jackson in his famous concurrence in the steel seizures case85 which accords greater deference to the president in cases involving national security where he acts with express congressional authority than when he acts alone the differing views among the justices seem to have been function of their interpretation of the aumf and other acts of congress as condoning or limiting executive actions 86 the military commissions act of 2006 likely resolves many issues regarding the scope of authority the president may exercise however the constitutionality of the various measures remains to be resolved assuming the courts retain jurisdiction to resolve them 82 542 us 466 2004 83

almarri differs significantly from cases discussed above in that the petitioner lawful alien resident was arrested and is imprisoned within the united states marri qatari student was arrested in december 2001 in peoria illinois and transported to new york city where he was held as material witness for the grand jury investigating the 911 attacks he was later charged with financial fraud and making false statements and transferred back to peoria before his case went to trial however he was declared an enemy combatant and transferred to military custody in south carolina almarris counsel filed petition for habeas corpus challenging almarris designation and detention as an enemy combatant the petition was eventually dismissed for lack of jurisdiction by the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit 87 and new petition was filed in the fourth circuit in march 2005 judge floyd agreed with the government that the detention was authorized by the aumf and transferred the case to federal magistrate to examine the factual allegations supporting the governments detention of the petitioner as an enemy combatant88 the government provided declaration asserting that almarri is closely associated with qaeda and had been sent to the united states prior to september 11 2001 to serve as sleeper agent for qaeda in order to facilitate terrorist activities and explore disrupting this countrys financial system through computer hacking89 the magistrate judge recommended the dismissal of the petition on the basis of information the government provided which almarri did not attempt to rebut and which the magistrate judge concluded was sufficient for due process purposes in line with the hamdi decision90 the district judge adopted the magistrate judges report and recommendations in full rejecting the petitioners argument that his capture away from foreign battlefield precluded his designation as an enemy combatant91 almarri appealed and the government moved to dismiss on the basis that the mca strips the court of jurisdiction the petitioner asserted that congress did not intend to deprive him of his right to habeas or that alternatively the mca is unconstitutional the majority avoided the constitutional question by finding that almarri do not meet the statutory definition as an alien who has been determined by the united states to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination92 87 almarri v rumsfeld 360 f3d 707 7th cir 2004 cert denied 543 us 809 2004 88 almarri v hanft 378 f supp2d 673 d sc 2005

the hamdi plurality stated that enemy combatant proceedings may be tailored to alleviate their uncommon potential to burden the executive at time of ongoing military conflict hearsay for example may need to be accepted as the most reliable available evidence from the government in such proceeding likewise the constitution would not be offended by presumption in favor of the governments evidence so long as that presumption remained rebuttable one and fair opportunity for rebuttal were provided thus once the government puts forth credible evidence that the habeas petitioner meets the enemycombatant criteria the onus could shift to the petitioner to rebut that evidence with more persuasive evidence that he falls outside the criteria 91 id at 77880 92 the court held that the mca requires twostep process for determining whether persons are properly detained as enemy combatants but that the presidents determination of the petitioners enemy combatant status fulfilled only

fall within the legal category of enemy combatant within the meaning of hamdi and that the government could continue to hold him only if it charges him with crime commences deportation proceedings obtains material witness warrant in connection with grand jury proceedings or detains him for limited time pursuant to the patriot act93 in so holding the majority rejected the governments contention that the aumf authorizes the presiden t to order the military to seize and detain persons within the united states under the facts asserted by the government or that alternatively the president has inherent constitutional authority to order the detention the government cited the hamdi decision and the fourth circuits decision in padilla v hanft94 to support its contention that almarri is an enemy combatant within the meaning of the aumf and the law of war the court however interpreted hamdi as confirming only that the aumf is explicit congressional authorization for the detention of individuals in the narrow category of individuals who were part of or supporting forces hostile to the united states or coalition partners in afghanistan and who engaged in an armed conflict against the united states there95 likewise padilla although captured in the united states could be detained pursuant to the aumf only because he had been prior to returning to the united states armed and present in combat zone in afghanistan as part of taliban forces during the conflict there with the united states96 the court explained that the two cases cited by the government hamdi and padilla involved situations similar to the world war ii case ex parte quirin 97 in which the supreme court agreed that eight german saboteurs could be tried by military commission because they were enemy belligerents within the meaning of the law of war98 in contrast almarris situation was to be likened to ex parte milligan 99 the civil war case in which the supreme court held that citizen of indiana accused of conspiring to commit hostile acts against the union was nevertheless civilian who was not amenable to military jurisdiction 100 the court concluded that enemy combatant status rests in accordance with the law of war on affiliation with the military arm of an enemy government in an international armed conflict judge hudson dissented arguing that the broad language of the aumf which authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations organizations or persons he determines were involved in the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 would continued the first step the court next found that almarri could t be said to be awaiting such determination within the meaning of the mca inasmuch as the government was argu ing on the merits that the presidential determination had provided all of the process that was due and the government had offered the possibility of bringing almarri before csrt only as an alternative course of action in the event th petition were dismissed further the majority looked to the legislative history of the mca from which it divined that congress did not intend to replace habeas review with the truncated review available under the amended dta in the case of aliens within the united states who it understood to have constitutional as opposed to merely statutory titlement to seek habeas review almarri v

district courts decision that almarri was not entitled to present any more evidence to refute the governments case against him four of the judges on the panel would have retained the earlier decision arguing that it was not within the courts power to expand the definition of enemy combatant beyond the lawofwar prin ciples at the heart of the supreme courts hamdi decision 103 however these four judges joined in judge traxlers opinion to remand for evidentiary proceedings in order at least to place the burden on the government to make an initial showing that normal due process protections are unduly burdensome and that the rapp declaration is the most reliable available evid ence supporting the governments allegations before it may order almarris military detention 104 judge traxler whose opinion is controlling for the case although not joined in full by any other panel member agreed with the four dissenting judges that the aumf grants the president the power to detain enemy combatants in the war agai nst qaeda including belligerents who enter our country for the purpose of committing hostile and warlike acts such as those carried out by the qaeda operatives on 911 105 accordingly he would define enemy combatant in the gwot to include persons who associate themselves with qaeda and travel to the united states for the avowed purpose of further pros ecuting that war on american soil even though the government cannot establish that the combatant also took up arms on behalf of that enemy and against our country in foreign combat zone of that war106 under this definition

did not agree that almarri had been afforded due process by the district court to challenge the factual basis for his designation as an enemy combatant while recognizing that the hamdi plurality had suggested that hearsay evidence might be adequate to satisfy due process requirements for proving enemy combatant status judge traxler did not agree that such relaxed evidentiary standards are necessarily appropriate when dealing with person arrested in the united states because almarri was seized and detained in this country he is entitled to habeas review by civilian judicial court and to the due process protections granted by our constitution interpreted and applied in the context of the facts interests and burdens at hand to determine what constitutional process almarri is due the

the provision does not create cause of action for detainees to ask court for relief based on inconsistent treatment and it divests the courts of jurisdiction to hear challenges by those detained at guantanamo bay based on their treatment or living conditions112 it also provides legal defense to us officers and agents who may be sued or prosecuted based on their treatment or interrogation of detainees113 this language appears to have been added as compromise because the administration reportedly sought to have the central intelligence agency excepted from the prohibition on cruel inhuman and degrading treatment on the grounds that the president needs maximum flexibility in dealing with the global war on terrorism114 the dta also includes modified version of the grahamlevin amendment115 which requires the defense department to submit to the armed services and judiciary committees the procedural rules for determining detainees status 116 the amendment neither authorizes nor requires formal status determination but it does require that certain congressional committees be notified 30 days prior to the implementation of any changes to the rules as initially adopted by the senate the amendment would have required these procedural rules to preclude evidence determined by the board or tribunal to have been obtained by undue coercion however the conferees modified the language so that the tribunal or board must assess to the extent practicable whether any statement derived from or relating to such detainee was obtained as result of coercion and the probative value if any of any such statement the grahamlevin amendment also eliminated the federal courts statutory jurisdiction over habeas claims by aliens detained at guantanamo ba but provides for limited appeals of status determinations made pursuant to the dod procedures for combatant status review tribunals csrts in june 2008 the supreme court invalidated the provision that eliminated habeas corpus jurisdiction but stated that the dta appellate process remains intact 117 although it appears that the process is not an adequate substitute for habeas review however it longer constitutes the sole avenue by which detainee may seek judicial review of his detention as detainee may also seek habeas review by federal district court it appears that courts will not require detainees to exhaust their options under the dta appeals process prior to seeking habeas review at least in cases currently pending 111 section 1003d of pl 109148 for more information see crs report rl32438 convention against

of dispute in the detention an d treatment of detainees is the application of the geneva convention as noted previously the habeas corpus statute has traditionally provided for among other things challenges to allegedly unlawful detentions based on rights found in treaties123 thus for instance common article 3 of the 1949 geneva conventions which prohibits the passing of sentences and the carryi ng out of executions w ithout previous judgment pronounced by regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples has been used as basis for challenging the confinement of detainees124 section 5 of the mca however specifically precludes the application of the geneva conventions to habeas or other civil proceedings125 further the mca provides that the geneva conventions may not be claimed as source of rights by an alien who is subject to military commission proceedings126 rather congress deems that the military commission structure established by the act complies with the requirement under common article 3 of the geneva convention that trials be by regularly constituted court127 in addition the act provides that the president shal l have the authority to interpret the meaning of the geneva conventions128 the intended effect of this provision is unclear while the president generally has role in the negotiation implementation and domestic enforcement of treaty obligations 129 this power does not generally extend to interpreting treaty obligations role more traditionally associated with courts130 in general congress is prohibited from exercising powers allocated to another branch of government131 in united states v klein 132 the congress 123 28 usc 2241 124 gpw art 3 1d see hamdan 126 sct at

judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples for purposes of common article 3 of the geneva conventions while this language could be construed as directing court to find that the mca does not conflict with the geneva conventions better reading would appear to be that to the extent that there is conflict between the mca and the geneva conventions that the mca should be given precedence see generally robertson v seattle audubon socy 503 us 429 1992 128 mca 6a3a provides that the president has the authority for the united states to interpret the meaning and

as to the effect of presidential pardon133 similarly law that was specifically intended to grant the authority of the president to adjudicate or remedy treaty violations could violate the doctrine of separation of powers as providing relief from acts in violation of treaties is judicial branch function134 instead what appears to be the main thrust of this language is to establish the authority of the president within the executive branch to issue interpretative regulations by executive order135 however the context in which this additional authority would be needed is unclear one possible intent of this provision is that the president is being given the authority to interpret the geneva convention for diplomatic purposes eg to define treaty obligations and encourage other countries to conform to such definitions this interpretation seems unlikely as the presidents power in this regard is already firmly established136 another possible meaning is that the president is being given the authority to apply the geneva conventions to particular fact situations such as specifying what type of inte rrogation techniques may be lawfully applied to particular individual suspected of being an enemy combatant this interpretation is possible but it is not clear how the power to interpret woul d be significant in that situation as the mca precludes application of the geneva convention in those contexts in which such interrogations would be challengedmilitary commissions habeas corpus or any other civil proceeding137 the more likely intent of this language would be to give the president the authority to promulgate regulations prescribing standards of behavior of employees and agents of federal agencies for instance this language might be seen as authorizing the president to issue regulations to implement how agency personnel should comply with the geneva conventions policies which might otherwise be addressed at the agency level thus for instance if the cia had established internal procedures regarding how to perform interrogation consistent with the geneva convention then this language would explici tly authorize the president to amend such procedures by executive order 138 whether the president already had such power absent this language is beyond the scope of this report 133 the court struck down the law essentially holding that the congress had an illegitimate purpose in passage of the law the language of the proviso shows plainly that it does not intend to withhold appellate jurisdiction except as means to an end its great and controlling purpose is to deny to pardons granted by the president the effect which this court had adjudged them to have it seems to us that this is not an exercise of the acknowledged power of congress to make exceptions and prescribe regulations to the appellate power 80 us at 146 the court also found that the statue impaired the effect of presidential pardon and thus infringeed the constitutional power of the executive id at 147 134 see generally miller v french 530 us 327 35051 2000souter j concurring 135 mca 6a3b 136 if the country with which the treaty is made is dissatisfied with the action of the

section 1405e of pl 10963 mca 7a it may be intended to apply to habeas cases brought by us citizens or by aliens who do not fall under the definition of enemy combatant on the other hand as will be

president to detain american citizens as enemy combatants without trial 142 the prohibition in the mca with respect to habeas corpus petitions applied only to those filed by or on behalf of aliens detained by the united states as enemy combatants however the mca can be read by implication to permit the detention of us citizens as enemy combatants although it does not permit their trial by military commission which could affect their entitlement to relief using habeas corpus procedures plurality of the supreme court held in 2004 in hamdi v rumsfeld 143 that the president has the authority to detain us citizens as enemy combatants pursuant to the aumf144 but that the determination of combatant status is subject to constitutional due process considerations the hamdi plurality was limited to an understanding that the phrase enemy combatant means an individual whowas part of or supporting forces hostile to the united states or coalition partners in afghanistan and who engaged in an armed conflict against the united states there 145 but left it to lower courts to flesh out more precise definition the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit found that the defi nition continued to apply to us citizen who returned to the united states from afghanistan and was arrested at the airport146 more recently the fourth circuit appears to have expanded the definition of enemy combatant to individuals arrested in the united states on suspicion of pl anning to participate in terrorist acts without necessarily having engaged in hostilities in afghanistan see discussion of almarri supra in theory the executive branch could detain citizen as an enemy combatant and argue that the definition of unlawful enemy combatant provided in the mca which does not explicitly limit the definition to aliens and includes persons who provide material support to terror groups engaged in hostilities against the united states should also apply to the detention

under the mca the citizen combatant would not be able to assert rights based on the geneva convention in support of his contention that he is not an enemy combatant in that sense us citizens could be affected by the mca even though it does not directly apply to us citizens on the other hand since the mca definition for unlawful enemy combatant applies on its face only for the purposes of the new chapter 47a of title 10 us code providing for the trial by military commission of alien unlawful enemy combatants it may be argued that outside of that context the term enemy combatant should be understood in the ordinary sense that is to include only persons who participate directly in hostilities against the united states this interpretation seems unlikely given that it would also mean that this narrower definition of enemy combatant was also meant to apply in the context of the mca s habeas corpus provisions such that some aliens who fall under the jurisdiction of military commission under the mca would nevertheless have been able to ar gue that the mca did not affect their right to petition for habeas corpus or pursue any other cause of action in us court reading that does not seem consistent with congresss probable intent further it does not appear that congress meant to apply different definition of enemy combatant to persons depending on their citizenship congress could specify that us citi zens captured in the context of the global war on terror be subject to trial in us court for treason or violation of any other statute or prescribe procedures for determining whether us citizens are subject to detention as enemy combatants if constitutional but it has not done so

access to classified information attorneys access to clients and other matters the petitioners sought to have the court adopt rules similar to what the district court had ordered when the cases were

the court to hold status determination invalid as arbitrary and capricious there was need for it to evaluate the conduct of other detainees csrts the court also denied as unnecessary the petitioners motion to appoint special master the court also promised to enter protective order to implement guidelines for handling classified and sensitive information and for government monitoring of attorney client written communications legal mail again stressing its mandate under the dta to determine whether preponderance of the evidence supports csrts status determination the court found that counsel for the detainees to aid in their capacity to assist the court should be presumed to have need to know all government information concerning their clients except for highly sensitive information in which case the government could present the evidence to the court ex parte the court rejected the governments proposal that would have allowed the government rather than the court to determine what unclassified information would be required to be kept under seal with respect to legal mail the court agreed to the gove rnments proposal to have mail from attorneys to detainees reviewed by privilege team composed of department of defense personnel not involved in the litigation to redact information not pertinent to matters within the courts limited scope of review the government asked the panel to reconsider the ruling based on its belief that the order would require the government to undertake an overly burdensome search of all relevant federal agencies in order to create new record for each detainee that would be entirely different from the record reviewed by the csrt for that case the court denied the request for rehearing explaining its view that its previous order would not require search for information that is not reasonably available bismullah ii 148 the court also suggested that the government might instead convene new csrts to reconfirm the detainees status this time ensuring that the relevant documents are retained for the purpose of review under the dta the government also objected to the requirement that it turn over classified information to the petitioners counsel on the basis of the risk to intelligence sources and methods as well as the burden of conducting the necessary reviews to determine which information must be turned over the court rejected the argument pointing out that dod regulations declare classified information to be not reasonably available where the originating agency declines to authorize its use in the csrt process in light of this fact the court suggested the burden of reviewing the information should not be as great as the government had argued the government then asked for an banc hearing but the dc circuit evenly divided declined 149 the government then sought expedited review at the supreme court urging the court to decide the cases concurrently with the boumediene case but the court took action on the request150 instead it granted certiorari and vacated the decision remanding for reconsideration in light of its decision in boumediene 151 on august 22 2008 the dc circuit reinstated without explanation its decisions in bismullah i and bismullah ii presumably because it did not find the boumediene ruling to conflict with its decisions in these cases152 148 bismullah ii 503 f 3d 137 dc cir

under the dta was matter of interest to the supreme court as it was considering boumediene and may have had some bearing on the ultimate determination in that case that the dta procedures are not an adequate substitute for the writ of habeas corpus accordingly it may be worthwhile to review some of the shortcomings described by the dissent the only opinion of the panel that addressed the adequacy of the dta procedures as substitute for habeas corpus judge janice rogers brown concurring separately in bismullah i set forth number of issues she felt call into question the fairness of the csrt proceedings for example she noted that the detainee bears the burden of proving that he is not an enemy combatanta term she described as elastic in nature even though the detainee may not be aware of the information he is expected to rebut all without the assistance of counsel153 further the record presented to the csrt is limited by the executive and the detainees only recourse for seeking further evid ence is through the dta review process if the detainee is successful in obtaining new evidence his remedy appears to be new csrt154 finally she noted evidence that the csrts do not necessarily follow their own regulations regarding the collection and presentation of evidence155 g18g138g155g145g138g157g561g159g495g561g9g138g157g142g156g561 in october 2007 while the governments petition to the supreme court for certiorari in the bismullah case was pending the government produced to the counsel of husaifa parhat one of the parties to the bismullah case record including both classified and unclassified material of what was actually presented to parhats csrt parhat subsequently filed separate motion to the dc circuit requesting review of the csrts determination that he was an enemy combatant in june 2008 threejudge panel for the dc circuit ruled in the case of parhat v gates that petitioner had been improperly deemed an enemy combatant by csrt the first ruling of its kind by federal court because the courts opinion contained classified information only redacted version has been released156 parhat an ethnic chinese uigher captured in pakistan in december 2001 was found to be an enemy combatant by the csrt on account of his affiliation with uighur independence group known as the east turkistan islamic movement etim which was purportedly associated with qaeda and the taliban and engaged in hostilities against the united states and its coalition partners the basis for parhats alleged affiliation with the etim was that an etim leader ran camp in afghanistan where parhat had lived and received military training for his part parhat denied membership in the etim or engagement in hostilities against the united states and claimed he traveled to afghanistan solely to join the resistance against china which was not alleged to have been coalition partner of the united states the circuit court agreed with parhat that the record before the csrt did not support the finding that he was an enemy combatant as that term had been defined by the dod and accordingly the csrts determination was not supported by preponderance of the evidence and consistent

the dod defined an enemy combatant as an individual who was part of or supporting taliban or qaida forces or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the united states or its coa lition partners this includes any person who has committed belligerent act or has directly supporte d hostilities in aid of enemy armed forces158 both parties agreed that for detainee who is not member of the taliban or qaeda to be deemed an enemy combatant under this definition the government must demonstrate by preponderance of the evidence that 1 the detainee was part of or supporting forces 2 those forces are associated with qaeda or the taliban and 3 the forces are engaged in hostilities against the united states or its coalition partners 159 the circuit court found that the evidence presented by the government to support the second and third elements was insufficient to support the csrts determination that parhat was an enemy combatant most significantly the court found th at the principal evidence presented by the government regarding these elementsfour government intelligence documents describing etim activities and the groups relationship with qaeda and the talibandid not provide any of the underlying reporting upon which the documents bottomline assertions are founded nor any assessment of the reliability of that reporting160 as result the circuit court found that neither the csrt nor the reviewing court itself were capable of assessing the reliability of the assertions made by the documents accordingly those bare assertions cannot sustain the determination that parhat is an enemy combatant 161 and the csrts designation was therefore improper the circuit court stressed that it was not suggesting that hearsay evidence could never reliably be used to determine whether person was an enemy combatant or that the government must always submit the basis for its factual assertions to enable an assessment of its claims however evidence must be presented in form or with fficient additional information that permits the csrt and court to assess its reliability 162 having found that the evidence considered by the csrt was insufficient to support the designation of parhat as an enemy combatant the circuit court next turned to the question of remedy although parhat urged the court to order his release or transfer to country other than china the court declined to grant such relief postulating that the government might wish to hold another csrt in which it could present additional evidence to support parhats designation as an enemy combatant while acknowledging that the dta did not expressly grant the court release authority over detainees the court stated that there was nonetheless strong argumentthat release authority is implicit in our authority to determine whether the government has sustained 157 although parhat argued that the dods regulatory definiti on of enemy combatant exceeded the scope authorized by the 2001 aumf the circuit court declined to reach this issue finding that the government provided insufficient evidence to demonstrate that parhat met the dods own regulatory definition 158 id 2008 wl 2576977

the petitioners in boumediene are aliens detained at guantanamo who sought habeas review of their continued detention rather than pursuing an appeal of their designation as enemy combatants by csrts using the dta appeals process the petitioners sought to have the district court decisions denying habeas review reversed on the basis that the mcas courtstripping167 provision was unconstitutional168 on appeal the dc circuit affirmed holding that the mca stripped it and all other federal courts of jurisdiction to consider petitioners habeas applications relying upon its earlier opinion in odah v united states169 and the 1950 supreme court case johnson v eisentrager 170 in which the supreme court found that the constitutional writ of habeas was not available to enemy aliens imprisoned for war crimes in postwwii germany the dc circuit held that the mcas elimination of habeas jurisdiction did not operate as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ because aliens held by the united states in foreign territory do not have constitutional right to habeas 171 consequently the court did not examine whether the dta provides an adequate substitution for habeas review 163 parhat 2008 wl

review172 with three justices dissenting to the denial and two justices explaining the basis for their support173 in june 2007 however the court reversed its denial and granted ce rtiorari to consider the consolidated cases of boumediene and odah in 54 opinion authored by justice kennedy the court reversed the dc circuit and held that petitioners had constitutional right to habeas that was withdrawn by the mca in violation of the constitutions suspension clause174 g5g152g151g156g157g146g157g158g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g20g146g144g145g157g561g157g152g561g10g138g139g142g138g156g561 the petitioners in boumediene argued that they possess constitutional right to habeas and that the mca deprived them of this right in contravention of the suspension clause which prohibits the suspension of the writ of habeas except when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it the mca did not expressly purport to be formal suspension of the writ of habeas and the government did not make such claim to the court instead the government argued that aliens designated as enemy combatants and detained outside the jure territory of the united states have constitutional rights including the constitutional privilege to habeas and that therefore stripping the courts of jurisdiction to hear petitioners habeas claims did not violate the suspension clause the court began its analysis by surveying the history and origins of the writ of habeas corpus emphasizing the importance placed on the writ for the framers while also characterizing its prior jurisprudence as having been careful not to foreclose the possibility that the protections of the suspension clause have expanded along with post1789 developments that define the present scope of the writ175 the court characterized the suspension clause as not only vital instrument for protecting individual liberty but also means to ensure that the judiciary branch would have except in cases of formal suspension timetested device the writ to maintain the delicate balance of governance between the branches and prevent cyclical abuses of the writ by the executive and legislative branches 176 the court stated that the separationofpowers doctrine and the history shaping the design of the suspension clause informed its interpretation of the reach and purpose of the clause and the constitutional writ of habeas the court found the historical record to be inc onclusive for resolving whether the framers would have understood the constitutional writ of habeas as extending to suspected enemy aliens held in foreign territory over which the united states exercised plenary but not jure control nonetheless the court interpreted the suspension clause as having full effect at guantanamo while the court did not question the governments position that cuba maintains legal sovereignty over guantanamo under the terms of the 1903 lease giving the us plenary control over the 172 boumediene v bush 127 sct 1478

justices souter and ginsburg would have granted certiorari to provide immediate attention to the issues the dissenters viewed it as unlikely that further treatment by the lower courts might elucidate

least when applied to noncitizens the constitution necessarily stops where jure sovereignty ends177 instead the court characterized its prior jurisprudence as recognizing that the constitutions extraterritorial application turns on objective factors and practical concerns178 here the court emphasized the functional approach taken in the insular cases where it had assessed the availability of constitutional rights in incorporated and unincorporated territories under the control of united states 179 although the government argued that the courts subsequent decision in eisentrager stood for the proposition that the constitutional writ of habeas does not extend to enemy aliens captured and detained abroad the court found this reading to be overly constrained according to the court interpreting the eisentrager ruling in this formalistic manner would be inconsistent with the functional approach taken by the court in other cases concerning the constitutions extraterritorial application 180 and would disregard the practical considerations that informed the eisentrager courts decision that the petitioners were precluded from seeking habeas based on the language found in the eisentrager decision and other cases concerning the extraterritorial application of the constitution the court deemed at least three factors to be relevant in assessing the extraterritorial scope of the suspension clause 1 the citizenship and status of the detainee and the adequacy of the status determination process 2 the nature of the site where the person is seized and detained and 3 practical obstacles inherent in resolving the prisoners entitlement to the writ applying this framework the court characterized petitioners circumstances in the instant case as being significantly different from those of the detainees at issue in eisentrager among other things the court noted that unlike the detainees in eisentrager the petitioners denied that they were enemy combatants and the governments control of the postwwii occupied german territory in which the eisentrager detainees were held was not nearly as significant nor secure as its control over the territory where the petitioners are located the court also found that the procedural protections afforded to guantanamo detainees in csrt hearings are far more limited than those afforded to the eisentrager detainees tried by military commission and we conclude fall well short of the procedures and adversarial mechanisms that would eliminate the need for habeas corpus review 181 while acknowledging that it had never before held that noncitizens detained in another countrys territory have any rights under the us constitution the court concluded that the case before it lacked any precise historical parallel182 in particular the court noted that the guantanamo 177 id at 2253 178 id at 2258 179 see lima v bidwell 182 u s 1 1901 dooley v united states 182 u s 222 1901 armstrong v united states 182

decided that petitioners possessed constitutional privilege to habeas corpus the court next assessed whether the courtstripping measure of mca 7 was impermissible under the suspension clause because the mca did not purport to be formal suspension of the writ the question before the court was whether congress had provided an adequate substitute for habeas corpus the government argued that the mca compli ed with the suspension clause because it applied the dta s review process to petitioners which the government claimed was constitutionally adequate habeas substitute though the court declined to offer comprehensive summary of the requisites for an adequate substitute for habeas corpus it nonetheless deemed the habeas privilege at minimum as entitling prisoner to meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he is being held pursuant to the erroneous application or interpretation of relevant law and empowering court to order the conditional release of an individual unlawfully detained though release need not be the exclusive remedy or appropriate in every instance where the writ is granted 183 additionally the necessary scope of habeas review may be broader depending upon the rigor of any earlier proceedings184 the court noted that petitioners identified myriad of alleged deficiencies in the csrt process which limited detainees ability to present evidence rebutting the governments claim that he is an enemy combatant among other things cited deficiencies include constraints upon the detainees ability to find and present evidence at the csrt stage to challenge the governments case the failure to provide detainee with assistance of counsel limiting the detainees access to government records other than those that are unclassified potentially resulting in detainee being unaware of critical allegations relied upon by the government to order his detention and the fact that the detainees ability to confront witnesses may be more theoretical than real 185 given the minimal limitations placed upon the admission of hearsay evidence while the court did not determine whether the csrts as presently constituted satisfy due process standards it agreed with petitioners that there was considerable risk of error in the tribunals findings of fact186 given that the consequence of error may be detention for the duration of hostilities that may last generation or more this is risk too serious to ignore187 the court held that for either the writ of habeas or an adequate substitute to function as an effective remedy for petitioners court conducting collateral proceeding must have the ability to 1 correct errors in the csrt process 2 assess the sufficiency of the evidence against the 183 boumediene at 226667 184 id at 2268 185 id at 2269 186 id at 2270 187

evidence that was not introduced in the prior proceeding the court held that the dta review process is facially inadequate substitute for habeas review it listed number of potential constitutional infirmities in the review process including the absence of provisions 1 empowering the dc circuit to order release from detention 2 permitting petitioners to challenge the president s authority to detain them indefinitely 3 enabling the appellate court to review or correct the csrts findings of fact and 4 permitting the detainee to present exculpatory evidence discovered after the conclusion of csrt proceedings as result the court deemed mca 7s application of the dta review process to petitioners as failing to provide an adequate substitute for habeas therefore effecting an unconstitutional suspension of the writ in light of this conclusion the court held that petitioners could immediately pursue habeas review in federal district court without first obtaining review of their csrt designations from the dc circuit as would otherwise be required under the dta review process while prior jurisprudence recognized that prisoners are generally required to exhaust alternative remedies before seeking federal habeas relief the court found that petitioners in the instant case were entitled to prompt habeas hearing given the length of their detention the court stressed however that except in cases of undue delay federal courts should generally refrain from considering habeas petitions of detainees being held as enemy combatants until after the csrt had an opportunity to review their status acknowledging that the government possesses legitimate interest in protecting sources and methods of intelligence gathering the court announced that it expected courts reviewing guantanamo detainees habeas claims to use discretion to accommodate this interest to the greatest extent possible so as to avoid widespread dissemination of classified information 188

federal district court for habeas review of status determinations made by csrt however the full consequences of the boumediene decision are likely to be significantly broader while the petitioners in boumediene sought habeas review of their designation as enemy combatants the courts ruling that the constitutional writ of habeas extends to guantanamo suggests that detainees may also seek judicial review of claims concerning unlawful conditions of treatment or confinement or to protest planned transfer to the custody of another country189 the conduct of trials before military commissions at guantanamo may also be affected by boumediene as enemy combatants may now potentially raise constitutional arguments against their trial and conviction aliens convicted of war crimes before military commissions may also potentially seek habeas review of their designation as an enemy combatant by the csrt designation that served as legal requisite for their subsequent prosecution before military commission 188 id at 2275 189 see boumediene at 2274 in view of our holding we need not discuss the reach of the writ with respect to claims of unlawful conditions of treatment or confinement

were an inadequate substitute for habeas it made judgment as to whether the csrts as currently constituted satisfy due process standards and emphasized that both the dta and the csrt process remain intact190 whether these procedures violate due process standards facially or as applied in given case and whether particular detainee is being unlawfully held are issues that will be addressed by the district court when reviewing the habeas claims of guantanamo detainees some 250 habeas petitions have been filed on behalf of guantanamo detainees in the us district court for the district of columbia in the aftermath of the boumediene ruling the district court adopted resolution for the coordination and management of guantanamo cases the resolution calls for all current and future guantanamo cases to be transferred by the judge to whom they have been assigned to senior judge thomas f hogan who has been designated to coordinate and manage all guantanamo cases so that they may be addressed as expeditiously as possible as required by the supreme court in boumediene v bush 191 judge hogan is responsible for identifying and ruling on procedural issues common to the cases the transferring judge will retain the case for all other purposes though judge hogan is to confer with those judges whose cases raise common substantive issues and he may address those issues with the consent of the transferring judge district court judges richard j leon and emmet g sullivan have declined to transfer their cases for coordination and it is possible that the three judges may reach differing opinions regarding issues common to their respective cases

questions regarding the scope of the writ of habeas corpus and what options are open to congress to make rules for the detention of suspected terrorists the following sections provide brief background of the writ of habeas corpus in the united states outline some proposals for responding to the boumediene holding and discuss relevant constitutional considerations the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum also known as the great writ has its origin in fourteenth century england192 it provides the means for those detained by the government to ask court to order their warden to explain the legal authority for their detention in the early days of the republic its primary use was to challenge executive detention without trial or bail or pursuant to ruling by court without jurisdiction but the writ has expanded over the years to include variety of collateral challenges to convictions or sentences based on alleged violations of fundamental constitutional rights 193 the habeas statute

tests the legality of the detention and the custodians authority to detain if the detention is not supported by law the detainee is to be released195 minor irregularities in trial procedures that do not amount to violations of fundamental constitutional rights are generally to be addressed on direct appeal196 article i 9 cl 2 of the constitution provides the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it given the emphasis the rasul court had placed on the distinction between the statutory and constitutional entitlement to habeas corpus it might have seemed reasonable to suppose that congress retained the power to revoke by statute what it had earlier granted without offending either the court or the constitution without regard to establishing public safety justification however as the boumediene case demonstrates the special status accorded the writ by the suspension clause complicates matters the relevance of the distinction between statutory and constitutional privilege of habeas corpus is not entirely clear the federal courts power to review petitions under habeas corpus has historically relied on statute 197 but it has been explained that the constitution obligates congress to provide efficient means by which the writ should receive life and activity198 while the court has stated that at the absolute minimum the suspension clause protects the writ as it existed in 1789199 it has also presumed that the suspension clause of the constitution refers to the writ as it exists today rather than as it existed in 1789200 the boumediene court declined to adopt date of reference by which the constitutional scope of the writ is to be judged201 accordingly it remains unclear whether statutory enhancements of habeas review can ever be rolled back without implicating the suspension clause202 the constitutionally mandated scope of the writ may turn on the same kinds of objective factors and practical considerations that the court stated would determine the territorial scope of the writ under boumediene it appears that congresss ability to revoke altogether the courts jurisdiction over habeas petitions by certain classes of persons is constrained by the constitution but congress has the power to impose some procedural regulations that may limit how courts consider such cases 203 congress also retains the option of withdrawing habeas jurisdiction if it 195 ex parte watkins 28 us 3 pet 193 201 1830 marshall cj the writ of habeas corpus

provide an adequate substitute but indicated that the prisoners are entitled to meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that they are being held pursuant to the erroneous application or interpretation of relevant law205 more direct option to affect the outcome of habeas cases brought by detainees may involve enacting clear statutory definition of who may be detained and the purpose of the detention along with an appropriate procedure designed to distinguish those who meet the definition from those who do not such an approach could potentially increase certainty with respect to courts decisions regarding whether the detention of particular alleged enemy combatants comports with statutes and treaties although constitutionally based claims may remain less predictable congress could formally suspend the writ with respect to the detainees although it is unclear whether congresss views regarding the requirements of public safety are justiciable 206 if they are then reviewing courts assessment of the constitutionality of habeassuspending legislation would likely turn on whether qaedas terrorist attacks upon the united states qualify as rebellion or invasion and whether the court

protections afforded to detainees in csrt status hearings legislation addressing some or all of the potenti procedural inadequacies in the csrt process identified in boumediene might permit judicial review of csrt determinations to be further streamlined attorney general michael mukasey has recommende d that congress enact new legislation to eliminate the dta appeals process and make habeas corpus the sole avenue for detainees to challenge their detention in civilian court and also to eliminate challenges to conditions of confinement or transfers out of us custody in speech before the american enterprise institute on july 21 2008207 general mukasey discussed this suggestion along with five other points he feels congress should address courts should be prohibited from ordering that an alien captured and detained abroad be brought to the united states for court proceedings or be admitted and released into the united states procedures should be put in place to ensure that intelligence information including sources and methods would be protected from disclosure to terrorist suspects 204 see united states v hayman 342 us 205 1952 hill v united states 368 us 424 1962

prevented from bringing habeas petitions until the completion of their trials congress should reaffirm the authority to detain as enemy combatants persons who have engaged in hostilities or purposefully supported qaeda the taliban and associated organizations congress should establish sensible procedures for habeas challenges by assigning one district court exclusive jurisdiction over the cases with one judge deciding common legal issues by adopting rules that strike reasonable balance between the detainees rights to fair hearing and our national security needs that would not provide greater protection than we would provide to american citizens held as enemy combatants in this conflict and ensuring that court proceedings are not permitted to interfere with the mission of our armed forces other proposals that have been floated include the creation of new national security court to authorize preventive detention of terror suspects 208 or the use of civilian or military courts to prosecute all detainees who cannot be released to their home country or another country willing to take them among the issues associated with prosecuting all of the detainees in civilian court is that the detainees may not have committed any crimes cognizable in federal court persons accused of engaging in terrorist acts including attempts conspiracies and the like against the united states could likely be prosecuted 209 but jurisdiction over offenses involving the provision of material support to terrorist organization abroad is somewhat more limited and for acts occurring prior to 2004 included only persons subject to the jurisdiction of the united states210 congress could also take action and allow the courts to address the issues in the course of deciding the habeas

given case and whether particular detainee is being unlawfully held are issues that will be addressed by the district court when reviewing the habeas claims of guantanamo detainees boumediene considered challenges to the legality of detention the issue at the heart of most of the habeas challenges brought by guantanamo detainees to date however there are also some cases challenging the conditions under which detainee is being held these two categories of challenges may involve different procedural routes and the application of different constitutional rights the extent to which congress may limit the scope of challenges guantanamo detainees may bring may turn on the unresolved question of which constitutional rights apply to aliens detained in territory abroad the supreme court has not directly addressed whether there must exist judicial forum to vindicate all constitutional rights justice scalia has pointed out that there are particular cases such as political questions cases where all constitutional review is in effect precluded213 other commentators point to sovereign immunity and the ability of the government to limit the remedies available to plaintiffs214 however the court has in cases involving particular rights generally found requirement that effective judicial remedies must be available215 although the extent of constitutional rights enjoyed by aliens outside the territory of the united states is subject to continuing debate the right of aliens within the united states to liberty except when restricted in accordance with due

challenging the validity of decisions by csrt that detainee is an enemy combatant the dc circuit court of appeals has not fully clarified the scope of evidence it may review in reaching such

of the csrt proceedings is subject to review and that extrinsic evidence not already part of the record should not be subject to discovery 216 the dc circuit however rejected that view holding that

constitutional review of whether the standards and procedures utilized in the military proceedings below were consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states this seems to bring the scope of dta proceedings closer to that which would be available in habeas review however habeas challenges may also permit challenges to detention not based solely on the adequacy of csrt procedures first there is statutory requirement that all detainees receive csrt determination in order to be detained nor that detainees receive any kind of hearing within any certain period of time after their capture this might have left some detainees without effective means to pursue dta challenge moreover it appears that some detainees who were determined by csrts to be properly classified as enemy combatants have been released from guantanamo without new determination which may call into question the importance of the csrt procedure as the primary means for obtaining release and therefore the sole focus of collateral challenge detainees may also be transferred or released based on the results of periodic reviews conducted by administrative review boards arbs 218 to determine whether the detainee is longer threat or that it is in the interest of the united states and its allies to release the prisoner there is opportunity under the dta to appeal the result of an arb finding while new evidence uncovered by this process may result in the convening of new csrt to determine continued enemy combatant status219 the dta does not provide an avenue to appeal decision not to convene new csrt220 the supreme courts ruling that the constitutional writ of habeas extends to guantanamo suggests that detainees may seek habeas review in such cases

in persuading csrt that they are not enemy combatants do not have right to release or even right initially to be informed of the csrts decision if the csrt director approves finding that detainee is longer an enemy combatant the detainee may be held for as long as it takes the government to arrange for his transfer to his home country or another country willing to provide asylum during which time he need not be told of the csrts conclusion 241 according to one report of unclassified csrt records in the event the csrt director disapproves of the finding new csrts may be convened apparently without notifying or permitting the participation of the detainee although the government might present new evidence to the new panel242 the supreme court viewed the lack of an express power permitting the courts to order the release of detainee as factor relevant to the dtas inadequacy as substitute proceeding243 in the context of csrt determinations the government suggested to the court that remand for new csrt proceedings would be the appropriate remedy for determination that an error of law was made or that new evidence must be considered244 whether such remedy would be acceptable probably depends on whether measures are taken to decrease the risk of error under the csrt procedures it seems unlikely that court would consider itself constitutionally obligated to permit detainee

remains unsettled although the district court has so far declined to enjoin military commissions247 supreme court precedent suggests that habeas corpus proceedings may be invoked to challenge the jurisdiction of military court even where habeas corpus has been suspended248 habeas may remain available to defendants who can make colorable claim not to be enemy combatants within the meaning of the mca and therefore to have the right not to be subject to military trial at all without necessarily having to await verdict or exhaust the appeals process 249 interlocutory challenges contesting whether the charges make out valid violation of the law of war for example seem less likely to be entertained on habeas petition250

use of habeas corpus or other avenues of redress by the detainees is an unconstitutional limitation the constitution contains few requirements regarding the jurisdiction of the federal courts article iii section 1 of the constitution provides that the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish251 the judges both of the supreme and inferior courts shall hold their offices during good behaviour and shall at stated times receive for their services compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office although article iii provides for supreme court headed by the chief justice of the united states252 nothing else about the courts structure and operation is set forth leaving the size and composition of the court as well as the specifics if any of the lower federal courts to congress253 utilizing its power to establish inferior courts congress has also created the united states district courts254 the courts of appeals for the thirteen circuits255 and other federal courts256 on its face there is limit on the power of congress to make exceptions to or otherwise regulate the supreme courts appellate jurisdiction to create inferior federal courts or to specify their jurisdiction however the same is true of the constitutions other grants of legislative authority in article i and elsewhere which does not prevent the application of other constitutional principles to those powers the constitution is filled with provisions that grant congress or the states specific power to legislate in certain areas justice black wrote for the court in different context but these granted powers are always subject to the limitations that they may not be exercised in way that violates other specific provisions of the constitution 257 justice harlan seems to have had the same thought in mind when he said that with respect to congresss power over jurisdiction of the federal courts what such exceptions and regulations should be it is for congress in its wisdom to establish having of course due regard to all the constitution258 thus it is clear that while congress has significant authority over administration of the judicial system it may not exercise its authority over the courts in way that violates constitutional rights 251 the latter part of this quoted language dovetails with clause 9 of 8 of article i under which congress is authorized to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme court 252 although the position of chief justice is not specifically mandated it is referenced in article i 3 cl 6 in connection with the procedure for the senate impeachment trial of president the senate shall have the sole power to try all im peachments when sitting for that purpose they shall be on oath or affirmation when the presiden t of the united states is tried the chief justice shall preside and person shall be convicted without concurrence of twothirds of the members present 253 by the judiciary act of 1789 it was established that the court was to be composed of the chief justice and five associate justices the number of justices was gradually increased to ten until in 1869 the number was fixed at nine where it has remained to this day 254 28 usc 81131 132 255 28 usc 41 43 district of columbia circuit fi rst circuit

over the courts in way that violates precepts of separation of powers the doctrine of separation of powers is not found in the text of the constitution but has been discerned by courts scholars and others in the allocation of power in the first three articles that is the legislative power is vested in congress the executive power is vested in the president and the judicial power is vested in the supreme court and the inferior federal courts that interpretation is also consistent with the speeches and writings of the framers beginning with buckley v valeo 261 the supreme court has reemphasized separation of powers as vital element in american federal government262 justice kennedy in boumediene stressed his view that the writ of habeas corpus itself plays an important role in preserving the operation of separation of powers principles263 the federal courts have long held that congress may not act to denigrate the authority of the judicial branch in the 1782 decision in hayburn s case 264 several justices objected to congressional enactment that authorized the federal courts to hear claims for disability pensions for veterans the courts were to certify their decisions to the secretary of war who was authorized either to award each pension or to refuse it if he determined the award was an imposition or mistaken the justices on circuit contended that the law was unconstitutional because the judicial power was committed to separate department and because the subjecting of courts opinion to revision or control by an officer of the executive or the legislative branch was not authorized by the constitution congress thereupon repealed the objectionable features of the 259 laurence tribe jurisdictional gerrymandering zoning disfavored rights out of the federal courts 16 h

been applied to prevent congress from vesting jurisdiction over commonlaw bankruptcy claims in nonarticle iii courts266 allocation of court jurisdiction by congress is co mplicated by the presence of state court systems that can and in some cases do hold concurrent jurisdiction over cases involving questions of federal statutory and constitutional law thus th power of congress over the federal courts is really the power to determine how federal cases are to be allocated among state courts federal inferior courts and the united states supreme court congress has significant authority to determine which of these various courts will adjudicate such cases and the method by which this adjudication will occur for most purposes the exercise of this power is relatively noncontroversial

otherwise it seems habeas petitions for prisoners at guantanamo would have to be referred to commanding officer with courtmartial convening authority there which seems unlikely to provide the sort of independent collateral review that the boumediene court seemed to view as constitutionally required hr 6705s 3401 the enemy combatant dete ntion review act of 2008 would repeal subsection of 28 usc 2241 it would grant the us district court for the district of columbia exclusive jurisdiction over and make it the exclusive venue for consideration of all habeas corpus applications by or on behalf of enemy combatants held at guantanamo who are not us citizens or aliens who have been admitted for permanent residence in the united states all such applications would be consolidated before the chief judge of the district court or designee for consolidated proceedings and determinations on common questions of fact or law habeas corpus application could be filed to challenge the legality of the continued detention of covered individual but not any other claims relating to his detention transfer treatment trial or conditions of confinement or any other action agai nst the united states applications of persons subject to military commission proceedings would be stayed until those proceedings have been completed the proposed legislation would also establish procedures for habeas corpus review of detainees including the scope of permitted discovery protection of national security information the allowance of video hearings so that detainee may participate from guantanamo and the admission of evidence including hearsay g4g146g149g149g156g561g157g152g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g142g561g6g142g157g142g151g157g146g152g151g561 s 1249 and hr 2212 would require the president to close the detention facilities at guantanamo bay and either transfer the detainees to the united states for trial by military proceeding or article iii court or for detention as enemy combatants as

further legal process where adequate assurances are given that the individual will not be subject to torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or to release them from any further detention s

guantanamo the bill defines aggrieved person as an individual who is detained or subjected to rendition overseas by us officer or agent except as authorized excluding any individual who is an international terrorist nonus person who engages in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor and any person apparently including us persons who knowingly aids abets or conspires with such nonus person in the commission of terrorist act or activity in preparation of terrorist act an aggrieved person would have the right to sue the head of the agency or department responsible for his or her unlawful detention or rendition for damages including punitive damages extraterritorial rendition and detention would generally be permitted only with proper authorization by order of the foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc court set up to authorize electronic surveillance of agents of foreign powers in the united states certain types of renditions and detentions appear to be excluded from these general requirements including those of persons detained by the united states in guantanamo on the acts date of enactment who are transferred to foreign legal jurisdiction as well as the rendition or detention of individuals detained or transferred by the us armed forces under circumstances governed by and in accordance with the geneva conventions otherwise extraterritorial detention would require the authorization of the president or the director of national intelligence based on certification that the failure to detain that individual will result in risk of imminent death or imminent serious bodily injury to any individual or imminent damage to or destruction of any united states facility or the factual basis exists to demonstrate the individual is an international terrorist and there is reason to believe that the detention or rendition of such person is important to the national security of the united states an application for detention must be submitted to the fisc within 72 hours in order to detain the person hr 6705s 3401 would expressly authorize the tention of persons who have been engaged in hostilities or who have purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the united states or its cobelligerents on behalf of the taliban qaeda or associated forces it would bar court from releasing person into the united states who has been designated as an enemy combatant by csrt other than us citizen or an alie n admitted into the us for permanent residence and also make such person ineligible for entry visa or any immigration status subject to the waiver of the president if court were to grant detainees habeas application and order his release he would be placed in the custody of the secretary of homeland security for transfer to the detainees country of citizenship or third country g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the administrations policy of detaining wartime captives and suspected terrorists at the guantanamo bay naval station has raised host of novel legal questions regarding among other matters the relative powers of the president and congress to fight terrorism as well as the power of the courts to review the actions of the political branches the dta was congresss first effort to impose limits on the presidents conduct of the global war on terrorism and to prescribe limited role for the courts the supreme courts decision striking the dta provision that attempted to eliminate the courts habeas jurisdiction may be seen as an indication that the court will continue to play role in determining the ultimate fate of the detainees at guantanamo however the court did not foreclose all options available to congress to streamline habeas proceedings involving detainees at guantanamo or elsewhere in connection with terrorism httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33180g7g151g142g150g162g561g5g152g150g139g138g157g138g151g157g561g6g142g157g138g146g151g142g142g156g497g561

be weighed in the context of relevant circumstances and exigencies as general matter the courts have not accepted the view that the president has inherent constitutional authority to detain those he suspects may be involved in international terrorism rather the courts have looked to the language of the aumf and other legislation to determine the contours of presidential power the supr eme court has interpreted the aumf with the assumption that congress intended for the president to pursue the conflict in accordance with traditional lawofwar principles and has upheld the detention of narrow category of persons who fit the traditional definition of enemy combatant under the law of war other courts have been willing to accept broader definition of enemy combatant to permit the detention of individuals who were not captured in circumstances suggesting their direct participation in hostilities against the united states but plural ity of the supreme court warned that novel interpretation of the scope of the law of war might cause their understanding of permissible executive action to unravel consequently congress may be called upon to consider legislation to support the full range of authority asserted by the executive branch in connection with the gwot in the event the court finds that the detentions in question are fully supported by statutory authorization whether on the basis of existing law or new enactments the key issue is likely to be whether the detentions comport with due process of law under the constitution
