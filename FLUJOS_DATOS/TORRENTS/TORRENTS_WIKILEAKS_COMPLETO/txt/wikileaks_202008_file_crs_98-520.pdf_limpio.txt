opportunities for worldwide communications and economic growth in the judgment of most experts it is also generally agreed that in order to tap this potential fully many difficult technical and policy issues must be confronted and resolved one of these polic issues concerns the scope of protection for copyrighted works against unauthor ized copying or other unlawful use the general issues relating to internet uses of copyrighted material are implicated both by national legislative proposals and by two new international treaties in the field of intellectual property at the national level bills were introduced in the 104th congress s 1284 and hr 2441 to make changes in the copy right law related to internet uses of copyrighted works2 hearings were held on the bills and private sector groups

definition of effec tive technological measure differs slightly hr 3048 contains amendments relating to the first sale doctrine and shrinkwrap licenses not found in s 1146 hr 3048 does not contai n any provisions on online service provider liability whereas title i of s 1146 addresses this issue finally hr 3209 deals only with the online service provider liability issue revised version of hr

property organizati on wipo copyright treaty covers copyright protection for computer programs and databases to the extent the latter are intellectual works and clarifies or creates rights relating to use of copyrighted works over the internet and in digital electronic contexts3 the second treaty the wipo performances and phonograms treaty covers protection for performers and producers of sound recordings ca lled phonograms internationally4 and tracks many of the rights extended to copyright subject matter by the wipo copyright treaty the wipo treaties have been sent to the senate for its advice and consent and the president has recommende d implementing legislation that adopts minimalist approach to treaty implementation s 1121 and hr 2281 as originally introduced in the first session of the 105th congress embodied the administrations proposals for wipo treaties implementation the original administration bills were premised on the assumption that existing united states law is largely consistent with the obligations of the treaties consequently s 1121 and hr 2281 as introduced proposed amendment of us copyright law concerning only two new s ubstantive issues as well as certain technical amendments the copyright act would have been ame nded to provide new legal protection i against circumvention of anticopying technologies and ii against performance of certain acts relating to fraudul ent removal or alte ration of copyright management information cmi the only other amendments originally proposed by s 1121 and hr 2281 are technical in nature and relate primarily to consequential adjustments to those definitions and sections of the copyright ac t that affect treaty relationships and the eligibility of foreign authors to claim us copyright subsequent to the introduction of th administrations implementation b ills two other wipo implementation bills were introduced s 1146 and hr 3048 contain many common provisions but they are not companion bills5 they

owners and online service providers had reached an agreement concer ning the issue of osp copyright liability based on this agreement the house judiciary committee essentially combined hr 2281 with revised version of hr 3209 and reported the bill as hr 2281 as revised hr 2281 only partly reflects the private sector agreement on osp liability additional elements of the agreement w ill reportedly be adde d to hr 2281 by means of house floor amendment8 at the same markup session the house judiciary committee rejected series of amendments to hr 2281 along the lines of the proposals in hr 3048 the new senate bill s 2037 contains the amendments made to hr 2281 plus the full private sector agreement on osp copyright liability and other amendments addressing additional copyright policy issues including changes in the circumvention of anticopying measures provisions new provisions on library reproduction of copyrighted works new provisions on ephe meral recordings and other matters discussion of hr 3048 the digital era copyright enhancemen t act hr 3048 proposes several amendments to the copyright act that would update the limitations on the rights of copyright owners in the context of digital electronic uses of copyrighted works the bill would make other changes in united states law to implement the obligations the united states would assume if this c ountry ratifies the wipo copyright and performancesphonograms treatieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98520crs4 9 similar library reproduction amendments are included in s 2037 as passed by the senate except that s 2037 adds the c ondition that copies or phonorecords reproduced in digital formats can be used only on the premises of th library in lawful possession of copy and s 2037 defines when format is obsolete 10 s 2037 does not contain any amendments concerning the first sale doctrine 11 s 2037 would defer any specific amendments of the copyright act concerning distance learning pending submi ssion of report by the register of copyrights the bill mandates report by the register with in six months of enactment 12 s 2037 contains different amendment concerning ephemeral recordings than the proposal in hr 3048 an amendment of 17 usc 112 would extend the existing ephemeral recording exemption to nonsubscription broadcasts of sound recordings in digital formats another amendment w hich relates to the anticircumvention provisions of the bill requires copyright owners to make ava ilable to broadcasters the necessary means to continuedfair use the bill would amend section 107 of the copyright act title 17 us code to specify that fair use applies to digital as well as analog transmissions the courts would be instructed not to gi ve independent weight to the means of performing displaying or distributin g work when evaluating the fair use statutory criteria library uses the existing library exemption of 17 usc108 would be expanded under hr 3048 by permitting libra ry reproduction of three copies or phonorecords rather than the one copy of ex isting law by deleting the references of existing law to reproduction only in facs imile form and by adding as new justification for library reproduction the factor that the work is stored in an obsolete format9 first sale doctrine hr 3048 would amend section 109 of the copyright act which contains limitations on the public distribution right of copyright owners known as the first sale doctrine the ow ner of copy of phonorecord in digital format would be given an exemption to pe rform display or distribute the work by transmission to single recipient if th at person erases or destroys his or her copy or phonorecord at substantially the same time to the extent necessary for such performance display or distribution reproduction of the work would also be exempt10 distance learning the existing instructional broadcasting exemption of 17 usc1102 w ould be expanded by hr 3048 to exempt distance learning that is performances displays or distri butions of works by analog or digital transmission to remote sites for reception of systematic instructional material by students officially enrolled in the course and by government employees as part of their official duties would be exempt from copyright liability11 ephemeral recordings section 112b of the copyright act which now deals with performances and displays by means of ephemeral ie temporary recordings of works by nonprofit organiza tions and governmental bodies would be expanded by hr 3048 to cover distribution of work in addition to public performance and display12httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98520crs5 12continued make ephemeral recordings if the copyright owners anticopying measures would otherwise prevent the making of the recording 13 although s 2037 does not contain broa d exemption for operational reproduction by computers it contains several provisions th at create narrower exemptions for automatic copying of works in connection with comput er uses s 2037 exempts computer repair or maintenance companies for the automatic repr oduction of computer program that occurs when the computer is activated the osp liability provisions of s 2037 generally eliminate any monetary liability for the copying by an ospthat occurs when the osp acts as mere conduit in transmission copies material as pa rt of system caching or stores material at the direction of system user 14 s 2037 contains provision aling with shrinkwrap licensingoperational reproduction by computers the existing limitations of 17 usc117 apply to the rights of copyri ght owner of computer program hr 3048 would create new limitations in an ame nded section 117 on the rights of any copyright owner in the case of auto matic operational c opying by computers under this amendment it would not be an infringement to make copy of any work in digital format if the copying i is incidental to the operation of device in the course of lawful use of the work and ii does not conf lict with the normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author13 this exemption for copying that is incidental to operation of device is intended to exempt the automatic re production of works which occurs when messages or communications are transmitted via computer network the condition that the copying must not conflict with the normal exploitation etc tracks exactly the general limitation permitted by article 10 of the wipo copyright treaty and article 162 of the wipo pe rformances and phonograms treaty preemption of shrinkwraplicenses hr 3048 would amend section 301 of the copyright act to preempt state comm on or statutory laws to the extent they would otherwise allow enforcement of certain nonnegotiable licenses socalled shrinkwrap licenses the term shrinkwrap license refers to the fact that unilateral licensing terms are commonly expressed on the outside wra pping of computer software package which is removed in order to use the software the license provides that by removing the wrapping from the package the purchaser of the software becomes bound by the licensing agreement the enfo rceability of such licenses is not settled but they are commonly employed by the software industry under hr 3048 federal c opyright law would preempt state laws in the case of licenses covering uncopyrigh table material or licenses which abrogate or restrict the copyright acts limitations on rights of copyright owners as found in sections 107114 117 or 118 of the act14 circumvention of technological measures

circumvention of effective technological measures that is protection against infringing conduct in the nature of acts that defeat an ticopying technologies each of the pending implementation bills addresses this ob ligation but hr 3048 and s 1146 differ fundamentally from the approach of the administration bills s 1121 and hr 2281 as originally introduced in general the electronics industry favored the approach of hr 3048 and s 1146 and opposed the administrations original bills rightsholders generally have favored the administrations original bills the electronics industry contended th at the original administration bills exceeded the minimum treaty obligations c oncerning protection for technological measures whereas hr 3048 does not hr 3048 creates remedi against acts of circumvention for infringing purposes speci fically provides that this conduct does not include the manufacture importation or distribution of device or computer programs and establis hes only civil remedies15 rightsholders on the other hand generally supported the original administration bills they argued that criminal penalties are necessary to enforce rights against circumvention of anticopyin g technologies that meaningful law must protect against devices whose primary effect is to defeat anticopying technologies and that components parts must be specifically covered to guard against evasion of the law hr 2281 as reported by the house judiciary committee adds knowledge requirement to the anticircumvention provisions in order to establish liability against someone who only markets the technology defeating device exempts nonprofit libraries archives and educational institutions from liability under the anti circumvention provisions if they obtain access to the copyrighted work

constituted violations of the anticircumvention provisions requires court to remit ci vil damages against nonprof it library archives or educational institution if the nonprofit tity was not aware and had reason to believe that its acts constituted viola tion and exempts the same nonprofit entities from any criminal liability for violation of the anticircumvention provisions also the bill exempts lawfully authorized inves tigative protective or intelligence activity of federal and state law enforcement or intelligence entitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98520crs7 16 the home recording rights coalition hrrc which is trade association representing manufacturers distributors and retailers of electronics products and some consumers issued press release on may 1 1998 praising the changes in s

1998 this bill incl udes the changes adopted by the house judiciary committee in hr 2281 to the ci rcumvention of anticopying technology provisions and makes additional changes which in their totality apparently satisfy the concerns of the elect ronicscomputer manufacturin g industries on this issue16 s2037 allows circumventions for purposes of interoperab ility of computers expressly declares that

the components incorporation in the product for the sole purpose of preventing access by minors to certa in internet material if the component does not itself violate the anticircumvention right but essentially requires that rightsholders must cooperate with broadcasters and ot her transmitters to provide broadcasterstransmitters with the means to make ephemeral recordings copyright management information under article 12 of the wipo copyright treaty and article 19 of the wipo performances and phonograms treaty member countries must provi adequate and effective legal remedies against any person knowingly performing prohibited acts relating to the removal or alteration of electronic rights management information the remedies could be civil or criminal or both hr 3048 would implement this treaty obligation by creating civil remedies against knowing and intentional acts to lead or induce infringement by removal or alteration of copyright management information cmi the civil remedies also apply against public distribution or impor tation of copies or phonorecords containing altered cmi or from whic h cmi has been removed cmi is defined to include the following information in electronic or digital form the title author and copyright owner of the work the copyright notice terms and conditions for uses of the work iden tifying numbers or symbols and any other identifying

copyright management information provisions cmi is defined to include information about performers writers and directors of audiovisual works except in the case of radio and television performances in addition to information about authors there are several changes in the liability provisions in the case of innocent violations where the court finds that the violator was not aware and had reason to believe that his or her acts were violation of the cmi provisions the court may reduce or remit civil damages where the violator is nonprofit library ar chives or educational institution who was not aware and had reason to believe its acts were violation the court shall remit any civil damages the same nonprofit entities are exempt from criminal penalties the lawfully authorized activities of federal and state law enforcement and intelligence entities are exempt from any liability for violations of the cmi provisions in addition to the above changes s 2037 also places limits on the liability of transmitting organizations such as broad cast and cable and their program suppliers for cmi violations with respect to anal og transmissions there is cmi violation if compliance is not technically feasible or would create an undue financial hardship and if there is intention to induce able facilitate or conceal an infringement with respect to digital transmissions lia bility depends upon the setting of digital transmission standard by consensus of re presentatives of transmitting organizations and copyright owners until the standard is established the transmitting organization is generally not liable for cmi violations if the entity has intention to induce enable facilitate or conceal an infringemen t and if transmission of the cmi would result in signal degradation or conflict with g overnment regulations or an industry wide standard adopted before enactment
