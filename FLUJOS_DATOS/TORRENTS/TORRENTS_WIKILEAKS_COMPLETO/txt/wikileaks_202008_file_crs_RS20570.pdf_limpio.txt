agreement on chinas accession to the world trade organization wto addresses range of us foreign trade and investment concerns related t chinas entry into the wto in particular us import sensitive industries are wary of the impact from increased imports that might result from chinas wto membership the bilateral agreement allows the united states to continue to use at least temporarily special trade remedy procedures against surges of imports and against dumped and subsidized imports from china that it has used since the two countries reestablished trade re lations in 1980 t hese procedures are more favorable to importsensitive industries tha n those normally used in trade with other established wto members they are viewed by some observers as policy tool to cushion the potentially adverse impact of in creased china trade on us industries codification of the safeguard provision wa s included in hr 4444 the legislation that granted china pntr pl 106268 and th at was signed into

accordance with the wtos principle of mos tfavored nation mfn treatment the concessions made by china in the bilateral agreement technically apply to trade with all wto members this report however

107thcongress that anycountryor customs territorymust go through with wtomember trading partners in applying to join the wto2 the bilateral agreement addresses us c oncerns about chinas treatment of us exports of agricultural and manufactured g oods and of us services in chinas domestic market and about us investments in china3in addition and perhaps most critically for importsensitive industries the agreement llows the united states to employ special measures to remedy the adverse price eff ects on us industries of some imports from china4the house passed on may 24 2000 and the senate passed on september 19 2000 hr 4444 that authorized the president to grant china permanent normal trade relations pntr status hr 4444 was sig ned into law on october 10 2000 pl 106 268 see legislation section us trade remedies and nonmarket economies trade remedies are government measures authorized in law and sanctioned by multilateral agreement ie the wto to minimize the adverse impact of some imports on domestic industries5safeguard measures allow domestic industries to adjust to the adverse impact of surges in import competition antidumping duties remedy the adverse price effects of imports determined to be sold at less than fair value countervailing duties remedy the adverse price effects of imports that are determined to have benefitted from government subsidies safeguard measures us safeguard measures are authorized under sections 201204 of the trade act of 1974 often simply called section 201 or escape clause relief they must also conform to article xix of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt1994 and the wto safeguards agreement us law provides that an industry can receive relief in the form of tem porary higher duties quotas or other import restrictions if the us international trade commission itc makes two determinations 1 that imports of like product as produced by the industry seeking relief have surged at such rate as to cause serious injury or t hreat thereof to the us industry and 2 that their level of causation is substantial if both determinations are affirmative then the itc makes recommendation for relief which the president may accept amend or reject section 201 is applied in cases where t he exporting country is market economy however us law also authorizes simila r relief against imports from nonmarket economies section 406 of the trade act f 1974 as amended was enacted at timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20570crs3 6see us congress senate trade reform act of 1974 report of the committee on finance of the united states senate together with additional views on hr 10710 93d congress 2d session srept 931298 p 212when the united states was opening up trade r elations with communist countries it was enacted in response to industry concerns that imports from communist countries would flood us markets because their prices were not marketdetermined section 406 provides for relief in the form of higher tariffs or quantitative restrictions on imports from communist country that the itc determin have caused market disruption under the statute market disruption is said to have occurred when the itc determines that 1 the imports into the united states have rapidlyincreased absolutelyor relative to domestic production at such rate as to ve caused material injury to the us industry and 2 their level of causation is significant if both determinations are affirmative then the itc recommends relief to the president who may accept and implement the recommendation or oppose the r ecommendation and deny relief although similar section 201 and section 406 differ in several important respects first the injury threshold for relief under sec tion 201 serious injury is higher than that of section 406 material injury serious injury is defined under section 201 as one that is significant overall impairment to the position of the domestic industry material injuryis not defined under section 406 but the legislative history of the statute indicates that congress intended it to be l ower threshold than serious injury6 second the causation threshold under sectio n 406 significant is lower than that under section 201 substantial under section 406 significant cause is cause which contributes significantly to the material injury of the domestic injury but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause italics added on t he other hand under section 201 substantial cause is one that is important and not less than any other cause italics added third under the safeguards agreement of the wto and in accordance with the wto mostfavorednation mfn principl section 201 safeguards relief must be imposed against all imports of the product in question from all foreign suppliers that is wto member cannot target re lief against particular country section 406 on the other hand discriminates against communi st countries and allows us industries to seek relief against imports from single country section 406 unlike section 201 does not provide statutory procedures for congressiona l override of presidential decision not to act or to take action different than that recommended by the itc in sum the lower injury and causation thresholds of section 406 and its provision for specificcountry targeting are intended to increase the chances that temporary import relief measures will be implemented than would be the case under section 201 antidumping and countervailing duty remedies us antidumping remedies are authorized under sections 731 739 of the tariff act of 1930 as amended they must also conform to article vi of gatt 1994 and the wto antidumping agreement under us law antidumping relief is granted if 1 the department of commerce doc determines that imports subject to an antidumping investigation have been sold in the united states at less than fair value and 2 the itc determines that ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20570crs4 7in cvd cases the injury test and therefore it c participation is required only if the country against which the us industry is bringing petition is member of the wto which includes most trading partners is nonmember country but has ccepted equivalent obligations or country with which the united states has an agreement which entitles that country to unconditional mfn treatment otherwise only final determination by the doc of the existence of subsidy is required for the assessment of the countervailing dutyindustry producing like or competitive p roduct as the dumped import has been materially injured by reason of the dumped imports in determining what is the fair value of good the us antidumping law requires that the doc use when possible the price of the good or like good in the exporters home market but because the prices of good in nonmarket economy are administratively set and not determined by market forces they may not represent the fair value of goods produced in nonmarket econom the statute provides that in the case of nonmarket economy such as china the doc construct the fair value of the good by determining what the cost s of production including profit are in market economy of comparable development level to the nonmarket economy and use that as proxy for the fair value us countervailing duty relief is author ized under sections 701709 of the tariff act of 1930 as amended and must conform to article vi of gatt 1994 and the wto agreement on subsidies and counterva iling measures scm under the scm agreement countervailable subsidies must b specific as defined in the agreement and cause material injury to the relevant dom estic industry under us law an industry may obtain relief after 1 the us department of commerce has determined that the imported good under investigation has be nefitted from countervailable subsidyand in most cases 2 the itc has determined that the imports are causing or threatening to cause material injury to us industry producing lik or competitive product as the imported product7 the uschina bilateral agreement the us trade remedies against imports from china are one of the most critical sets of provisions of the uschina bilateral greement on wto accession by and large the bilateral agreement allows the united states to apply for certain period of time the same trade remedy measures in its trad with china that it applied since 1980 when the united states and china first reestablished trade relations the trade remedy provisions of the bilateral agreement were incorporated into chinas terms of accession to the wto and apply on an mostfavorednation basis to chinas trade with not only the united states of with each wto member regarding safeguard measures with some exceptions the bilateral agreement allows the united states to continue to apply the more liberal section 406 criteria for relief against imports from china however like section 406 the bilateral agreement allows china to seek equivalent compensation from the united states for the actions against its imports if the us measures have been in effect for at least two years in the case of imports that have increased relative to domestic production or three years in the case of imports that have increased absolutely this provision reflects in part the wtohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20570crs5 safeguards agreement requirement that wto members have the opportunity to obtain compensation if safeguard action is taken against their exports by another wto member and if that action has been in place for at least three years whether the imports increased relatively or absolutely in addition the bilateral agreement allows the united states to take safeguard action against increased imports from china that may have been diverted from third country as result of that countrys safeguard action against china the agreement also requires that the united states consult with china to try to resolve the issue before initiating safeguards action and to notify the wto committee on safeguards of measures taken against china the safeguards provision of the bilateral agreement expires on december 11 201312 years after china enters the wto at which time section 201 measures would be used regarding antidumping measures the bilateral agreement provides that the united states can continue to use the constructed f air value method unless the chinese producer can clearly show that market conditions prevail in the production of the exported good in such case the united states will use prices and costs prevailing in china the wto committee on antidumping actions must be notif ied of antidumping actions taken under the bilateral agreement regarding countervailing duty measures the bilateral agreement provides that subsidies to chinese stateowned enterpris will be considered specific and therefore countervailable if stateowned enterprises ar the predominant recipients of the subsidies or if they receive disproportionately large mounts of the subsidies in determining the level of subsidies the bilateral agreement requires that where possible the united states use methodologies that it applies against th imports of other marketeconomy wto members but the bilateral agreement recognizes that given the structure of chinas economy it may not always be possible and allo ws the united states t use alternative methodologies that are based on thirdcountry surrogate marketdetermined data rather than chinese data as with the safeguards provisions the bilateral agreements provisions on antidumping and countervailing duties woul d seem to favor the us industry more than in the case of the methodologies applied to imports from other wto members making it easier for the us industries to obtain r elief the provisions will be applicable for 15 years after chinas entry into the wto until december 11 2016 or when china is deemed market economy by the national l aws of the importing country whichever comes first at which time the standard anti dumping and countervailing duty criteria will apply in addition to the provisions on safeguar d antidumping and countervailing duty measures the bilateral agreement contains provisions pertaining to trade in textiles and wearing apparel according to the agreem ent us quotas on imports of these items from china will continue but will be gradua lly phased out until january 1 2005 at which time they will expire but the agreement also provides that the united states will be able to apply special productspecific safegua rds measure against imports of textiles and wearing apparel from china that are determined to have caused market disruption in the united states this special safeguards provisi on differs from the more general safeguards provision in the bilateral agreement discussed earlier in that china would not have the right to retaliate or seek remedies for us action the provision would expire onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20570crs6 8for current information and analysis of usc hina trade since chinas accession to the wto see crs issue brief ib91121 uschina trade issuesdecember 31 2008 after that date and until december 11 2013 the nontextile safeguards provision would apply legislation on october 10 2000 president clinton signed into law hr 4444 pl 106286 the chinaus relations act of 2000 the act the law authorized the president to grant china pntr upon the issuance of proclamation and only after he has certified to congress that the terms of chinas accession to the wto were at least equivalent to the provisions of the bilateral agreement on november 10 2001 president bush so certified and on december 27 2001 he issued th proclamation granting china pntr effective january 1 2002 the act also codified into us law the special safeguards measure of the bilateral agreement as sections 421423 of the trade act of 1974 these sections are modeled after section 406 but contain some importa nt additions for example they include presidential discretion in granting relief in the form of standard for presidential action the president is to grant relief i f the international trade commission so recommends unless he determines that doing so would not be in the us national economic interest or in extraordinary cas would harm the national security of the united states they also give the us tra representative ustr responsibility to make recommendations to the president regarding relief if the itc makes an affirmative determination and after the ustr solicits public comments conclusions the uschina bilateral agreement on w to accession was designed to smooth the transition of chinas entry into the wto for the united states the trade remedy provisions attempt to alleviate apprehensions that some us importsensitive industries might have regarding increased competition from imports from china yet it is unlikely that uschina trade patterns will change much after chinas entry into the wto certainly in the nearterm chinese imports have received mostfavorednation mfn now normaltraderelations ntr status since 1980 and ther efore us tariff rates on chinese imports will not immediately chang therefore us domestic industry use of trade remedies are unlikely to alter greatly in the near term8 however trade remedies not only serve the economic role of smoothing the transition to liberalized trade for import s ensitive industries they also serve political roleas tools to make trade liberalization more politically palatable to those sectors adversely affected by it
