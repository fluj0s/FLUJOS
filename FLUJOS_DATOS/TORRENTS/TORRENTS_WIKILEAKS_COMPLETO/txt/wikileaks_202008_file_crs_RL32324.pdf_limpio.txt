some argue that the governments financial research andor clinical support of hea lthrelated rd entitles the public to commensurate considerations in the prices charged for any resulting drugs others view government intervention in price decisions based upon in itial federal funding of basic research as contrary to l ongterm trend of gove rnment promotion of innovation technological adva ncement and the commercia lization of technology by the business community leading to new pr oducts and processes for the marketplace the federal involvement in rd stems in part from the understanding that technological advancement is key element in economic growth many of the innovations that stimulate technological progress are rooted in basic research however because the returns to basic resear ch accrue to society as whole and often can not be captured by the firm pe rforming the work there tends to be underinvestment in these activities thus the government typically funds fundamental research as public good concurrently the government has an interest in ensuring that the results of this enterprise are applied to generate new goods and services to meet the demands of citizens the benefits of research emerge when innovations are available in the marketplace in recognition of this the congress has passed legislation to facilitate the commercialization of new technology government policies implemented over the past 25 years include incentives to increase private sector inve stment in technology deve lopment through technology transfer cooperative rd and intellectual property ri

members of congre ss have questioned the adequacy of the current balance between public and private needs the particular nature of healthrelated research and development and the substan tial federal investment in this area over 29 billion was appropriated to nih for medical research in fy20071 has led critics of the current system to argue that the necessity of incentives is mitigated by such factors as free access to the results of federally funded work by the monopoly power permitted by patent pr otection and by other regulatory and tax advantages such as those conveyed by the hatchwaxman act or the orphan drug act therefore some maintain more direct payback should be required including recoupment of public sector financial support or government involvement in price

basis for innovation the us cons titution states that patents are intended to promote the progress of science and the usef ul arts as research and development become more expensive ownership of title to inventions has been used by the federal government as means to foster increased private sector activities to generate new and improved products and pr ocesses for the marketplace in an academic setting the possession of title is expected to provide motivation for the university to license the technology to industry for further refi nement and application in expectation of royalty payments the patent system is grounded in artic i section 8 clause 8 of the constitution and is intended to stimulate new discoveries and their reduction to practice commonly known as innovation the grant of patent provides the inventor with means to capture returns to his invention through exclusive rights on its practice for 20 years from date of filing this is designed to encourage those investments necessary to further deve lop an idea and generate marketable technology at the same time the process of obtaining patent places the concept on which it is based in the public domain in return for time limited monopoly right to specific applications of the knowledge generated the inventor must publish the ideas covered in the patent proponents argue that as di sclosure system the patent can and often does s timulate other firms or individua ls to invent around existing patents to provide for parallel technical developments or meet similar and expanded demands in the marketplace25 innovation produces new knowledge one characteristic of this knowledge is that it is public good good that is not consumed when it is used this public good concept underlies the u s patent system as professor john shoven points out the use of an idea or discovery by one person does not in most cases reduce the availability of that information to others26 therefore the marginal social cost of the widespread application of that information is near zero because the stock of knowledge is not depleted this is why th federal government funds basic research ordinarily society maximizes its welfare through not charging for the use of free good27 however innovation typically is cos tly and resource intensive patents permit novel concepts or discove ries to become property when reduced to practice and therefore allow for control over their use they create incentives that maximizehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32324crs8 28 stanley m besen and leo j raskind an introduction to the law and economics of

to resolve the problem of appropriability if discoveries were universally available without means for the inventor to realize return on investments most commentators are convinced that there would result much lower and indeed s uboptimal level of innovation29 although research is often important to innovation it appears that on average it cons titutes approximately 25 of the cost of

necessary to further deve lop an idea and generate marketable technology the utility of patents to companies varies among industrial sectors patents are perceived as critical in the drug and chemi cal industries that may reflect the nature of rd performed in these sectors wher the results often are relatively easy to reproduce30 others have pointed out that dr ug patents are more detailed in their claims and therefore easier to defend31 in contrast studies have found that in many other industries the protection offered by patents is diminis hed by the ability to invent around the patent and limited by the disclosure of vital information in the patent itself32 in the aircraft and semiconductor i ndustries patents have not been the most successful mechanism for capturing the benefits of investments instead lead time and the strength of the learning curve were determined to be more important33 according to one study in the semiconducto r and related equipment industry secrecy and lead time were deemed significantly more important than patents similar findings characterize the aerospace and m achine tool industries among others34 the degree to which industry perceives patents as

disclose technical information36 disclosure requirements are factors in achieving ba lance between current and future innovation through the patent process as are limitations on scope nove lty mandates and nonobviousness considerations37 patents can give rise to an environment of competitiveness with multiple sources of innovation which is viewed by some experts as the basis for technological pr ogress this is important because as professors robert merges and richard ne lson found in their studies in situation where only few organizations contro lled the development of technology technical advance appeared sluggish38 the patent system has long been subject to criticism however some observers have asserted that the patent system is unnecessary due to market forces that already suffice to create an optimal level of i nnovation the desire to obtain lead time advantage over competitors as well as the recognition that technologically backward firms lose out to their rivals may we ll provide sufficient inducement to invent without the need for further incentives39 other commentators be lieve that the patent system encourages industry concentration and presents barrier to entry in some markets40 still other observers believe that the patent system too frequently attracts speculators who prefer to acquire and enforce patents rather than engage in socially productive activity41 when analyzing the validity of these competing views it is important to note the lack of rigorous analyti cal methods available for study ing the effect of the patent law upon the us economy as whole the relationship between innovation and patent rights remains poorly understood as result current economic and policy tools do not allow us to calibrate the pate nt

biological mechanisms that would otherwise not be pursued due to the lack of market incentives such research can lead to earlystage findings and provide clues that may eventually lead to medical

relation to the government in the pharmaceutical arena pharmaceutical companies spend more than nih on rd primarily for applied research and development directed at generating new drugs for the marketplace some analysts argue that the federal role is overstated because existing studies use c itations as measure of each sectors contribution to drug development this critics maintain skews the

development at tufts university noted that for the set of drugs looked at by nih the governments involvement was greatest in the preclinical and clinical development of drugs that were treatments for serious or lifethreatening diseases where there was clearly public health benefit derived from fac ilitating the development of these drugs the nih was also involved in the di scovery andor development of compounds that were in the public domain ie knowledge of the existence and method of preparation of the compounds was publicly available before therapeutic potential was identifiedthese types of compounds initially might not have been of interest to the pharmaceutical industry because possible patent claims were limited117 those who oppose changes in the current approach to intellectual property ownership of the results of federally funded rd argue th at the promise of large return on investment is precisely the tool sanctioned by the constitution to promote the progress of science118 it is because pharmaceu ticals and biotechnology are so research intensive that they rely heavily on patents intellectual property is important because the costs of drug innovation are ve ry high while the costs of imitation are relatively low119 the domestic pharmaceutical i ndustry typically reinvests 8 to 20 of its revenues in rd and oftentimes substantially more in contrast to other industries where the rates are about 3 to 4 according to testimony presented by dr arthur levinson ceo of genentech120 ownership of intellectual property is particularly important to biotechnology companies that typically are small and do not have profits to finance additional rd according to the biotechnology industry organization most of these firms finan ce research and

john calfee of the american enterprise institute noting that one of the least appreciated effects of faster research and development is to quicken the competitive process itself calfee argues that althoug h the scientific effort required for new drugs costs great deal of money the drugs are worth far more than they cost eliminate the financial reward howev er and you cut off the supply125 dr m kathy behrens director of the national venture capital association testified at hearings before the jo int economic committee on september 29 1999 that health care proposals which impose dr ug price controls or medicare drug benefits which provide marginal reimbursement can create perception or reality that the industrys potential return is limited or at greater risk126 other experts concur with

difficult to administer129 instead congress accepted as satisfactory the anticipated payback to the country through increased revenues from taxes on profits new jobs created improved productivity and economic growth for example according to the mit technology licensing office in 1998 15 of the sales of licen sed products derived from federally funded university research was returned to the government in the form of income taxes payroll taxes capital gains taxes and corporate income taxes this was estimated to be 6 times the royalties paid by companies to the universities130 the emergence of the biotechnology i ndustry and the development of new therapeutics to improve health care are of ten cited indications of such benefits research tools the focus on intellectual property ownershi p of the results of federally funded rd has led some critics to charge that the patenting of fundamental research prevents further biomedical innovation law professors rebecca eisenberg and arti rai argue that due to implementation of the bayhdole act proprietary claims have increasingly moved upstream from th end products themselves to the ground breaking discoveries that made them possible in the first place131 while patents are designed to spur innovation rai and eisenberg ma intain that certa in patents hinder the process from their perspective permitting univers ities to pa tent discoveries made under federal funding the bayhd ole act draws distinction between inventions that lead directly to commerc ial products and fundame ntal advances that enable further scientific studies132 these basic innovations are generally known as research tools eisenberg and professor rich ard nelson argue that owne rship of research tools may impose significant transaction cost s that

again in history of science and technology of having many independent minds at work trying to advance field public science has flourished by permitting scientists to challenge and build upon the work of rivals134 similar concerns were expressed by harold varmus president of memorial sloan kettering and former director of the na tional institutes of health in july 2000 prepared testimony he spoke to being t roubled by widespread tendencies to seek protection of intellectual property increasin gly early in the process that ultimately leads to products of obvious commercial value because such practices can have detrimental effects on sc ience and its delivery of health benefits135 while the bayh dole act and scientif ic advances have helped ge nerate dynamic biotechnology industry there have been changes that are not always consistent with the best interests of science136 however as varmus and ot hers acknowledge the remedi to this situation are not necessarily associated with the bayhdole act or its implementation by nih yale president richard levin notes that wh ile some research should be kept in the public domain including research tools the fact that it is privatized is not the result of the bayhdole act but rather the result of patent law made by the courts and the congress therefore he believes that changes to the act are not the appropriate means to address the issues137 current law as reaffirmed by court decisions permits the patenting of research tools however there have been efforts to encourage the widespread availability of these tools marie freire formerly director of the ffice of technology transfer at nih testified that the value to society is greatest if the research tools are easily available for use in research she asserted that there is need to balance commercial interests with public interests138 to achieve this balance the national institutes of health has developed guidelines for univ ersities and companies receiving federal

patentability of biotechnology discoveries study by professors john walsh ashi sh arora and wesley cohen found that although there are now more patents associ ated with biomedical research and on more fundamental work ther is little evidence that work has been curtailed due to intellectual property issues associated with research tools142 according to this view scientists are able to tinue their research by li censing inventing around patents going offshore the development and use of public databases and re search tools court challenges and simply using the technolog without license ie infringement according to the authors of the report pr ivate sector owners of patents permitted such infringement in academia with the exception of those associated with diagnostic tests in clinical trials partly because it can increase the value of the patented technology government rights royalt free licenses and reporting requirements the government retains certain rights under the bayhdole act to protect the public interest the act states that th government is provi ded nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable pa idup license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the united states any subject invention throughout the world this license commonly known as royalty free license has been the subject of some discussion including whether or not this permits government purchasers to obtain discounts on products developed from federally funded r d particularly pharmaceuticals july 2003 gao report addr essed this issue and concluded that the license entitles the government to practice or have practiced the invention on the governments behalf but doe s not give the federal govern ment the far broader right to purchase off the shelf and royalty free ie at discounted price products that happen to incorporate fede rally funded invention when they are not produced under the governments license143 the study states that rights in one patent do not
