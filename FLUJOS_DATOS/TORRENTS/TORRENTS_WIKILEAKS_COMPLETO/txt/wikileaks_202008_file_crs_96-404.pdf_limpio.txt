more recently consensus appears to haveemerged in the international community that the fact that war criminals remained at large undermined the implementation of critical civilian aspects of the peace agreement in the longer term some observers believe that lasting peace isimpossible in bosnia unless justice is done with respect to war crimes they believe that the recrimination can only give way to

international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia and us policy introduction war crimes were an integral part of the 19921995 bosnian war and were committed by all sides in the conflict1 shortly before recognition of bosnia by the european community and the united stat in april 1992 bosnian serb militiamen and the yugoslav army part of which wa s later converted into the bosnian serb army launched attacks throughout the republic against unarmed or poorly armedcivilians most observers believe that most war crimes committed by the bosnian serbs from 1992 until the end of the war in 1995 were not unplanned scatteredexcesses by few soldiers but key aspect of the political and military strategy ofbosnian serb leaders they besieged the bosnian capital of sarajevo killingcivilians by indiscriminate shelling and sniper attacks bosnian serb militias forcedhundreds of thousands of nonserb civilians from their homes committing tens ofthousands of acts of murder rape and torture in systematic policy of ethniccleansing this policy was aimed at creating territorially compact ethnicallypure serb state comprising about twothirds of the republics territory whichwould then be united with serbia and m ontenegro and an ethnicallycleansed region carved out of croatia by similar means in 1991 2 although serbs are seen by many observers as the main culprits croats also committed substantial numbers of war crimes croat extremists in hercegovina and central bosnia carried out brutal ethni c cleansing campaign against muslims during their 19931994 war in drive to create an ethnically pure croat state that could beunited with croatia there are also nume rous reports of war crimes committed by muslims albeit fewer than those committed by the other two groups according toobservers reports of war crimes in bosnia have had an important impact on us and western policy toward the conflict pictures in western media of serb detentioncamps where inmates were routinely starved tortured and raped as well as carnagecaused by the shelling of sarajevo provoked international outrage and calls forusually unspecified action us and european policymakers felt need to dealwith the emotional issue of war crimes but did not want to be drawn into thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96404crs2 bosnian war as combatants or police po licymakers were also trying to establish legal precedent for action in order deter future war crimes elsewhere first step was the establishment of war crimes commission to collect evidence of atrocities in the former yugos lavia the commission of experts on the former yugoslavia was established by security council resolution 780 inoctober 1992 the final report of the commission more than 3000 pages wassubmitted to the secretarygeneral in may 1994 while the commission of experts was gathering material on war crimes the members of the security council reach ed agreement on the establishment of war crimes tribunal the international cr iminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia was established by security council resolution 808 on may 25 1993 it is the first international tribunal for prosecution of war crimes since the nuremberg andtokyo trials of fifty years ago as of april 1998 however 74 suspects are known to be currently under indictment for genocide war crimes and crimes againsthumanity fiftysix of the suspects are serb s 15 are croats and 3 are muslims 26 of the 74 suspects are in custody at present one suspect was killed while resisting arrest second has been released provisi onally due to illhealth he must return to the hague two weeks before the trial is to begin those indicted include former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and former army chief ratko mladic the tribunal initially got off to slow start in part due to difficulties in finding judges and prosecutors and inadequate funding war crimes played significant role in bringing the war to an end after the bosnian serbs overran the undeclared safe areas of srebrenica and zepa in july1995 reports soon emerged that the bosn ian serbs executed an estimated 6000 to 8000 civilians and dumped their bodies into mass graves international outrage over the atrocities caused the united nations and nato to agree in response to strongus pressure to more extensive use of air strikes in response to attacks on safeareas massive nato air strikes were launched in august 1995 in response tobosnian serb shelling of sarajevo for which bosnian serb leaders have beenindicted by the tribunal these strike s combined with muslim and croat battlefield successes at around the same time led the bosnian serbs and their patrons in serbiamontenegro to agree to ussponsored peace talks in dayton ohio innovember the dayton peace accords initialed in november 1995 were signed inparis month later the bosnian peace agreement includes many provisions requiring the parties to cooperate with the icty the genera l framework agreement commits all parties to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes and other violationsof international humanitarian law article ix article x of annex ia to the peace agreement provides that the parties shall cooperate

enforcement forces andofficials conference held in rome in febr uary 1996 on implementation of the dayton accords produced further agreement on war crimes cooperation the partiesrecognized their obligation to cooperate fully in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes they specifically agreed to provide unrestricted access to warcrimes suspects and investigation sites the nato implementation force ifor it was noted will work to provide secure working environment for the completion of these tasks the parties also agreed to what were dubbed the rules of the road if the parties wanted to arrest or indict suspect an order must be reviewed by the tribunal and deemed consistent with international legal standards 3 june 1996 international peace accord review conference called for the removal of indicted war criminal radovan karadzic from power tribunal president antonio cassese called for the arrest and ex tradition of indicted war criminals as precondition for bosnian elections that were held in september 1996 casseserepeated an earlier recommendation that ec onomic sanctions be applied to enforce compliance with the tribunal the confer ence demanded the removal of karadzic but stopped short of calling for reimposition of sanctions against violators but ratherreferred to sanctions as measure of last resort karadzic was removed in july 1996 after meeting between us envoy richard holbrooke and serbian leader slobodanmilosevic an international conferen ce in london in december 1996 to assess the implementation of the peace accord warned the parties to the agreement thateconomic reconstruction assistance is closely linked to their cooperation with thetribunal because of their failure to implement provisions of the peace accordincluding cooperation with the tribunal the republika srpska received only about 2 of international reconstruction aid for bosnia in 1996 nato policy on ifor assistance to the international tribunal provided that ifor personnel would detain and transfer i ndicted persons to the tribunal when they come into contact with such persons in the course of carrying out their duty 4 in december 1996 ifor was formally replaced by stabilization force sfor anapproximately 31000person natoled force with essentially the same mandate asifor this force which will be reduced as conditions improve in bosnia will stay in bosnia until selfsustaining peace takes hold an ongoing issue of central concern to the administration and congress is the impact of the tribunals activities on the peace process and on the safety of usforces in bosnia the relationship of th tribunal to the peace process in bosnia is difficult and delicate issue some observers have raised concerns that thatvigorous pursuit of war criminals may hurt the peace process unlike the nuremberg trials where the victors dispensed justi ce to vanquished enemy the bosnian peace agreement was the product of negotiations among factions which counted suspectedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96404crs4 war criminals within their leadership at l east as far as the bosnian serbs and croats are concerned if these persons are arrested their supporters could stopimplementing the peace accord or engage in acts of violence against peacekeepers this concern may be one reason why ifor and its successor sfor have appearedreluctant to seize suspects or guard war crimes sites other observers stronglybelieve that lasting peace is impossible for bosnia unless there is justice theybelieve that the recriminations caused by war crimes can only give way toreconciliation if the desire to assign coll ective guilt to another ethnic group and exact revenge is replaced by the desire to bring to justice the indivi duals of all ethnic groups who committed the crimes an additional concern which appears to haveemerged as consensus view in the past year among us and other western leaders is that if suspected war criminals remain at large the impl ementation of the peace agreement could be undermined their direct efforts by their ability to discredit the international community by defying it or by keeping alive the extreme nationalistideology that caused the war and would prevent efforts to reintegrate bosnia other related issues center around the tribunal its future its ability to implement and enforce decisions should the tribunal come to be seen as successthose urging the creation of permanent international criminal court will beencouraged finally the issue of us s upport for the international criminal court for the former yugoslavia or any subsequently established internationalcriminal tribunal may have policy implications that go well beyond the currentsituation in bosnia broader issues could include us world leadership roles and the potential for us participation in policing what could be remote areas of the world as well as what may be seen as surrender of national sovereignty to an

convened since the nuremberg and tokyo tribunals following the end of world war ii 5 authority and powers authority for the establishment of the tribunal the security council has passed series of resolutions6 culminating in the establishment of the tribunal for the former yugoslavia under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations which authorizes the security council to take measures necessary to maintain or restoreinternational peace and security 7 the report of the secretarygeneral on the creation of the tribunal8 says that the ideal method of establishing it would have been by treaty ratified by all parties invol ved such treaty or convention could have established permanent international criminal tribunal which then could have handled the war crimes cases from the form er yugoslavia however the report also notes that the interest in expeditious ju stice and the difficulties and length of time necessary to achieve an effective treaty dict ated an alternative method of establishing the tribunal given the volatile uncertain situation in the former yugoslavia theconsensus was that immediate action had to be taken therefore the securitycouncil exercised its powers under chapter v ii of the charter of the united nations to establish the ad hoc tribunal immediately without the necessity of conventionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96404crs6 9international court of justice

note 9 at 3648there has been and is some concern that the tribunal might undermine the peace because the parties to the balkan conf lict would be reluctant to turn over their own people especially some of their leaders for possible trial there is furtherconcern that any perceived bias of the tr ibunal might cause party to withdraw from the peace process in anger either that it was being unfairly penalized or that itsgrievances were being overlooked however the report comments that the tribunalcould help the peace process by providing ne utral forum in which war crimes cases from all parties can be fairly resolved and redressed thus reducing unresolvedresentment and tensions over unpunished war crimes during the same period that the security council was in the process of establishing the tribunal bosniahercegovina filed petition against yugoslaviaserbiamontenegro in the international c ourt of justice icj the petition alleged war crimes in violation of the genoc ide

of the principles of internati onal law recognized by the charter of the nuremberg tribunalthe report of the secretarygeneral pr oposing the organization of the tribunal notes that there are two main sources of international law customary internationallaw which comprises the core of principles about which there is internationalconsensus and treatyconventional law becau not all states are parties to certain conventions and there can be crime where there is preexisting law thestatute of the tribunal adopted convention based definitions of crimes only where the convention in question expressed definitions which had become part ofcustomary international law the re port lists the conventions which beyond doubt have become part of customary internati onal law 1 the geneva conventions of 12 august 1949 for the protection of war victims 12 2 the hague convention iv respecting the laws and customs of war on land and the regulations annexedthereto of 18 october 1907 13 3 the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide of 9 december 1948 the 1948 convention14 and 4 the charter of the international military tri bunal of 8 august 1945 the charter of the nuremberg tribunal15 the definition of the crimes which may be tried by the tribunal according to its statute are thus derived from customary international law the crimes include grave breaches of the geneva conventions of 1949 violations of the laws or customs of war genocide and crimes against humanitythe geneva conventions of 1949 regulate the conduct of war by protecting certain categories of persons such as civilians prisoners of war and sick or wounded or shipwrecked members of the armed forces from certain actions such as wilful killingand torture derived from the hague c onvention iv of 1907 the violations of the laws or customs of war include among ot her things use of poisonous weapons or other weapons of unnecessary suffering attack of undefended towns wanton militarily unnecessary destruction of towns plunder of property and seizuredamage or destruction of institutions dedicated to religion charity educationculture or science the definition of genocide is derived from the 1948 convention concerning genocide and includes certain act s committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part national ethnic r acial or religious group in peace time and in war time crimes against humanity derived from the charter of the nurembergtribunal include acts similar to those under genocide but do not require intent todestroy particular group and only include acts committed in armed conflict againsthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96404crs8 civilian population it does not matter whether the armed conflict is civilinternal or international in character the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal ie the persons that it can put on trial includes only natural persons or actual individuals and not juridical persons ie groups or organizations according to article 6 of the statute in article 7 thestatute of the tribunal espouses the concept of individual criminal responsibility theidea that individuals commit crimes not organizations or nations and thatindividuals who contribute to violations of international human rights laws aredirectly responsible person cannot claim the defense of immunity becauseviolations were committed in an official governmental capacity person in superior official position may be held responsible for failure to prevent or deterviolations committed by subordinates if knowledge of impending violations couldreasonably be imputed to him subordina tes may not claim the defense of following orders to escape individual responsibility for violations however obedience to orders may be mitigating factor at the sentencing phase the territorial jurisdiction of the tribunal is defined as covering the territory of the former socialist federal republic of yugoslavia including land airspace andterritorial waters under article 8 of the statute this article also defines thetemporal jurisdiction as extending from january 1 1991 through the present with specified ending date under article 9 of the statute the tribunal shares jurisdiction concurrently with the national courts of the former yugoslav countries and other involved nations the national courts exercise jurisdiction accordi ng to their national laws and procedures however this is subject to the primacy of the tribunal the tribunal may request national court to defer to its jurisdiction at any stage of the proceedings significant and relevant to this shared jurisdiction prohibitions against double jeopardy are provided for under article 10 of the statute which uses the latin term for the concept non bis in idem trial by the tribunal pr ecludes subsequent trial on the same charges in national court however trial in national court would not preclude trial by the tribunal in two s ituations 1 the characterization of the act in the national court did not correspond to its characterization under the statute of the tribunal that is it was not treated as war crime but as an ordinary crime of murder rape assault etc or 2 the conditions of impartiality independence oreffective means of adjudication were not guaranteed in proceedings before the national courts if the tribunal retries case which has already been tried before national court and resulted in prison sent ence in imposing its own sentence the tribunal must take into account the extent to which the sentence imposed by thenational court has already been served the actual power of the tribunal to enfo rce its will is established by article 19 providing for the issuance of orders and warrants and article 29 mandating thecompliance and cooperation of member states of the united nations with the statute and the orders and requests of the tribunal the member states are to cooperate in the identification and location of persons the arrest and detention of indictees or suspects the taking of

of the tr ibunal 4 investigations and rights of suspects 5 pretrial proceedings 6 proceedings before trial chambers 7appellate proceedings 8 review pro ceedings and 9 pardon and commutation of sentence perhaps the most important rules concer n the obligation of states to cooperate with the tribunal in the arrest of indictees even if nation has implemented thenecessary measures to cooperate with the tribunal under the statute and rules of the tribunal an arrest warrant must be transmitted from the tribunal to nationalgovernment an indictment alone does not compel state to apprehend and turn over an indictee who is in its jurisdiction to the tribunal however once thetribunal issues an arrest warrant and offi cially communicates it to the state believed to have jurisdiction over the indictee the receiving state is obligated to act promptly and with due diligence to execute the arre st warrant rule 56 reinforcing article 29 of the statute and to surrender or transf er the accused to the tribunal rules 57 and 58 pursuant to article 29 of the statute th obligation to transfer an indictee to the tribunal supersedes any prohibition or rest riction on transfer under the national laws or extradition treaties of the country concer ned if country is unable to execute an arrest warrant it shall report this to the registrar with the reasons for nonexecution if such report is not made within reasonable time after transmission of the arrestwarrant the inaction shall be deemed failure to execute the warrant and the tribunal may report this inaction to the security council rule 59 the tribunal may transmit notice to the national authorities of country to be published innational newspapers to inform the indictee th at service of the indictment against him is sought rule 60httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96404crs11 when the whereabouts of an indictee are unknown or when an indictee attempts to evade arrest by fleeing the juri sdiction of the state that has received an arrest warrant an international arrest wa rrant may be necessary under rule 61 of the rules of procedure and evidence the tribunal holds public hearings to review an indictment and the evidence supporting it nd also the efforts that have been made to serve the indictment on the indictee and to arrest him if the indictment isconfirmed and the tribunal is satisfied that the prosecutor has taken all availableactions to gain custody over the indictee the tribunal may issue an international arrest warrant which is universally binding on all member nations of the unitednations it serves notice internationally that the indictee is wanted by the tribunal for trial on war crimes and that any member nation in whose jurisdiction the indictee is found is obligated to arrest the indictee and turn him over to the tribunal if the prosecutor convinces trial chamber that fa ilure to effect service of an indictment was due to nations failure or refusal to cooperate with an arrest warrant the trial chamber shall certify this lack of coopera tion the tribunal shall then notify the security council of nations failure to cooperate the security council may then take such action as it deems necessary in the interests of international peace andsecurity under chapter vii of the united nations charter to enforce cooperation although neither the statute of the tribunal nor the rules of procedure and evidence authorize plea bargaining imm unity or amnesty the tribunal may consider the substantial cooperation with the prosecutor by the convicted personbefore and after conviction in determining the sentence and any later commutationof the sentence or pardon rules 101bii and 125 some other salient features of the rules include the provision for informing the suspect of his rights similar to the rights commonly referred to as miranda rights in the united states rule 42 the provision for audio or videorecord ing of questioning of suspect by the prosecutor rule 43 in case of urgency the prosecutor may request country to arrest suspectprovisionally seize evidence and take all necessary measures to prevent theescape of suspect intimidation or inju ry of victim or witness or the destruction of evidence rule 40 the disclosure by the prosecutor of ex culpatory evidence tending to show the innocence or mitigate the guilt of the indictee the ability of the tribunal to authorize special measures for the protection ofvictims and witnesses including xpunging of identifying information from the public record of proceedings and closed sessions rule 75 the ability of judge in the trial cham ber to append separate or dissenting opinion rule 88 the requirement that witnesses take an oath to tell the truth rule 90 the ability of the trial chamber to dir ect the prosecutor to

the number of investigations indictments and trials increase the tr ibunal budget does not cover the costs of mass grave exhumations and the tribunal issued an appeal to individual countries to fund future efforts the tribunal has only one permanent courtroom creating long delaysin bringing cases to trial two new c ourtrooms are scheduled to be completed in april and may 1998 icty president gabrielle kirk mcdonald told the unsecurity council in march 1998 that in order to use the new courtrooms moreeffectively the tribunal needs another tr ial chamber of three judges and fourth judge who could handle preliminary issues the gathering of evidence both physical evidence from mass grave sites and interviews with witnesses has been im peded by the limited investigatory resources of the tribunal and the lack of cooperation from serbiamontenegro and therepublika srpska 26 the tribunal has had to maintain difficult balance between adequate protection of witnesses from intimidation and invasion of privacyparticularly for the victims of rape and the concern that excessive shielding ofprosecution witnesses will deprive the defens of the ability to mount an effective case by questioning the sources of prosecu tion information as of march 1998 only one country had agreed to relocate witnesses the tribunal is seeking relocationagreements with other countries there has been an ongoing concern about the ability of the tribunal to obtain personal jurisdiction over the indicted at present only 26 of the 74 indicted persons are actually in the custody of the tribunal 27 th

five serb suspects turned themselves involuntarily to the tribunal in april 1998 ms arbour said that the main focus of secret indictments will be those w ho exercised command authority over those committing war crimes she noted that these efforts are often more difficult and time consuming than trials of actual lowranking perpetrators of such deeds in december 1997 arbour sharply critici zed france for not moving to arrest indicted war criminals possibly including karadzic and mladic in the sfor sectionthat it controls saying war criminals could feel perfectly safe there arbour also criticized france for refusing to allow fren ch military officers who served in peacekeeping forces in bosnia during the war to testify at war crimes trials another problem has been national im

countries had passed im plementing legislation while the united states and other nations including croatia have enacted implementinglegislation or taken other necessary domestic measures 31 some other nations including serbiamontenegro have failed to take the necessary steps under theirnational laws to enable cooperation with the tribunal 32 one should also note that the criminal laws of nation may authorize the prosecution of war crimes as domestic ma tter in such cas under article 9 of the statute of the tribunal the tribuna l would have to request the national authorities charged with enforcing their own criminal laws to defer to the tribunal unless legislation implementing the statute of the tribunal required automaticdeferral to the tribunal because obtaining the arrest of the

nation to arrest and transfer an indictee found within its jurisdiction 33 in july 1996 the tribunal issued international arrest warrants for bosnian serb leader radovankaradzic and bosnian serb army

statute of the tribunal as noted above imprisonment is to be served in state chosen from list of states which have indicated their willingness to accept convicted warcriminals in 1994 the secretarygeneral of the united nations sent note inviting all memberstates to indicate their willingness additionally the tribunal sent aletter in 1994 requesting 35 states to indi cate their willingness but only few gave positive response 34 most did not respond some indicated an inability to help or an inability to give definite response and the remainder indicated willingness only to

give way to reconc iliation if the desire to assign collective guilt to another ethnic group and exact revenge is replaced by the desire to bring to justice the individuals of all ethnic groups who committed the crimes one important problem has been the noncooperation of serbiamontenegro many analysts view milosevic as the chie f culprit in causing the war in bosnia and the organized war crimes known as ethnic cleansing yet he was also instrumental in bringing about the peace settlement and key player in determining the success or failure of the peace agreement serbia montenegros noncoope

areas of concern and questions include powers of the united nations could the creation of these two tribuna ls significantly strengthen the united nations particularly with respect to international criminal law giving itpotential new powers and enhanced international prestige is expanding the uns power and claim to international legitimacy an overallpolicy direction one seeks to promote on the other hand do constraints placed on the united nations by the charter including the veto given the five permanent members of the security councilassure that us interests will be adequately protected and assure that thepowers of the united nations in this and other areas will remain limited principles of international law do the tribunals constitute new step in the evolution of international criminal law or are they nonprecedent creating responses to unique situations that may not recur to what extent might the precedent of standing and active internationalcourt in one area of law pave the way for expanded court jurisdiction inother legal areas both criminal and civil to what degree does support for the tribunal establish precedent for usfunding of expanded tribunal activity in other parts of the world also what would the relationship be between the current tribunals and anynew but separate international criminal court established within the unframework us role in enforcing international law how does an active us presence on the courts and an active role in supporting them promote or detract from overall us foreign policy goals and objectives strong us presence on the court may not be popular in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96404crs34 international community yet lessthanleading role may diminish us stature in the international community finally to what extent are concerns of mission creep justified if u n tribunal were to be given an expanded jurisdictional role would there be anincreasing call for us intervention to provide stable environment for thetribunal to operate effectively ie could the war crimes angle have theultimate effect of setting up the us as policeman for numerous conflictswhere the united states has little or other foreign policy interestsarguably handinhand with broad manda for an active international war crimes tribunal is the requirement for policing power to enable the court tooperate effectively on the other hand are not

of war crimes and of permanent international tribunal to try such crimes has evolved over the last two centuries59 the age of enlightenment gave rise to the idea that while armies might clash in the conflict between nationstates innocent civilians should not be harmed napoleon adopted codes prohibiting theexecution of prisoners of war and the want on destruction of civilian property the union army adopted code of conduct duri ng the civil war in the united states and tried and executed the commandant of the confederate prison camp at andersonvillefor war crimes the first hague convention for the pacific settlement ofinternational disputes of 1899 and the hague convention iv on the laws andcustoms of war of 1907 were the first tw multilateral agreements to recognize and create an international law of humanitarian conduct applicable during war time 60 treaties ending world war i attempted to provide for the prosecution of war crimes the treaty of versailles of 191961 establishing the terms of peace with germany at the end of world war i provi ded for the prosecution of kaiser wilhelm ii for starting war of aggression and of german military personnel who committed war crimes in 1919 special commission was created to investigate responsibilityfor acts of war including the crime against the laws of humanity ultimately this crime was not included among the offenses prosecutable by an international criminalcourt the treaty of sevres 62 establishing the terms of peace with the turkish ottoman empire at the end of world war i provided for the surrender by turkey of persons accused of crimes against the laws of humanity this treaty was notratified and in any case such persons we re ultimately granted amnesty in 1937 the league of nations of which the united states was not member signed aconvention against terrorism 63 which had protocol providing for the establishment of special international criminal court to prosecute crimes ofterrorism this

multinational war crimes tribunals were created after worl d war ii the london charter of august 8 1945 established the international military tribunal at nuremberg to prosecutepersons accused of crimes against peace war crimes and crimes against humanity in europe 64 the following year the internati onal military tribunal for the far east was established at tokyo to prosecute major war criminals in the asianpacificregion 65 however these tribunals were held by multinational group of the victors in the conflict the ad hoc international tribunals for the former yugoslavia and rwanda may be considered the first truly international war crimes tribunals because they wereestablished by an international organization representing the global community notonly the victors in conflict however because the tribunals do not represent clear victors in conflict they do not have mo st of the accused war criminals in custody the extent to which the tribunals can effectively and fairly prosecute the accusedwill likely set precedent for and influen ce the prospects for the establishment of any permanent international criminal tribunalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96404crs44 66prepared by

wanted by the tribunal for trial on war crimes and that any member nation in whose jurisdiction the indictee is found is obligated to arre st the indictee and turn him over to the tribunal if the
