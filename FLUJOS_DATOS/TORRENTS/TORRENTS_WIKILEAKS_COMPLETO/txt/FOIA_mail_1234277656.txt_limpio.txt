from peterthorne peterthornemetofficegovuk to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re visit to met office date tue 10 feb 2009 095416 0000 cc david parker davidparkermetofficegovuk phil david as david says ill be away in oklahoma first week in march antarctic data first piqued my interest with the science paper on raobs trends which was clearly nonphysical but hard to nail down how wrong it was i did some minor digging into reader and found that in the ua domain it was qced but not homogenised ive made rather rash assumption that this would also be the case for the surface data but am happy to be corrected its clear to that antarctica is uniquely difficult environment to collect longterm homogeneous data in so i have substantial doubts that all the manned station pegs in steig et are adequate does this really matter im not sure what steig et satellites and potentially reanalyses does do is allow us in principle at least to get around the noneighbours issue in assessing homogeneity away from the peninsula for example we could use bootstrapping of the steig et approach by creating say 50 realisations of each station series using randomly seeded combinations of manned station pegs as the s et regem constraint excluding the candidate station to make neighbour composite ensemble we could then add in the available reanalysis field estimates and satellite estimates and make reasonable punt about the existence and magnitude of any breaks based upon multiple lines of evidence of course we lose some of these before 1979 we could use this information to assess in more rigorous way than has been done to date the homogeneity of these sparse stations then cleaned up data could be fed back through steig et afterwards to see how it impacts that analysis making for nice clean selfcontained study my understanding from the blog discussion of steig et is that the analysis step is fairly trivial so such an ensemble realisation approach should be plausible with humble pc so long as it has the coding platform available of course this doesnt resolve any fundamental methodological concerns about the s et approach that may exist but it does give us reasonable chance of creating much more homogeneous reader manned station dataset for next ipcc ar and our future products my suspicion is that actually changing the manned station data in this way may make s et more different to the straight average of the reader data as used effectively in ar5 and point to the importance of the longterm homogeneity of the data pegs in regem this may of course be felt to be can of worms too far peter on mon 20090209 at 1653 0000 phil jones wrote david i think i misinterpreted your email when in switzerland i think i thought you wanted talk and possible project now i read it and it is just possible project ive done lot with the antarctic temperature data i also have an archive of mslp data for most sites for some it is station level pressure with regards homogeneity it is difficult to do much beyond the peninsula and be confident about anything as the stations are too far apart there is an issue i could ask adrian whether erainterim is good enough since 1988 this could also assess the avhrr but this may be circular ive read steig et now and i can see all the comments on the ca and rc sites about some of the data it seems that bas have made some mistakes with some of the aws sites the only aws site used in crutem3 is the one at byrd as this is at one of the manned sites the issue with the awss is getting reasonable data in real time whilst i was away the checked monthly data arrived for 2002 i will add byrds data in the problem is that some sites get buried but still seem to transmit what steig et have done is paleotype reconstruction of the full field from the avhrr for recent period and extended it back to 1957 if the data are ok all youre assuming is that covariance structure remains the same i did this paper attached ages ago but it doesnt seem all that relevant anyway i do need to come down to see ian possibilities would be coming mid week say feb 2526 or march 45 how do these dates suit id need to spend the night maybe that travellodge near you it is only one night cheers phil at 1604 30012009 david parker wrote phil thanks i hope the gcos meeting goes well roger saunders will be there we look forward to your thoughts on the antarctic data and to your visit whenever that may be convenient for you david on fri 20090130 at 1556 0000 pjonesueaacuk wrote david the swiss extremes workshop has afternoons off for skiing as i dont ive been on 60 or 90 mins walks along snow covered trails snow is 1m deep off the trails anyway back now so looking at emails as the sun drops the temperature plummets im at the gcos imp plan meeting next week in geneva back in cru on feb 6 ive been reading the steig et paper ive looked at homogeneity issues with the antarctic data in the past difficult to do much except in the peninsula anyway ill give your proposal some thought will talk to others like kevin t next week as well about the paper glad to hear ian is settling it would be good idea to do two things on the visit im sure we can think of more glad also youre helping out brian i just couldnt rearrange my uea teaching again already done this so i can be here now and geneva next week have good weekend if little cold cheers phil phil peter thorne and others have suggested that you visit us in the near future to set up project in which cru would homogenise the reader surface temperature data for antarctica this subject arose in connection with steig et als paper on antarctic temperatures in last weeks nature and is also relevant to the possibility that we may include interpolations over the arctic ocean and antarctica in our analyses for ipcc ar5 peter challenges the results of steig et on the grounds that the in situ surface temperatures may not be homogeneous maybe you could even give seminar on eg antarctic observations please let know when visit would be convenient for you you could of course combine it with review of ians progress ian is now well settled into using our computing systems and has started to calculate rbar from the daily precipitation fields for the uk regions with view to estimating uncertainties in the regionallyaveraged daily values as crosscheck and to gain deeper appreciation of this myself i have independently written some software to calculate rbar this is leading to some ideas which i will send to you when i have had more time to think them through i understand youre busy as i am expecting to attend the malaria meeting at imperial on 1213 feb when you arent available hope youve had good meetings in geneva david david parker met office hadley centre fitzroy road exeter
