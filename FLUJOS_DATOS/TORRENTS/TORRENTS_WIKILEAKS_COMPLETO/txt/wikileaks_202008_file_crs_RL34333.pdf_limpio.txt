trainingadvisory operations in contrast there have been number of proposals to create new units and organizations better suited to address the challenges of these miss ion areas secretary of defense robert gatess recent challenge to the army to organize and prepare for asymmetric warfare and advising and training foreign armies could renew and elevate this debate the army began reorganizing to brigadebased fullspectrum force in 2003 primarily to provide larger pool of deployable units based on lessons learned from afghanistan and iraq the department of defense dod and the army have initiated significant changes in doctrine education and training focusing on counterinsurgency stabilization and trainingadvising foreign militaries the army has also begun the conversion from what it describes as cold war force structure into number of other types of units that have been considered highdemand lowdensity units that the army believes will be required in the future there have also been number of proposals to create specialized units to meet the operational challenges of counterinsurgency stabilization and trainingadvisory operations but the army insists that its current force structure is adequate to meet these challenges and that the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan precludes the effective use of these specialized units there are potential issues for congressional consideration for example should the armys missions be prioritized to reflect current and possible future security environments instead of holding the army equally responsible for all of its fullspectrum missions another potential issue is the armys emphasis on new doctrine education and training it can be argued that changes to army force structure have not matched the significant changes in doctrine education and training there might also be concern that the army has not conducted sufficient analysis of the proposals for specialized units and has chosen to continue to rely on fullspectrum units without subjecting this decision to sufficient analytic rigor questions also might arise as to whether too much is being asked of soldiers and brigade combat teams bcts in terms of being able to perform the myriad challenging missions that they are being assigned particularly given the loss of noncommissioned officers and junior officers the need for specialized army units might also be topic of the congressionally mandated roles and missions review slated to occur sometime in 2008 this report may not be updated

armyconsisting of active na tional guard and reserve unitsis required to be able to conduct joint multinational operations anywhere across the spectrum of operations this spectrum ranges from the low endemphasizing stability and civil support operationsto the high endemphasizing major combat operations1 to accomplish this mission the army has chosen to man equip and train each of its combat and support units to be fullspectrumcapable able to function in all operational scenarios described in the previous passage while the army considers its units full spectrum capable army units are optimized for traditional ground campaigns against the ground forces of other nations

army leadership desires fullspectrum expeditionary globally deployable army2 and has focused current and future resources toward achieving this vision impacting on this vision is the reality that the allvolunteer army has also become rotational force that can not be deployed indefinitely for the duration of an extended conflictas was the case in the second world warwithout the fear that the force would break because soldiers might opt to leave the army in significant numbers due to excessive combat tours this factor plays significant role in organizing manning training and equipping the army the general rule of thumb for the rotational army is that for every one unit deployed two other similar units are required one unit preparing to relieve the deployed unit and another unit that has just returned from deployment and undergoing recovery process so that it can redeploy in the future g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g17g155g144g138g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561 in 2003 the armyin

there is general agreement amongst number of military analysts that the fullspectrum us armys initial success in defeating the taliban in afghanistan and the iraqi army during three week campaign demonstrated that the army is good at destroying targets and bad at rebuilding states 11 in the case of afghanistan the taliban regime was toppled primarily by the efforts of us special operations

technology airpower and the ineptitude of the iraqi army13 army leadership and some military analysts viewed the lowcasualty rapid defeats of the regimes in afghanistan and iraq as validation of the armys rapid decisive operations rdo14 concept but the armys performance during the stability operations15 phase commonly referred to as phase iv was considered inadequate by some however the armys difficulties in phase iv should not be solely attributed to its focus on fullspectrum organization and doctrine one military expert suggests that stabilization or phase iv operations are far more challenging than defeating conventional military forces they can best be conducted if the us is prepared for immediate action after the defeat of conventional enemy forces both in afghanistan and iraq the us wasted critical days weeks and m onths in engaging in security effort before opposition movements could regroup or reengage it left power vacuum then exploited one and it was not prepared for nation build ing or the escalation of resistance once the enemy was defeated 16 the failure to properly plan resource and execute phase iv operations has been cited as significant contributing factor in the emergence of insurgencies17 particularly in the case of iraq the armys performance in the conduct of counterinsurgency operations has varied widely between units with some suggesting that the army as an institution needed to relearn counterinsurgency warfare18an assertion that directly challenges the armys contention that it is full spectrumcapable force 13 dr stephen biddle study director

to influence the political and civil environment to facilitate diplomacy and to interrupt specified illegal activities its purpose is to deter or thwart aggression reassure allies friendly governments

be given priority comparable to combat operations and be explicitly addressed and integrated across all dod activities including doctrine organizations training education exercises material leadership personnel facilities and planning20 the significance of this directive is that stability and associated operations are now to be treated as equal to combat operationsa major cultural shift for the us

in the 1980s to support the united states involvement in salvadors successful 12 year counterinsurgency campaign against wellorganized sovietbacked marxist guerilla movement23 fm 324 is described as downplaying the militarys role in successful counterinsurgency campaign stressing instead the need for nonmilitary us agency involvement less kinetic and lighter military approach and the need to constantly learn and adapt24 fm 324 also does not advocate the creation of specialized counterinsurgency units and continues to rely on fullspectrumcapable units to successfully prosecute the

throughout their careers in general terms the army has decreased the emphasis placed on teaching conventional force onforce combat operations and increased emphasis on stabilization and counterinsurgency operations as well as regional cultural awareness and language skills for example the armys command and general staff college cgsc at fort leavenworth kansas used to include only about 30 hours of counterinsurgency course work for the majors attending the yearlong course but now includes 200plus hours of counterinsurgency core courses and another 40plus hours of counterinsurgency electives 25 the army is revising the officer and nco education system to include stability operations and is integrating cultural awareness and language proficiency training into educational courses26 while the army has changed and added to course curriculum to reflect current operational needs the army has also significantly shortened the dura tion of number of officer and nco bedrock courses to meet the needs of commanders for officers and ncos to serve in iraq and afghanistan27 the armys overall intent is to build its leaders into pentathletesleaders who are equally

maneuver combat operations against warsawtype pact mechanized and armor forces as well as light infantry and irregular forces these centers now feature such innovations as villages and urban centers replicating those found in iraq and afghanistan indigenous foreignspeaking role players car bombs and improvised explosive devices30 the ctcs now stress continuous complex counterinsurgency and civil affairs operations and working with interagency nongovernmental organizations ngos and civilian organizations 31 the armys policy in the past was to rotate bcts and associated units through one of these centers for comprehensive and challenging monthlong exercise prior to deploy ment to iraq or afghanistan but the rapid turnaround of units for combat deployments has meant that some units have not had time for ctc exercise some units are arriving at ctcs at reduced readiness status and the focus has shifted in those cases from graduate level counterinsurgency and stability training to only missionessential tasks 32 for units that have not had time for ctc rotation training teams from ctc are sent to the units home station for abbreviated predeployment training while the abbreviated

that the united states exit from iraq and afghanis tan depends on stepping up us advising of those nations security forces35 the united states and other coalition nations in iraq and afghanistan have been involved to varying degrees over the past few years in the training and advising of afghan and iraqi military and police units from the individual basic training through unit level the intent in both cases is to build military capacity so that security responsibilities can be transferred to iraqi and afghan forces permitt ing the united states to permanently reduce its troop presence in these countries over the past year about 4800 members of the army navy and air force have been trained under 72day training program at ft riley kansas the marines trains its teams at the 29 palms training facility in california to serve as members of the 11man training teams 36 these ad hoc teamsabout 135 teams in iraq and 55 in afghanistandeploy for about year and consist of midgrade officers and ncos who are also in demand to fill vacancies in us units these teams live and work alongside iraqi and afghan military and police units where they are teaching them basic tactics and planning and providing them w ith intelligence air power and other support as well as monitoring their operations for signs of sectarian activity and other abuses37 while it is not known how much longer us forces will be training iraqi and afghan soldiers and police us army leaders are planning on at least anothe r 15 years of what they describe as persistent conflict not just in iraq and afghanistan but throughout the world38 concerns about the current approach 39 there are concerns about the temporary adhoc nature of these advisory and training teams one concern is that the current approach is not the most efficient and costeffective approach to potentially longterm mission to train and advise iraqi and afghanand perhaps other nationssecurity forces these teams are brought together to train for 10 weeks then sent to iraq or afghanistan for yearlong tour there is evidence suggesting that it takes these teams four to six months before they become effective finally after completion of their yearlong tour the teamswho have gained invaluable training advisory and cultural experienceare then disbanded and are sent on to other army assignments another concern is that many soldiersofficers in particularassigned to these teams consider these assignments detrimental to their careers because it takes them off their career paths for promotion by being out of their career paths for over year

association of the united states army ausa41 issued what some suggest was declaration of bureaucratic war and call to rethink the army by challenging the armys current training organizational personnel and strategic policies42 in his speech secretary gates made the following points43 the us army today is an orga nization largely organized trained and equipped in different era for different kind of conflict one of the principal challenges that the army faces is to regain its traditional edge at fighting conventional wars while retaining what it has learnedand relearnedabout unconventional warsthe ones most likely to be fought in the years ahead the standing up and mentoring of indigenous forcesonce the province of special forcesis now key mission for the military as whole how the army should be organized and prepared for this advisory role remains an open question and will require innovative and forward thinking until our government decides to plus up our civilian agencies like the agency for international development army soldiers can expect to be tasked with reviving public services rebuilding infrastructure and promoting good governance all these socalled nontraditional capabilities have moved into the mainstream of military thinking planning and strategywhere they must stay these remarks are said to have renewed an intense debate over proposals for sweeping reorganization of the army to address shortcomings that have plagued the force in iraq and to abandon some warfighting principles that have prevailed since the cold war 44 this debate has 40 branchqualifying position in the army is specific staff or command position within an officers branch infantry artillery signal corps etc that an officer must successfully serve in to be

forces also referred to as green berets have been the only army units specifically organized trained and equipped to conduct counterinsurgency and training and advisory missions army special forces continue to conduct these missions but because of their limited size and the demand for direct action missions to kill or capture highvalue targets and key insurgents in iraq and afghanistan army special forces are conducting increasingly fewer counterinsurgency and trainingadvisory missions g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g156g561 there are likely variety of proposals for the creation of specialized counterinsurgency units but there has not been widespread public discussion of possible options the following three proposals can be considered representative of the range of options concerning counterinsurgency forces three distinct forces 46 this proposal would redesign the majority of ground forces into units specializing in one of three disciplines conventional warfighting counterinsurgency and stabilization operations and homeland defense the warfighting component would consist of traditional mechanized and armored units and conventional support units artillery attack helicopters etc needed for combat operations against conventional forces the second component would combine army special forces wi th additional support units that have been trained specifically for counterinsurgency and stabilization operations units in this second component would have language and cultural tr aining and would be able to conduct law enforcement governance and infrastructure repair operations when us civilian capacity is absent or available only on limited scale the third and final component would consist primarily of reserve units and would be organized traine d and equipped for homeland security missions 45 ibid 46 information in this section is from dr steven metz and frank hoffman restructuring americas ground forces better not bigger the stanley foundation

able to optimize its forces for any specific task as opposed to the current fullspectrum approach where it can be argued that the army is longer optimized for any task given the recent heavy emphasis on counterinsurgency stabilization and training missions this specialization could result in greater expertise in all three areas which could mean particularly in terms of counterinsurgency that future operations could be conducted more efficiently in terms of time cost and casualties the major drawbacks to this course of action would be expense both having to maintain three separate forces and overcoming cultural biases within the army that could arise when soldiers are grouped in three different specialities with significantly different responsibilities prioritizing missions 47 this option would depart from the current fullspectrum focus and instead prioritize missionsmuch as in the case of the cold war where conventional warfighting was the preeminent mission for us ground forces taking this approach the united states could relegate conventional warfighting to secondtier priority and elevate counterinsurgency and stabilization to the forefront besides providing mission focus for us forces this approach could have the benefit of prioritizing what some believe will become increasingly scarce funds for defense procurement advocates for highcost major weapons systems could oppose this course of action as counterinsurgency and stabilization operations tend to be less dependent on large hightech weapons systems an inherent risk in this approach is assuming that decision makers will be able to accurately anticipate the security threats that the united states will face in coming decades augmenting brigade combat teams bcts 48 another proposed solution to address counterinsurgency organizational needs is to create special staff section for each of the armys proposed 76 bcts specifically designed to deal with counterinsurgency and other unconventional operations this staff section would be responsible for formulating counterinsurgency plans policies and doctrine for the bct in addition the section would have funds available to underwrite counterinsurgency and stabilization tasks such as logistics intelligence and interpreter support and to provide compensation for local security forces if required officers assigned to this staff section would require specialized counterinsurgency training and experience over and above that of the typical officer potential benefit from adopting this course of action would be that it could be done at relatively low cost and without the potential strategic risk associated with largescale organizational and cultural changes while this staff section could enhance the bcts ability to conduct counterinsurgency operations it might not have direct impact on how individual soldiers and smaller units perform counterinsurgency functions with some noting that counterinsurgencies can be lost or won at the soldier and squad level 47 ibid 48 information in this section is from james d campbell making riflemen from mud restoring the armys culture of irregular warfare carlisle papers in security

just as there are proposals for creating specialized counterinsurgency units there are arguments against one representative argument maintains that the army should not develop specialized its to fight counter insurgency as us doctrine fm 324 and strategy indicate the primary role of the united states in counterinsurgency is strengthening and supporting partners us involvement in counterinsurgency combat should always be seen as an emergency expedient undertaken only when absolutely necessary for the shortest period of time possible given this it would not be an effective use of resources to create specialized units for counterinsurgency combat if direct combat is needed for some finite period of time the tactical activities would be close enough to those already resident in the force that the training of existing units can be modified to make them effective 49 while this argument is rooted in current us milita ry doctrine it might also be argued that it is unrealistic to believe that the us military will routinely have partners that are equal to the task and that the us military might find itself in prolonged counterinsurgency combatas in the case in iraq and afghanistanwhere current combat operations can hardly be classified as an emergency expedient of short duration g21g157g138g139g146g149g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561g23g151g146g157g156g561 there have also been

request of the house armed services committee hasc the congressional budget office cbo published study that propos ed eight options for restructuring the army that would increase the armys ability to conduct different missions and to decrease the reliance on the reserve component one of these options would be the establishment of stability and reconstruction sr divisions cbos option would eliminate one heavy division about three heavy bcts and supporting units and one light infantry division about three infantry bcts and supporting units and use the personnel and equipment resources to activate five sr divisionsfour in the active component and one in the reserves each sr division would include military police engineer medical civil affairs and psychological operations units and

equipped and trained force for sr type of operations cbo estimated that this op tion would save the army almost 14 billion from 2006 to 2022 because of the smaller number of combat units that the army would need to modernize and because of the reduced emphasis on high technology weapons such as the fcs intended for conventional combat operations in addition cbo projected an additional cost savings of 18 billion in operations and support costs through 2022 and 1 billion annually thereafter cbo maintains that the major drawback to this opt ion is that it would reduce the armys ability to fight wars as it would have six fewer bcts available if the five stryker bcts in cbos proposed sr divisions are dedicated exclusively to the sr divisions then the army would have 11 fewer bcts available for major combat operations g15g158g149g157g146g556g143g158g151g140g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g21g157g138g139g146g149g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561g22g138g156g148g561g8g152g155g140g142g156g347g343g561 another proposal maintains that the key to success is to integrate stabilization force packages into bcts to begin stabilization and reconstruction operations as soon as combat operations end this proposal calls for the establishment of multifunctional stabilization battalion task forces that can be inserted into bcts or larger multifunctional stabilization brigade task forces that can operate over larger geographical area these stabilization task forces would consist of mix of forces including combat and support forces but key focus for these task forces would be to maintain internal security and conduct law enforcement operations at the local level the task forces would also focus on infrastructure repair if the local security situation permits besides providing specialized forces and focused efforts for stabilization and reconstruction operations this proposal would free bcts of the responsibility of conducting these operations permitting them to focus on combat operations instead

while acknowledging the appeal of establishing specialized stabilization units some maintain that there are significant downsides to this idea in certain instances for example it is necessary to deter renewed conflict to win counterinsurgency and combat units are considered the best choice as they are trained to win battles and they inspire respect and fear from those who would challenge them 53 furthermore in large operations the missions are too large in scale for small number of specialized units to handle on their own54 if specialized stabilization units were developed it is likely that they would require considerable help from generalpurpose formations either all the time or at least at some point in the multiyear efforts55 instead it is suggested that the army needs to increase the

is less wellknown however is whether the army has subjected any or all of these proposals to any form of critical analytic review without formal analytic review the ar my could be accused of being dismissive and choosing the easier path of continuing to rely on fullspectrum forces comprehensive analytic comparison by the army as well as inde pendent organizations of all optionsincluding the current fullspectrum approachcould highlight the advantages disadvantages and resource requirements of the various proposals and if the results favor fullspectrum approach add further weight to the armys current position on the need for specialized units

on one level in order for brigade combat team bct and its soldiers to conduct the current and potential panoply of fullspectrum missions additional training education and equipment are the key on another level soldiers are the key the armys need for pentathletesparticularly among its officer and noncommissioned officer nco corpsmay prove to be an unobtainable goal65 reports suggest that the army is losing our combat experienced midcareer ncos and captains at an excessive rate66 of even greater concern perhaps is reported internal army warning in 2005 that there was disproportionate loss of highpotential highperformance junior leaders precisely the types the army envisions as its pentathletes67 the loss of these junior officers has other implications as well on is that there is less competition for promotion meaning that less capable officers could be promoted to more senior ranks68 another is that to fill these depleted officer ranks the army is send ing more ncos and junior soldiers with nco potential to officer candidate school thereby depriving the nco corpsalready several thousand ncos shortof much needed highpotential highperformance ncos69 these circumstances may preclude the army from achievi ng and maintaining fullspectrum capability and further stress soldiers and bcts by requiring them to perform at level currently beyond their abilities
