department of veterans affairs fy2006fy2007 4 veterans benefits issues in the 109th congress introduction the first section of title 38 of the united states code defines veteran as person who has been discharged under conditions other than dishonorable from active military naval or air service federal policy toward veterans recognizes the importance of their service to the nation and the effect that service may have on their subsequent civilian lives this policy dates back to the first pensions granted by the continental congress to soldiers disabled by their service in the revolutionary war and to the dependents of those who were killed some benefits require service during period of war members of reserve units or the national guard can gain eligibility for some veterans benefits by virtue of being called to active duty by the federal government although military retirees are veterans their retirement benefits are paid by the department of defense dod benefits administered by the department of veterans affairs va directly or in conjunction with other federal agencies include the following among other things programs that provide compensation for disabilities sustained or worsened as result of active duty military service pensions for war veterans with low incomes who are either 1 permanently and totally disabled or 2 over the age of 65 cash payments for certain categories of dependents andor survivors free medical care for conditions sustained during military service and medical care for other conditions much of which is provided free to lowincome veterans education training rehabilitation and job placement services to assist veterans upon their return to civilian life loan guarantees to help them obtain homes life insurance to enhance financial security for their dependents and burial assistance flags grave sites and headstones when they die the va is divided into three administrative structures the veterans benefit administration vba the veterans health administration vha and the national cemetery administration nca this report is primarily concerned with benefits other than those provided through the vha it does not discuss health care issues for discussion of the vha and health care issues for veterans see crs report rl32961 veterans health care issues in the 109th congress by sidath viranga panangala crs2 the veteran and benefit populations the va is the major source for information on the total veteran population and beneficiaries of veterans benefits estimates of the veteran population will be different from the population receiving benefits during specific time period for several reasons including not all veterans may be receiving benefits in given period of time benefits may be depending on the specific benefit provided to veterans surviving spouses and children and some veterans surviving spouses or children may receive more than one type of benefit in given period of time the veteran population the va estimates1 the veteran population by various characteristics including age sex state and period of service as of september 30 2005 there were an estimated 244 million living veterans with 243 million of them living in the united states and puerto rico six states each had an estimated veteran population of 1 million or more california 23 million florida 18 million texas 17 million new york 11 million pennsylvania 11 million and ohio 10 million these states were home to 370 of the total veteran population the three largest states california florida and texas were home to 235 of the total veteran population six states had an estimated veteran population of less than 100000 delaware south dakota alaska vermont wyoming and north dakota together these six states were home to 16 of the total veteran population as of september 30 2005 the majority of all veterans 636 were age 55 or older with 110 aged 80 or older female veterans were 70 of the total veteran population and had an age distribution that was generally younger than for all veterans as of september 30 2005 only 304 of female veterans were aged 55 or older and 97 were aged 80 or older almost half 498 of female veterans were between 35 and 55 years of age the benefit population the va also provides data on the number of beneficiaries of veterans benefits in fy2005 disability compensation benefits were 1 the department of veterans affairs estimates vetpop2004 version 10 office of the actuary office of policy us department of veterans affairs december 2004 are based on model that uses detailed data on veterans from the decennial census through april 2000 actual dod separations including reserve and national guard forces with federal activation through september 2003 and projected dod separations including an estimate for an increased level of reserve separations through september 2009 at this time the model output does not distinguish among cohorts of veterans by time of entry into and departure from the military nor whether they were reserve or national guard members activated for duty in iraq or afghanistan nor does the model incorporate any particular assumptions about the longterm effects of the war in iraq and afghanistan on the size or composition of the veteran population save for the assumption that the gulf war would end on sept 30 2006 which is done to allocate veterans to period of service it should also be noted that many reserve and national guard members activated for duty in iraq or afghanistan were veterans at the time of activation that is they were discharged from active duty military service before joining the reserve or national guard crs3 provided to 2600583 veterans 326272 survivors and 1171 children in addition there were 82333 veterans

training special assistance for the disabled home loan guarantees and veterans insurance and indemnities are mandatory entitlement spending although required amounts are annually appropriated veterans entitlement benefits were once increasing rapidly but now they are relatively stable federal obligation to declining population of veterans the remaining programs primarily those associated with medical care facility construction and medical research are annual discretionary appropriations as are funds for the costs of administering va programs in fy1976 entitlements constituted 73 of vas budget with the remaining 27 of the budget comprised of discretionary appropriations for va health care administration and construction for fy2007 mandatory spending is expected to be about 53 of the total va budget with discretionary spending at 47 for the entire federal budget little more than onethird of spending is discretionary va cash benefits spending for the va cash benefit programs is mandatory and the amounts requested by the budget are based on projected caseloads definitions of eligibility and benefit levels are found in various sections of title 38 of the us code while the overall number of veterans is declining outlays for va entitlement benefits mostly serviceconnected compensation pensions and readjustment primarily education payments were expected to be 381 billion for fy2006 and are projected to reach 382 billion in fy20075 much of the projected increases for recent years result from greater proportion of surviving veterans receiving benefits and liberalizations to the montgomery gi bill mgib the primary education program compensation and pensions the compensation program pays benefits to living veterans who have suffered loss or reduction in earning capacity as result of condition traceable to period of military service6 and to the dependent survivors of certain veterans the va pension program is meanstested benefit for permanently disabled from condition unrelated to their military service veterans of wartime service whose incomes and assets fall below certain levels after taking into consideration the financial circumstances and dependents of eligible veterans the pension payments along with countable income are intended to bring their total 5 calculated by the congressional research service for projected net outlays for

to the targeted amounts7 given the broad availability of other sources of income including social security program caseload is diminishing as fewer veterans have incomes below the categorical levels during fy2005 about 26 million veterans drew an average of 783 in monthly compensation for serviceconnected disabilities about 326300 of their dependent survivors averaged about 1072 in monthly payments8 pensions for 337787 veterans averaged about 654 monthly 211240 survivors of veteran pensioners averaged about 288 monthly9 one of the issues that arises in determining who should receive compensation and how much is the inconsistency of va representatives in the 57 regional offices applying written criteria to individual cases10 out of concern for the disparity in the amounts of disability compensation awarded to veterans living in different regions of the country congress included provision in the fy2006 appropriations bill for va pl 109114 to instruct the va to conduct veterans disability compensation information campaign in states with an average annual disability compensation payment of less than 7300 in response to this provision va is conducting outreach efforts in illinois indiana michigan ohio new jersey and connecticut readjustment near the end of world war ii congress enacted series of programs to assist veterans in readjusting to civilian life and to help the national economy adapt to the influx of demobilizing armed forces the gi bill has entered the national lexicon as an example of federal responsibility for this readjustment responsibility and many citizens continue to refer to the current array of programs by that historical name indeed the largest current program providing readjustment education benefits is named the montgomery gi bill mgib program after its congressional sponsor and the heritage it brought into the age of an allvolunteer military service without conscription to fill the ranks of active duty armed services the inducements to potential recruits must be sufficient to attract them to enlist the mgib provides recruits with the promise of educational assistance when they separate and the amounts that eligible participants receive has climbed significantly over the last few years from 800 per month for 36 months for threeyear enlistment in fy2002 to 985 per month in fy2004 and 1034 per month in 7 for 2005 the annual basic level for an eligible single veteran was 10162 with one dependent 13309 and each additional dependent 1734 for 2006 these amounts have been adjusted to 10579 13855 and 1806 respectively additional amounts are available for eligible veterans who are housebound or in need of aid and attendance 8 department of veterans affairs fy2007 budget submission summary volume

benefits the va program to guarantee home loans for veterans has made significant contribution to the national goal of increasing the number of families who own their own homes by supporting the loan applications of more than 200000 veterans year because of the guarantees lenders are protected against losses up to the amount of the guarantee thereby permitting veterans to obtain mortgages with little or down payment and with competitive interest rates these guarantees and certain direct loans to specific categories of veterans are obligations of the federal government that constitute mandatory spending administrative expenses are discretionary appropriations transferred from the home loan programs to the general operating expenses account11 va construction congress provided 1561 billion in major construction for fy2006 and 201 million in minor construction including supplementals these construction funds are used primarily for health care facilities such as hospitals community based outpatient clinics and nursing homes but these funds are also used to design build and acquire land for cemeteries and administrative centers the administration request is 399 million for major construction projects for fy2007 and 198 million for minor construction hr 5385 as passed by the house would provided 284 million for major construction and 210 million for minor construction the senate appropriations committee approved 429 million and 168 million respectively12 major construction projects are those with an estimated cost of 7 million or more many of the minor construction projects will continue vas overall strategy of expanding outpatient access13 burial and cemetery benefits payments to honor and help defray the cost of veterans burials will total about

equal to the social security increase in payments for disability compensation to veterans and for dependency and indemnity compensation to their eligible survivors the cola for these programs is not in permanent law unlike the cola for social security benefits the cola for 2006 of 41 first payable in checks issued in january 2006 was provided by pl 109111 which the president signed on november 22 2005 the house passed its version of the veterans compensation costofliving adjustment act of 2006 hr 4843 on june 27 2006 and the senate version s 2562 was reported on july 27 2006 pl 109361 provides 33 costofliving adjustment beginning in january 2007 which is equal to the cola for social security concurrent receipt of military retirement and va disability benefits until 2004 simultaneous payment of military retirement and va disability benefits was prohibited as duplicate payment for the same period of service retirement pay has been reduced on dollarfordollar basis by the amount of disability compensation received because retirement pay is taxable while disability benefits are not the fy2004 national defense authorization act ndaa approved concurrent receipt for retirees with at least 50 disability but set up 10 year schedule to phase in full payment of retirement benefits the fy2005 ndaa repealed this phasein after december 31 2004 for qualified retiree receiving veterans disability compensation for disability rated as 100 the senate version of the fy2006 ndaa extended the repeal of the phasein to veterans with full or 100 unemployability rating but the house version only accelerated the phasein for these veterans the house provision was adopted in the conference report the house version of the fy2006 ndaa hrept 10989 passed house may 25 2005 contained partial step toward inclusion of 100 unemployables the house would authorize full concurrent receipt for 100 unemployables beginning october 1 2009 over four years earlier than the date of january 1 2014 in current law the date of full concurrent receipt for all retirees regardless of disability rating the senate version once again would have authorized immediate concurrent receipt for all those with 100
