processed by the mobile unit which handles combination of new modification and lost applications all these u nits processing applications have to pass the application through the numbering indexing belt and laminating processing units according to the current regulations once person reaches the age of 16 that person is eligible to receive national ident ity card at present national identity card applications are distributed through grama niladharis gn at village level and the application details are sent to department of registration of persons through the respective divisional secretariats ds he nce the functions of the department have been decentralized to the divisional secretariats and grama niladari level the department verifies the applications received from the divisional secretariats and issues the id cards id cards are distributed to the citizens through the divisional secretariats or the grama niladaris in addition the department has one day service where citizens are able to obtain an id card within few hours if they visit the department there have been numerous instances w here the existing national identity card has been forged and hence the credibility of the existing national identity card as an authentic identity document has been compromised to great extent furthermore at present it is difficult to obtain nation identity card within short period of time except through the one day service offered at the department of registration of persons in order to address these issues department of registration of persons wishes to automate their activities and also issue more secure and reliable national identity card section v schedule of requirements 97 the national identity card nic project preliminary government process re engineering gpr study was carried out in the department to make the internal processes in th department more effi cient citizen centric and suitable for automated processing as result certain existing processes in the department are to be changed and certain new core processes are to be introduced with the implementation of the nic project stated below are t he core processes identified together with the boundaries of each core process process obtaining of applications from the point citizen becomes eligible for registration until the point the relevant individual submits an application to an authorize d representative of the department process b application processing record management from the point representative of the department accepts an application new or modification of information to the point the application is processed the individ ual registered or relevant information modified and id card with correct information is returned to the applicant and his information maintained in secure manner process c handling of lost cards and updating information withdrawing the id card of deceased person from the point registered individual looses an id card until the point the card is recovered and handed over to the individual or new card is processed and handed over to the individual in addition from the point of receiving info rmation on the death of citizen up to the point of updating the system and withdrawing and canceling the id card process d handling of customer queries from the point any citizen or institution makes query from any authorized officer even those to whom the commissioners powers have been decentralized until the time such information is made available to the individual or institution seeking the information including on line access to selected institutions like elections department immigration partment etc this process includes maintaining knowledge base of type of queries that are being asked and the responses given below are the objectives of the new core processes process obtaining of applications applications should be available in 3 languages sinhala tamil and english applications should be easily available to the citizens applicants should find it convenient to fill the application the department should be aware of those eligible for registration and their contact details place of residence address and photograph should be properly certified by the authorized certifying officer applicant should take responsibility for the information provided and the required information on the application should be completed at least i n sinhalatamil english process b processing of applications information stated in the application should be validated with other systems such as the proposed epopulation register system preferably on line section v schedule of requirements 98 applicant should be able to validate the in formation in the enic system before registration and issue of an id card single register of persons should be maintained and the information should be readily accessible should be able to handle frequent modifications ie address as well as less frequent modifications ie change of name should ensure every application is registered and issued with an id card should ensure the id card is handed over to the applicant should maintain the records physical electronic for future reference should ensure all information in the card and databaseregister are current and accurate process c handling of lost cards should register and invalidate lost card should issue temporary receipt to state that citizen has the id card should facilita receiving of lost cards should facilitate re distribution of lost cards received should issue cards for those that are lost and not found process d query management should handle any citizen query in sinhalatamil or english should provide automat ed responses such as automated voice responses sms web interfaces etc to query application related and lost card related queries should inform the applicant on the status of an application should provide on line verification to authorised persons on r egistered persons should make the verification of information on the cards convenient to the public in addition following policy level decisions have been taken as result of the reengineering exercise decentralize certain activities such as registra tion of applications localized distribution of cards and handling of related enquiries to divisional secretariat ds level special rpd units to be set up at d ivisional secretariats applications will not be controlled nor serially numbered this facil itates wider distribution of blank application forms the control and numbering takes place only after handing over the application to the d ivisional secretariat the facial picture thumb impression of the applicant will be taken on line information i n the card to be printed in 3 languages sinhala tami and english card to be valid for 1 0 years age of eligibility to be reduced to 15 years online verification information to be provided to identified organizations eg elections department imm igration department police etc the new identity card

benefits of the nic project following are the expected benefits of the enic system benefits to rpd section v schedule of requirements 99 the enic system would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of id card issuing system the security loop holes of the existing issuing pr ocess will be minimized enic system would establish an efficient card information verification mechanism which would provide card information to subscribed organizations through number of channels the environment of department of registration of person s would be changed in positive manner benefits to citizens citizens would be provided with id cards in more convenient manner the time taken to issue national identity cards will be considerably reduced citizens would be provided with facilities at divisional secretariats to capture photographs thumb impression s etc making it more convenient for citizen citizens would be able to track the status of their applications submitted without visiting the grama niladhari divisional secretariat or the partment of registration of persons national identity card would contain information in all three languages making it easy for citizen s to prove their identity in given situation government and private organizations the government and private organiz ations would be able to verify the authenticity of cards by checking the convert and overt security features of the card rpd would allow government and private organization to subscribe to the card information verification process the subscribed parties would be able to verify the card information through multiple channels for an agreed fee since the information of the card would be kept up to date government and private organizations would rely on the information containing in nic major components of the nic project the project comprises of five main components activities as mentioned below i the enic software system development ii provisioning of data centre facilities including hardware and
