seen since 1960 compared with spending increases over the past 40 years the 71 increase that occurred in 2005 is relatively moderate in particular the years 1979 through 1981 experienced growth rates between 138 and 159 relative to the overall economy personal health expenditures increased in 2005 in 2005 personal health expenditures acc ounted for 133 of gross domestic product gdp up from 132 of

percentage of gdp stayed between 115 and 117 during the three decades prior to the 1990s personal health expenditu res as percentage of gdp increased almost every year home health care spending was the fastest growing category of personal health care in 2005 home health care spending in 2005 was 111 higher than the amount spent in 2004 yet because home health car represents about 3 of personal health expenditures it was one of the smallest contributors to overall growth in personal health spending hospital care which grew 79 in 2005 and accounts for more than onethird of personal health expenditures contributed the most to overall growth in personal health spending spending on phy sician and clinical services which grew at 70 in 2005 and accounts for onefourth of personal health expenditures was the second largest contributor to overall gr owth in personal health spending over 85 of personal health expenditure s in 2005 were financed by thirdparty payers the largest payer

januaryfebruary 2002this report focuses on expenditures for personal health care since these goods and services constitute most spending on healthrelated activities the latter half of the 1990s experienced historically low growth in personal health care spending from the beginning of 1994 to the end of 1999 health spending increased at an average annual rate of 56 this low growth is attributable to changes in both the private and public sectors in the private sector the increased use of managed care limited cost growth during the mid1990s vigorous fraudanda buse investigation and the balanced budget act of 1997 which slowed growth in hospital home health and nursing home payments constrained health expenditures in the late 1990s2 the effect of these changes in public and priv ate sector have subsided in 2000 personal health expenditures grew at 67 11 percen tage points higher than the average rate over the previous six years personal health expenditures grew at even higher rates in 2001 87 but have fallen steadily since then looking from broader historical perspective spending growth in recent years is still much lower than that in most years since 1960 see figure 1 in particular the years 1979 through 1981 experienced growth rates between 138 and 159 source congressional research service crs calculations using data from the centers for medicare and medicaid

health expenditures3 t h r factors contribute to growth in nominal health spending higher population higher prices and higher real per capita expe nditures which some experts label the intensity of care real per capita expenditures indicate qualitative and quantitative increases in the amount of car received by individuals figure 2 depicts the role of population prices and real per capita expe nditures in nominal health expenditure growth caution should be used when inte rpreting data on real health expenditures however real expenditures are estimated using price indexes for medical care goods and services but such price indexes are imperfect4 as result of these imperfections it is difficult to isolate prices and real per capita health expenditures from nominal health spending source

factors influencing gr owth in nominal personal health expenditureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31374crs4 health spending and gross domestic product spending on personal health care in 2005 increased relative to the overall economy in 2005 personal health care ex penditures accounted for 133 of gross domestic product gdp up from 132 of gdp in 2003 and 2004 128 of gdp in 2002 and 122 of gdp in 2001 these increases mark departure from the experience of the previous nine years when health spending as percent of gdp was relatively constant between 1992 and 2000 personal health care expenditures averaged 116 of gdp see figure 3 source the congressional research service crs calculations using data from the centers for medicare and medicaid services office of the actuary growth in categories of medical care four categories of medical goods and services compose more than 84 of personal health care expenditures hospital care physician and clinical services prescription drugs and longterm care which includes nursing home and home health care in 2005 home health care wa s the fastest growing category of health expenditures increasing 111 above 2004 expenditures see table 1 0246810121416 1960

dollar growth yet moderate percentage growth is attributable to the fact that hospital care c onstitutes relatively large share of total personal health expenditureshowever growth rates of individual categories of services can be deceptive at indicating how much particular category of medical care contributed to overall spending growth as indicated in table 1 the category with the largest dollar increase was hospital care in 2005 sp ending on hospital care was 447 b illion higher than in 2004 an increase of 795 home health care expenditures were 47 billion higher in 2005 than they were in 2004 an increase of 111 thus even though home health care increased more th an hospital care in terms of percentage growth hospital care grew more than home health care in dollar terms that is growth in hospital care contributed most to increased personal health care expenditures in 2005 the 447 billion increase in hospital expenditures in 2005 accounted for 41 of the 1101 billion increase in overall personal health care spending figure 4 shows how much dollar growth in each category of personal health care contributed to total grow th in personal health expenditures source the

noninstitutional establishments spending on drugs dispensed in nursing homes or hospitals is considered spending on those respective categories consequently data on prescription drug expenditures are likely to be understatedsource the congressional research service crs calculations using data from the centers for medicare and medicaid services office of the actuary much attention has been directed at sp ending on prescription drugs the share of personal health expenditu res devoted to prescription drugs has more than doubled since 1981 when drugs accounted for only 54 of personal health expenditures yet 1981 represented the trough of 20y ear decline in spending on prescription drugs as share of personal health expe nditures while the percent of personal health expenditures spent on prescription dr ugs has grown significantly over the past two decades prescription drug spending represented only slightly greater share of personal health expenditures in 2005 as it did in 1960 this trend is illustrated in figure 5 6 longterm care which includes nursing home and home health care composes larger share of health care than in th past in 1960 about 4 of personal health care expenditures were spent on nursing home and home health care in 2005 about 10 of personal health spe nding was directed towards providing nursing home and home health care394447 41 37 2322 22 471011

suggests that the individual accepts lowe r wage in exchange for this benefit thus individuals pay for all insurance premiums either directly or in the form of forgone wagesfinancing health care in 2005 85 of personal health expenditure s were in the form of thirdparty payments private health insurance was the largest payer of personal health care in 2005 it paid 36 of personal health expe nditures the federal government the second largest payer accounted for 34 of all personal health sp ending the health care system underwent shift over the last four decades from one financed primarily by outofpocket expenditures to one financed primarily by private insurance figure 6 shows how the funding of personal health care has changed from 1960 to 2005 ultimately all health car is funded by individuals through outofpocket expenditures including insurance ductibles and copay ments insurance premiums taxes and ch aritable contributions7 source the congressional research service crs

although this category repres ents only small share of all personal health care expenditures private insurance plays relatively small role in financing nursing home and home health care these services were funded mostly by the federal government and outof pocket expenditures dental services and prescription drugs are funded mostly by private insu rance and outofpocket expenditures the federal government plays relatively small role in the financing of these services state and local funds account for small shar of expenditures in all categories the contribution of theses funds is largest in
