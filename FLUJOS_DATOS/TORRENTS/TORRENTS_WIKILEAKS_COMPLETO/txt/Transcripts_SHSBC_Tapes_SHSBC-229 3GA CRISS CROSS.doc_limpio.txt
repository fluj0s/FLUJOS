3ga criss cross lecture given on 23 october 1962 well here we are at what day audience twentythird twentythird of october audience ad 12 ad 12 hoped i hadnt lost year here since the last time i lectured to you well if youre afraid of getting restimulated you can leave now now im going to talk about the 3ga criss cross now i want you to carefully notice i havent any notes and this is not athis is just off the cuff because in the past many many weeks ive been auditing like mad myself on research auditing trying to pick up all of the data necessary to make it easy for you to crack cases you should realize at first glance and atimmediately that 3ga in its original form will find goals and has made firstgoal clears you should recognize that that we are going beyond point of success the problem which reaches us however is that some eases do not respond easily to the original 3ga it goes up into the thousands of goals on these cases and if you had unlimited time you could probably undoubtedlyusing more than these techniques contained in the original 3gafind the pcs goal but in view of the fact that we are few and the preclears are many and because of the peculiar position of the saint hill graduate todayin that he is looked upon to find great many goals and do great deal for great many people in the field of clearingan endless procedure is therefore inadequate to our needs hence you get 3ga dynamie assessment by rock slam that was the first upgrade and improvement of this now this saved time and this swept in the bulk of those cases that were very difficult that is it swept in the bulk of them we were marching up now higher in our percentage that could be done rapidly and the technique 3ga with the goals assessment done by dynamic assessment by rock slam that particular technology and those bulletins is still valid and is still workable and theres lot of people sitting right in front of whose goals were found with that particular technology but this again failed on some cases to attain the goal rapidly once more slowdown came about on some cases having established all of this we found then that the goals on some eases went out hard it was all right we could find the goal and all of that sort of thing but goals went out hard now what do i mean by went out hard i mean as long as nine hours to tiger drill out one goal which wasnt it you see goals were going out hard now you understand as you upgrade procedure that you also sweep in the easy ease and make it easier to do the easy ease you understand that that is not an incidental benefit but was not the primary target in the research which ive been engaged upon dont you see so the easy case always benefits from resolution of the more difficult case youll find this is very consistent in scientology that once you are able to do very very difficult ease then you can do more easily an easy ease so once more we are not confronted with you do 3ga ordinarythe old 3gaon some cases and 3ga dynamic assessment by rock slam on some other eases and then 3ga criss cross on just few difficult cases you would find your goal by the highest most sweeping procedure which at this stage of development is 3ga criss cross and you would find your easy case more rapidly with 3ga criss cross than you would be list 850 goals and ill tiger drill them dont you see but this requires facility and understanding on the part of the auditor and as we march forward into these more difficult cases i have to tell you that i myself at the moment am slightly appalled by the fact that the technology is quite complex at this particular moment and iit was more complex friday last than it was monday it was more complex the wednesday before that friday dont you see and so on but it has now gotten to point where i can give you answers which again speed up the time involved in finding somebodys goal now this is all in the direction of speedup so when you go in the direction of speedup you demand more accurate auditing that contains the element of luck less thats swift auditing now as you understand by its title 3ga criss cross is direct grandchild of 3d criss cross old 3d criss cross was itself and had it been done by rock slam well people probably would have gone on running out items happily and gone to clear on it the only ingredient that old 3d criss cross needed was just those three words by rock slam to make it totally successful procedure now this doesnt mean that all of the rules of 3d criss cross apply to 3ga criss cross so we might as well just start out with brandnew set of rules and scrub those and im show you the old ones and ill just show you and you can recognize where these things fit in those of you who have been trained in 3d criss cross youll find this very much to your benefit now when we were doing 3d criss cross i was giving you constant the students who were here at that timeincidentally there arethere are three students here right this minute who have been beaten over the head on this and it must sound like old times theyve just rejoined the class on retread basis and it just must sound like just old times to them you know like the wheels havent turned at all since theyve been away but if they remember the stress was on speedspeed there are two things speed and accuracy which is involved here and some auditor who takes one week of sessions three hours each to find an item on his pc isnt batting in any league that will give him any success with 3ga criss cross in the first place the pcs attention wears out by that time this is rapid activity lf i find the item and its totally successful its taking one hour and ten minutes to adjudicate what is to be listed list it and null it to successful reliable itemone hour and ten minutes when i goofand its very possible for an auditor to goof on this you take the wrong side of something or something goes wrong one way or the otherwhen i goof its about two hours and half it takes longer to goof than to find right one takes longer to lay an egg than it does to come up with reliable item but two hours and half we are still talking in the framework of threehour session now im not holding one hour and ten minutes up to you as how good i am and how terrible you are its very far from this case because let assure you that my research auditing during the past three or fouror worse than thatduring the past two months have made citizen out of with exclamation points you know im batting right there in your league i found out i can make mistakes man and it has been very annoying to to discover that for once in my life im grappling with something where judgment is not infallible i look at this ease and i say well thats whats to do and i go ahead and do it and im finding that 50 percent of the time i am wrong all right if thats the way its going with well stop beating your brains out trying to be 100 percent right now those of you who have goal to be 100 percent rightthis is this is way to achieve that goal because lot of the time youre going to be wrong now even following all the rules youre going to be wrong every now and theneven following all the rules because the nature of the beast that youre auditing contains several little excursions this way and that and when youre following the rock slam you have to follow the rock slam and if the rule gets in the road of your following the rock slam why then you follow the rock slam you understand the road is the road of the rock slam not the road of the rule i can tell you how to find rock slams how to trace them down and how to preserve them carefully how to nurture them and derive items from them left and right but i am very sure at this stage of the game that i cannot tell you how to do it 100 percent of the time always now on any given pc yes you can find rock slam you can find the items thats forsworn foregone conclusion that part of its licked yes you can find rock slam on pc there are several ways of doing it if you dont do it one way you can do it another way what im talking about is on this one pc that you are auditing if you expect to find an item every hour and ten minutes of auditing youre going to be very badly disappointed because you very often have nervedup pc and when youve missed the item you of course then have missed withhold dont you so then you have to steady down the pc and you have to do lot of other things which are all very interesting and all very complicated and they all consume auditing time and then after youve done it by the best traditions of auditing after you have done it perfectly you find yourself all too oftenbut not more than 50 percent of the time unless your luck is always badsitting there looking at complete skunkno item everything goes out see you do it all perfectly and then everything goes out now i have been auditing very hard and very thoroughly trying to whip the laws which underlie this and the laws which underlie it are quite interesting extremely intelligible and very easily followed and they will reduce i am sure the number of wrong turns that you make in following the rock slamthese various laws but i know very well that they will not obviate them completely because there are too many little lucky breaks and so forth still contained in dynamic assessment by rock slam as it is done with 3ga criss cross now with that preamble and prelude to the situation you should understand this as procedure which guided by good textbook auditing actually the kind which the better auditors here are doing at this moment done with that type of auditing and not with something that the fellow read three books and then he read half of bulletin and then he took his meter in hand and he turned it on by twisting the needle and hes not going to make it see hes not going to make it this is definitely an experts activity but that is not all bad that is very far from all bad goals finding and goals running is so fraught with disaster for pc that it shouldnt be done by anybody but an expert and if that experts expertness becomes as fantastically evident as it does in 3ga criss cross well that just builds up your altitude i mean lets be crude about the thing it puts it out of reach this fellows going to do this 3ga criss cross and hes read book and he went halfway through the academy before he blew and now hes going to find goal on somebody with 3ga criss cross and he sits there and he looks at the meter and for fifteenth of second he sees rock slam and then he doesnt see any more rock slams and he cant find any more rock slams and matter what he does he cant find any more rock slams and the road is blocked because only good auditing presence will keep rock slam on so actually the road is boobytrapped by bad auditing presence now if youll notice lately ive put several booby traps into clearing i fixed it up so that its very unlikely that wrong goal would get listed why well before with all too much glee people could list wrong goal and practically spin somebody in well how did we do this well we say you tiger drill it the beginning of every session of course that is necessary to get the items to blow but at the same time recognize that as prevention against auditing wrong goal after youve done just so many sessions on the thing why the goals going to blow up and then youre going to have to do something to remedy the goal now even when pcs goal has been found in many casesthis is uses of this procedureeven when pcs goal has been found by some other method of assessment it is all too likelyyou know items have been found on this pcthat his bank will be too heavily charged to list easily so with 3ga criss cross you dont have just goalfinding procedure you have procedure which finds goal but also which unburdens the bank so goal can be run also you have procedure which when the pc suddenly sticks on cops you know he said cops and that was the last you ever heard him say tone arm went up and he ducked and he babbled something or other and so on well you continue his item assessment and you will get him back in the running again youall sorts of uses dont you see these variant uses you heard him say cops and cops is somethingor you see him sitting thereit just happened todayis somebody sitting there with horrible arc break and the auditor finally argues him out of an item and then the item is seen to rock slam so the auditor i think opposed and represented itdid both to the thing and it unburdened the case started cogniting and the fellow started running again you see there was an item which he hadnt even presented but the auditor found it and did something with it see that was during listing so when do we use this procedure well we use this procedure when clearing gets tough and when prepchecking wont remedy it and when do we use prepchecking when tiger drilling wont do anything for us see thats when you use the procedure so you can use the procedure to find the goal you can use the procedure to prove goal that has been found you can use the procedure to unburden the bank so as to make it easy to run the goal and you can use this procedure in addition to that to get the pc unstuck from some item hes collided with in listing which he cant or wont confront so you see it has many usesbecomes skilled activity now completely aside from its uses in clearing this quite incidentally adds up to the fastest gain process that we have ever developed now that one sort of is likely to get overlooked you find couple of items on somebodyyou find one item on somebody that is real honesttogoodness rock slamming item and youve changed that caseand youve changed it observably now nobody has been finding items against ocas and iq tests and that sort of thing but im sure that you would see some rather startling changes occur in iq and profile as result of finding an item now look at what this puts in your hands supposing in problems intensive you could get twenty points of gain on an oca or an apa and that took twentyfive hours recognize that the same gain is probably obtainableor greater gain obtainablein the finding of one item in space of less than three hours if youre lucky now look at your ease resurgence look at that in time now in view of the fact that were using this to find goals and actually clear people that little point is liable to be overlooked because were not using it to make pc feel good and yet they do they do now lets tackle this thing from the beginning ive given you its various uses and applications lets tackle it from the beginning on the subject of nomenclature were going to get our nomenclature all mixed up well why do we say criss cross and thats just because you go from one channel to the other channel and then you go back to the other channel what do we mean by channels well we mean what the pcs been and what the pc has opposed by saying criss cross well we get the idea of channel from over to b and from b back over to and were going back and forth between the pc what he has been and the pcs enemies what they have been so weve got game going here of the enemy and the pc now i refer you to the lectures on the gpm it is vital to understand the composition of the gpm as contained in those lectures i am not going to repeat them at this particular time the composition of the gpm then has much greater scope and complexity than what im giving you right now but essentially its composed of them and us that doesnt matter on what dynamics these occur its game of them and us now our nomenclature gives us the them as opposition to the terminal actually not opposition terminals let show you the packaging of this word it was originally opposition to the pcs terminal and then became opposition terminal just because people got tired of saying the other words and then became oppterm and thats the word which you should know it by thats theman oppterm that is what the pc is agin its seldom either grammatical or delicate enough to be against hes agin itbrutally violently and directly it aint him that he knows he may not know much but he knows he aint it thats down deep and reactively but analytically because hes supposed to be reasonable being in reasonable world he very often collides with it and finds himself playing footsies with being it and this is sickening experience to him the whole way now in view of the fact that he begins bywhen youwhenin life after occlusions of the gpm have set in and he cant remember who he was and he thinks hes only lived one life and he thinks hes oh i dont knowhe thinks hes baptist and ahe thinks hes this and that and hes some nationalist he thinks hes essentially an earthman oh wow you know this guys occluded anyhow there he is and he walks around in life and he gets this feeling you knowhes got enemies you know he knows this and he has various ways of handling this one is to be them another way is to be interesting to them another way is to make everything peaceful so they wont jump him and the reason he has to have all of these rationales of which they are just infinite numbers is because he cant identify what the enemy is he merely knows that something in the environment is hostile he cant say what it is well im give you an example the fellow thinks that all publishers are against himall publishers that means newspaper publishers book publisherseverything and you know theyre all against him and thats for sure and hes got an uneasy feeling so he goes through life solving problems as to how to get along with publishing companies publishers you see he tries to be writer he does this he does that and hethishe worries about it all the time and one day you give him 3ga criss cross and the item turns up school copybook thats all hes against school copybooks see theyre deadly enemy and immediately the identification between school copybooks and all books and all publications and all publishers ceases to exist so he knows now when youve found this item that hes against school copybooks thats what hes agin he feels much more comfortable even though they still knock his head off you understand he longer identifies in this particular subject so the world looks like friendlier place to him well so you get you get whole unknown existence eight dynamics worth piled on this one thetans head until you start separating it out because at the same time he didnt know what he was being that had to oppose or was threatened by school copybooks and then he finally finds out what he is being hes being student see its not his military career that is giving him pains and aches you see its not his life as writer that is giving him pains and aches you see its not his life as this and latas that and the sphere of influence here and there and all that sort of thing its just the fact that as student he is agin copybooks now 3ga criss cross would make it possible to sort out the oppterm copybook and the terminal student so youve got these two things these are terms terminal that means the pcs experiential track what he has been his beingnesses and the oppterm what his beingnesses have opposed or the oppositions that have made him assume his beingnesses so weve got these two things weve got the them and us reduced to oppterm and terminal now these are distinctly different things and life is madeis usually very simple on this the auditor sails along and everything is fine and so forth and hes been finding terminals and hes been finding oppterms and everything is going according to hoyle and he knows which they are even when the pc is confused about it because the terminal invariably turns on pain and the oppterm invariably turns on sensation sensation being motion pressure misemotion and pain simply being the sharp impulse or dull impulse of heat cold and electrical heat is pn cold is pn and bzzzt is pn thats all pain but the pc is getting dizzy and hes getting sensations and he is crying and feels griefy about it all and anything on the emotional scale or theres effort pushing his chest in and hes got pressure against his eyeballs and so forththats all sensationcommonly called sen sen all right those are very easily identifiable oppterm equals sen term equals pn and thats all there is to it there are just those two things and thats the way they are and you got it all sorted out you got it all straight and the last three pcs you audited you didnt have any trouble with and when you get to the fourth pc while he has sen he talks about us and while he has pn he talks about them and he doesnt know which is him and which is them and everything you find has some pn and some sen on it this should happen to you see as the auditor youll find his rock slam on consider committing overts against copybooks slaaaaam you know ouch he says everything is fine hes had pain himself while facing the copybook but then of course because youre dealing only with the copybook you turn on sen so you say copybook copybook copybook to him and he goes zzzzzzhe gets dizzy and so forth you see you say to him what would commit overts on copybook and he gets ouch see youre all sorted out youre all straight as the auditor you know which side it is and oddly enough you will never really make mistake on it because you can sooner or later sort it out as to which it is but your fourthevery fourth pc or something like that is not going to be able to get this through his own thick skull which is him and which is them see doubt remains in his mind because theres pain and theres sensation on copybook and theres pain and theres sensation on student and one day he starts talking about us copybooks and those dirty students marking all up now if youve got the nomenclature and the rules straight why youre all set because you yourself wont get mixed up on it the auditor is actually never mixed up on it because he can make some simple tests the pc is busy talking about us copybooks and all you have to do is say to him well what would commit overts on copybook and he says ouch well you know copybookyou know at once that copybook is an oppterm because committing overts against it can give him an ouch if he lists it see so the lists of thingscommitting overts against copybooks gives him pain but listing copybooks and what they represent gives him sen and he goes bzzz bzzz sensation get the idea and you say to him forcefully copybooks copybooks copybooks and he says stop that youre making dizzy you see how this is sorted out you say to him student student student and he says ouch stop that youre giving an awful pain in my head see at once youre advised well dont blame him if out of his confusion in the gpm and so forth he cant make it out he doesnt know whether hes copybook or student and he gets all mixed up about it why does he get so mixed up because when he says copybook hes liable to get pain i remember that lecture i was telling you about ithes in the wrongterminal situation and when he says student and so forth hes liable to get sensation why because he has to be outside of the beingness of student to gaze at student in his bank which of course puts him into the copybook you understand so the pc trying to sort this out for himself gets all mixed up because sometimes he doesnt exteriorize from student while saying student and gets pain and sometimes he exteriorizes from student you see when hes saying student and gets sen and sometimes when he is saying student he backs into copybook dont you see and then when he says copybook he backs into student and gets pain you see and he just gets terribly confused about all of this so realize that the pc can get confused about what all these things are quite often hes usually straight about it but dont expect him to be very reliable as to which is which youre the person who knows as the auditor the auditor knows the auditor can make simple test he canhes got two or three items there and he wants to know which side these items are onhe just says them to the pc and one will produce pain and one will produce sen and then he knows which side of the fence hes on because of course hes an exterior source of command so he tends to push the student pc back into the valence that he is calling so the student pc experiences that valence well this is not something that has to be overstressed too hard but becomes very important to the auditor when he starts to list goalsthis becomes extremely important to the auditor because if youre trying to list goals against an oppterm you use the lists 1 to 10 that were contained in the original dynamic assessment by rock slam bulletins see if you were an oppterm what goal would be impossible to achieve you know that kind of thing thats listing goals against an oppterm listing goals against terminal is quite different the basic rule there is this what would be the goals of student you see terminal student you say what would be the goals of student give twenty thirty forty fifty goals of student pcs goal is likely to be in that list if you carried this far enough so you see you ask different ways to get goal but you could use either terminal or an oppterm to get goals list from you see that so you have to know which it is and you dont take the pcs sayso because hes liable to say us copybooks you follow that youve got to make test well the test is the pain or sensation you say what it is or you write list representing it and the pc gets pain you know youre handling terminal and you write what it is and write list concepbreaking it down representing it and the pc gets sen you know youve got list of oppterms and that that item being part of that list of course is an oppterm you understand that pcs will throw you curve every once in while by turning on fifty fifty of each on everything thats the original mixedup kid from suppressville see so theres yourthose are the trials of an auditor you say copybook and the left side of his body gets under tremendous pressure while the righthand side gets burning hot and you say student and they reverse which side of it is him well oddly enough you could say well you find more items it will eventually work itself out well that proved here not to be the ease about two or three days agoproved not to be the ease at all we had terminal rocket reading and pc didnt know whether it was pain or sensation he had both we had something rocket reading some item was rocket reading and so we had to list goals so we just did both we treated it as terminal and we treated it as an oppterm and went over the whole thing and of course it worked out in the final analysis because only the goal stayed in got the idea in other words we treated it as both what goals would it have we used it in list of twenty goals all by itselfas the wordand then we did list 1 i think and list 6 i dont even know if they got that far but we were prepared to do it both as an oppterm and terminal and sort the goals out of the total list remaining because of course youre only dealing withwell youre dealing with less than hundred goals you see that in other words youve goteven if you became totally unstuck and didnt know whether it was terminal or an oppterm you still have remedy which is just treat it as one and then treat it as the other youre not dealing with vast quantities of material now more terminology rocket read rocket read doesnt have any definite size because of course were dealing right now with two different marks of emeters the mark iv and the mark v and you havent seen mark v yet but i think theyll be here in couple of days youve seen them on your tv demonstrations so forth and of course it gives liver longer read it gives the same kind of read as the mark iv but it is livelier longer looking read but it looks otherwise exactly the same you could say this its longer on mark v than on mark iv to tell you how long rocket read is would be adventurous because rocket reads have been half dial and ive never seen rocket read that was valid an eighth of an inch you see some goal will dwindle down to about an eighth of an inch and it will kind of look it but you cant tell if its rocket read or not so ill give you the two limits the biggest one ive ever seen was half dial and the smallest i have ever seen was greater than an eighth of an inch now whats rocket read if you take three coins big coin and two small coinsand put them on roughedup surface in row small coin 1 big coin 2 small coin 3all in rowtheir rims are all touchingand you take small coin 1 and rap big coin 2 sharp rap you will see coin 3 do rocket read in musical note it would be fast decay called rocket read because it takes off like rocket and slows down it goes off the pad with burst probably more like catapult it goes pssswww and other read looks like it there isnt any other read like rocket read i predicted that this thing would exist we were fooling around with oscilloscopes it was quite remarkable because tiger drilling had not then been released and we had only seen goals up to that time tick and fall you see but when any goal was tiger drilled out why sure enough this predict i said goal being the basis of bank would probably read differently electronically than any other read i couldnt see how it could do otherwise and we dreamed this up and saw it on an oscilloscope and it looks very funny on an oscilloscope it apparently goes way up and way up above the center line and then way down above the center line and then back to the center line again it makes very peculiar pattern sort of shortlegged z stood on end and this very peculiar thing was seen first on an oscilloscope now on meterit turned up on meter and as soon as any goal was welldrilled well tiger drilled and very smooth and so forth it would consistently and continuously rocket read youd say it and itd give an instant rocket read it looks quite different its an amazing phenomenon that it would read that way now it isnt fall and the only time you can make mistake with it is on the first leg of rock slam now once in blue moon an unfinished rock slam will be at just at that triggered position that when you say something the first part of the rock slam will fire now that really isnt rocket read because it doesnt go off with spurt and do fast decay but it does such an energetic flash that you can be taken by surprise by the thing thats the first leg of rock slam the next time you say it it probably does it in reverse now rock slam very often looks like reverse rocket read when it first starts out but once more that isnt really rocket read because it doesnt give you the very rapid beginning and the very slow end i know i every once in while have been startledor was before i got used to itwas startled occasionally id see rock slam start and think i was looking at rocket read you see and then say the item again and then see the rock slam finish itself and say ah bemeter now rocket read you think well thats justjust some more slanguage to learn and so forth well it isnt covered in emeter essentials because it was discovered after emeter essentials was written and it is itself it is itself definitely now rock slam thats very interesting because the word dirty needle here gives you curve we have unfortunately developed in our midst homonymic word love that dont you homonymic one explanatory double word phrase that means two things and thats why you may have trouble with this thing called dirty needle youll find auditors trying to get over the heading of this saying well it was an instant dirty needle well in actual fact this is what dirty needle really is although i dont expect to stamp out its use with just few words here because ive already defined it and had everybody fall from grace and i hear them using it and using it and im afraid its gone too deep into the language now the original dirty needle was buzz bzzz bzz bzz bzzz bzzz bzzz that was happening with the needle sufficiently consistently that you couldnt pick that was happening read out of the middle of this guys needle in other words it was bad small sudden continuous needle pattern that made it impossible to read the meter and that was dirty needle if i remember rightly it had another name at that time but ive forgotten what it was it perished nobody used it very much audience member scratchy needle hmm audience member scratchy needle oh yeah scratchy needle was being used at that time well for some reason or otherfor some reason or other scratchy needle didnt survive but dirty needle did and that really means consistent pattern of little tiny bzzz and bzzzz and bzz and bzzzand up and down up and down the needle face you know up and down the face of the dial and just about the time youryou well its laid off for minute you see its not doing that now and youre going to say 76 catch cabzz bzzz bzzzz bzz you say all right now have i missed with watch it carefully watch it carefully yeah well i see what its pattern is and now if i say anything that is meaningful you say to yourself itll disturb the pattern i see in front of all right have i missed with oh well thats doing something else now have i missed withhold on you oh id say it read i dont know well that is the bane of 3ga all through the line has been the dirty needle because the confounded thing gives us everything but read now it is actually tiny rock slam and it is caused byjust as rock slam isby ow only we call it invalidatefailed to reveal you see these little bzzzs and bzzs and bzzzzs and bzzzzs on the fellows meter hes invalidated something or he has failed to reveal somethingone or the other but the odd part of it is he very often has invalidated something he has failed to reveal it and hes now protesting your asking him about it so very often protest is the better entering button than either fail to reveal or invalidate even though it is now an auditor with lots of experience can take look at this thing knowing the pcs operating on it of course and he can say oh this guy has just picked up missed withhold see ive just missed withhold on this pc because now here goes athis needle was clean and everything was fine and now its dirty needle well thats its usual use now he can say well have i missed withhold on you or something like that and the pc gives it to him after some argument and after that the needles clean or its an accumulation of these things but youll find out its more oftenwhen you cant clean it up at onceits more often just protest just common old gardenvariety protest it also by the wayif you missed and failed to complete list and youve left list all unfinished and you went on and you missed the item and so forth after that you get bzzz bzz bzzz bzzz bzz also wonderfully enough you can sweat your head off trying to turn off one of these things on pc all during prepcheck it was always like this you could never get the rudiments straight on this pc its always like this and you know its sort of like out inout amongst homo sapiens its halitosis that loses you friends see and in scientology its having dirty needle you know after while nobody will audit you you know hes got dirty needle to hell with him and oddly enough on two occasions on chronically dirty needles i have seen them turn off with the first item found by dynamic assessment by rock slam and they just vanished and i see them only now when the pc really does have withhold of magnitude or something like that thats interesting isnt it in other words 3ga criss cross will blow up this dirty needle phenomena and you can expect the pc who has dirty needle and is giving you hard time to keep on having it until you find the first reliable item all right lets continue here with this rock slam now when you get an instant dirty needlethat means your instant read is bzzt see its bzzzz now how big is that bzzz and people are always coming up to and expecting to translate thought into mensuration english type and i will confess to you that every once in while i get tired of being badgered and i will toss something off like half an inch or quarter of an inch you know but the truth of the matter is it varies by the meter and it varies by the meter setting now mark v meter at 128 sensitivitya dirty needle looks like the first cousin to real rock slam because its pretty broad and now you take it down to sensitivity 16 and its this little eighthofaninch bzzz see that youre used to on mark iv but its tiny needle disturbance of great rapidity actually what it is is small rock slam auditors are always saying to hopefully well i found lot of little dirty needles on the list and cant i take those arent they really rock slam you know please ron please ron say ive found an item well i cant tell you youve found an item if you havent the answer is you see well how big is the smallest dirty needle well how long is short piece of string this is one of those things this is something that comes by experience and frankly i have never taken ruler and sat there over an emeter trying to measure the width of one but i will tell you this i have never seen one narrower than about an inch or an inch and quarter by my guesssee ive never seen one smaller than thatthat meant anything to pc pc didnt cognite if your rock slams were smaller than that and did cognite if they were bigger than that but what meter is this oh i dont know pick meter actually its not reducible to that degree dont you see rock slam then becomes dirty needle when it ceases to carry with it cognition on found item but it is matter of size id say if i finally assessed everything out to an eighthofaninch rock slam i think i would just tear the listi wouldeven after i tiger drilled it and did everything i could do with it and id polished it all up and i worked like mad and working my brain to the bone trying to make this thing rock slam and it wouldnt do any more than an eighthofaninch i think i wouldnt have spent that much time on it i think i would take the list and youwhat you do is take the list and you fold it over once you see and you tear it across the middle and then you put the two pieces together again and you tear them again leave it in the guys record to show that it didnt go anyplace is the proper professional thing to do but my impulses are more savage than this sometimes i seldom throw them in the pcs face now i mean ive gotten myself under good control that way dump emeter tables on the pc sometimes but not often but its got to be accompanied by the cognition see but rock slam is rock slam and i would say that the graduating point on mark iv is probably sensitivity 16 maybe plus or minus half an inch or something like that as the smallest possible rock slam but ive never seen one that small that meant anything its always been up there around an inch and quarter now rock slam is nervous agitated flingingtoandfro of the needle and now i have been compounded with the felony of slow rock slam well you could say stage four needle is very slow rock slam but slow rock slamwell there are rock slams inside of rock slams that ive seen ive seen needle slamming while it was slamming thats very interesting because as it sweeps up the dial it does three or four bzz slams of incredible speed and frequency as its traveling an inch and half very rapidly that thing really looks savage it looks like thetan on electric chair that he doesnt know whether to lean back or sit down you can just see this guy bouncing out of his head and all over the universe this thing is very frantic action to say that some rock slams are slower than others is true but that brings us up how slow is slow rock slam i dont know thats something youll have to answer by experience but rock slam of the speed of grandfather clock ticking from left to right would in my opinion be suspect thats tooslow there cant be such thing as toofast rock slam however because it just simply develops rock slams inside of rock slams and it looks more and more frantic but it is frantic needle and sometimes thetans are more slowly frantic than other times and once more the index is is it accompanied by cognition now those basically are your fundamental terms that youre using and doing business with with 3ga criss cross there really are fancier terms of one kind or another than those things because all other terms are very very explanatory such as oppose is simply you oppose it and represent is you simply represent it and so forth and to go into that and call that lot of terminology is practically waste of time so as all intents and purposes ive given you the lexicon of 3ga criss cross and its various terms except one item now youve got detested person in 3gaby dynamic assessment by rock slam you have detested person you have dynamic and you have item and thats fine and that belonged to that procedure and im very happy to have it belong to that procedure because in 3ga criss cross theyre all items if you wrote it on the list it was an item and if you found it it was an item its still an item and when its obviously provable item capable of delivering up further items you call it reliable item see you dont have to worry about detested persons and dynamics and items and all that sort of thing you just call them items just call anything an item also in listing goals out the pc is giving you items dont you see so its just all items what do we mean by an item we mean its terminal whether species or ally of oppterms or species or ally of terminals see theyre all items and we needntweve got to have word that embraces both so reliable item then is an item which the pc got after the list was nulled and thatsits reliable and can be used to obtain further items well that is reliable item its also called and you will call it i am sure the pcs item even when it is an oppterm go ahead and call it what you please but just recognize that there is sloppy use of this word item and theres reason for too many terms on top of item youve passed into 3ga criss cross call them all items people know what youre talking about you say i found an item obviously you have proven an item out on pc you see youd also say i wrote four hundred items on one list see it sort of differentiates itself there is other terms to be defined in this except auditor and an auditor in 3ga criss cross is somebody who can find reliable items on the pc of course thats joke but i make my point it really takes an auditor to run this one well i will cover in the next lecture now the more amusing vagaries and departures from grace that we can have as we follow the rock slam thank you
