never forget that military leader has ever become great without audacity clausewitz principles of war 1812 planning considerations 41 strategic level international environment there exists strong international public opinion against war between nuclear weapon states on acco unt of the attendant risk of triggering nuclear w eapons exchange hence any intended military action requires careful calibration of international support proactive and aggressive diplomacy plays pivotal ro in preparing suitable political environment prio r to launching operations aspects such as economy trade and commerce also come into play in such circumstances synergy between dipl omacy and military action military conflict is usually the outcome of diplomatic failure to ensure peaceful resolution of disputes while coercive diplomacy may necessitate deployment of military forces as prelude to offensive action largescale mobilisation of forces would normally follow firm decision at the highest level to adopt the military option with minimum loss of time conflict termination conflict termination requirements and viable exit policy should be incorporated at the nati onal and appropriate military levels as part of overall campaign plans 42 operational level relation to military strategic objectives operational level activity mu st directly contribute to achieving defined military strategic objectives 3 freedom of action the operational level commander will dictate the nat ure of major operations battles and engagements freedom of action to deploy reserves assigning priorities and allocation of combat and logistic elements is therefore of critical importance this freedom of action will however be within the confines of politic and military constraints while recognising these c onstraints the commander will convey clear statement of his intent which outlines his concept and establishes the objectives to be achieved by subordinate commanders within his theatre of operations resources the resources made available to commander to accomplish his operational objectives may be tangible such as formations and units combat and services support assets or intangibles such as delegated authority to achiev the given objectives these give him freedom of action to exercise various options resources must be held at the level which ensures their most effectiv employment operational commanders must also utilise all civil infrastructure and resources available in their respective theatres to enhance their com bat potential civil affairs the operational level commander will have certain explicit or implicit responsibilities for civil affairs within his theat re of operations movement of refugees and minimizing damage to civil infrastructure will have to be considered in addition to his legal and moral obligatio ns to minimize civilian casualties once operations have ended initially the military may be the only organ available to exercise authority in the area and therefore responsibilities relating to civil affairs will assume greater importance all formations entrusted with offensive operations in enemy territory will have an integral civil affairs element to handle tasks relating to control of the civilian population management of resources and ensuring stability in captured territory however aspects pertaining to the transition to civil control must be built 4 into operational plans and be put into effect at the very earliest this will ensure that fighting units are relieved at the earliest to carry out their primary roles 43 tactical level employment of firepower and mobility commanders at the tactical level should ensure optimum employment of all the resources available to them and employ them effectively to fight decisive battles earmarking objectives all objectives at tactical level should lie well within the culmination point of the forces earmarked to achieve such objectives they should be in concert with and part of the commanders overall operational design success should be achieved with overwhelming asymmetry and the use of firepower and force multipliers and with least cost to life and material methodology of conduct 44 strategic level aim the military aim of war must be derived from the national aim and be clearly defined apart from being decisive and attainabl each operation and battle must contribute to ttainment of the overall military aim terrain considerations since the indian army has to operate along vast borders of greatly varying terrain it is important that pl anning for war training and development of infrastructure is based on such terrain terrain is not neutral since it either helps or hinders the mobility of force the advantages and limitations of terrain should be identified and exploited for furthering own operations terrain appreciation is thus vital component in formulating plans military leaders must develop the ability to use terra in skilfully and should be able to visualise own and enemy forces on given piece of terrain for maximizing own potential and 5 degrading that of the enemy im plications of terrain on different operations of war are available in various general staff publications warning period while it would be difficult to lay down any fixed warnin g period preceding war there will always be indica tors and periods in which anticipatory action can be taken all planning should aim to mobilise forces in the minimum possible time in order to take advantage of t he many benefits that such step offers maximising force potential ideally this implies placing all available resour ces under one commander at each level however due to paucity these may have to be placed under commander only for particular phases of an operation or fo r specified duration nevertheless jointness is prerequisite at the operational and theatre levels balanced force force must be so composed and structured that its full combat power can be brought to bear in the most effective manner to achieve assigned objectives in the stipulated time favourable air situation favourable air situation over the tactical battle area as well as the operational level battle area prior to launch of own operations is decided advantage strategic constraints however may dictate the need for achieving objectives in shor t timeframe wherein both land and air campaigns may have to be fought concurrently as consequence favourable air situation may not always be available 45 operational level force projection this includes mobilisation movement and deployment mobilisation encompasses marshalling of manpower equipment stores and training as also activa ting part or all reserve components as required this involves preparation of welldesigned mobilisation schemes which should be 6 frequently practiced and rehearsed anticipation of mobilisation helps the army to be physically and mentally prepared flexible logistic support is prerequisite for force projection and should be catered for accordingly shaping the battlefield the purpose of shaping the battlefield is to create c onditions which will facilitate the success of own operations keeping the ultimate aim in view in the human di mension psychological operations serve to unbal ance the enemy create discord and weaken his will to fight decisive operations military operations which force the enemy to submit to ones will are decisive operations these are most effective when the application of combat power and force multipliers is wellorchestrated and fully integrated throughout the battlespace enemy vulner abilities should be targeted to achieve clearcut vict ory such operations will invariably be joint operations protection this relates to the ability to conserve troops information and equipment so that these can be utilised at the decisive time and place it has relevance in both defensive and offensive operations sustainment this is continuous process which starts with mobilisation and continues till the end of hostilities towards this end there is need for operational plans to be core lated to the available logistic support infrastructure intelligence sound and timely intelligence is critical for successful prosecution of war aims it includes the entire gamut of obtaining information from various sources converting it to intelligence by passing it through stages of synthesis and analysis and the timely dissemination of proc essed intelligence to the user 7 offensive operations 46 offensive operations are decisive form of winning war their purpose is to atta in the desired end state and achieve decisive victory offensive operations seek to seize the initiative from the enemy re tain it and exploit the dividends accruing from such actions these operations end when the force either achieves the desired end state or reaches its culmination point 47 planning an offensive enemy information every possible means of acquiring intelligence and conducting surveillance must be employed to get accurate and timely information about the enemy of particular relevance will be his strategic thought process intention grouping of formations deployment and location of reserves joint planning operation launched in isolation can be expected to succeed in future offensive scenarios planning and c oordination for operations should be undertaken jointly by all three services and each should complement the strengths and offset the vulnerabilities of the other while formulating joint plan surprise and deception with the availability of modern day hightechnology surveillance means achieving complete surp rise will be difficult accordingly more than the ement of surprise it is deception at the strategic an d operational levels which need to be given greater import ance as this could more easily contribute to success simplicity of plans even at the highest level plans for offensive operations must be simple common sense approach with minimum complexities will help in making the plan workable and thereby ensure better coordination and flexibility this is especially relevant while planning joint operations nuclear factor future operations will be conducted against nuclear backdrop all planning should take this important factor into account 8 terrorism and insurgency similar to the nuclear backdrop war in jammu kashmir may have to be fought against the bac kdrop of terrorism and hence appropriate measures fo r rear area security will have to be inbuilt into operational plans 48 preparation for offensive operations mobilisation offensive forces should mobilise within the shortest possible time in keeping with the prevailing oper ational environment force posturing posturing by offensive forces should be planned at the highest level to aid deception and preem pt the enemy reliable and foolproof communications reliable and secure communications with inbuilt redundancy provides flexibility in employment of forces and assists the commander in influencing the outcome of battle combined arms battle concept the capabilities of all availabl forces must be understood and the cumulative strength of every arm and service must be exploited fully to achieve optimum results similarly their weaknesses mu st also be known so that they can be mitigated thr ough appropriate employment or deployment this will obvi ate the possibility of the enemy taking advantage of weakness if any directive style of command offensive operations throw up unexpec ted scenarios and fleeting opportunities which should be exploited to advantage directive style of command gives best results in offensive operations 49 conduct of offensive operations shaping the battlefield adequate time and resources must be set apart for shaping the battlefield before any offensive is launched the results achieved will be dependent entirely upon the ingenuity with which firepower is delivered th is includes counter air operations and battlefield ai r interdiction artillery 9 engagements and strikes by surfacetosurface missiles offensive iw including psychological operations must be exploit ed optimally to demoralise and degrade the adversary creation of superiority at points of decision absolute superiority across the board will be hard to achieve forces should therefore be deployed for the offensive in such manner that they create force superiority at wellselected points of decision overwhelming combat superiority or advantageous asymmetry reduces the time required for achieving success indirect approach the essence of operational art lies in planning an indi rect approach to the objective concepts such as the turning move envelopment and infiltration provide dividends out of proportion to the force employ ed when seen in contrast to direct frontal or head on operations tempo of operations an offensive should generate such tempo that it should unbalance and paralyse the adversary the design of operations should ensure that lead ing elements reach their objectives before the enemy re serves can be brought to effectively bear on them employment of forces pivot or holding corps should be prepared to undertake offensive operations accordingly only the minimum essential forces should be committed to holding vita l areas and the remainder should be grouped positioned and tasked to conduct offensive operations to im prove the defensive posture and create windows of opport unity for development of further operations few sa lient aspects are outlined below strike corps strike corps should be capable of being inserted into operational level battle either as battle gr oups or as whole to capture or threaten st rategic and operational objectives with view to cause destruction of the 10 enemys reserves and capture sizeable portions of territory contingency planning formations should be prepared to switch from one theatre to another in the shortest possible time equipment commonality and preplanned tailormade logistic support should be ensured to facilitate such switching employment of heliborne airborne and amphibious forces these will primarily be employed to augment the ffensive capability of conventional ground forces they could also be employed for security of island territories offshore resources and maritime trade routes defensive operations 410 destruction of the enemy s armed forces and breaking his will to fight is the basic aim of war this can be achieved by major offensive operations defensive operations are nonetheless necessary to ensure the security of own forces provide the base for strike forces and to create favourable situation for offensive operations to be undertaken defensive operations must therefore be bas ically aggressive in design and offensive in conduct 411 planning for defence importance of intelligence acquisition of intelligence about the enemy is as important for defensive operations as it is for offensive operations offensive defence defensive plans at every level must be offensive in nature this implies that the enemy should be engaged effectively from the earliest available opportunity with every possible means in planned manner it also implies taking offensive action at every level as part of coordinated plan to wrest the initiative from the enem at every stage during war preemptive strike on hi s likely launch pads would completely upset the enemys strategic design cause imbalance in the disposition of his forces and wrest the initiative from him right from the beginning of 11 operations pragmatic appreciation for defence defensive plans must be made after very detailed and deliberate appreciation of the enemys capabilities intentions and interests st arting from the strategic and operational levels nd culminating in t he identification of threat at the tactical leve l the emphasis at operational and tactical levels should be on effective surveillance gauging of enemy intentions and retaining strong reserves rather than holding every inch of ground 412 conduct of defensive operations accurate reading of battle accurate and continuous reading of battle by commanders at every level is vital ingredient for fighting successful defensive battle availability of real time information at all levels is essential for this purpose improvement of defensive posture every formation must have wellcoordinated plans for improvement of it s defensive posture depending on terrain conditions these could range from expansion of its forward zone to capture of likely launch pads and dominating heights objectives for these offensive actions should be selected in manner that ensures that these operations do not jeopardise and unbalance the subsequent defensive plans of the formation heavy attrition once the enemy offensive has been discerned all availabl firepower including air armour artillery and other weapon systems must be employed in coordinated manner to cause heavy attrition and seriously degrade the enemy offensive employment of reserves the key to conduct of successful defensive battle is timely and skilful

stock if the stock gives away hit with our fists if your fists are hurt bite with your teeth special forces 413 characteristics the special forces are specially selected troops who are trai ned equipped and organised to operate in hostile territory is olated from the main combat forces they may operate independently or in conjunction with other forces at the operational vel they are versatile have deep reach and can make precision st rikes at targets of critical importance they are particularl valuable in the early stages of campaign when they can create conditions for decisive operations 414 concept of employment allocation of tasks to special forces should be handled at the appropriate level special forces will have access to the maximum possible intelligence inputs relevant to the task and absolute security will be maintained at all time s relating to their intended employment the principle of direct control and mission command should be exercised special forces units will be tasked to develop area specia lisation in their intended operational theatres to achiev optimum effect 415 missions missions that could be assigned to the special forces are given below

munitions low intensity conflicts seek and destroy missions including transborder operations 13 during peace hostage rescue antiterrorist operations and assistance to friendly foreign governments 416 planning special operations keeping in mind the capabilities and farreaching consequences of special forces operations it is imperative that planning is conducted meticulously in order to ensur success various aspects of planning include the following purpose commanders should specify the desired effect rather than courses of action selection of targets while the objectives are decided at the strategic level commanders in the theatre of operations will evol ve additional objectives for specific operational plans simultaneous assessment will be carried out by the air force and naval elements in case they too are involved intelligence intelligence agencies will be required to provide feasibility assessments prior to final acceptance of the task success will result from the precision with which spec ial forces are employed against correctly identified enemy weaknesses joint planning plans must be evolved jointly in conjunction with the air force and navy where employment of their re sources is involved surprise in any operation the force ratio would invariably be against the special forces accordingly achieving surprise will be essential for success flexibility special forces operations are characterised by great flexibil ity this is fostered and enhanced by improvisation selfcontainment and detailed contingency planning 417 equipping because of the nature and gravity of their tasks with inherent risks special forces need to be equipped with the very best of equipment and armament the process of identifying needs and the pace of acquiring equipment for the special forces should accordingl be different from the rest 14 of the army in order to ensur that they are always suitably equipped conduct of operations 418 security of plans appropr iate navigation aids and the support of air defence elements for aircrafts utilised to insert special forces into enemy territory should be ensured battlefield air strike and electr onic support measures during landing will also form an impo rtant part of the conduct of operations 419 insertion extraction and recovery special forces will be trained for insertion by air land sea and inland waterways and detailed plans for extraction and recovery after accomplishment of missions are vital special forces will be prepared and trained for exfiltra tion and extraction from the area of operations employing various means section 13 joint operations john s mosby war reminiscences 1887 it is just as legitimate to fight an enemy in the rear as in the front the only difference is in the danger 15 section joint operations jomini precis l art guerre 1838 it is not so much the mode of formation as the proper combined use of the different arms which will insure victory 420 the nature of future warfare requires harmonious and synergetic application of land sea and air forces joint operations are the most essential requirement of future wars and have to focus on the seamle ss application of all available resources to shock dislocate and overwhelm the enemy this necessitates an intimate underst anding of the capabilities and limitations of each servic by the other two 421 optimal impact is achieved by evolving joint operational plan which effectivel integrates all designated resources joint operations enc ompass all actions required to successfully achieve designated joint objective and involves activities relating to marshal ling deploying and employing the allotted forces it also includes the intelligence communication and logistic functions in support of such operations principles of joint operations 422 objectives joint operations will be planned and directed towards clearly defi ned attainable and decisive objectives so that the combat potential of all components is exploited to obtain optimal effect 423 centralised planning and decentralised execution it is important to retain the fr eedom of action of own forces towards this end while plan ning and coordination must be centralised there should be adequate decentralisation of command and decisionmaking to the lowest practical level 424 unity of effort planning for joint operations integrates the combat power of the three services and their activities in time space and pur pose joint operations produce maximum application of the ov erall combat power at the decisive point towards attain ment of common objectives 16 425 speed modern weapons equipment and communications continue to acce lerate the pace of warfare the joint planning and execution process must facilitate rapid decision making and action 426 joint focus jointness in training intelligence planning execution and logistics foster interoperability and commonality of purpose in oper ations interoperability of equipment particularly that of communications needs special emphasis planning for joint operations 427 planning for joint operations commences at the level of the cosc and involves alloca tion of objectives and missions to designated successive leve ls of command of the armed forces 428 joint planning process the cosc will nominate the service headquarters responsible for the overall conduct of joint operations and issue dire ctive defining the objectives terms of reference and allocati on of resources an overall force commander will also be nominated by the cosc thereafter planning at vari ous levels will be conducted as under theatre level joint operations centre at the designated command headquarters will analyse the directive and will refer back unresolved issues if any to the cosc for final decision thereafter plans for surprise deception and iw will be evolved and commanders in the theatre will issue their operational directives to subor dinate formations operational level the directions of the overall force commander will be analysed to decide on tactical objectives lines of operati ons and decisive points joint staff at each successive level will facilitate optimisation and synergisation of joint resources 17 landair operations 429 recent conflicts have dem onstrated that spectacular successes can be achieved by we llcoordinated and integrated joint operations though the ext ent of involvement of each service would depend on the ssions assigned to it and the prevailing circumstances t he inherent speed and reach of combat air power allows r apid engagement of enemy ground targets within and outside the tact ical battle area in conjunction with ground operations air operations in support of land forces will be planned jointly to obtain synergistic effect in the specified theatre or area of oper ations however all such air operations should contribute to wards achievement of the overall military goal 430 land operations these will be undertaken with the aim of capturing designated ob jectives and destruction of enemy forces availability of inte lligence deception attainment of surprise speed of operations and concentration of combat power at the points of decision will be critical for success of land operations 431 air operations during joint operations air power is employed for conduct of air perations in support of land forces operations the objective of air operations will be to degrade the enemys air power and reduce its capability to interfere with the operations of own land forces deny enemy land forces the ability to move unhindered create an imbalance in his force disposition and destroy or severely damage his surface communications and logistic means air operations will be the most effe ctive means of disrupting the move of reserves and substantially reducing their potential before they arrive at their point of application air operations include tactical reconnaissance counter air operations battlefield air

land forces to bring about synergised effect on the battlefield airborne operations 433 characteristics airborne operations are conducted in hostile territory for executing an assault landing from the air these may be conducted at the st rategic or operational levels either independently or in c onjunction with other operations with its inherent air mobility an airborne force is an important means to achieve simultaneity of force application and gaining foothold across obstacle systems in circumstances in which other forces would require considerably much more time to be effective airborne operations can be launched at any stage of battle 434 missions due to their inherent flexibility airborne forces are capable of being em ployed on various missions whether these are strategic or operational operational missions are generally in furtherance of land forces plans and involve close cooperation with them though launched independently into the depth areas of the enemy quick link up by ground forces is essentia l for the success of an airborne operation 19 435 planning airborne operations the sequence of planning of an airborne operation is illustrated below airborne force chiefs

essential for safeguarding national interests and creating deterrence so as to ensure peace and stability in the indian ocean 438 tasks and employment scenarios our amphibious forces have the capability to pr oject sustainable presence in coastal and offshore areas amphibious tasks are essentially categorised as assault demons tration raid and withdrawal operations these tasks could be undertaken in various scenarios including conventional war defence of island territories assistance to friendly littoral states in the region peacekeeping under the united nations char ter and any other special operations necessitating employment of an amphibious force 439 command and control on the basis of the overall situation content and objective of the operations the cosc will designate the theatre commander concerned who will be responsible for the overall camp aign he will function with an integrated staff from all component services the three services will nominate their respective component force commanders ie the commander amphibious task force catf land force commander lfc and air force commander afc though the catf will be the coordinator among the three services duri ng the planning phase the catf lfc and afc will function with individual and independent access to t he overall force commander however during the embarkation movement and assault phases and until the atf is diss olved the catf will exercise command authority over the atf besides the catf will have command authority over all forces operating in the amphibious objective area aoa including t hose that are not part of the atf 440 planning on receipt of the op erational directive from the cosc the theatre commander will issue an initiating 21 directive to the catf lfc and af c this initiating directive is in essence an amplification of the operational directive and contains the information necessa ry to carry out the task thereafter the triservice planning staff will prepare detailed plans based on which formal oper ational order is issued this constitutes the basis on which the three services components would make their detailed plans 441 conduct the assault phase

the wellestablished principles of war are equally applicable to combat operations conducted within the overall ambit of lic some other princi ples will need to be modified for the military environment t he commander on the spot will balance the application of each principle depending upon the nature of each specific operat ion the commonly understood principles of ci and counterpro xy war operations are given below primacy of overall aim the scope and intensity of ci operations relate to the probability of finding political solutions therefore operational objectives will need to be oriented towards achieving 25 qualitative improvement in the situation clearly stated operational and tactical objec tives should be directed towards an equally unambiguous overall strategic aim unity of effort this will be equally applicable to intraforce as well as inte ragency efforts apart from the army large number of police and paramilitary forces are often also committed in ci operations as such it will be essential to harmonise the efforts of each element and therein lies the importance of unity of command loosely defined yet responsive command arrangements may also need to be made within own forces popular support popular support is the cornerstone of all ci operations all actions including military operations should be undertaken to seek the voluntary and willing suppor t of

way they contribute even more than the actual operations dynamic conduct the conduct of military operations should break fr ee from set patterns stereotyped plans and rigid responses the insurgents

be reactive it is therefore of utmost importance that imaginative and innovative variations in time scope and manner of force application fo rms the basis of all ci operations to dominate the area keep the insurgents on the run and gain physical and moral ascendancy public relations the broad spectrum of all military actions must be pr ojected in transparent honest and positive manner for maximum psychological gains the action of the army should aim at respecting and protecting human rights re ducing the threat to the 26 people and inspire sense of security any excesses by the troops provoked or otherwise or errors of judgement of commanders must be candidly and promptly admitted and swift corrective actions taken in free and fair manner wh ilst guarding against any adverse effect on the morale of own troops it needs to be noted that the role of t he media is critical in achieving positive projec tion of military actions code of conduct the military code of conduct must be strictly observed by all ranks guidelines issued by the chief of the army staff are given below remember that the people you are dealing with are your own countrym your behaviour must be dictated by this single most consideration violation of human right s therefore must be avoided under all circumstanc even at the cost of operational success be compassionate hel p the people and win their hearts and minds operations must be peoplefriendly and it should be ensured that least possible inconvenience and harassment is caused to the populace minimum force should be used and collateral damage should be avoided operations should not be undertaken without police representative ll operations against women militants or terrorists s hould be conducted only in the presence of women police personnel be truthful honest and maintain the highest standards of integrity honour discipline courage and sacrifice sustain physical and moral strength mental robustness and motivation train hard be

backup for success in ci operations concer ted efforts are required to establish an intelligence grid this is longterm process and 28 hence continuity must be main tained even if units rotate through

perceptions of the selected target audience 57 information management media media caters to various needs of the people in society in peace and war with its unlimited capabilities and reach it is an effective force multiplier since insurgency is battle for the hearts and minds of the people media is the most potent weapon for conducting psychological initiatives electronic warfare ew plays key role in supplementing in telligence timely and actionable intelligence is vital this will go long way in isolating scattered pockets of insurgents and depriving them of direction and coordination from their controllers and supporters 58 winning hearts and minds security forces must seek popular approval for their presence in insurgency prone areas wham involves acti ons to gain the confidence of uncommitted elements of the population in addition to obtaining preserving and strengthening support from friendly insurgents wham focuse s on undertaking civic action programmes to present the armys human face these include providing education creating medi cal facilities construction and development projects in additi on to social activities aimed at improving the quality of life and promoting better understanding and cooper ation with local re sidents further due consideration needs to be accorded to minimize inconvenience to the populace during conduct of operations apart from safeguar ding human rights 29 59 human rights and legal framework with the armys prolonged deployment in ci operations there is need to develop due respect for human rights notwithstanding the tense stressful and turbulent si tuations at the grass roots level in this regard the ten commandments issued by the chief of the army staff as given ear lier will be strictly followed 510 leadership good leadership is very important and will prove effective in ensuring that troops are convinced that the cause they are fighting for is just leaders need to display great tact and patience in coping with the difficulties in insurgency situations conduct of operations 511 ci operations need to be co nducted in two different geographical contexts more so in proxy war situations the first is at the border or lc it self through which the insurgent cadre infiltrates the second is in the hinterland both urban and rural wherein insurgents tablish bases and hides from which strikes are launched theref ore it is ess ential that well coordinated operations need to be conducted to first check infiltration and then to deprive the freedom of action enjoyed by insurgents in the hinterland this isolates them from their support base 512 checking infiltration and exfiltration the porosity of our borders difficult rrain and inclement weather conditions provide ideal conditions for infiltration all possible measures must be undertaken to check infiltration and exfiltration incisive appreciation of terrain will help identify the likely infiltration and exfiltra tion routes along which multi tiered surveillance grid should be established quick reaction teams should be based on surveillance centres to respond swiftly to any attempted infiltra tion and egress in the long run the success rate of infiltration attempts should be reduced so drastically that insurgents do not consider it costeffective whenever an obstacle such as fence is creat ed it should be backed by surveillance equipment and troops physically guarding it from both sides ju ngle bashing by large bodies 30 in the absence of intelligence is the least effective method of operating in such conditions 513 operations in the hinterland these encompass the urban rural and forest areas each of these has its own peculiarities which dictate the deployment pattern and density of troops in given area wh ile inhabited urban areas will require firm but humane measures for population and access control and selective surgical operations based on specific inputs more vigorous combat operations will be necessitated against wellestablished camps in rural areas and forests the army is more suited for the second category of operations the deployment pattern and density of troops wil l be dictated by the overall number of insurgents operating in the area their tactics and motivation demographi c realities public attitude and terrain in addition to the pr evailing political economic and social conditions it will be impe rative to ensure own security and undertake measures to prevent the insurgents from exploiting vulnerabilities and if they do so to respond swiftly so that poststrike get away is prohibitively expensive for the insurgents 514 small team operations resources of the security forces will invariably be st retched over large area of responsibility in such an environment operations based on small teams backed by good or s pecific intelligence increase the chances of contact with and success against insurgents 31 helicopters can be very effectively employed for various tasks in ci operations ci units fe rried by helicopters should be employed for tasks of decisiv nature where speed and surprise are of paramount importanc particularly in remote or inaccessible areas 515 minimizing casualties unlike conventional war ci operations are seldom time bound casualties occur when operations are conducted without adequate intelligence poor or inadequate standard of basic in fantry skills and neglect of fundamentals effort s hould be spared to minimize casualties to own troops so as to maintain moral ascendancy over the insurgents counter insurgency operations must of necessity be an

administration to meet sudden challenges to internal peace and tranquillity due to local disturbances initiated by segment of the population or due to natural or manmade calamities the suddenness and intensity of the event may catch the civil administration unprepared or unable to meet the immediate challenge while the army will be able to dep loy speedily provide relief and bring the situation to state manageable by the civil administration it must be noted that management of disasters is primarily state subject 517 maintenance of law and order amongst all the duties generally performed by the

progressively escalating with correspondi ng increase in the frequency of the armys deployment under such conditions deployment and conduct of the army has to be thought through and planned meticulously bearing in mind prevailing sensitivities the army should work on the well established principles of good faith the use of minimum force and prior warning to the people when compelled to take action 518 disaster relief the indian subcontinent is vulnerable to floods drought s cyclones earthquakes and accidents disasters include earthquakes landslides floods cyclones wildfires and epidemics on the one hand and accidents and manmade disasters on the other the impact of these disasters is more predom inant in underdeveloped and 33 remote areas where facilities to handle such calamities do not exist 519 humanitarian assistance these programmes consist of assistance provided in conjunction with military operations and training exercise s humanitarian assistance should enhance national security interests and increase the operational readiness of units performing such missions these may include provision of medical care basic sanitation facilities repair of public amen ities and facilities education training and technical assistance planning for noncombat operations 520 levels of planning the army carries out planning for disaster management at the national state and field levels the ministry of defence in cluding headquarters integrated defence staff and the three servic headquarters are involved at the highest level co mmand area or sub area headquarters will interact with t he civil administration police and other organisations at the state level through periodic civilmilitary conferences activities related to surveillance preparedness and prevention shoul d nonetheless continue even during normal conditions 521 full utilisation of state resources all military commanders approached to provide aid must advise the civil administration to first fully utilise their own resources they should synergise these with thos of the army once deployed this is particularly applicable for duties involving maintenance of law and order particularly in circumstances when the state 34 government may be of the opinion that the task is beyond its capabilities though this may result in the army having to step into an already deteriorated sit uation it is necessary to maintain its longterm credibi lity and effectiveness and hence need to avoid highhandedness will be the key guiding principle 522 preparation in order to be able to respond to any call in aid of civil authorities it is important for all command echelons in the army to be full aware of the availability and deployment of state resources as also have complete understanding of the existing infras tructure in their areas of responsibility equally important is visualisation of the likely role that the army may be assign ed in specific area given its physical and social peculiarities the capability of the army to undertake various noncombat operations will require an in depth analysis and standard operat ing procedures should be worked out in consultation with civil administration this will ensure that minimum time is lost in deployment of troops and that necessary training is im parted to own troops in advance for the purpose the army has c harted out detail ed allocation of responsibilities in all areas and all civil administrative officials are kept informed requisitioning of aid 523 preplanned aid in cases where rendition of aid can be planned

make necessary preparations state governments should keep the appropriate army formation headquarters informed regarding ongoing developments and details of reques ts projected to the ministry of defence such formations or units will then carry out necessary preparations and make outline plans for the task including allotment of troops equipment and movement army headquarters shall always be kept fully apprised of such details 35 524 aid in an emergency when time is short the designated civil authority may make direct requisition to the nearest military authority for maintenance of law and order or for disaster relief local military authority will pr ovide the necessary help without reference to t he higher headquarters in exceptional cases where speed is essential to save human lives and property however in cases of sensitive nature prior clearance of the army headquarters will be obtained telephonically by the command headquarters concerned the sanction of the union government will be obtained at the earliest even in such cases by the concerned state governments during natural calamities and other serious emergencies when time does not permit obtaining sanction of the ion government the local commander may at his discr etion comply with the request of the civil authority to the best of his ability in such circumstances the civ il and military authorities will immediately report their actions to the union government general nc vi j internal security related operations have assumed an equal significance as the primar task of the army and these have now
