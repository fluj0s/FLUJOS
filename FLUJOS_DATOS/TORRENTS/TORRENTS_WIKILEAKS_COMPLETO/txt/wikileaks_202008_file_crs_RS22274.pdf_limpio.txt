president hosni mubarak and his ruling national democratic party ndp have faced gr owing criticism both domestically and internationally regarding limite d progress on po litical liberaliz ation one frequently cited obstacle to reform had been the indirect presidential election process in which candidate was nominated nd confirmed by the ndpc ontrolled peoples assembly lower house of parliament nd then approved in nationw ide yes or referendum which was thought to be manipulated by au thorities with the past four referendums without competitor routinely resulting in mubarak receiving anywhere from 93 to 98 yes votes the process was widely viewed at home and abroad as illegitimate and was perceived as an anachronism in the ey of younger egyptians the recent publicity surrounding elections in iraq lebanon saudi arabia and the west bank gaza strip only heightened this perception as egypt th largest arab country appeared out of step with the trend in the arab world in add ition egypts ruling elite has been gradually undergoing generational shift in which new faction of young mediasavvy and westerneducated leaders with in the ndp led by the presidents gamal mubarak has attempted to reinvigorate political culture in order to modernize the ndps image without having to relinquish the partys grip on power httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22274crs2 1 the 2005 parliamentary elections also were ov erseen by parliamentary election commission which functioned similarly to the presidentia l election commission though with more autonomyamending the constitution as result of this changing political atmosphere on february 26 2005 president mubarak proposed to amend the constitution to allow for egypts first ever multi candidate presidential election the proposal was approved by the pe oples assembly and then confirmed in nationwide refe rendum on may 25 2005 however under the amended article 76 of the constitution lawmakers made it difficult for independent candidates to run for president according to the amendment and the subsequent election law law 174 which laid out the legal fra mework for new elections any independent candidate seeking to run would need the support of 250 elected politicians drawn from the peoples assembly the shura council or upper house and the provincial councils since the ndp and its supporters c ontrol most of the seats in all three bodies most analysts considered it nearly impossible fo r an independent oppositi on candidate to run in presidential election critics charged that this requirement wa s designed specifically to prevent members of the banned mu slim brotherh ood egypt s largest opposition movement from running under cu rrent law the brotherhood is not recognized as legal party forcing its members to run as indepe ndents in past parliame ntary elections other provisions in the amendment and the ne w election law include the following candidates from legal opposition partie s must come from their partys leadership to be eligible to run in 2005 however in future elections party would need to have been license d for at least five years and to hold at least 5 percent of the seats in the lower and upper hous of parliament to get on the ballot this last requirement would make it difficult for many small opposition parties to field candidates it also heightens the importance of parliament ary elections in 2010 since president mubarak at age 77 may choose not to seek another term oversight of the presidential election process is given to presidential electoral commission pec composed of current and former judges and other public figures1 five of the commissions ten members are chosen by parliament the pec s the sole authority to approve candidate nominations supervise elec tion procedures and tally the final results most importantly since some of its members are judges the pec has final judicial competence to rule on any contestation or challenge submitted in relation to the presidential elections and its decision will be final and subject to appeal critics charge that this final provision places the pec above the rule of the courts the campaign the presidential campaign ran from august 17 to september 4 2005 although some criticized the short campaign season many obs ervers believe that the campaign had positive impact on political discourse in egyp t for example the opposition wafd party the oldest political party in egypt used provocative campaign slog an loosely translatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22274crs3 2 opposition partys angry slogan

politics2 the slogan which was not well received by government officials was eventually permitted by authorities despite its veiled criticism of the mubarak regime reportedly the party had threatened to boycott the election if the slogan were banned on august 21 2005 the eg yptian muslim brotherhood called on its supporters to vote in the election but qualifie d this statement by saying that all the brothers should know that we could not suppor t an oppressor or coope rate with corrupt person or with tyrant veiled reference to mubarak3 some observers speculated that the brotherhood resisted boycotting the election in the hopes of securing additional seats in the november 2005 pa rliamentary elections ayman nours candidacy surprised some experts by showing growing organizational capacity in parts of the eg yptian countryside whic h many other opposition candidates lacked4 nour is wealthy attorney who may have drawn on his own personal resources to fund his campaign in d ecember 2005 nour was convicted of forgery for falsifying signatures on his partys registrati on documents he is appealing the ruling and the united states has demande d that he be released overall the campaigns of president m ubarak ayman nour and nomaan gomaa focused almost exclusively on domestic issu such as job creation social welfare programs and education fore ign policy issues received ss attention which is unusual in egyptian politics and in the region as whole where the israelipalestinian conflict and more recently iraq absorbs the overw helming bulk of media coverage during his election campaign mubarak pledged to intr oduce number of reforms including the elimination of the 1981 emergenc laws which have been us ed to quell political dissent many outside observers also we re surprised by the lack of censorship on such previously taboo subjects as mubaraks pers onal finances the status of coptic christians in egypt and government corruption according to joe stork deputy middl east director at human rights watch the significance of th is election isnt the possibility of unseating mubarak but the fact that many egyptians ve boldly challenged his quartercentury of rule their willingness to speak out has gene rated serious public bate instead of just another presidential plebiscite5 election day developments election day on september 7 was largely p eaceful if marred

voters lists campaign materials inside polling stations and harassment of domestic elec tion monitors at the polls7 although some allegations may reflect insufficient voter education and the novelty surrounding egypts first presidential competitive election most observe rs believe that the election was weighted in favor of president mubara k others counter that the ection was an improvement over past national referenda and parliamentary votes due to less heavyhanded security measures at the polls on september 9 the pec announced that president mubarak had been reelected with 886 of the vote followed by ayman nour with 7 and nomaan gomaa with 3 nours second place finish was surprise to some and has nhanced his status as one of the leading opposition figures in egypt more importantly turnout was noticeably low with estimates ranging from the official figure of 23 to independent estimates of 15 some analysts believe that the low turnout represents prevailing apathy toward politics with many voters reluctant to participate in process they perceive as corrupt egypts voter rolls have not been updated for many ears which has resulte d in voter confusion decreased voter participation and fraudulen t voting procedures others particularly government officials counter that the figure represents egyptians faith in president mubarak and disinterest in democracy the u s state department spokesman praised the vote saying these elections really mark historic departure for egypt in the fact that you have multicandidate presidential elections i think its safe to say that egyptians have not seen presidential election like the one they have just seen in their lifetimes8 2005 parliamentary elections in the egyptian political system the line between executive and legislative power is often blurred as the peoples assembly is seen as more of patronage dispensing network rather than lawmaking body9 thus parliamentary elections often become contests pitting business elites against one another as they vie for government access instead of ideological battles between par ties of different governing philosophies nevertheless some opposition figures were hopeful that give n the more liberal atmosphere engendered by the september 2005 presidential electi on the parliamentary elections would yield some gains for political reformists in reality the ndp maintained supramajority in parliame nt despite significant gain for the islamist opposition the secular opposition faired poorly httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22274crs5 10 analysts note that the egyptian government often negotiates with the opposition over how many candidates they are allowed to field the election took place in three stages during november and december 2005 in all 5414 candidates vied for 444 seats the ten remaining seats are appointed by presid ent mubarak voter turnout averaged about 20 for all three rounds muslim brotherhoodaffiliate d candidates who won total of 88 seats up from 17 seats in the 2000 election received international attention for winning higher percentage of the actual seats they contested for example the brotherhood only fielded between 135 150 candidates 88 of whom won their districts victory percentage of 58 the ndp whic h contested all 444 seats only had 158 actual party members successfully gain seats victory percentage of 35 ultimately another 166 independent candidate s many of whom are affiliated with the ndp returned to the party giving it an overall majority of nearly 73 although the strong performance of th muslim brotherhood in the first round provided positive picture of the reform pr ocess in egypt subsequent rounds which witnessed extensive government repression and fraud were re turn to the politics of old in egypt10 secular and islamist opposition demonstr ations were met with widespread violence by police and hired thugs 1600 peopl were arrested and 13 people were killed in various provinces only four women were elected to parliame nt all of whom were from the ndp one copt finan ce minister yusef boutros ghali was elected five other copts were appointed by president mubarak ay man nour lost his s eat in parliament to former egyptian state security official some observers have credited egypt for llowing extensive domestic monitoring of the elections process number of egyptia n ngos some of which receive support from us democracy promotion organizations like the the national democratic institute ndi and the international republican institute iri regularly reported violations including instances of vote buying voter intimidation nd shortages of judges to oversee ballot box counting independent monito rs were not allowed to ove rsee the counting of votes implications for us policy both elections pose several dilemmas for usegyptian relations and the wider us effort to promote democracy in the regi on on the one hand some policymakers believe that the more open atmosphere engendered during the presidential campaign and the first round of the parliamentary elections was ccess for us efforts to promote political reform and pluralism in the arab world at the same time the ndp and president mubaraks overwhelming victorie s raise questions about the fairness of both elections putting the united states in the difficult position of having to both praise egypt for undertaking reforms and at the same time to call for more transparency in future elections furthermore experts note that political reform is just one of number of issues in usegyptian relations including s ecurity cooperation

efforts to promote democracy in egypt as the st rongest opposition organization the brotherhood is the only group capable of mobilizing on large scale and has pressed the government to expand freedom of speech and assembly nevertheless some speculate that us policymakers would prefer more vibrant secular opposition in egypt two weeks after the elections muhammad mehdi akef the s upreme guide of the brotherhood remarked that the nazi holocaust was myth reiterating comments made earlier by irans president mahmoud ahmadinejad the brother hood issued re traction several days later the brotherhood fielded one woman candidate in the election makarem aldeiri professor at the esteemed azhar university although she lost to an ndp businessman she gained attention in the western media for her statements on gender equality remarking that violence against women and children in western societies stems from going against the idea that men are superior to women many analysts believe that elections for the lower house of par liament were in many ways more important than the recent presidential election due to the failure of any opposition party to secure the minimum number of seats needed 23 under egyptian law to field candidate in any future presiden tial election with 88 seats muslim brotherhood sympathizers were the only movement that exceeded 23seat minimum however it is not legal party at time when there is mu ch speculation surrounding the succession to 77 year old president mubarak th ere appears to be legal oppos ition party capable of fielding candidate agains t the
