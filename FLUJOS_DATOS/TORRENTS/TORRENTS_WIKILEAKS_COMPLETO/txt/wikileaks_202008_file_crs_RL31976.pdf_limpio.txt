resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31976benefitcost analysis and the discount rate for the corps of engineers water resource projects theory and practice summary construction of large water resource project s such as those of the army corps of engineers corps can be controvers ial because they involve tradeoffs among various river uses and between current and future generations pursuant to federal water project planning guidelines the corp s weighs these tradeoffs using benefit cost analysis if its analysis shows th at projects nationa l economic development ned benefits exceed its ned costs the corps seeks project authorization from congress congress authorizes the corps to construct some of these large water projects through usually biennial wate r resource development acts since the corps rarely recommends project that does not have benefitcost ratio greater than 10 this report describes the decisions that influence this ratio with focus on the role of the discount rate one of the decisions that critically influence the outcome of benefitcost ratio is the choice of discount rate to transfor m future benefits and costs into present values the corps uses discount rate formula established in the water resources development act of 1974 this formula base s the discount rate on the average yield of longterm government securities so economists however argue that the rate should reflect the cost of disp lacing private investment sp ecifically the rate of return on capital in private markets which is usually higher than longterm government securities due to the temporal distribution of water projects bene fits and costs eg large nearterm costs and with benefits typically distributed over very long time periods projects evaluated with lower discount rate are more likely to pass the benefitcost ratio test than projects evaluated using higher rate since the treasury rate is generally lower than the rate of return on private investments changing the water project rate now 5875 to rate of retu rn closer to that on private investments such as the ombs base rate now 7 would likely decrease th number of projects that have benefitcost ratio of greater than 10 basing the water project rate on treasury rather than privatesector rates is not the only controversial component of the di scount rate formula for example the corps calculates future benefits and costs using real dollars ie inflation is removed from these figures but discounts using nominal discount rate ie one that is not corrected for inflation to produce real rate this underestimates the present value of future benefits nd costs and reduces the like lihood that longterm projects would pass the benefitcost ratio test notwithstanding this technical inconsistency there are other issues associated with th corps discount rate formula use of an average rather than marginal rate of return use of rate based on longterm rather than shorterterm securities and use of th yield rate rather than the coupon rate given the many factors that influence th discount rate the net effect is unknown in addition many factors other than the disc ount rate affect the be nefitcost ratio and project recommendations but are beyond the scope of this report this is background report and is unlikely to be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31976contents introduction 1 t h c r p s p l n n i n g g u i d l i n s f d r l b j c t i v s 3 q u n t i f i n g b n f i t s n d c s t s n t i n l c n m i c d v l p m n

plans and implements water and related land projects in two major areas water infrastructure primarily flood control and navigation and environmental management restoration for more information on corps programs see rs20866 the civil works program of the army corps of engineers primer 2 it should be noted that most other large fe derally sponsored infrastructure projects such as airports and highways are evaluated at th state level where they may or may not be subject to benefitcost analysis requirements the federal role for these projects generally is to provide funding not to physically construct the projectsbenefitcost analysis and the discount rate for the corps of engineers water resource projects theory and practice introduction construction of large water resource project s such as those of the army corps of engineers1 corps and the bureau of reclama tion department of interior are often controversial because th ey involve tradeoffs betw een various river and other waterrelated uses and between current and fu ture generations therefore each water resource management strategy results in winners and losers for example free flowing river supports recreation fisherie s and scenic beauty while dams may support hydropower flood control navigation water supply and motorized or other recreation purposes managing rivers to achieve any individual or combination of benefits may diminish the benefits derive d from other river uses because it is choice among river or other water resource management objectives eg estuaries ports etc each large water proj ect generates suppor ters and opponents during the course of controversy over these large water projects there is inevitably debate over the proj ect evaluation process one of the more controversial aspects of this project evaluation process is benefitcost analysis2 benefitcost analysis is formalized procedure for estimating the benefits that water resource development is expected to generate the costs necessary to produce the project and comparing them proponents of benefitcost analysis contend that it is necessary to help quantify the differences among project alternatives however benefitcost analysis is controversial because it is necessarily based on subjective decisions on what should or should not be included as benefits and costs as well as how they ought to be evaluated critics of benefit cost analysis often focus on the valuationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31976crs2 3 the corps has also been criticized for underval uing benefits and costs that cannot be easily measured monetarily eg benefits and costs associated with the destruction or production of fish and wildlife habitat or wetlands as system functions 4 for more information on proposed changes to the army corps of engineers planning process see crs report rl30928 army corps of engineers civil works reform issues for the 107th congress 5 these concerns were explored at length in series of washington post

construction projects7 in 2001 at the request of the department of defense the national research council an arm of the national academy of sciences examined the upper mississippi riverillinois waterway and criticized the assumptions and data used to conduct th corps feasibility study8 the corps has been criticized for other projects as well for example general accounting office gao report released in june 2002 found that miscalculati ons invalid assumpti ons and inconsistent discount rates caused the corps to overestim ate the benefits of the delaware river deepening project9 concerns regarding the corps proj ect evaluation proce ss have resulted in increased congressional scrutiny of the agency in recent years congress typically supports corps projects through new and revise d

this report primarily because its project evaluation processes have been the subject of recent controversy and congressional hearings the corps is also the largest water resource agency in terms of funding and number of projectsnew corps projects in part due to disa greement over proposals to reform the corps project development process both chambers of the 107th congress held hearings examining the corps methodologies and seve ral bills were introduced to change how the corps plans for and evaluates its project s one bill s 1987 called for independent peer review for increasing the requisite benefitcost ratio to 15 and for updating project planning guidelines11 furthermore house and senate appropriations committees which are responsible for corps funding12 have expressed concerns about the corps project development process13 given recent congressional in terest in how the corps plans for and evaluates federal water projects this report examines the federal planning guidelines for the corps water project evaluati ons these planning guidelines establish the objectives of federal water projects guide which benef its and costs contribute to the objectives delineate methodologies

practices for economic nalysis of river basin projects washington dc may 1950environmental principles and guidelines for water and related land resources implementation studies principles and guidelines or pg guide water project evaluations16 under the pg the objective of corps projects is to increase national economic development ned thus the corps is required to measure each projects contribution to this objective whenever feasible these effects are to be measured in monetary terms which are then used to calculate benefitcost ratio these monetary measurements of ned are significant because project must generally have benefit cost ratio of at least 10 to be approved by the corps17 while the pg emphasize the national ec onomic development objective previous planning guidelines had other sometimes broader planning objectives congress first established federal guidelines for evaluating the corps civil projects in the flood control act of 193618 this act provides the basis for project evaluation by stating that project should be undertaken if the benefits to whomsoever they may accrue are in excess of the estimated costs nd if project is needed to improve the lives and social security of the people19 since then planning guidelines have narrowed this objective to focus on specific types of be nefits and costs see table 1 page 17 for the effective dates of fede ral planning guidelines the first major implementation guidance for this statute was 1950 report entitled proposed practices for economic nalysis of river basin projects 20 this document which is known as the green book states that the objective of benefitcost analysis should be to maximize gene ral economic welfare and ec onomic efficiency from comprehensive public viewpoi nt furthermore the green book recommends that this broad objective include both ma rket and nonmarket benefits and costs for example the benefits from flood control project s hould include nonmarket benefits such as saving human lives as well as market bene fits such as protecting physical property therefore the green book narrowed the objective of bene fitcost analysis to economic welfare and economic efficiency but defi ned these objectives in broad terms ie it included nonmarket effects while implementing the green book was voluntary many of its procedures became mandatory in 1952 when they were incorporated into document of the bureau of the budget predecessor to the office of management and budget entitledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31976crs5 21 bureau of the budget circular a47 dec 31 1952 22

ouncil within the execu tive office of the president and gave it responsibility for establishing benefitcost guidelines the reagan administration abolished the active program of the water resource council in the early 1980s however statutory authority for the agency remainsbudget circular a4721 through circular a47 benefitcost analysis became the dominant component of project evaluation circular a47 states that except for unusual cases where adequate ju stification is presented projects estimated benefits must exceed its estimated costs throughout the 1950s the bureau of the budget would not approve corps projects that did not have benefitcost ratio in terms of monetized benefits and costs of at least 10 although circular a47 states th at benefits and costs should be estimated in moneta ry terms or in the most quantitative terms possible benefitcost ratio only includes values measur ed in dollars nonmarket benefits and costs are included only when they are conve rted into dollars since monetization of nonmarket benefits and costs can be difficu lt and is often contr oversial the corps interpretation of circular 47 appeared to emphasize ma rket over nonmarket benefits and costs the move toward market benefit empha sis encountered resi stance along the way throughout the 1950s legislation was proposed to broaden evaluation procedures in 1962 the kennedy administration acting on 1960 recommendation of the senate select committee on water resources further revised the guidance for water project planning and evaluation by preparing policies standards and procedures in the formulation evaluation and review of pl ans for use and development of water and related land resources ps 22 these were printed as sdoc 97 this document replaced the strict benefitcost ratio test with more general objectives it stated that the basic purpose of project formula tion is to provide the best use or combination of uses of water and related land resources to meet all foreseeable short or longterm needs in order to achieve this goal sdoc 97 recommended that the corps pursue multiple objectives including economic developmen t preservation and the well being of people23 the corps evaluation process began chan ging again in 1968 when the thenactive water resources council24 wrc began revising the mandatory guidelines printed in sdoc 97 in july 1970 special

review of the proposal and consulta tion with the office of management and budget the water resources council published revised version of the ps for public comment25 in contrast to the proposal of the special task force the final version of the ps26 which took effect in 1973 was much na rrower in its approach to selecting feasible water projects specifically it focused on single national economic development objective the 1973 principles and standards remained in effect only few months before being revised the direction of congress in 1974 the first in what has become generally biennial series of water resource development acts wrda was enacted27 under 80c of wrda 1974 the president wa s authorized to study and revise the ps inclusive of interest rates costsharing and the multiple objectives suggested by the special task force in 1970 one of the most significant features of the newly revised ps under wrda 1974 was that environm ental matters were placed on footing equal to econo mic development as reissued in 1980 the ps relied on four coequal accounts national economic development quality of the environment regional development and social factors although they were in effect these accounts never gained political acceptance during an extended legislative and executive debate over water policy in september1982 the wate r resources council repealed the principles and standards ps and established the principles and guidelines pg 28 which were approved by president reagan in februa ry 1983 and currently remain in effect29 the pg establish four accounts simila r to the objec tives under the ps including national economic development ned regional economic velopment red environmental quality eq and other societal effects ose30 unlike the ps however the pg did not place equal weight on the f our accounts according to these principles and guidelines the federal objective of wa ter and related land resourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31976crs7 31 if the red and ned accounts were both cons idered equally for example the regional distribution of costs and bene fits would be taken into consideration under the p g benefits to one region can offset the costs in another region likewise economic benefits can offset any measurable environmental costs 32 principles and guidelines 33 this term external economies refers to the costsaving benefits of locating near factors of production which are external to th firm such as locally available skilled labor training and resource and development facilities 34 principles and guidelines 8 35ibid 9project planning is to contribute to the na tional economic developm ent consistent with national environmental law and other federal planning requirements therefore the ned account is the most significant of the four accounts and the only mandatory account used to evaluate fede ral water projects component s of the other three accounts are often included in the ned account when they are monetized but they are not considered as equivalent objectives31 the pg further emphasizes the importance of the ned account by instructing the corps to choose the nedma ximizing alternative unless there are overriding reasons for recommending another plan based on other federal state local or international concerns32 ultimately therefore the corps project recommendation largely rests on wh ether or not the projects ned benefits outweigh its ned costs quantifying benefits and costs national economic development given an objective in this case nati onal economic development the second component of benefitcost analysis is deci ding which variables should be included as with the selection of an appr opriate discount rate deciding which benefits and cost will be included and how they will be measured is controversial and somewhat subjective process for federal water projects the pg define which variables the ned account may include notably increases and decreas in categories of goods and services expressed in monetary units however it does not include t hose benefits and costs that the corps chooses not to value in monetary terms the specific types of ned benefits and costs are described in the following paragraphs ned benefits the pg establish procedures for identifying and measuring ned benefits they define ned benefits as increases in the national economic value of the national output of goods and services from plan the value of output resulting from external economies33 caused by plan and the value associated with the use of otherwise unemployed or underemployed labor resources34 this definition means that ned benefits are the direct and indir ect increases in production and employment attributable to plan pr oduction benefits are measured as the willingness of users to pay for each increment of output plan will create35 projects output may include increases to the following categories of g oods and services municipal and industrial water supply agricultural floodwater reduc tion agricultural drainage agricultural irrigation erosion and sedimentation reduction urban fl

irrigation releases as outlined below the ned account may incl ude wide variety of direct benefits however it does not addr ess the distribution of project be nefits for example the ned benefit calculation does not dis tinguish between the benefits that are gained by few people eg local barge owners and those that are spread widely eg over all electricity consumers ned costs as described in the pg projects ned account includes two categories of costs implementation outlays and other direct costs the first cost category implementation outlays are those co sts that require the direct expenditure of money it includes all the payments made to construct operate and maintain project37 as shown in figure 2 the major subcategories of implementation costs as outlined bythe pg are

the second cost category othe r direct costs are the costs of resources directly required for project or plan but for which dollars are expended39 basically these nonmarket costs fall into three categories implicit costs of displ aced resources uncompensated ned losses and negative externalities40 figure 2 the implicit costs category includes the resources used for project completion for which money is expended eg land or other resources donated for the project uncompensated ned losses result when the insta llation operation main tenance or replacement of project reduces the economic output eg loss of recreation user days from temporary decrease in water releases these losses differ from implicit costs in that they are not necessarily associated with project construction nega tive externalities are th implicit or explicit costs for affected third parties eg loss of commercial or sport fishing as outlined above the ned account may incl ude wide variety of direct costs however it does not address some qualitative equity concerns regarding the distribution of projects costs for example the ned cost calculation does not distinguish between construction costs that are spread widely eg over many tax payers and those that are borne by few people eg commercial fishermen likewise the ned account does not identify projects whose costs will be paid by people with specific age income or other demogr aphic characteristics httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31976crs10 41 see principles and guidelines 141b which reads the general level of prices for outputs and inputs prevailing durin g or immediately preceding th period of planning is to be used for the entire period of analysis 42 specifically all of the prices used to value benefits and costs are expressed in constant dollars 43 for more information on one common tool contingent valuation see crs report rl30242 assessing nonmarket values th rough contingent valuation 44 according to the pg p5 the period of analysis is to be the time required for implementation plus the lesser of 1 the period of time over which any alternative plan would have significant beneficial or adverse effects or 2 period not to exceed 100 years 45 inflation also decreases the value of future benefits and costs when they are measured in nominal dollars but not when they are measured in real dollars again real dollars have already been adjusted for inflation but nominal dollars are notevaluating ned benefits and costs in addition to describing the types of benefits and costs that may be included in the ned account the pg outline the methods for evaluating the magnitude of these benefits and costs specifically the pg state that benefits and costs should be expressed in real as opposed to nominal prices41 this rule means that the corps estimates of future costs and benefits are based on todays price level ie they are adjusted to remove the influence of expected inflation42 calculating real constant dollar values attributable to some of the aforementioned benefits and costs varies in difficulty whenever possible the corps values benefits and costs using market prices for the good or service for example th value of protecting structures from flood damage is based on the structures market values however the valuation process becomes more challenging nd controversial as the good in question becomes further removed from one that is traded in an actual market or will be traded in the more distant future for example it is more difficult to value projects recreational benefits or environmental costs than to value its electri city benefits for th is reason this approach has been criticized by economists environmen talists and fiscal conservatives however the corps is working to improve its nonmark et valuation methodologies discussion of these methods is beyond the scope of this report43 the discount rate discounting future benefits and costs after quantifying all of the ned benefits and costs to whomever they may accrue the next step in the analysis is to compare the benefits to the costs this process is complicated by the fact that corps projects take several years to construct and their projects and benefits c ontinue for an indefinite number of years in practice the corps evaluates benefits and costs over period of up to 100 years44 benefits and costs accrued at different points in this 100 year pe riod are not directly comparable rather dollar earned today has more value than one earned tomorrow because people prefer to spend money today and because dollar c ould be invested today to yield more than dollar tomorrow45 to compare benefits and costs accrued in different periods thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31976crs11 46 rather than convert future benefits and cost s into single present value they could also convert those values into average annual benefits and costs us department of the army corps of engineers national economic development procedures manual national economic development cost iwr report 93r12 washington dc june 1993 47 crs report 76150 benefitcost analysis of water resource projects 48 benefits and costs measured in real dolla rs should be discounted using real discount rate nominal dollars should be disc ounted using nominal discount rate 49 to discount future benefits or costs the fo llowing formula is used future benefit or cost divided by 1 discount rate t where t equals the number of years in this case t is 50 because that is the average length of analysis for water projects in reality benefits and costs for each year 1 throug h 50 would be discounted corps must convert future benef its and costs to present values46 this conversion process known as discounting requires the use of an interest rate also known as the discount rate the discount rate is important because it has major impact on the outcome of benefitcost analyses high discount ra places low value on future benefits and as such will justify only projects with very hi gh future rates of return whereas low discount rate is more lenient47 in this manner the leve l of the discount rate has significant effect on projects that provide benefits over long time horizon but have large initial construction costs conversely projects with high maintenance costs and large nearterm benefits are the leas t affected by high discount rate how the calculation works the overall effect of the discount rate on projects benefitcost analysis depends on th distribution of each projects benefits and costs figure 3 provides an example of how the discount rate ffects two projects with different distributions of benefits and costs over time for simplicity benefits and costs are assumed to occur in only two time periods year one the shortrun and year 50 the longrun in this example the benefits and costs are stated in real dollars thus the discount rates shown in examples and b are real rates of return48 in example the discount rate has very little effect on the pr

when the discount rate is zero the benefitcost ratio is 10010090100 or 105 when the real discount rate is 6 the longrun benefits and costs are discounted49 specifically the present value of 100 is

the discount rate the discount rate has more impact on project s that generate few nearterm benefits but for which benefits accrue over long time horizon as is the case for many corps projects in

shortterm gratification and 2 an assumption that per capita consumption will grow over time diminishing marginal retu rns to future consumption faa page 52 54 according to robert nderson office of management and budget feb 11 2003 the corporate income tax is one of the main re asons for differences between the numbers that come out of different discounting approaches 55 boscolo et alhowever most economists support discountin g because constructin g and maintaining federal project diverts resources from other investments or from consumption52 therefore each investment has cost this cost is either associated with the return that could be earned on the next best use of cap ital known as the opportunity cost of capital or occ or the rate of return that must be paid to indu ce people to defer an additional unit of current consumption this is equivalent to their marginal social rate of time preference srtp53 discounting is the method for incorporating these costs into benefitcost analysis in perfectly functioning market di scount rate calculated to reflect the srtp or the occ would be identical however capital market imperfections such as taxes54 risk aversion and uncertainty cause th discount rates to differ and cause disagreement regarding the discount rate calculation economis ts have generally proposed four major formulations for calcula ting the social discount rate the pretax return on investment method the aftertax savings method the shadow price of capital method and weighted average method55 see figure 4 these formulas are described below and are followed by more specific description of the corps discount ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31976crs14 56 see faa and boscolo et this method is based on the idea that investing in private markets is the best alternative use of capital to using the capital to fund federal projects using this rate of return allo ws policymakers to compare the projects rate of return to what return might have come from investing the same capital in private markets 57 however it should be noted that very few agencies actually conduct benefitcost analyses and those that do have some leeway to use ot her rates in

cost analyses use discount rate based on this approach as established by the omb57 specifically the office of management and budget omb in circular a9458 sets base discount rate that is the average rate of return to private capital consistent with national income and product accounts59 the omb believes that this rate is appropriate for evaluating public investments because it accounts for the displacement of private investment60 the rate is currently set at 761httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31976crs15 62 ae bordman dh greenberg ar vining and dl weimer costbenefit analysis concepts and practice upper saddle river nj prentice hall 1996 marginal rate of return is more appropriate for evaluating propos ed projects because it is the rate of return that could be earned if the capital were invest ed rather than an average of what has been earned on past investments from numer ical standpoint this is important because marginal rates of return are usually lower than average rates of return 63 boscolo et p 5 64 faa p 54 65 boscolo et 54 specifically the aftertax savings rate equals the pretax real discount rate 1tax rate or around 25 to 5 percent see richard zerbe jr and dwight d dively benefitcost analysis in theory and practice new york ny harpercollins college 1994 287 66 the omb also recommends discount rates based on the treasurys borrowing rates in certain circumstances specifically the omb suggests the treasurys rates for 1 cost effectiveness analysis 2 leasepurchase analys is 3 internal government investments and 4 asset sales analysis circular a94 67 faa p 55although this formula is widely used cal culating discount rate using the pretax rate of return on private investments is still contentious in part the difficulty is based on the vast array of possible private sector interest rates additionally there are number of theoretical bases for arguing that the pretax rate of return on private sector investment does not accurately measure the opportunity cost of capital for example some argue that this formula generates an average rather than marginal rate of return62 furthermore the private sector rate of return may reflect individual rather than societalpremium for risk 63 this argument is based on the perspective that people may be more willing to accept risks as group than as indi viduals therefore rate based purely on the pretax return on investme nt may overestimate the disc ount rate thereby making it more difficult to obtain benefitcost ratio of greater than one particularly for long lived projects aftertax savings the resources used to cons truct federal water projects may also be diverted from consumption through taxes therefore some economists believe that the discount rate should reflect the compensation requi red by society to substitute future consumption for current consumption ie the srtp64 this is sometimes measured as the rate of return on us tr easury debt adjusted for inflation and taxes65 the discount rate used by the corps and ot her water resource agencies generally follows this method but the water project rate is not adjusted for taxes66 today this rate is 5875 using the aftertax savings rate as the discount rate faces number of critiques as with the pretax rate of return on private investments the this formula may generate an individual rather than social rate of time preference even if it is equal to the individual rate of time preference accord ing to economists at the federal aviation administration observed inte rest rates reflect the prefer ences of individual members of society who have finite liv and are currently living67 because society exists for an indefinite time period it may place more value on future consumption than would an individual therefore observed rates may overestimate the di scount rate for actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31976crs16 68 richard zerbe et p 128 69 the weights reflect assumptions about the perc entage of resources that are diverted from consumption and from alternative investment s the weights are not projectspecific 70 boscolo et p 7 the weights represent the percentage of resources diverted from consumption versus the percentage diverted from savings 71 faa p 51 boscolo et p 6 72 other agencies with oversight over large c onstruction projects such as the faa or dot generally do not conduct benefitcost analysis any such analysis likely occurs at the state level and the federal agency provides partial project funding 73 agencies such as the epa which do c onduct benefitcost analyses of proposed regulations are required to use the ba rate set by omb circular a94 that will affect the distant future but it may be less relevant for projects with short and mediumterm effects conversely some economists argue that riskless rate of interest such as the treasury rate should not be used for evaluating longterm projects there is also an argument that tax finance shoul d take into account the welfare loss from taxes called the excess burden of taxation the ex cess burden of taxati on is the difference between welfare gains from tr ade with and without taxes68 such welfare loss could be reflected in higher discount rate the weightedaverage method the weighted average method recognizes that project may divert re sources from consumption and from alternative investments if the resources were not used for federa l project for example the public could spend the money or the money could be invested in the private sector since the social rate of time preference and the opportunity cost of capital may yield diffe rent discount rates the weighted average method uses discount rate that combines the pretax return on investment and the aftertax savings techniques specifica lly this method defines the social discount rate as the weighted69 average of the srtp which is often computed as the posttax savings rate of return and the occ typically computed as the pretax return on private investment70 so it faces the same critiques as both methods the shadow price of capital in addition to the other three methods the omb and some economists prefer third pproach to discounting known as the shadow price however the shadow price of capital approach is rarely used to examine federal projects because it has stringent information requirements it also generates different discount rates for each project depending on how the project affects future consumption and investment for more information on how to compute the shadow price of capital see faa or boscolo et al71 history of the discount rate used by the corps unlike most federal agencies72 the corps and three other water resource agencies conduct water project evaluations using di scount rate dictated by specific planning guidelines rather

the benefitcost ratio adopting longerterm rate would decrease the rate and increase the benefitcost ratio real dollars and nominal discount rate the current discount rate policy for federal water projects contains significant inconsistency the corps governing documents guide it to calculate benefits and costs in real dollars 83 but to use nominal discount rate84 generally real discount rate is used to discount real dollars or nominal discount rate is used to disc ount nominal dollars either combination will result in the same present va lue and benefit cost ratio on the other hand mixing real and nominal figures as the corps does will alter present value calculations and the benefitcost ratio to illustrate the problem with mixing real values and nominal rates consider the previous example b illustrated in figure 3 in this example long run benefits were shown in real dollars benefits 400 and were discounted using real discount rate of 6 at real discount rate of 6 discounted longr benefits equaled 40010650 or 2172 when nominal discount rate is used to discount nominal dollars the result is similar using the same figures from figure 3 and an expected inflation rate of 2 the nominal discount rate would be 8 ie real discount rate expected rate of inflation the minal value of 400 in 50 years would be 40010250 or 107664 as shown in figure 5 discounting the nominal value of 107664 with nominal discount rate 8 resu lts in value similar to the result found when discounting real dollars w ith real discount rate however mixing real and nominal figure s overstates or unders tates the discounted present value when the corps discounts 400 real dollars using nominal discount rate of 8 it understates the projects discount ed present value 9 instead of 23 by removing inflation from the dollar value nd not from the discount rate given the temporal distribution of benefits and costs for many corps projects ie nearterm costs and longterm benefits this practice

rate that most closely follows the social rate of time preference srtp approach to discounting85 however many economists view the srtp as only secondbest approach because it assumes that resources are diverted from consumption and does not acknowledge that some resources ma be diverted from investment86 furthermore the water project rate lags behind the longt erm treasury rate may not reflect current borrowing rates and is used to discount r eal dollars an arguably inappropriate method given these issues it may be useful to compare the rate used for federal water projects with few of the many possible alternative rates the real discount rate as described above th corps currently discounts real dollars using nominal di scount rate specifically the pg stipulates that benefits and costs be measured in real dollars but th discount rate formula established in the water resources development act of 1974 re sults in nominal rate one way to remedy this problem would be to transform the nominal water project rate into realhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31976crs23 87alternatively change to the pg could allow projects benefits and costs to be measured in nominal dollars to go with the nominal discount rate s tipulated by wrda 74 88 this rate is an approximation because an accurate real discount rate would use expected inflation rate for the time period in ques tion rather than

act of 1936 promoted the construction of federal water projects for which the benefits are expected to exceed the costs while this general concept is straight forward applying benefitcost analysis faces both conceptual and practical challenges these challenges stem from the fact that benefitcost analysis is neither fully comprehensive nor an exact method for evaluating the welfare tradeoffs project could gene rate particularly nvironmental and social tradeoffs for example the process is limited by the choice of which benefits and costs to include in the analysis for federal water projects the pg stipulate that the corps analysis include all increases and decreases to national economic development ned the analysis is also limited by measurement techniques because th benefitcost ratio only includes benefits and costs that are meas ured in dollars continuing challenge for benefitcost analysis is accurately mone tizing nonmarket values such as projects environmental and social effects therefor project assessments are often based on limited set of factors that are clearly measur able in dollar terms while ignoring factors that cannot be readily quantified in dollars another controversial component of benefitcost analysis for federal water projects and the focus of this report is the discount rate this rate is used to place present value on the monetized economic environmental and social be nefits or costs that will accrue to future generations it can be contentious because different rates lead to different conclusions about project desirability and because there is indisputably correct discount rate rega rdless of debates on the disc ount rates theoretical and formulaic foundation it is the size of the disc ount rate that affects the corps benefitcost analyses since most water projects have large upfront construction costs and more distant benefits lower discount rate will lead to more pr ojects passing the benefitcost hurdle however the corps does not choos its discount rate rather the corps discount rate is based on statutory fo rmula established by the water resource development act of 1974 publ 93251 therefore supporters and opponents of federal water projects look to changing the di scount rate formula as way to affect the number and type of proposed projects there are many theoretical approaches to discounting the discount rate currently used to evaluate federal wa ter projects is based on form ula for measuring the return on savings however there are many theoretical alternatives to using the return on savings for example some economists sugge st that the discount rate be derived from rates of return in the private sector th omb recommends such rate for evaluating most federal projects in general the gove rnment borrowing rate tends to be lower than the rate of return in the private sector therefore changing the water project discount rate to rate of return in the private sector would likely decrease the number of projects that currently pass the benefitcost ratio test even if the theoretical approach to di scounting were not contentious formulaic decisions still lead to disputes the water pr oject discount rate is nominal interest rate estimated from average rates of return on longterm treasury bonds one of the main differences between this and other rates used to discount real futu re costs and benefits is that it has not been adjusted for inflation ie it is nominal rather than real rate according to economists the use of minal rate to discount real dollars is conceptually incorrect rather economists ar gue for using real rate to discount realhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31976crs26 95 real discount rates are lower than nominal rates so long as there is inflationdollars an inflationadjusted discount ra calculated using s imilar longterm treasury bonds would generally be lower than the rate currently used by the corps and thus would likely increase the number of projects th at would pass the bene fitcost ratio test95 however changing the formula to create real water project rate would not end the debate rather the corps di scount rate is based on numbe r of formulaic choices for example the formula directs the corps to use treasury rate rather than market rate pretax rate rather than posttax rate an average rather than marginal rate of return yield rate rather than coupon rate and rate based on secur ities with 15 or more years remaining to maturity changing any of these elements would also affect the size of the discount rate consequently am ong both supporters nd opponents of corps water projects any proposed change in the discount rate is likely to generate considerable debate
