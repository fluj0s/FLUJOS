from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to myles allen mallen1physicsoxacuk subject re re tyndall proposal date wed dec 12 092929 2001 at 0003 121201 you wrote hi tim and phil im afraid i missed their deadline im presenting at the royal society meeting on ipcc tomorrow and that had to take priority if simon is interested enough to bend some rules quietly i could certainly get him an outline proposal by friday but if not itll have to wait until their next call its frustrating but it cant be helped nerc just have too many calls as simon points out the tyndall centres style may be more topdown regulatory approach anyway and good luck to them politically negotiated emission targets may work but i have to confess to having doubts perhaps i have spent too much time talking to dick lindzen to believe in central planning any more myles by simon do you mean simon shackley i dont think hed be able to bend the rules since the proposals have to go direct to the tyndall centres administrator as you say they are being more directive is that word in what they want this time round and since your idea isnt central to what they think they want i doubt whether theyd be prepared to bend the rules hope the roy soc goes well i hear theyre charging 100 quid to listen to you bargain tim
