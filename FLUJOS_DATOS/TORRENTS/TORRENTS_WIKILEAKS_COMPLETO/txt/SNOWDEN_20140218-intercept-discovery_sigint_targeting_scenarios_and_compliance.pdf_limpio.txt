fingerprints when using fingerprints that strongly suggest malicious activity what defeats are needed if any nocogc response fingerprints are okay to task on if there is 51 confidence that it is foreign malicious method and other information contradicts that theory you may task with defeats otherwise defeats or other selectors are required to minimize potential usfveys hackers querying may be made to prove us origin of hacking activity there must be evidenceinformation that suggest it is foreign source 001 edit tssirel known foreign malicious actor are any defeats needed when querying against known foreign malicious actor defeats are needed when it is known foreign malicious actor source 002 noc response if the foreign ip is consistently associated with malicious cyber activity against the us so tied to foreign individual or organization known to direct malicious activity our way then there is need to defeat any to from or about us persons this is based on the description that one end of the communication would always be this suspect foreign ip and so therefore any us person communicant would be incidental to the foreign intelligence task in fact you would very likely see us person in the to as victim of spearphishing or other campaigns or as from for beaconing or exfiltration activity if however you believe there is circumstance where the task will give you us persons at both ends then ive misunderstood the description and would need more information source 003 ogc response ogc agrees please note that any usp collection obtained via targeting the selector will constitute incidental collection and any usp information would need to be minimized per ussid 18 also please be aware that any targeting of foreign selector solely for the purpose of obtaining usp comms constitute improper reverse targeting source 003 edit tssirel twoway fveys defeat is it freeforall when using twoway fveys defeat nocogc response yes problem source 001 as clarification thoughquerying on known usfveys selector even with defeats will still be reported as violation example querying on us persons name email address ip address etc even though you would receive 0 resultsyou still targeted us person edit tssirel unknowingly targeting us person i screwed upthe selector had strong indication of being foreign but it turned out to be usnow what nocogc response with all querying if you discover it actually is us then it must be submitted and go in the ogc quarterly reportbut its nothing to worry about source 001 edit tssirel potential for usus comms im still worried about selector in which i dont have 100 confidence of its foreignness95 confident for the sake of argument but i dont want to miss out on potential communication by using fveys defeat what happens if my selector ends up being us and i potentially get us to us comms nocogc response the sigint system does not have the capability to collect usus comms source 001 edit tssirel targeting an unregistered uri while reversing piece of malware that came into niprnet we come across callback to an unregistered uri we do not know foreignness nor server location it will eventually resolve to what are our options in tasking that selector nocogc response if there is information to suggest it is legitimate us used site assume foreign if at all possible use selectors to just focus on activity ie specific url or file name if you discover it actually is us then it must be submitted and go into ogcs quarterly reportbut its nothing to worry about source 001 edit tssirel randomly generated uris we frequently run across randomly generated uri in malware dns lookups get request etc given that the randoms indicates obfuscation and obfuscation many times indicates malicious intentwhat are our targeting options nocogc response random looking uris can be treated as malicious unless there is contradictory information otherwise same applies to the foreignness of said uriassume foreignness unless there is contradictory information otherwise source 001 edit tssirel querying against us systems many foreign actors utilize us based serversservices for things like facebook gmail twitter etc if we know foreign actors screenamelogin for said us service can we query for related traffic tofrom the said us server nocogc response if they are foreign target using the account from foreign location then it may be fine but if youre actually having to target the twitter server more broadly then probably not nsa may target via eo 12333 dni selector which is confirmed foreign source 003 okay to use xks microplugins for example that query against facebook gmail twitter etc if screenameusername is believed to be foreign this is sticky though if you guess foreign and its not then it is serious violation try to minimize to post for example to filter out nonpertinent comms source 001 noc response yes you may task that domain if it was established for and used only by the foreign target believed to be operating from an overseas location if there is any possibility that others had previously established or could currently be using the domain then your task must include an and that defeats any known us person use of the site and limits the task to only the communications that would be generated by the foreign targeted group via that domain so if there is an entry port or protocol unique to the group that would be an appropriate and once tasked if the collection reveals activity by us persons that is not simply incidental to the foreign intelligence task than additional defeats must be implemented if there is foreign intelligence activity as expected you would have to detask source 003 even though xyzcommuncation in chicago may own the equipment foreign actor may be leasing space what is the determining factor for foreign noc response i dont know the full realm of possibilities here but you must have either intelligence law enforcement commercial or open source information denoting that the establishment and use of that webspace is by the foreign target source 003 ogc response ogc agrees however it is essential that the topi be able to establish the foreignness of the webspace and that the defeats are sufficient to prevent any overcollect source 003 since we can do the above what proof would we need of the leaser being foreignjust the domain registration info from open source noc response if the registration information is explicit enough to link to your foreign target this should be adequate otherwise youll need additional corroborating information source 003 ogc response ogc agrees source 003 edit tssirel targeting foreign members of group is it okay to target the foreign actors of loosely coupled group of hackerssuch as with anonymous for instance anonymous has branch in brazil india germany etc can we target those individuals nocogc response as long as they are foreign individuals outside of the us and do not hold dual citizenshipthen you are okay source 001 edit tssirel malicious foreign actor disseminator of us data can we treat foreign server who stores or potentially disseminates leaked or stolen us data on its server as malicious foreign actor for the purpose of targeting with defeats examples wikileaks thepiratebayorg etc nocogc response let us get back to you source 001 edit tssirel storing leaked us data on government systems can we store leaked information such as from the hacker group anonymous on government systems for the purpose of analyzing the data for clues as to the method of the breach nocogc response if its dodmil and not classified data its okay otherwise source 001 need followup what about gov data edit tssirel querying on foreign ips obtained from home if we run across foreign malicious actors at home spam email routerids logs torrent sites etc can we bring those ips here and use the sigint system to monitor these guys nocogc response it might be okay but wait for confirmation source 001 edit tssirel foreign servers in which us persons might be using is it okay to query against foreign server known to be malicious even if there is possibility that us persons could be using it as well example thepiratebayorg nocogc response okay to go after foreign servers which us people use also with defeats but try to minimize to post only for example to filter out nonpertinent information source 001 edit tssirel us server being used for foreign malware callback in some instances foreign malware has know us server as its callback if we are fairly confident that the uri pointing to the said us server is operated by foreign actor can we query for that traffic nocogc response if you are more than 50 confident that it is foreign origin okay also minimize any potential us legit comms also use uri as selector not ip as server may host multiple domains some of which could be us domains if you discover that you are wrong in lessor of said server then it must be submitted and go into ogcs quarterly report source 001 edit tssirel tracking foreign actors bouncing through us proxies when an actor isposting to thepiratebayorg foreign web serverthrough multiple proxied hops are we allowed to backtrace that communication even if it hops through us based proxies in other words backtrace the post from thepiratebayorg to chinese base proxy which came through us based proxy which came through another us based proxy which came through russian based proxy etc noc response assuming you mean via sigint metadata then spcmatrained analysts would be able to use spcmaenabled tools to chain otherwise source 003 url redacted ogc response ogc agrees with the above discussion regarding metadata source 003 note v252 has now been given the authority to gain spcma accesstools analyst should obtain spcma training and download the appropriate spcma enabled tool in order to achieve the goal in the question stated above put link to page here can we task xkssigint for communication between 2 us ip addresses if we know the ports associated with proxy running between them being used for malicious foreign activity noc response if you know the ports associated with the proxy youre targeting are only used for that purpose then you can target the ip addresses and the ports to only return the malicious foreign activity being conducted via those ip addresses source 003 ogc response however ogc will need further clarification before signing off on targeting 2 us ip addresses source 003 since we can do the above what level of effort and justification would we provide to filter out us communication could we simply use 4tuple the two us ip address on either end along with the port numbers that the proxy is running over with justification that it was being used by foreign power at that moment in time noc response if the 4tuple task already effectively limits the collection to the foreign intelligence target than yes but if your tasking could also result in domestic collection us to us then additional defeats or tasking parameters are necessary perhaps adding time frame to limit collection to that moment in time when you expect the activity to occur source 003 ogc response ogc agrees and defers to sv regarding the specific filtering requirements source 003 edit tssirel password us person does password correspond to us person if list of mil passwords were released to thepiratebayorgcan we go back into xks sigint using custom created fingerprint to search for traffic containing that password in foreign traffic just before the release noc response normally password would not be considered equivalent to us person since it is not necessarily unique to any one individual but in this case we will have an equivalency record as will the public so i am not sure of the legality from that standpoint but more importantly the tasking of the passwords in this case is consistent with the sigint consensual collection package signed by cmdr uscybercom and dirnsa appropriate to both of his hats refer to this document for full context 0 source 003 ogc response ogc agrees source 003 url redacted edit tssirel botnet on us box foreign actor if we have evidence that malicious activity is originating from an us ip via foreign controlled botnet can we target that ip using the botnets port number thus filtering out any us citizen communication noc response yes you would only be collecting the foreign targets use of the us ip in this case with the appropriate filters cands source 003 ogc response again it is critical that foreignness is established and that there is effective filtering source 003 edit tssirel definition of malicious activity in reference to the many queastions above please define malicious activity malware server cc node responsible for attacks against us system site containing us persons passwords and other confidential data site containing mil passwordsdata etc noc response the djpmaintained cyber lexicon does not define malicious activity so will have to table that for now but the activity youve described clearly constitutes security threat to national security systems ogc response ogc agrees edit ssirel using sigint system for defensive means example can we query xkssigint using dod ip address as the selector to look for foreign targets unanswered at this point edit ssirel spcma query against us selector ssirel when querying with spcma enabled tool ie synapse workbench against us selector ie an ip address what are url redacted some scenarios that would be considered foreign intelligence purposes based upon the link i we can query the said us selector regardless of the known or unknown foreignness of the communicants is this scenario where we are able to querychain through comms but must simply detask if it is revealed to be us origin ssirel example we have an us ip hitting the niprnet with an attack that attack could very well have foreign actor behind it utilizing that us box as last hop but it could just as easily be us person hitting uswe have idea can we assume it is foreign actor until we have evidence to the contrary if chaining back through the link utilizing spcma tool reveals us source as opposed to foreign do we simply detask or would that incidental targeting of us person need to be reported to you guys as well noc response ssirel if spcma analysis reveals us actor behind an intrusion then per spcma guidance existing rules for collection and dissemination of us person information are unchanged by the supplemental procedures therefore you would detask the us actor if previously tasked vs incidentally discovered and this would be reportable incident however if not previously tasked the discovery of this us person would be incidental to legitimate foreign intelligence task and therefore discovery via authorized spcma chaining is not an incident source 005 edit tssirel querying on case notation xkssigint queries being made with case notation as the selector there are two scenarios 1 an xks query being made with only one or more case notations and time range typically in days and always exceeding 2 hours being used as selectors 2 query being made with case notation selector and minimal amount of effort to narrow down the querysuch as looking for executables only see example 2 below in neither case are there any sort of fveys defeats timeframe limitations such as 2 hour window nor malicious fingerprints being used and in case it mattersthese are typically cyberquest personal at remote field sites whose tasking includes survey work such as characterizing links for possible sigint value if blackpearl shows the case notationlink to be foreign saudi arabia denmark etc is that justification enough to query on that case notation alone with other defeats noc response for the purpose of characterization activity the queries are supportable given the confirmation from blackpearl that the case notations are foreign case notation is also considered strong selector and any additional limiters would be more to restrict the volume of the return than anything else although not recommended for sustained collection but are fine for survey purposes consistent with the mission being worked by the cyberquest personnel source 004 edit udfouo other guidance to review if your answer is not on this
