streamlining the process as whole doj and ftc enforce the generally applicable antitrust laws these laws prevent transactions that would substantially impede competition and can require premerger

port of hr 6 would repeal puhca the following summarizes the act as it currently exists puhca regulates holding companies which have subsidiaries that are electric utility companies or that are engaged in the retail distribution of natural gas or manufactured gas the act defines holding company as any company which directly owns controls or holds with power to vote 10 per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of publicutility company or of company which is holding company by virtue of this clause or clause b of this paragraph unless the commission securities and exchange

imposed in this chapter upon holding companies11 under puhca all holding companies which have subsidiaries that are engaged in the electric utility business or in the re tail distribution of natural or manufactured gas must register with the sec if they engage in interstate commerce12 several kinds of holding companies are exempt under the act from the registration and regulation requirements these exemptions include 1 predominantly intrastate holding company which substantially carries on its business in the state in which it and all of its subsidiaries ar organized and derives materi

the items required by the registration statement are the charter or artic of incorporation by laws rights of the different classes of secur ities underwriting arrangements under which the securities have been offered directors and officers material contracts balance sheets and profit and loss statements14 however puhca goes beyond the di sclosuretype requirements of the securities act of 193315 and the securities exchange act of 193416 puhca also places substantive requirements upon the opera tions of registered holding company holding companies not exempt from puhca registration have two other requirementsgeographical integra tion and corporate simplification17 the geographical integration requirement provides that holding company is limited to single integrated electric or gas utility system and other businesses which are reasonably incidental or economically necessary or appropria to the operations of the integrated public utility system the sec will permit registered holding company to continue to control one or more additional public utility systems if it finds that each of the additional systems ca nnot be operated as an independent system without the loss of substan tial economies the additional systems are located in one state in adjoining states or in c ontiguous foreign country and the continued combination of the systems is not so large as to impair the advantages of localized management efficient operation or the effec tiveness of regulation18 corporate simplification under puhca re quires the elimination of corporate structures or companies which unduly or unnecessarily complicate the structure of holding company system or which unfai rly or inequitably distribute the voting power among security holders of holding company system further

should not be changed23 puhca was originally enacted in the wake of the stock market collapse of 1929 to deal with abuses stemming from consolidated ownership of utility and nonutility interests24 supporters of repeal have argued that the conditions that originally necessitated puhcas enactment longer exist in the current market and that even if they should arise again state and other federal

consumer rate protection state interest and regulatory efficiency points of view 42 in addition unlike the antitrust agencies under ferc review the burden of proving consistenc with the merger guidelines falls upon the regulated entities43 debate over the extent to which ferc s hould continue to review electric utility mergers has accounted for portion of th controversy surrounding the new energy legislation44 proponents of fercs continuing ro in merger review cite the agencys expertise in the field and its specialized review focus based upon public interest standard proponents also argue that until the market has been competitive for sufficiently long time the antitrus t agencies will be poorly equipped to accurately gauge participants market power45 those opposed to fercs

abilities of ferc and the antitrust agencies to address adequately the issue of market power in restructured electric power industry which may have important consequences in future deregulated electric utility industry has been noted by doj there is concept of fault monopolization in antitrust law th mere fact that an entity is particular size is by itself of antitrust significance the antitr ust agencies may not therefore order the divestiture restructuring of any entity deemed to be too big unless that entity has achieved or is maintaining its monopoly positi on by virtue of something violative of the antitrust laws the antitrust divi sion has expressed some thoughts on its inability to challenge market structure in the electric utility industry and possible means of addressing that concern in other words to whatever extent restructured electric power markets are too highly concentrated to yield pricing at or near competitive levels the antitrust laws provide remedy to address these kinds of structural problems some states have encouraged or required divestiture as part of their restructuring efforts and these divestiture efforts have progressed substantially in support and furthera nce of such efforts the antitrust division suggested in testimony before the house judiciary committee last june that congress might want to l ook into providing authority to order divestiture in any federal restructuring legislation such authority if conferred would presumably go to the federal electric regulatory commission55 the current bill would not directly affect either of the antitrust statutes it may however anticipate alterations to the curre nt scheme of merger review section 1291 would require ferc the secretary of ener gy and the attorney general to conduct study of whether ferc merger review authority under section 203 of the federal power act is duplicative of authorities vested in other agencies of federal and state government56
