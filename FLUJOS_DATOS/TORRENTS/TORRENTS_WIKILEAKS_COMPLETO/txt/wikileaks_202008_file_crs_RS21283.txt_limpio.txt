homeland security intelligence support richard best jr specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21283 legislation establishing department of homeland security dhs pl 107296 included provisions for an information analysis element within the new department it did not transfer to dhs existing government intelligence and law enforcement agencies but envisioned an analytical office utilizing the products of other agencies both unevaluated information and finished reports to provide warning of terrorist attacks assessments of vulnerability and recommendations for remedial actions at federal state and local levels and by the private sector in january 2003 the administration announced its intention to establish new terrorist threat integration center ttic to undertake many of the tasks envisioned for the dhs informational analysis element known as information analysis and infrastructure protection iaip but some members of congress argue that ttic cannot be substitute for dhs analytical effort this report examines different approaches to improving the information analysis function and the sharing of information among federal agencies it will be updated as circumstances warrant introduction better intelligence is held by many observers to be crucial factor in preventing terrorist attacks concerns have been expressed that single agency or office in the federal government prior to september 11 2001 was in position to connect the dots between diffuse bits of information that might have provided clues to the planned attacks testimony before the two intelligence committees joint inquiry on the september 11 attacks indicated that significant information in the possession of intelligence and law enforcement agencies was not fully shared with other agencies and that intelligence on potential terrorist threats against the united states was not fully exploited for many years the sharing of intelligence and law enforcement information was circumscribed by administrative policies and statutory prohibitions beginning in the congressional research service the library of congress crs2 early 1990s however much effort has gone into improving interagency coordination1 after the september 11 attacks number of statutory obstacles were addressed by the usapatriot act of 2001 and other legislation2 nevertheless there had been one place where the analytical effort is centered the department of homeland security dhs was designed to remedy that perceived deficiency as is the terrorist threat integration center announced by the president in his january 2003 state of the union address background the homeland security act pl 107296 signed on november 25 2002 established within dhs directorate for information analysis and infrastructure protection iaip headed by an under secretary for information analysis and infrastructure protection appointed by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate with an assistant secretary of information analysis appointed by the president the legislation especially the information analysis section seeks to promote close ties between intelligence analysts and those responsible for assessing vulnerabilities of key us infrastructure the bill envisions an intelligence entity focused on receiving and analyzing information3 from other government agencies and using it to provide httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21283 warning of terrorist attacks on the homeland to other federal agencies and to state and local officials and for addressing vulnerabilities that terrorists could exploit dhs is not intended to duplicate the collection effort of intelligence agencies it will not have its own agents satellites or signals intercept sites major intelligence agencies are not transferred to the dhs although some dhs elements including customs and the coast guard will continue to collect information that is crucial to analyzing terrorist threats the legislation establishing dhs envisioned an information analysis element with the responsibility for acquiring and reviewing information from the agencies of the intelligence community from law enforcement agencies state and local government agencies and unclassified publicly available information known as open source information or osint from books periodicals pamphlets the internet media etc the legislation is explicit that except as otherwise directed by the president the secretary of dhs shall have such access as the secretary considers necessary to all information including reports assessments analyses and unevaluated intelligence relating to threats of terrorism against the united states and to other areas of responsibility assigned by the secretary and to all information concerning infrastructures or other vulnerabilities of the 1 for background on this issue see crs report rl30252 intelligence and law enforcement countering transnational threats to the us by richard best jr 2 see crs report rl31377 the usa patriot act legal analysis by charles doyle and crs report rl30465 the foreign intelligence surveillance act an overview of the statutory framework by elizabeth bazan 3 some writers distinguish between information and intelligence the former being unanalyzed information the latter being the result of analysis in practice however the terms are often used interchangeably and the distinction will not be observed in this report crs3 united states to terrorism whether or not such information has been analyzed that may be collected possessed or prepared by any agency of the federal government4 dhs analysts are charged with using this information to identify and assess the nature and scope of terrorist threats producing comprehensive vulnerability assessments of key resources and infrastructure identifying priorities for protective and support measures by dhs by other agencies of the federal government state and local government agencies and authorities the private sector and other entities they are to disseminate information to assist in the deterrence prevention preemption of or response to terrorist attacks against the us the intelligence element is also charged with recommending measures necessary for protecting key resources and critical infrastructure in coordination with other federal agencies dhs is responsible for ensuring that any material received is protected from unauthorized disclosure and handled and used only for the performance of official duties this provision addresses concern that sensitive personal information made available to dhs analysts could be misused as is the case for other federal agencies that handle classified materials intelligence information is to be transmitted retained and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21283 disseminated in accordance with policies established under the authority of the director of central intelligence dci to protect intelligence sources and methods and similar authorities of the attorney general concerning sensitive law enforcement information5 concerns about dhs intelligence despite enactment of the homeland security act it is clear that significant concerns persisted within the executive branch about the new departments ability to analyze intelligence and law enforcement information media accounts suggest that these concerns center on dhs status as new and untested agency and the potential risks involved in forwarding raw intelligence to the dhs intelligence component6 another concern is that new entity rather than longestablished intelligence and law enforcement agencies would be relied on to produce allsource intelligence relating to the most serious threats facing the country 4 section 202a1 the language provides for presidential exception that might arise because of particularly sensitive information some observers also argue that under any circumstances the president has constitutional authority to control the dissemination of intelligence information 5 the dcis authority for protecting intelligence sources and methods is set forth in 50 usc 403 3c6the attorney generals authorities for safeguarding law enforcement information are diffuse see eg 18 usc 2511 interception and disclosure of wire oral or electronic communications prohibited exceptions 18 usc 2517 authorization for disclosure and use of intercepted wire oral or electronic communications 21 usc 190e public disclosure of significant foreign narcotics traffickers and required reports exclusions of certain information 6 see dan eggen and john mintz homeland security wont have diet of raw intelligence rules being drafted to preclude interagency conflict washington post december 6 2002 p a43 crs4 dhs role in the intelligence community the us intelligence community consists of the central intelligence agency cia and some 14 other agencies7 it provides information in various forms to the white house and other federal agencies as well as to congress in addition law enforcement agencies such as the federal bureau of investigation fbi also collect information for use in the federal government8 within the intelligence community priorities for collection and to some extent for analysis are established by the dci9 based in practice on interagency discussions being at the table when priorities are discussed it is widely believed helps ensure equitable allocations of limited collection resources the homeland security act makes the dhs information analysis element member of the intelligence community thus giving dhs formal role when intelligence collection and analysis priorities are being addressed dhs officials have indicated that the new department is actively participating in the process of setting priorities the question of raw intelligence there has been discussion in the media whether dhs will have access to raw intelligence or only to finished analytical products but these reports may reflect uncertainty regarding the definition of raw httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21283 intelligence satellite photograph standing by itself might be considered raw data but it would be useless unless something were known about where and when it was taken thus satellite imagery supplied to dhs would under almost any circumstances have to include some analysis the same would apply to signals intercepts reports from human agents present special challenges some assessment of the reliability of the source would have to be provided but information that would identify specific individual is normally retained within very small circle of intelligence officials so as to reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosure and harm to the source the issue of the extent and nature of information forwarded to dhs has proved to be difficult reviewing copies of summary reports prepared by existing agencies is seen by some observers as inadequate for the task of putting together meaningful picture of terrorist capabilities and intentions and providing timely warning on the other hand there is need to ensure that dhs would not be inundated with vast quantities of data and that highly sensitive information is not given wider dissemination than absolutely necessary analytical quality the key test for homeland security will of course be the quality of the analytical product whether terrorist groups can be identified and timely warning given of plans for attacks on the us critical need exists for trained personnel the types of information that have to be analyzed come from disparate sources and require variety of analytical skills that are not in plentiful supply academic institutions prepare significant numbers of linguists and area specialists but training in the inner workings of clandestine terrorist entities is less often undertaken analysts with law enforcement backgrounds may not be attuned to the foreign environments from which 7 defined by 50 usc 401a4 8 28 usc 533 provides information collecting authority to the justice department and the fbi 9 50 usc 4033c2 crs5 terrorist groups emerge in july 2003 dhs had only some 53 analysts and liaison officials with plans to increase this number to about 15010 the terrorist threat integration center president bush in his state of the union address delivered on january 28 2003 called for the establishment of new terrorist threat integration center ttic that would merge and analyze all threat information in single location under the direction of the dci according to administration spokesmen ttic will eventually encompass cias counterterrorist center ctc and the fbis counterterrorism division along with elements of other agencies including dod and dhs ttics stated responsibilities are to integrate terroristrelated information collected domestically and abroad and to provide terrorist threat assessments for our national leadership11 on may 1 2003 ttic began operations at cia headquarters under the leadership of john brennan who had previously served as the cias deputy executive director by july 2003 it consisted of some 100 analysts and liaison officials with plans to increase to 300 by may 200412 ttic appears to be designed to assume at least some of the functions intended for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21283 dhs information analysis division representative cox chairman of the select committee on homeland security has welcomed the establishment of ttic while noting that the establishment of the center in way reduces the statutory obligations of the department of homeland security to build its own analytic capability13 making the dci responsible for ttic will facilitate its ability to use highly sensitive classified information and ttic can expand upon the relationships that have evolved in the ctc that was established in cias operations directorate in the mid1980s according to testimony by administration officials to the senate government affairs committee on february 26 2003 ttic will in effect function as an information analysis center for dhs and dhs will require smaller number of analysts with less extensive responsibilities subsequent administration testimony indicates that dhs will receive much of the same intelligence data from other agencies and will undertake analysis key distinction is that dhs is not responsible for information relating to threats to us interests overseas14 in fy2004 funds were appropriated for 206 intelligence analysts in iaip the administration requested 225 for fy2005 some observers express concern that the dcis role in the ttic responsibility for the analysis of domestically collected information and for maintaining an uptodate database of known and suspected terrorists that will be accessible to federal and non 10 testimony of bill parrish acting assistant secretary for information analysis dhs before joint hearing of the house judiciary and select

testimony of bill parrish july 22 2003 crs6 federal officials and entities15 may run counter to the statutory provision that excludes the cia from law enforcement or internal security functions16 there are also questions about transferring the fbis counterterrorism division to the dci some express concern about how the ttic under the dci will coordinate with state and local officials and with private industry as contemplated in provisions of the housepassed version of the fy2004 intelligence authorization bill hr 2417 the relationship between dhs and ttic is also continuing concern to members of congress some may consider modifications of the homeland security act that could affect the analytical efforts of dhs17 section 359 of the intelligence authorization act for fy2004 pl 108177 requires that the president report on the operations of iaip and ttic by may 1 2004 the report which is to be unclassified with the option of classified annex asks for delineation of the responsibilities of iaip and ttic and an assessment of whether areas of overlap if any represent an inefficient utilization of resources the president is asked to explain the basis for the establishment and operation of the center ttic as joint venture of participating agencies rather than as an element of the directorate iaip the report is also to assess the practical impact if any of the operations of the center ttic on individual liberties and privacy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21283 conclusion legislation creating homeland security department recognized the crucial importance of intelligence it proposed an analytical office within dhs that would draw upon the information gathering resources of other government agencies and of the private sector it envisioned the dhs information analysis entity working closely with other dhs offices other federal agencies state and local officials and the private sector to devise strategies to protect us vulnerabilities and to provide warning of specific attacks the administration appears to prefer modification to the approach originally envisioned in the legislation that created dhs ttic under the direction of the dci will provide the integrative analytical effort that the drafters of homeland security legislation and others in congress have felt to be essential in light of breakdowns in communication that occurred prior to september 11 2001 whether ttic is consistent with the intent of congress in passing the homeland security act and whether it is ultimately the best place for the integrative effort is current matter of discussion in congress regardless of where the integrative effort is ultimately located the task will remain fundamentally the same pulling together vast amounts of data from wide variety of sources concerning terrorist groups analyzing them and reporting threat warnings in time to prevent attacks is and will remain daunting challenge 15 ibid 16 50 usc 4033d1 17 william new cox plans
