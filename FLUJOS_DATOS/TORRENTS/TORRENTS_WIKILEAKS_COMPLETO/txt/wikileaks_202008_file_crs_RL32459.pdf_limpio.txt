profitable and growing with over 12 billion in commercia l transactions taking place between the two countries every day of the year each country has an increasingly large stake in the health and openness of the others economy france is the 9th largest merchandise trading partner for the united states and the united states is frances largest trading partner outside the european union more than half of bilateral trade occu rs in major industries such as aerospace pharmaceuticals medical and scientific equipment electrical machinery and plastics where both countries export and import similar products the united states and france also have large and growing trade in services such as tourism education finance insurance and other professional services in recent years france has been the sixth larg est market for us exports of services although trade in goods and services recei ve most of the attention in terms of the commercial relationship foreign direct investment and the activities of foreign affiliates can be viewed as the backbone of the commercial relationship the scale of sales of usowned companies operatin g in france and frenchowned companies operating in the

france most us trade and investment transactions with france dominated by multinational companies are noncontroversial neverthe less three prominent issues agriculture government intervention in corporate activity and the war in iraq have contributed periodically to increased bilateral tensions the most pointed perhaps arose in early 2003 with reports of us consumer boycotts of french goods and calls from some members of congress for trade retaliation against france and germany due to foreign policy differences over the iraq war the foreign policy dispute however appears not to have had much impact on sales of products such as french wines perfumes and toiletries travel goods and handbags and cheeses that are most prone to being boycotted while some public opinion polls at the time suggested support for economic boycotts as way of expressing opposition to frances position on iraq an economic backlash appears not to have materialized eff ective boycotts would jeopardize thousands

over 75 of the civilian workforce is employed in services and less than 3 in agriculture1 at the same time the state still plays rger role in the economy of france than in the united states this is particularly true in the provision of services such as education and health care but also in energy telecommunications and transport where stateowned companies play promin ent role policies geared to supporting national champions in leading sectors to influencing mergers involving french companies to screening foreign investments in strategic sectors to sustaining network of personal re

in 2006 38 billion or 62 of bilateral trade occurred in major industries such as aerospace pharmaceuticals medical and scientific equipment electrical machinery and plastics where both countries ex port and import similar products see tables c and d in the appendix many of these products are components or capital goods used in the production of finished goods in both the united states and france furthermore due to large amounts of fore ign direct investment across both sides of the atlantic much of this intraindustry trade takes place as trade between parent companies and their affiliates socalled intrafirm trade this kind of trade where large multinational companies such as michelin and general electric trade between their affiliates has accounted for around 50 of total trade turnover in recent years3 the overwhelming role that both intraindustry and intrafirm trade play in merchandise trade tends to limit targets of any potential trade retaliation this is because restrictions placed on most of these traded items would adversely affect domestic production as well as employment of the country imposing the restriction the united states and france also have large and growing trade in services such as tourism education finance insu rance and other prof essional services as shown in table 2 the us exported 138 billion in services to france in 2006 and imported 148 billion

france as member of the european union adopts the same trade policy as other members of the eu9 by sharing common tariff and nontariff policies with other eu members and by adopting euwide regulations and standards there are few trade disputes that can be considered u sfrench bilateral di sagreements per most us trade and investment with france dominated by multinational companies and intrafirm trade is non controversial ne vertheless three prominent issues agriculture government intervention in corporate activity and the war in iraq have contributed to increased bilateral tensions in recent years agriculture agricultural trade disputes hi storically have been the major sticking point in usfrance commercial relations although the agricultural sector accounts for declining percentage of out put and employment in both countries it has produced disproportionate amount of tr ade tensions between the two sides as trade as well as agriculture is under th jurisdiction of the european commission the problems of course are not technically bilateral in nature from the us perspective the restrictive trade regime set up by the common agricultural policy cap has been the main problem it has been longstanding us contention that the cap is the largest single distortion of global agricultural trade american farmers and policymakers have complained over the years that ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32459crs6 10 trademark protection for geogra phic indications is also an issue of great importance for italy parma ham and parmesan cheese gre ece feta cheese hungary tokay wine and portugal porto wine denmar k italy and germany are other eu countries taking the lead on limits on research and use of gm crops nd most all eu members strongly support the ban on the importation of beef treated with hormones for further discussion of these disputes see crs report rs21569 geographical indications and wto negotiations by charles hanrahan and crs report rs21556 agricultural biotechnology the useu dispute by charles hanrahan sales and profits are adversely affected by 1 eu restrictions on market access that have protected the european market for european farmers by 2 eu export subsidies that have deflated us sales to third markets and by 3 eu domestic income support programs th at have kept noncompe titive european farmers in business from an eu and french perspective the cap has been substantially reformed in recent years and cannot be characterized as the largest source of distortions in agricultural trade on the contrary under this view there is ample evidence that eu as well as australian new zealand and canadian farm exports have been hampered by us food aid policies in some veloping countries frances agricultural sector which in terms of output and land is the largest in europe has long been the biggest benefici ary of the cap over the past several years french farmers have received bout 20 to 25 of cap outlays that have averaged around 40 billion acting to tinue benefits and subsidies for its farmers the french position which is sh ared by many other eu members can determine the limits and parameters of the european commissions negotiating flexibility on range of agricultural issues that are of keen interest to the united states the most prominent and perhaps important example relates to current efforts to get the wto doha round of multilatera l trade negotiations back on track by reducing agricultural subsidies and other barriers to market access other examples where the french position backed by many other eu members arguably has made settlement of disputes more difficult include expanded trademark protection for wines cheeses and other food products li nked to specific regions and ban on the importation of beef tr eated with hormones10 government intervention in corporate activity despite significant reform and privatization over the past 15 years the french government continues to play larger role in influencing corpor ate activity than does the us government this difference is manifested not only in the french governments continuing direct control of key companies and its support of national champions but also in its continuing proclivity to influence mergers involving french firms president sarkozy in number of ways has continued to support this policy tr adition nevertheless although bilateral disputes may be more prone to occur because of the french governments interventionist and regulatory tendencies the dictates of eu laws as well as the urgent need to raise the revenue s through privatization efforts and to enact marketoriented reforms are weakening the french dirigiste tradition in 1997 the then socialist government re started process of privatization and opening of governmentcontrolled firms to pr ivate investment that had begun in the 1980s and the program was continued by the centerright government that took power in 2 002 in 2 003 and 2004 the

from 545 renault to 156 from 260 and thomson to 20 from 208 the government still has stakes in bull and sa fran and in 1280 other firms while the trend has been to privatize many large companies fully or partially the government still maintains strong presence in sector s such as power public transport and defense11 despite its ongoing privatization program the french government continues to promote national champions and economic patriotism concept that has been used to justify opposition to foreign takeovers of french firms this tendency has been apparent in an effort by the governme nt to strengthen french takeover law and parallel effort to scrutinize sensitive foreign investments more closely in the summer of 2005 the government orchestr ated quick merger of two utilities publicly traded suez sa french utility and statecontrolled gaz france gdf to fend off potential takeover by enel of it aly president sarkozy is now exploring ways to create national champions in ot her industries such as nuclear power and defense such mergers would involve areva the stateowned nuclear group and other french companies plus the huge defenseaerospace companies thales and safran12 at the same time that sarkozy is suppor ting interventionist policies designed to enhance frances economic and industrial strength he is also promoting market oriented domestic reforms on issues such as taxation and labor markets in this context president sarkozy views increased competition as way to get frances overregulated economy on track for stronger growth13 iraq war in the era of the cold war there was considerable concern that trade disputes between allies coul d undermine political and security ties deep differences over the iraq war between the united states and many of its allies particularly france and germany reversed this cold war c oncern into whether foreign policy disputes can weaken or undermine strong commercial ties specific concerns that divisions over iraq could spill over into the trade arena arose in early 2003 with reports of us c onsumer boycotts of french goods and calls from some us lawmakers for trade reta liation against france and germany the spike in bilateral tensions and hard feelings however appears not to have had much impact on sales of the products such as wines perfumes handbags and cheeses most prone to being boycotted14 as shown in table 5 us imports of all four of these french products increased in absolute terms from 2003 to 2007 moreover the french share of us total imports of these products has increased for cheese andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32459crs8 15 french wines have experienced longterm declining share of total us imports in 1998 french wines accounted for 4705 of total us imports in 2000 4 234 and in 2002 3512 curd stayed the same for perfumes and tr avel goods and declined only for wines but the decline in market share for wines from 35 in 2003 to 316 in 2007 started well before the iraq war15 it also should be pointed out that because the euro grew substantially weaker during this 20032007 time frame us demand for these products had to remain strong although there are few signs that goods and services clearly identified with france or the united states are being boy cotted some polls have found evidence of public support among some segments of the us population for expressing opposition to foreign policy disagreements in the shopping malls nevertheless substantial economic backlash appears unlikely because of the high degree of economic integration effective boycotts w ould jeopardize
