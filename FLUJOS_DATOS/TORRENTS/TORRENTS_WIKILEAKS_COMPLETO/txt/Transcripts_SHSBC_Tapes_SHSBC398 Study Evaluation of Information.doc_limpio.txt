study evaluation of information lecture given on 11 august 1964 im sorry to keep you waiting today we were testing out the walkie talkies we will not use on london airport imagine using walkietalkies on london airport you know with the radio control tower we have rig up so that we can handle photographic flash lamps at distance with little walkietalkievery tricky and were getting very cunning and thei can just hear it now though impact pictures coming in for landing on the north runway what is our aperture please very funny the difference between professional and amateur photography is chasm wide and you have to go at it in particular wild ways on the professional front it requires permission of nobody less than the ministry of aviation and that sort of thing in order to move practically in the vicinity of aircraft in england and so on have to produce credentials you know like deck of cards and all that sort of thing so forth the ministry has granted us permission to go up and shoot the incoming landing of hypothetical student you see so that all of your views of the airport and what you saw of england and so forth thats what im going up and shoot in two or three weeks just for fun so those snapshots you took that didnt come out i can give you some copies thats snide you know im showing you the proper scientology attitude toward learning or beginning scientologist you see all right whats the date audience august 11th august the 11th ad 14 saint hill special briefing course okay and were going to resume our lectures on the subject of study and the more i talk about study the better your grades get and so this is very fine this is one of the most successful lines of lectures i think ive ever engaged uponmost productive of catacataclysmic and colossal resultsreally fabulous so that i have not sweat throughyou take the sodium bichloride and you put it into the bichromate and you get bisulfite because it precipitates negatives you know and so on i remind you that about late spring i decided to study study and find out what study was all about and so on and go on along this particular lineand talking about study your grades keep going up the more i talk about study well thats very interesting because im not restimulating you study doesnt happen to be an end word there is an end word however called knowledge and this will bang your head off occasionally but it is not directly connected with words and so forth and isnt the basic reason why people have any difficulty at all with study all right there is particular reason then that knowledge should get in your road because the casus belli as the hootch dancer said is very very deepseated thing called words now you may even think there is an end word called words or something of the sort but of course all gpms are composed of words theyre actually not composed of english words theyre composed of significances which are connected to masses these masses are very capable of pushing somebodys ead off and where you have precise significancesand its quite interesting how precise these significances arewhere you have very precise significances you dont get too much upset in other words dont look at it the other way to dont look at it on the basis that if you avoid end words hundred percent you will make it see thats actually the incorrect look its the locks which do you in the offbeats do you see now you really shouldnt be terribly concerned ofabout this as scientologist the electrician gets used to handling 10000 volts the circus performer thinks that its quite nothing to pat lions on the nosei call to your attention that the public at large look at an electrician handling some voltage lines or something like that and theyre horrified see and you look at lion trainer in cagethey hate to be called lion tamers because those lions are never tame tame lion is the last thing you want around you see so they want good savage lions patting those on the nose and so forth the public looks and they say aaghhh but as matter of fact they would feel rather uncomfortable if they didnt have some big cats around to snap whips at you know i mean the lion trainer would this is the life he lives and the public at large not being initiated into this of course is horrified and properly stunned by the lion trainers association with the big cats in the cage clyde beatty for instance used to fight forty lions and tigers simultaneously mixed and i should imagine that he lay off of that for few days why he would have felt very very poor you know he would have felt bored and life would have seemed uninteresting to him now there are many other professions and many other activities and so forth you wonder how in the name of god dentist can stand there pulling teeth day after day after day after day fantastic but he can you wonder how surgeon can stand there cutting out guts and throwing the offal in the garbage can hour after hour you see year after year how come what are all these things well these things are what is known as professional familiarities and if you get familiar enough with particular subject it may look terribly dangerous and upsetting to somebody else but is not really dangerous or upsetting to you this is quite remarkable in any particular field or activity one is apt to become quite superhuman that is whats being demanded of you in scientology im not talking about whether you get better or whether you become clear or ot or anything else im just talking on very downtoearth rockbottom sort of an approach gpm words are the lions the high voltage the various other professional danger points with which you live in scientology the words the words of the gpms and that sort of thing now you take these words and you go out and throw them in the teeth of the public out here see you can actually watch somebody turn green if you stood and chanted at him root connection of some kind or another just wove it into your conversation four or five places and so forth kept telling him that he ishe just wants to be wrong you see he wants to wrong things and so forth just keep going at it you know youwrong this and wrong that and keep pounding it into him and all of sudden hell start yeahahah well he goeswalks out someplace and falls on his headtrue and hes liable to get quite ill and that sort of thing all right well hes just not used to lions do you see he couldnt even trace it back to why he feels so ill he knows nothing about this well this is rather happy area to be professional in because life isconsists of livingness and livingness has lot to do with the mind in fact there wouldnt even be anything here to live in or any living to do unless mind was around you see so the businessthe business of being in the business of the mind and so forth has liabilities but it has of course great many things that are very good and when you start fooling around with gpms you know very well you can knock your head off you know very well that this is not something to lightly fool with you know very well what they can do to somebody you see somebody around on crutches gimping around hes got arthritisarthritis exclamation point you see and so on whats the matter with him well hes just all wound up in gpm someplace thats really all that is wrong with him if eveneven if its an engram why its held in place with gpm thats the way he lives thats whats going on with all right why is this couple having an awful hard time maritally well theyve just got couple of end words crossed up one way or the other one is riding one hobby horse and one is riding the other one you know and that sort of thing well if you tried to explain it to them that it was an end word that was doing this sort of thingyou could probably slip it off of them on meter if you didnt try to explain it to them thiswell just lets take couple of hypothetical end words lets say that he was conservative you see and she had an end word wild now these two end words wont mix and they are both in highblown howl you see on this subject so hes being conservative and shes being wild all right never the twain shall meet so the upshot is that theyre going to lead very unhappy life now you could probably without their ever finding anything out about it really pick up that it was conservative on the meter probably get his considerations about being conservative have this end word blow you could take ahold of her you could probably pick up wild on the meter particularly if you had the total prearranged list of end words you could probably key it out get her considerations on this and so forth theyd walk out of there perfectly happy with each other and miracle would have been performed they would never be able to trace it even back to word their ability to recognize what has happened to themeven that is far below their familiarity level they have familiarity with this thing you see youve heard people go around and say well it doesnt matter sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never oh yeah now the liabilitythe professional liability of the scientologistis the fact that hes dealing with significances and hes dealing with masses and you connect the right or slightly wrong mass with the right or slightly wrong significance and you get this mismatched one way or the other and you get catastrophe and thats the way lifeshe is lived and you want to know about what is human behavior what are the basicselements of existence what makes matter stay here the conphysicist out there he is busy studying conservation of matteror conservation of energy ratherhes busy studying conservation of energyconservation of energy he is just going on with this on with this on with this oh hes just riding an end word man and hes riding himself into the ground sooner or laterwhy hes going to strike to kill all energy or something of this sort andas his interpretation of gpm and build an atom bombsomething like this hes got to do something you see in this particular line he getshe becomes obsessed along the line there are gpms that have to do with pictures i am very well aware of the fact that theres whole series of gpms that i havent run that have to do with pictures and since i became aware of this they dont have anything to do with skull you know they dont knock my head off at all once in while i find myself studying something and they have said pictures about five or six times too many in the paragraph and i find i have tiny headache begin to grow on and i say oh look at the paragraph oh you know gone thethisthis situation then that could have wrecked empiresone end word crosswise you see could have wrecked an empireto you becomes minor discomfort you find you have bellyache and yousomething like thisand youve been processing somebody or doing somethingyou find that you have bit of stomachache and you wonder whatwhats the stomachache you know afterwards you notice you got stomachache you suddenly realize youve been invalidating an end word thats the quickest way in the world to get yourself stomachache you think maybe there is an end word women well now if you invalidate that youre probably all right because there isnt one gpms predate the idea of men and women but there is one bodies and supposing youve got one bodies dont you see and you invalidate the idea of bodies well youre going to have yourself nice stomachache you say there is end word bodies when there is an end word bodies and of course about that timeit sometimes takes minutes or even half an hour or two for this to begin to sneak up on you what was going on what was going on you say to yourself well lets see about half an hour ago i was studying about bodies i said they didnt exist tuhhuh well i now know there is one end word anyway called bodies total reaction somebody elses reaction oh my god call doctor cutwin ohhh ive got to have an operation on esophagus or stomach or something of the sort ive got to have something drastic done to because look how drasticin what drastic condition i am in dont you see and an incomprehensibility way down below any level of knowingness on this thing they become the total effect of these things for instance we just upset numerous scientologists down in australia because we had to fight back against the laborite party the laborite party was the one who proposed the bill to outlaw scientology in the state of victoria so i decided that they had lived too long and they dont come to the inquiry very much anymore they as matter of fact found out that scientologists could cause them to come within an ace of losing all the seats they had i wrote out little pamphlet and ive carefully put in it the exact proper end words this was circulatedthis was circulatedthey came within an ace of losing their lives in this election and that was it but of course some scientologists down there who were afraid to shoot at somebody and who werent in the know and so forth continued to write on my standing order number 1 line that was terrible thing to do they didnt know anything about the end word that wassee they are not trained up to thisnot oriented in this area yet that was terrible thing to do because you really shouldnt put entheta you see on theta line like nice scientology magazine and its alland theyre sort of protesting you know that this pamphlet that came out and was generally issued in australia against the laborite partywas issued at all they dont realize what theyre protesting against some of those end words hit them they arent trained they arent in the know and so of course it made them feel kind of queasy and they want to know who wrote it well i havent told them yet i wrote it but it produced the exact effect that it was supposed to produce which to drive those dogs back in their kennels and it did exactly that they are much less enthusiastic these days as matter of fact they are becoming sorrier and sorrier that they ever started this inquiry and that is the proper effect to produce on somebody who is attacking you is just make them very very sorry that they attack you thats the proper way to handle it in this universe see united states government is getting into that frame of mind now on the emeter case see they are beginning to sit around and wonder why in the name of god they ever lost their wits to such degree as to start this thing in the first place because they cant prepare ease because none of their facts are correct and their charges are all wrong and theyre silly but if they let this ease go to court they let themselves in for recovery of damages that may run into the millions theyre now in trouble well how do you make people in trouble well you just make them sorry they done it thats all now the psychiatrist and psychologist and so forth are very busy in the world today on the field of motivational research what they call motivational research very interesting subject i recommend to every scientologist and particularly people who are engaged in promotion activities somethingin organizations to read book called hidden persuaders now that is very interesting book although it tries to make mock of the idea of hidden persuaders and so forth down in between the lines it gives you very thorough dissertation on the techniques now being used by modern advertising agencies and other people engaged in reaching the public and they hire these days psychiatrists and so forth to do motivational research and find out bunch of goofy facts well most of their facts are goofy because they dont know why people are they dont know what make people tick and that sort of thing but if scientologist reads that particularly saint hiller and particularly somebody who is moving around in the vicinity of class vi see he reads thatnow just reinterpret that whole thing theyve laid foundation theyve got beautiful piece of music theyve got words to the music dont you see theyve got marvelous idea that maybe they can influence and affect people one way or the other but they dont know what words to put to the tune theyre still groping around in their freudian analysis and trying to motivate soap by getting libido complex going on the age of three see theyre trying to restimulate something one way or the other in order to sell their soap and they havent got the buttons let put it this way you see theyre playing piano without any keys theyre still making noise on it i dont know how theyre managing it but one way or the other theyre making noise on it now actually that is one of the highest paid activities in the world todayis the world of advertising and merchandising that is the highone of the highest paid activities in the world today they are pouring out terrific avalanche of money into the pockets of psychiatrists and so forth these days in order to find out what makes people tick of course theyre not on basicreally basic research theyre still flying around in kindergarten stuff dont you see but here these fellows are trying to reach the public trying to sell products and so forth and they have turned to the psychiatrist and psychologist in order to give them the answers well they turned the wrong way and like any other boot soldier in an awkward squad why theyll probably get booted for it they lose money on this every once in while and they make mistakes but you start adding that upif you really know the mindand you wonder then that anybody would ever have any difficulty with dissemination now this material of course is debasedi mean this type of use is debased use of this information it would debase your knowledge of the field of the mind just to use it to sell somebody some preserved piglets or something see this is silly see this is something like using mercedes ear to crack walnuts this situation then is notnot recommended to you as an activity im simply pointing out some minor activity thats going on in the world today that is absorbing great deal of money from the manufacturersthat has bangtremendous bang from each magazine you turn on the tv set you are looking at motivational research you turnopen magazine youre looking at motivational research you open up newspaper and read its ads youre looking at motivational research you can look at an election you realize those candidates in that election are running by motivational research as matter of fact eisenhower won the campaign in the united states when he was elected president because of the work of an advertising agency in the field of motivational research and they found that the country was starved for father image so they set him up for father image and of course he got elected actually he was pretty good father image if fathers do nothing but read western stories but they set this boy up in that fashion now thats the way the world is moving now if you want to knowif you want to know how to live calmly in the midst of tremendous confusion all you really have to know is the answersthe basic answers and if you know the basic answers these things ninety percent of the time dont worry you and the other ten percent of the time you can do something about them do you follow knowledge is something that is achievedend word or end wordit is something achieved through study now the whole subject of words boobytraps persons effort to find out whats going on to find out what the world consists of wordsits boobytrapped line significance what is this how do you find out about anything well youre going to find out something about something these days with words information is going to be relayed with words youre going to find out about things with words and those words are boobytrapped they match up the gpmsthe woof and warp of the mind theyve got the mind pushbuttoned now the mind is terrifically pushbuttoned so that if you are reading the cat was black and feel queer or feel repelled by this statement the cat is black if you dont know what youre doing you simply are repelled by the subject of studying eats or of studying or acquiring knowledge about cats or anything of that sort of thing see in other words youve got barriered line because you read the statement the cat is black you feel odd therefore you say i mustnt study about cats see actually it has nothing to do with cats its the word black happens to be an end word you nearly always find yourself assigning to the wrong part of sentence or the wrong part of the study material the reason why you cant study it because the other is something one isnt confronting and one doesnt feel he can confront so therefore he disperses and confronts something else now that is the basic principle you should know about knowledge and study one that even if you are simply looking at tree to find out something about the tree you are studying tree i dont care how briefly this is done study isnt something being used here in connection with being very very thoughtful and thorough and so forth you look over this tree to see what kind of tree it is well in that brief instance youve studied the tree dont you see in other words you observed it to find something else out about it now you can pick up observation from the printed page thats secondhand observation but it nevertheless is the route on which almost all knowledge travels since if you individually were called upon to reevolve all the knowledge there was from the beginning of the world until now all by your little ol lonesome youd wind up stupid in this lifetime i dont mean to be harsh thats true if you were called upon personally and individually to evolve all knowledge there was about anything in one lifetime you would get so little way upon that routeyou understand thats without having any other person relay anything to you without having at your fingertips any works texts any reference books of any kind that you were just going to have to do it all on your little ol lonesome by thinking it up and evolving it and so forth and you were going to evolve all the knowledge and you werent going to have any receipt of information from any other secondhand observation in other words you want to learn about volcanoes well you have to go and find volcano you would get so little done on this project that you would die stupid i can assure you of that or you would be ruddy fool and believe that you knew everything there was to know about the one room that you had been in that whole lifetime do you follow so there is value to secondhand knowledge now firsthand knowledge of course is acquired by direct observation and experience but even to achieve direct observation and experience it is really much better to have the fruits of other observations and experience with which to profit and only in that way can you maintain and carry forward culture of any magnitude illiterate cultures do not survive and they are not very high the natives of the tribe of the buggabugga boogaboogas down in lower buggawugga boogawoog are mostly longer with us or they are around waving red flags today and revolting against their central government theyre having bad time well the british tommy that went down there with his snider or his leeenfield and brought them higher education in the first placewas only occasionally followed by anybody who taught them anything and they didnt learn fast their literacy was not up to absorbing culture rapidly so of course they can be victimized by anybody who comes along once the line is open if literacy doesnt follow and if secondhand observation is not available to people they stultify they die they go to pieces they degrade they are struck by this tremendous volume of exterior culture theyve been very happily down amongst the bongbong trees you know dancing up and down amongst the bongbong trees and the highest level of their interest and so forth was their own back yard they could tell you all about bongbong trees and they could tell you all about you mustnt step in bugbug bushes because you step on thumpthump snake and this was their direct observation the second theyre hit with thingsparticularly the abstract ideas of organizationthe abstract ideas of political philosophythe abstract ideas of really engineeringthings of this material nature where knowledge is moving in close to the mest you see where the significance is immediately directly applicable to the manipulation of matterwhen they move in on that of course their culture fails they are not able to turn out leeenfield rifles they are not able to organize themselves into proper democratic civilization matter how many lendlease payments are thrust into the paws of their greedy politicians they can be victimized they can be turned into slaves and they can be degraded whats happened well theyve been overwhelmed and presented with this tremendous cultural image heres this great shiny civilization you see its full of cadillac cars and jet planes and electric razors and all kinds of wild things and they look at this material animated world they see people have conquered their environment to the point where they can live at leisure and where they can do various things and where some girl canwith few push buttons can control 125 horses as the most usual thing that she ever did in her life you understand in other words she can drive car all right all of these miracles all of sudden hit these illiterate fellows see all these things they dont know the words see they see the tune but they cant sing it and they go into just overwhelmboom they just cave right in see they just back right up somebody who is fully trained in moscow has also been trained your brethren at home are pretty uneducated and if you push this button and that button and that button they will respond and all of sudden bring down the house and then we will be able to seize the whole place and get all the jute we need i mean the ethical and spiritual nature of communism is very interesting you know theyre out of jute so they put their political mechanisms intorun to get them some jute their interest in south africa is simply and entirely the fact that they need diamonds and they want gold i mean its very spiritual they love mankind for what they can get out of him and the way they play their violin is just about as coldblooded as anybody ever did see but its mainly based on the fact that people dont know the words and you look at communist array of vocabulary you look at communist vocabulary its very interesting vocabulary its very tricky their technologytheir political technologyis worked out to one of the finest hair splits you ever heard of boy they know how to talk to this one they know how to talk to that one and they know how to argue with somebody else and they know how to put together this and they know the parliamentary control of small meeting and theyre taught to do this and theyre taught to do that and they know how to shuffle the motion down to the bottom of the pile so it never gets heard and only the motion which they want heard is heard theyre just taught this very carefully you see technologytechnologytheyre all taught this with words they werent in on the 1917 revolution they got the whole technology right straight on up the line by being taught it by it being relayed to them with words much as im relaying to you information and ideas with words but its all secondhand its all hearsay and for those boys it really works they are taking the world i see people standing around with their hands in their pockets in these western governments and so forth not knowing what is going on and its something like big strong bull being chewed to pieces by pack of small dogs and this bullhe knows that small dog cant do anything to him and so hes tried to ignore himhe tries to go onhe tries to do this the next thing you know hes going to be down with his throat cut well he doesnt understand what theyre up to and hes above knowing something like this you see all kinds of attitudes mix into this hes deficient in knowledge of communist technology so therefore he is being defeated by communist technology its very very interesting that this technology is relayed by word of mouth its taught its not by direct observation but its material that can be put into direct observation by the communisttrained communist here and there the world today is being overwhelmed on the basis of illiteracy the illiterate people of the world are being overwhelmed its always this see its the fellow who doesnt know its those who do not understand its those who havent got it taped who get knocked into the wastebasket the death of civilization is based upon its accumulated not understandingsnotknowingsits ignoringsits failure to grasp the situation it can also drift back into too many yesterdays clichés like well the barbarians always come down on the northern frontier and go home at harvest time you know and one time they didnt go home at harvest time and that was the end of rome see rome at that time was illiterate on the subject of illiteracy the barbarian they didnt realize that their people had become very effete part of their information was missing that people who wishes to be free must not just know about the latest wine theyve got to know pretty well across the boards about most everything in sight theyve got to keep on the ball theyve got to keep on the qui vive theyve got to be right up there and alert the day that marks your death is the day that you sit back and decide you know everything there is to know about everything there is around you so there is reason for you to observe anything anymore now between the two points then of observation necessary because i know everything you see and observation possible because i dont know any of the words there is mean which makes life livable you get what these two extremes are now one is i know there is everything to know i know everything there is to knowi neednt observe anything i neednt really experience or do or look at anything because i know all there is to know now that would be the end product of dying civilization or dying individual and on the other extreme we have the dont know any of the words dont know anything dont understand anything thats happening in my vicinity and so forth and thats very fast route to death demise and decay see so the thing to do is to know the words and to stay alert thats the motto one reads out of this thing and youll find out theres always some new technology being boiled up someplace well be curious enough to find out about it see stay alert never become complacent about what you know and youll go right on surviving very nicely now this is particularly true of somebody who gets up to point of eminence or prominence somebody who moves up to point where he is superior to the ordinary or more average individual in his vicinityhe tends to become very complacent fellow is living in the vicinity of the natives of uggabugga and he can read and they cant well he feels very superior so he really doesnt even bother to read do you see now if scientology faces any danger it is that danger of stultifying because they longer believe they have to observe longer have to apply longer have to get on the ball now you want to know whats the difference between the successful individual and the unsuccessful individual it is just that one can understand and do and the other one doesnt understand or doesnt there are two ways of not understanding as ive just told you one is to suppose you know all about it so you dont have to observe thats one method of not understanding and the other is just not know the words you see those two extremes are there so the individual doesnt understand and he goes off into ain other words he doesnt understand so he quits tryingor he understands all there is he thinks and so doesnt bother to observe now those two actions there amalgamate into fellow whoeither one of themwho is going to fail this individual is going to go by the boards now who wont go by the boards then well its somebody who can observe and understand and doa person who can observe and understand and do now in view of the fact that the greatest body of observation is actually secondhand observation realize that that is perfectly valid observation when coupled with understandingbut that is particularly and peculiarly liable to having to be understood now the less direct the observation then the greater the understanding has to be in other words your understanding has to increase to the degree that youre not directly observing understanding has to increase in the degree that the observation is indirect if your observation of tree is indirect youd better jolly well understand about that tree pretty confounded well as matter of fact much better oddly enough than if you were standing there looking at it now understanding then is substitute for mass and you have the answer to understanding in arc understanding adds up to arc in study understanding is substitute for mass now lets go over that again if you havent got tree to observe and you are being told about tree then youd better jolly well understand what youre being told otherwise youre going to misobserve the tree now if you dont understand what you are being told about the tree or you dont understand how the information is being relayed to you about the tree you will wind up not understanding tree and have been denied that mass because the information received on via do you follow this this is very complex material im giving you here but is quite useful if you cantif you havent got tree to look at then you jolly wellif you are trying to study about trees on second relay then you damn well better understand that second relay now there are two things to understand about what youre being told or what you are reading or what your secondhand observation is see secondhand observation can be after the fact because of time too you understand that you say there must have been tree here because here is stump you know and theres going to be tree here because here is sprout do you see that that your understanding also can go forward and backward in time and it can be direct or indirect in terms of view so understanding can be direct or indirect in terms of view you can be there looking at the tree or somebody can be telling you about the tree so theres twotheres actually several different understandings all in packet now thats not to our purpose right now to examine how many types and brands of understanding there are but im just warning you on this fact with regard to study and this is the only point im really trying to make to you the other is just window dressing and cake frosting its interesting the whole subject is very interesting but its this if you are not observing something directly if you are reading about treesyou got thatyoure not observing it directly then your understanding has to be superior to the understanding which would be required in direct observation youve got to be moreyouve got to understand it better otherwise youre going to lose yourself tree now this is quite interesting because the difficulties of secondhand information are innumerable youve got four men trying to describe an elephant four blindfolded men that have felt all over an elephant and theyre trying to describe this elephant or whatever that old saw was dont you see and the wise men that give you all the dope of what an elephant is all about you know and they didnt observe the elephant because they were blindfolded and they gave the most wild dissertations on what this elephant was so now lets realize that part of our understanding when we are engaged in secondhand observationwhich is to say study on via or somethingwe are engaged upon thisthen our understanding must include an evaluation of the reliability of the information we are being given you follow that our understanding must include the understanding of whether this is good dope or bad dope whether this is the straight data or this isgot adata with curve in other words we have to be capable of evaluating the truth of the relayed observation understanding then must include that and there is where the bulk of sentient beingsi wont just say man because there are other sentient beingsfall down and there is where they get crosswise there is where they really have time well ill give you marvelous example there are people walking all over the place today and so on and so on and they think that everything in the field of the mind is all cared for see when little child is three years old why he gothe got excited about something or other hes been sick and thats why hes in the insane asylum and doctors understand all about this and everybody understands it and so forth and yah yah yah the problems all eared for well were in that state of the civilization where they say theyre not only saying we know theyre also saying somebody else knows and we dont have to know heyhey whats this whatswhat kind of apathy is this we dont even have to know anymore its all right that somebody else someplace knows that there are some authorities someplace on this subject i quote eisenhower he always depended on having an authority the best source of information was always an authority on the subject and he never did anything withouthe consulted an authority and it went along with this that he didnt have to know blessed thing about anything there was never even communication signal corps unit to keep him advised on moments of national crisis or anything else when he was out playing golf or anything there was information lines ever run through this man he got his national policies out of newsweek he did hed gotten to point of where the expert was newspaper reporter well i admit newspaper reporters are pretty good and they all think that if left up to them they can straighten everything out in minute but it seems rather interesting to have newspaper reporter policy being the dominant policy of nation they might really be trying to sell soap you see it might be motivational research entering in here you know you couldnt really trust that piece of information so part of your understanding is what youre understandingthe falsity or correctness of your data sourcesor what youre trying to understand so study has as part of it comprehension of the accuracy of your source of information and youve got to have some idea of that and thats an experiential line itself you say well this fellow tells what he believes to be true and if he longer believes it to be true or if he finds something else is true why he will tell something like that you say all right well thats that source of information and thats good source of information theres this other source of information if he tells something why hes just confoundedly certain that hes got to shove it down my throat in some particular line it might be right and it might be wrong but he will continue to tell just because he has to be right something like this you see since ive just gotten through three textbooksthree textbooks written by professor at columbia university who never had color film in his hands in his life im sure who was writing on color photography i had to study these and i had to know my business i was going to be examined on this i shot more color film than this man ever heard of but here was case where i had to study something to get grade i understood that see i understood the fact that i had to study this in order to get grade you get the subtlety then of the study that went on also began to be understood this guy loved to show off he loved to show off he would introduce some ninetydollar word of technical nature which wasnt included in any dictionary into the middle of sentence where it didnt have to be oh boy if that doesnt throw you now right in the middle of that sentence youve got word like colored couplers he says i quote we are now going to introduce new term colored couplers which i will explain later he never explained it you look up in the photographic dictionary what is this thing colored coupler and you cant find it its not in there you look everywhere and you cant find it what are you supposed to do just lie down and die at this point your understanding has to embrace the fact that the silly ass didnt know what he was talking about if nobody can define it well maybe someplace somebodys going to define it but it includes you dont have to know what it is in order to continue now that is also very interesting thing to do because you go past one of these points of understanding and you know youre going to have trouble but part of study is to know the technology of study and to know if you start developing headache in the next half page its because you didnt understand that word do you understand in other words your understanding of understanding can get very subtle indeed you can get very very tricky you are reading about the engineering works of the early egyptians which have been written by modern engineer who is also lecturer at massachusetts institute of technology and should have been flunked for english he cant writemaybe he can build bridges but he cant write if hes teaching at mit he probably cant build bridges either but anyhow there he is and you want to learn something about the bridge building of the early egyptians see and this thing is strewn with words that have to do with stresses and strains of various kind and torsionalgahhh and then when he really wishes to be clear he all of sudden gives you four paragraphs of solid integral calculus without giving you what any of the letters hes using in the integral calculus refer to ive got book on color reproduction upstairs written by some englishman that did this its marvelous you get simultaneous equations of all things in calculus and this is supposed to explain something of course what i did was not worry about the fact that i didnt understand it i just laughed in his face via his textbook in other words i wasnt so obsessed on the line that i couldnt skip it and i was sufficiently informed on the subject of study that i knew if i ran into liability of having skipped it i knew what the liability would be see so i could go back and run it out if it got in my road in other words i could walk through this bunch of bayonets do you understand audience yeah well you could get that clever about study see all right well thats actually going to high school before you get to kindergarten really on the subject of study but im showing you about where it extends to you can get clever enough to read an mit lecturers dissertation in full panoply of engineering terms on the bridges of the ancient egyptians without actually looking up single blasted one of his confounded technical terms and survive right on to the end of the dissertation and what do you know know something about the bridges now youre clever the latest editions of the encyclopaedia britannica require this as fine art because all theyre doing is showing off to the people of the profession theyve been so criticized by landscape architects for their articles on landscape architecture that they now have written professional piece on landscape architecture nobody can understand it but landscape architect well landscape architect isnt ever going to look it up in the encyclopaedia britannica and that applies to nearly all of their very professional dissertations thats why i theyve changed their style the modern style is to become incomprehensible and to say somebody else knows about it and then try to impress it and leave it all skipped and then you know say well if youre not an expert youre nothingand there are experts around so were all perfectly its all kind of mishmashdecadence is what youre really looking at now i use an old 1890 edition you read about landscape architecture in the old 1890 edition and it knew it was written for some fool that didnt know their nomenclature see you can find out what you want to know but later editions you cant soon that 1890 edition will become so antique why it wont be of any use anymore and then i wont have any encyclopedia left see ill have to do something desperate by that time byi dont know substitute for it with some vast library of stuff ohoh yes i know quentins getting whole bunch of textbooks and ill keep collecting those ive just solved it hes getting all kinds of textbooks the boys book of electronics you know the boys book of something or other you open these things up its actually integral calculus made easy for 6yearolds you know actually theyre way over his head i dont know how anybody did that but he does all right with these things crazy business yes theyretheyve got penchant going that its all right to make it easy for children to understand it so i can collect childs library and ill be all set thats what ill do maybe the children cant understand it but i will be able to anyway sources of information all add up then to comprehensibility and words form the woof and warp of any professional or technical area specialized words are used for specialized observations now we move off into the field of specialized observations as specialist which is perfectly fine but where you are lightly tapping some field for just moments understanding and you collide with specialist vocabulary you are lost at once now it gives you an idea at once of the very unserious student of scientology one of the first things he does is complain about the nomenclature well frankly we have less nomenclature than were entitled to as specialized field because nobody understood anything about the mind how could they have any vocabulary about it and they didnt have any vocabulary about it and if wed used their lousy vocabulary we would have misunderstood everything because those words meant other things so actually this bird stands around and starts complaining about our vocabulary now we know at once that hes not serious student of scientology thats the first thing we know about this person hes not serious student of it hes dilettante he wants to hang around the edges and pick up few scraps you recognize the brute now he wants few scraps he really doesnt want it because youve got to sweat for nomenclature because the nomenclature is carrying with it specialized understanding and unless youve got that specialized understanding you will never get the technology now theres the difference between knowing about something and being pro theres vast difference and theres many chap today walking around who is pretending to know great deal about something who oddly enough isnt even vaguely educated in that particular field and so forth but its sort of thing to be sort of dilettantethats modern trend for instance whats medical doctor but dilettante in the field of the mind really very much so hes justhes superficialnobody the effrontery of them six hours of lecture they get up here on some hospital alongside of the thames as i have mentioned before and this is their entire education on the field of the mind but because they have general practitioners license it gives them carte blanche in the field of the mind it sounds crazy but it is true thats what it is so the society at large is nothas gotten so dispersed that it doesnt mind calling somebody an authority who doesnt know anything about it at all because that is the authority on the field of the mindhe was taught for six hours this is their skeleton in their closet by the way this is why they raised the devil with us for so many years about how well we were trained and so forth and we actuallyin any given week an academy student anywhere in the world was learning more about the mind in that week per hours of invested time than medical doctor got in his entire career in one week now the effrontery of these boobs in trying to tell us that we were untrained in the field of the mind and so forth we are not untrained in the field of the mind we are practically the only people who are trained in the field of the mind now there are other fields that are trained in the field of meat or neurones or something like this as in psychology or brain surgery or something but they are trained in the field of meat they are not trained in the field of the mind ill give them that they are specialists on meat all right somebody gets bullet in his skull and so forth they can probably do something about it well all right dontlets not though pretend because we can take bullet out of somebodys skull that we now know about the mind because in the first place it didnt go into his mindit went into his skull now this was slight difference you see in nomenclature now what im trying to bring home to you here is there are various grades at which subject can be approached you can approach it as dilettante oh well i know all about painting yes yes i had course in art appreciation in junior high school one whole semester and the teacher stood up and showed us pieces of lithography on piece of cardboard andi got so i could call rembrandt nearly every time i got very clever at art appreciation so i know great deal about art well that must have consisted of what one or two or three hours week for maybei dont knowwhats semester sixteen weeks something like that which made totalhe looked at pictures for fifty or sixty hours and now hes an art specialist well of course thats better than somebody out in the street that never heard of them not much but its better but it gives somebody the interesting idea that he now knows something about it when he doesnt know ruddy thing about it it gives him curious and very dangerous attitude to his own acknowledge it gives him false understanding he now thinks he knows something about it he knows the nomenclature of pictures he doesnt know anything about art hes never been taught anything about art nomenclature of pictures was what he would know it isnt really the amount of time invested that gives you this although ive been mentioning time it is more the seriousness with which it is approached how much do you want to know about this do you want to know enough about this so you can talk about it as would be very common on park avenue debutante dont you see she could discuss arthow cute at her comingout party if somebody happened to say you look like madonna why she would know they werent necessarily talking religion you see see art see all right now lets move little bit further into the field of art now how seriously do they wish to approach this subject do they wish to understand something about this subject so that they just wont appear to be dummy or do they want to understand enough about it so as to do something with it do they want to know how to use art to decorate home that is to say how do you choose and match and hang pictures andyou know what do you do with these pictures you know we could go not necessarily further in that direction but along another path guy wants to know about art because of the threatened inflation of the world see threatened inflation you can buy land and you canwhich isnt very movableand you can buy gold if you can get your hands on it and youre not an american citizen and it will grow in price as the money of the community inflates or you can buy art and art today is big business amongst people who know nothing about it as an artistic activity but as financial investment and you would be amazed how big this business is well does he want to know enough about art so that he knows whether or not the experts are cheating him thats how far that fellow would want to go see hed have to know enough about art to know who knew about art so that he couldnt be tripped up in the field of art otherwise hed lose his shirt you see or do you want to know enough about art to move over into the field and maybe teach people art appreciation lets go little bit further wed have to know little bit more about art wouldnt we now were getting the lower grade instructional levels or do we want to know enough about art so that maybe if we were very good we could sit down with piece of charcoal and piece of paper and draw vase with narcissus in it now we say weve started back at the beginning again because any kid in kindergarten is trying to draw vase with narcissus in it were back to the area of doingness ill call to your attention that that little kid in kindergarten almost never connects its wildly wonderful what comes up that is supposed to be vase and so forth but they have what is called an artistic talent or they have this or they have that and nothing is more easily destroyed because it isnt based on knowledge or understanding this knack will leave him it will fly out from underneath his fingers if he does happen to draw something very easy to trip him up thetan is very naturally creative but hes actually handling certain media that he doesnt know much about now you go into this again you take yourself up piece of black charcoal you take yourself white piece of paper and you set yourself down to draw vase now your education begins you know that if you change the position of your paper and the position of your head while you are doing that you have changed the proportion of the vase well now that takes some knowing doesnt it in other words if you look at vase close and then draw it for while youll be drawing big top let us say and then you sit back to relax and do the bottom and youve now got small bottom big top and small bottom and it doesnt look right but it looked all right to you well your education on the subject of art began at that point you old your ead still that something has to do with the point i view from and the distance i view to has something to do with what im doing over here on this sheet of paper yeah all right now you are heading for the long run and you actually at that moment have begun the path of becoming pro now even if you did it for fun you would still be on the path of becoming pro whats the next thing youre liable to learn on the thing well youre liable to learn that if you draw one for one its dead easy but if you try reduction or an increase in size that is if you draw size for size if you draw the vase on your piece of paper the same size as the vase you see on the table this is pretty lousy easy but how do you make one for one well you mustnt change the relationship of the paper or tablet to the table its easy as that you see now most people cant draw still lifes for very interesting technical reasons they are trying to do reduction they are trying to draw big vase while looking at little one or draw little vase while looking at big one and as they shift they swivel their eyeball from the big vase to the drawn vase they dont get one for one size see they look at big vase and try to do little vase and of course they cant get the proportion because the size is already wrong and this throws them they dont know the easy route out they dont know that my god that requires all kinds of wild mechanical and mathematical actions to take big vase and to do little miniature vase of this bigoh man now you are getting creak creak see ah dead easy you set vase over there and you get your paper here and you getso the paper looks now the same size as the vaseand you take out your charcoal and you draw the vase lines which you see there the same size as you see here you keep your ead where it belongs and you keep your tablet where it belongs and you keep your vase where it belongs and you go scroompscroomp put in couple of highlights scroomp and if youre not shaking with palsy you will wind up with nice sketch of vase im just showing you theres these little pieces of technology dont you see well youre now on the route to being pro so you might say that study which winds up only in understanding is not without value and is large part of the cultural pattern which society has study with activity let put it that way you dont intend to do anything about it youre not going to do anything about it thats just cute thats interesting isnt that nice tremendous quantity of the culture in which you live is understood to that degree and its nice to know those thingsif youve got to know lot of those things for instance you dont know how tohave to know how to prepare or do the action of preparing an automobile in order to know about automobiles see but you jolly well better know something about the action of repairing automobiles before you start paying somebody to repair the automobiles in other words youre at point of regulated doingness dont you see your understanding of it is sufficient so that you wont get gypped buying mona lisa because joe just bought it yesterday see now thereforetherefore your understandingwidely in life can embrace great many things which you never intend to do theres nothing wrong with that but dont make habit of that see dont make habit of that if youre going down some line go down some line see dont stand around for instance dont let some studentlet talk about scientology for minutedont let somebody who walks into your pe and so forth keep standing around the edges of it youll find out theyll go hold meetings and they will talk endlessly about scientology see they couldnt define an engram if you held pistol on them but theyll talk endlessly about scientology see in fact there are groups all over the place that do practthat do nothing else they never audit they never go into action of any kind whatsoever their command of the subject is merely an interest now this is perfectly all right perfectly all right but dont leave them in state of believing that they now know the subject that would be the cruel thing to do to them they dont they dont and they get confused to the degree that they think now if they do soandso and suchandsuch why then this somehow or another fixes them all up so they know all about it now its at that point that persons education starts to break down because these people have dropped into what trap its just that one trap they know all about it see so life can go on well they dont know all about it they dont know your level of understanding of it my god youve been grinding away at it and slamming away at it and delving in it and getting comprehensions of it and so forth and you know how much there is there to know man this character is saying well i so on well if you followed through some of his logic you would be fascinated see if you followed through some of his think and some of his statements and some of his doingnesses on this subject if he did do anything on this subject you would practically cave in with laughter at times because its so far away from anything you could imagine anybody interpreting anything like that as its just gone proposition somebody will say well i settled the dog and i was using scientology processing and so forth you know i beat him how the hell did we get over there see its that goofy but to let that person go on believing now that he knows all about it so therefore does not have to address it directly and seriously in order to achieve any doingness level in it would be very very cruel thing to do to this person because hed just have nothing but failure heres this broad subject which is there which if he did it at all properly would give him results and he could go someplace and he could do something with this do you see but to have him sit there and think he knows all about it when he doesnt know anything about it of course is letting him fall into this other category also to put him in the position where he thinks he cant know anything about it because its so vast and so difficult andalso is equally cruel because youve artificially created the two reasons for the demise of an individual or civilization youve put him into state of he is not only illiterate but he is going to go right on being illiterate well of course only specialist could know that and so forth and i dont see why youre asking for the definition of word like that because it really doesnt apply to what you are doing anyway this is all pretty difficult you know i never follow such an approach some guyif some guy comes up and asks hostilely about something or other i cant guarantee what hell get back imit all depends on how i felt right at that moment if i felt puckish about it hes liable to go off packing headache but if heif somebody asked and they really want to know somethingof course you know mei tell them bang like that the best i could even though i didnt have any hope of their really understanding what i was talking about i would still give them anything i could tell them that i hope might assist their information or understanding of it i always do something for them this way and usually if somebodys just asking for information why i let it go at that but if theyre asking for help and so forth i always give them something to do not only give them piece of information or an insight into it if i possibly can but i always give them something to do too you know and youd be surprised how workable this type of an approach is of course if they ask you something hostilely or be nasty or something like that why just pull the trap you know i dont care what you do to them nobody demands of you that you be polite dont compromise your own communication lines the only time i ever get embarrassed or anybody get embarrassed is this person was asking silly question which sounded like hostile question but they really meant it and they were quite serious about it and then you find yourself immediately in the position of having been very nasty and very mean back dont you see when they didnt intend to be you sometimes can get that one crossed up thats rather easy to do but doingness requires of course much much much more understanding than just lookingness doingness requires an awful lot of added understanding and when you go into doing subject it is sometimes very very disappointing your first resultsvery disappointing your understanding wasnt up to match the doingness that you were doing you see and so forth and what you learn out of this iswhat you should learn out of this is that you should understand more about it in order to do it you see thats the lesson you should learn and the lesson you shouldnt learn out of it is its just too difficult but on some subject lines there is another lesson you could learn is that it never worked anyway oddly enough i dont think that is applicable except in the upper levels of supereducation and in the upper levels of supereducation theyve got lot of stuff that doesnt work but is just hoped for you know which theyre putting straight across the line it was never intended to workit leads to final result at all i mean that sounds rather peculiar but it is true its like doing the equations of aircraft propellersor buggy whips about the same category today propeller aircraft and the buggy whipwith integral calculus and painfully sketching out all of the various contours and curvatures of aircraft propeller blades or buggy whip curvatures with integral calculus why would you do such stupid thing why for instance learn the tremendous complications of some very esoteric activity on doingness basis which hasnt been used for three centuries just to do it well it sometimes doesnt work at all sometimes nobody ever did it that must enter into your calculations too when youre going up at that level of thing maybe nobody ever did it see maybe its too tough maybe it isnt too toughmaybe it just isnt see maybe there is integral calculus curve to buggy whip you know i mean you can go that far that silly about it you see this sort of thing is all part of your understanding of the subject of study where are you going with this study but if youre going up the line with any study on basis of doingness you should go up the line on basis of gradients and my first lecture to you on this subject had to do with gradients and you will find the first time the individuals doingness caved in was right after right after he had hit too steep gradient he didnt cave in on the steep gradient he caved in instantly before he hit the steep gradient ill talk to you more in later lecture about processing people using this exact principle of too steep gradient its quite interesting but itll be the gradient that he failed on was the gradient which came after the gradient he hadnt understood hes one step late in recognizing this thing see now what you want to do is give somebody series of doingnesses on gradient that they can do and that they can achieve and in scientology you have rather marvelous thing called touch assist and it is so workable that some people sort of park right there with the touch assist and thats only one little level of doingness which if they do why it gives them some confidence and they can go on to higher levels of doingness you see but its something like having invented too good kiddiecar you know this is too good kiddiecar and youll find it sometimes hard to move people off on to the next step but confidence and understanding goes along with the doingness so doingness is just another method of achieving understanding in addition to accomplishing something with it and so forth its also method of getting understanding doingness is method of achieving understanding and if you find yourself too bogged and so forth well you want to go do some of it and that sounds rather interesting now i know myself i have just gotten through three books of archaic yesteryears color films im studying color photography on textbooks that even though they are written by this institution and so forth have long since antiquated they are dead and there is very little left of the actual materials they are talking about and its writwas written by professor at columbia university who probably had never done any and the directions and so forth were mostly taken out of the literature released by the companies that manufactured the stuff at the time and they intended just happy result which they didnt ever think anybody would have any trouble with the net result of this amounted to tremendously interesting basic theoretical approach which was absolutely vital to an understanding of the subject which departed wildly on to series of doingnesses which were longer of use and were completely disrelated so if this wasnt the worlds worst mishmash i ever had anything to do with id like to know about it theya real mishmash heres vital basic technology basic historical technology basic puttogether basic chemical technology all of this stuff is not only true now its going to hold true from here on out in this particular field dont you see basics fundamentals and so forth well i got those down with spikes in spite of learning them from professor and the next thing all of sudden you collide with films you will never shoot and which you have to know all of the literature concerning oh thats pretty grim because in the first place i have already learned that manufacturers table of use on the subject of any piece of film much less color film is something that you carefully dont litter the street with you put it in the garbage can see useless forget it he isnt the user of the film in the first place hes the seller of the film not just its manufacturer but hes selling this stuff so he wants to put very happy face on it so he says its speed rating is up in the starswhen it isnt and he says it wont do this when it does and all of this stuff and how this stuff is handled and all of thisnot even germane why would anybody have even included it in the text in the first place he already knew that color was an advancing field it was advancing so rapidly that to expect of the individual without modernizing the text that he would have to know all about autochromehavent had any autochrome since 1920it didnt even take picture then whoever heard of this stuff well its nice to know that they had some film like this and what its basic theory is but now go and get the lens stops and settings for autochromeoh come now well what lens stops and settings for autochrome in camera system perhaps that isnt even used anymore thats just gobbledygook then isnt it well your understanding has to embrace this fact and you somehow or another have to survive through the subject and still retain intact the basic technology and the vital fundamentals of the subject which you have learned without being so upset about the later enturbulences which you got into because thats now been overridden and developed now you are all faced with that merely because of the advancing line of scientology ive just experienced it in the wildest way possible the third book was totally devoted to printing methods and i wouldnt be seen dead in color darkroom anyway see ibluh who wants to doodledaddle like that see well there are lots of guys around that like to doodledaddle like that and im happy there are because theyre going to do all of my doodledaddling all i have to know in that is also an understanding of what i have to know i havent got the time or the inclination to spend forty or fifty hours on salon exhibition print to get it registered properly i havent got the time or the inclination who wouldwhod do such thing one of these doodledaddlers they work happily marvelous couldnt live without it dont you see well i have to know enough to know whether or not they know what they are doing thats once more an understanding of what i need the information for an understanding of what im going to use this information and an understanding of its value and precision understanding of what i have to have out of it its an understanding of what do i want its an understanding of the proper practical use or application of this information and if its for drawing room conversation you would study it entirely differently if you were studying art for drawing room conversation but not commercially i assure you the thing to do is to get ahold of catalog that was published at some outrageous long date ago that lists all sorts of painters of the period of van eyck or something like this and get all the contemporaries see get all of those and what they were noted for you see and memorizejust grind grind grind like youre memorizing thisan amateur play script all of this stuff you see and so forthdrawing room conversation kill everybody dead they cant open their heads aboutthey say something about seventeenth century painters you know and you say like van der dobin and they say what you say yes van der dobin in other words you can play oneupmanship with this thing see mow em down you know well hobbema after alltoo blue and everybody says gee boy hes in the know so anyway the nonsense that you could run that one into and the various lines is still included under the heading of what are you going to use this information for what degree do you have to know even inside one single subject of course some of the teachers i had on the subject of antisubmarine warfare were busy teaching how to buildhow to build if you pleasethere was war going on i didnt have any time to build anything i tried to explain it to thema qcb1 antisubmarine electronic echo device an asdic qcb1 this is the way it is built fortunately it was lovely lovely warm classroom and i was shipped for very short time down into the south of florida to learn about this sort of thing and thats one of the things they taught and boy was i able to catch up on my sleep because i just knew somehow that out in the middle of the pacific ocean with my hands full of jap submarines i was not going to have to build one of these things i was merely going to have to know how to use it and at most repair it and to know when it was in operation when it was out of operation i figured that would be about all in the middle of action that i would be able to need thats all i would need to know about that equipment so i had myself nice sleep but the evaluation of what you want it forhow are you studying itwhich direction its going and so forth is all part and parcel to the whole subject of study and if it is not included in the field of study why your use of the information is minimal and you can become very stultified and you can become very horrified and you can hang up on lot of words and things that are getting in your road and upsetting you and that you dont understand and you get into an obsessive ive got to understand everything i read perfectly or i will hang up and this is taught to you by the fact that if you dont understand what you read half page later youre going to get headache well you also must include the idea that after youve read that half page more and gotten headache that youve now got to be smart enough to know there was something back of you find out what it was spot it get it out of the road say yeah thats word i dont know and go on reading in other words in order to study youve got to have lot of the technology of study or the use of the information which you are getting is going to be minimal now ive given you lot of stuff in this lecture today that is largely theoretical and that sort of thingall of this however has very practical applications and it has practical application to what you are doing right now so having increased your grades very very nicely after every one of these why please increase your grade again thank you very much
