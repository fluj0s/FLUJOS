incurred in the establishment and operation of their bpcs role of state and local law enforcement since the attacks of september 11 many have called on state and local law enforcement agencies to play larger role in the enforcement of federal immigration laws some question however whether st ate and local law forcement officers possess adequate authority to enforce all immigration laws that is both civil violations eg lack of legal status which may lead to removal through an administrative system and criminal punishments eg alien smuggling which is prosecuted in the courts historically the authority for state and local law enforcement officials to enforce immigrati on law has been cons trued to be limited to the criminal provisions of the ina by contrast the enforcement of the civil provisions has been viewed strictly as federal responsibility with states playing an incidental supporting role some posit none theless that states and localities as sovereign entities retain certain police powers under the constitution and consequently possess inherent authority to enforce civil as well as criminal violations of federal immigration law17 multiple bills in congress would address these possible authority issues and enhance the role of state and local law enforcement agencies in the enforcement of immigration law hr 4437 220 and hr 6095 101 both of which have been passed by the

associated with the transfer of aliens detained or in th custody of the sheriff 607 in the senate s 2611 would create borde r relief grant program for eligible law enforcement agencies to address

employers violating prohibitions on unlawful employment may be subject to civil andor criminal penalties18 enforcement of these provisions is termed worksite enforcement employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement are current areas of congressional interest chief among the reasons for this is the large and growing number of unauthorized aliens in the united states the majority of whom are in the labor force according to estimates by the pew hispanic center in 2005 the unauthorized alien populati on totaled about 111 million nd the unauthorized alien working population totaled about 72 million19 particularly since the 2001 terrorist attacks many have raised security cerns about having such large unauthorized population in addition the issue of work site enforcement has gained attention recently in connection with guest worker proposals president bush has expressed support for new temporary worker progra m and has called for increased worksite enforcement as part of the program immigration reform bills containing guest worker and worksite enforcementrelated provisions have been introduced in the 109th congress number of bills related to employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement are before the 109th congress title vii of hr 4437 as passed by the house would direct dhs to establish an employment eligibility

an individual after hiring or in change from basic pilot program requirements before commencin g recruitment or referral these verification requirements woul d take effect two years after enactment the current i9 system would remain in place with some modifications hr 4437 also would require employers to verify the identity and employment eligibility of previously hired workers by six years after enactme nt in addition hr 4437 would increase existing monetary penalties for employer violations at the same time it would provide for the reduction of civil monetary penalties for employer s

penalties for employer viola tions although to lesser extent than hr 4437 in addition the senate bill woul d establish new penalty for employees who falsely represent on the i9 form that they are authorized to work title iii of s 2611 as passed by the senate like hr 4437 and s 2454 would direct dhs to implement an employment eligibility verification system modeled on the basic pilot program

or hired after the date of enactment if dhs designates such employer or class as critical employer based on homeland security or national security needs or if dhs has reasonable cause to believe that the employer has materially violated the prohibitions on unauthorized employment under s 2611 individuals who are ter minated from employment based on determination by the verification system that they are not work eligible could obtain administrative and judicial review if they are determined to in fact be work eligible and prevail they would be entitled to compensation for lost wages the current i9 system would remain in place with some modifications in addition s 2611 would increase monetary penalties for employ er violations and like s 2454 would establish new penalty for employees who fa lsely represent on the i9 form that they are authorized to work other pending bills selection of which are discussed below would similarly require all employers to conduct employment eligibility verification through the basic pilot program or similar system as detailed in the following paragraphs some would maintain the basic pilot programs separation of the dhs and ssa databases as part of the verification syst em others call for the creation of new unified database by dhs or ssa most of the measures would increase existing monetary penalties for employer violations among their other provisions the bills variously would authorize appropriations at such sums as necessary to implement their provisions and subject to the availa bility of appropriations would authorize an increase in personnel to conduct worksite enforcement hr 98 which was the subject of ma 2005 hearing by the house judiciary committees subcommittee on immigration bord er security and claims would

card issued by the us government that explicitly authorizes employment among its other provisions s 1917 would increase monetary pena lties for employer violations hr 3333 would rename the basic pilo

machinereadable electronic identification strip and digitized phot ograph whic h the employer would use to verify identity and work authorization th rough the new database hr 3938 also would increase monetary penalties for employer violations alien smuggling many contend that the smuggling of aliens into the united states constitutes significant risk to national security and public safety since smugglers facilitate the illegal entry of persons into the united states some maintain that terrorists may use existing smuggling routes and organizati ons to enter undetected in addition to generating billions of dollars in revenues for criminal enterprises alien smuggling can lead to collateral crimes including ki dnaping homicide assa ult rape robbery auto theft high speed flight vehicle acci dents identity theft and the manufacturing and distribution of fraudulent documents the main alien smuggling statute ina 274 delineates the criminal penalties sset seizure rules and prima facie evidentiary requirements for smuggling offenses several bills in the 109th congress have provisions c oncerning alien smuggling among them is hr 2744 the fy2006 agricu lture appropriations bill which was signed into law as pl 10997 secti on 796 of this law specifies circumstances under which religious organizations are exem pt from criminal pena lties related to the smuggling and harboring

volunteer minister or missionary under the provision the alien mu st have been member of the religious denomination for at least one year and ma not be compensated as an employee but may be provided room boar d travel medical assistance and other basic living expenses hr 4437 as passed by the house and s 2611 as passed by the senate would rewrite ina 274 although the bills are simila r they are not identical in language or in scope both bills would broaden the types of acts that are considered alien smuggling for example they would make it smuggling offense to transport person outside the united states knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that the person is in unlawful transit from one country to another or on the highseas and is seeking to illegally enter the united st ates s 2611 would also provide new exemptions from criminal liability for persons or organizations providing assistance to unauthorized aliens on humanitarian gr ounds such exemptions are not contained in current law hr 4437 in contrast c ontains such exemptions and would also remove the current exempti on contained in pl 10997 for religious organizations that encourage certain unauthorized aliens to

determination about whether the aliens should be rem oved from the united states the law mandates that certain categories of aliens be subject to mandatory detention ie the aliens must be detained liens subject to mandatory detention include those arriving without documentation or with fraudulent documentation those who are inadmissible or deportable on criminal or national security grounds those certified as terrorist suspects and those w ho have final orders of deportation aliens not subject to mandatory detention may be detained parole d or released on bond the priorities for detention of these aliens are specified in statute and regulations22 there are many policy issues surrounding the detention of aliens among them are concerns about the number of aliens subject to mandatory detention and the justness of mandatory tention especially as it is app lied to asylum seekers arriving without proper documentation some have raised concerns about the length of time spent in detention by alie ns who have been ordered removed additionally the amount of detention space available to hous dhs detainees is constant issue especially since many nondetained aliens fa il to appear for their removal hearings or to depart from the united states after receiving final orde rs of deportation several bills in the 109th congress including housepassed hr 4437 and hr 6094 and senatepasse d s 2611 contain provisions concerning the detention of aliens in the united states hr 4437 hr 6094 and s 2611 would codify and modify the regulations governing the revi ew of postremoval

removed or granted admission s 2611 contains similar provisions hr 4437 also would authorize and establish the selection criteria for the secretary of dhs to contract with private entities to provide transportation to detention facilities and other locations for aliens apprehended along th border by cbp and would require mandatory detention for aliens of street gangs hr 6094 as passed by the house would also require the mandatory detention of alie ns who are street gang members s 2611 would direct dhs to acquire or construct 20 additional detention facilities for aliens with combined capacity of at least 10000 aliens at any time and would direct dhs to consider utilizing military installations approved for closure for this purpose detentionrelated provision dded as senate floor ame ndment to s 2611 would give the border patrol exclusive administrative and operational control over all assets utilized in carrying out its mission which would include detention space illegal presence removal and exclusion hr 4437 as passed by the house and s 2611 as passed by the senate would variously build on past legislative efforts most recently the real id act to tighten current law in the areas of illegal presence and illegal entry alien voluntary departure and removal from the united states alien exclusion from or inadmissibility to the united states and judicial review so hr 4437 or s 2611like provisions in these areas have been passed by one or both houses in other bills unlawful presence section 203 of hr 4437 would upgrade the consequences of illegal presence from civil offense to criminal offense presently unlawful presence is criminal offense only when an alien has previously been removed or excluded or had departed the united states while removal orde r was outstanding under hr 4437 both unlawful entry and presence would be made into felonies first offense of the unlawful entry statute is currently misde meanor while subsequent offenses are felonies the bill would further heighten the criminal and civil penalties for unlawful entry reentry and presence when an alien had previously been convicted of certain crimes secti on 206 of s 2611 would largely do the same with the notable exception that it would not criminalize unlawful presence or impose heightened penalties on such presence if the alien d previously been convicted of certain crimes unless the alien was unlawfully present in the united states after having been removed under 209 of hr 4437 and 206 of s 2611 unlawful reentry and presence after voluntary departure woul d be subject to increased criminal penalties hr 4437 would also establish mandatory minimum sentence requirements for the crime of reentering the united states after either having been removed or having departed

to waive any rights to appeal but could receive discretionary reduction of the period of inadmissibility before the alien could apply to reenter the united states subsequent decision to file an appeal would nullify the agreement the maximum validity period for permission to depart voluntarily prior to the conclusion of removal proceedings that have already been initia ted would be reduced from 120
