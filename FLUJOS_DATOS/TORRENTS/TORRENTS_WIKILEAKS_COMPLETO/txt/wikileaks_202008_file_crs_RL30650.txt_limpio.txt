individual or group or it may initiate an inquiry on its own it has formal procedures for the filing of complaints and does not publicize allegations that in its judgment do not merit full review after an investigative process the committee may recommend to the senate appropriate sanctions against senator including censure expulsion party discipline and financial restitution in addition effective in 1999 the committee may issue reprimand or assess financial reimbursement without full senate approval9 in the case of an officer or employee the committee may recommend dismissal

as mentioned earlier the committee sometimes has disciplined senators directly without recommending that the senate take official action the committee punishments have included reprimand an admonishment and rebuke crs4 consideration of the panama canal treaty and several discrimination issues15 disciplinary action was taken in any of those cases committee evolution and background creation of the select committee on standards and conduct prior to 1964 there were congressional ethics committees or formal rules governing the conduct of members officers and employees of either house of congress nor was there consistent approach to the investigation of alleged misconduct when allegations were investigated the investigation was usually done by special or select committee created for that purpose sometimes however allegations were considered by the house or senate without prior committee action traditionally the senate and the house of representatives have exercised their powers of self discipline with caution according to senate historian richard baker for nearly two centuries simple and informal code of behavior existed prevailing norms of general decency served as the chief determinants of proper legislative conduct16 baker further noted that for most of its history congress has chosen to deal on casebycase basis only with the most obvious acts of wrongdoing those clearly inconsistent with the trust and duty of member17 increasing attention to congressional ethics began in the 1940s when concern was first expressed about the lack of financial disclosure requirements for the three branches of government there was also public criticism about members of congress supplementing their salaries with income from speeches and other outside activities senator wayne morse the first member to introduce public financial disclosure legislation defended members right to earn outside income but believed that the american people were entitled to know about their sources of income18 senator morses 1946 resolution sres 306 would have required senators to file annual public financial disclosure reports it was predicated upon the very sound philosophical principle enunciated by plutarch that members of congress just as caesars wife must be above suspicion19 senator morse continued to introduce his measure through the 1960s ultimately expanding it to include all three branches of government and gaining support from 15 see for example congressional ethics cases 19761980 in congressional ethics 2nd ed washington congressional

congressional committees to adopt and monitor codes of official conduct for members and employees of the senate momentum for reform grew after robert g bobby baker secretary to the senate democratic majority resigned from his job in october 1963 following allegations that he had misused his official position for personal financial gain21 for the next year and half the senate rules and administration committee held hearings to investigate the business interests and activities of senate officials and employees in order to ascertain what if any conflicts of interest or other improprieties existed and whether any additional laws or regulations were needed22 the committee recognized that serious allegations had been made against former employee and that specific rules or regulations governed the duties and scope of activities of members officers or employees of the senate in its first report the senate rules committee characterized many of bakers outside activities as being in conflict with his official duties and made several recommendations including adoption of public financial disclosure rules and other guidelines for senate employees23 subsequently as part of its conclusion of the baker case the rules committee held additional hearings on proposals advocating code of ethics in conjunction with pending pay raise the creation of joint congressional ethics committee to write an ethics code and the adoption of various rules requiring public disclosure of personal finances by senators and staff and the disclosure of ex parte communications24 additions to the senate rules calling for public financial disclosure reports and more controls on staff involvement in senate campaign funds were then introduced to implement the committees recommendations25 20

senator john sherman cooper member of the rules committee discussed the committees rejection of his proposal for the establishment of select committee on standards and conduct26 the proposed committee would have been empowered to receive and investigate complaints of unethical activity as well as to propose rules and make recommendations to the senate on disciplinary action to implement the proposed new senate rules the committee on rules and administration reported measure granting itself authority to investigate infractions of all senate rules and to recommend disciplinary action27 on july 24 1964 during debate on the proposed new ethics rules sres 337 and resolution sres 338 to give the rules committee additional authority the senate adopted substitute proposal by senator cooper to establish permanent bipartisan senate select committee on standards and conduct28 the senate chose to create bipartisan ethics committee instead of granting the rules committee disciplinary authority in part because of the difficulties in the baker investigation the new select committee was similar to the one senator cooper had advocated during several stages of the bobby baker investigation the senator had declared that one of the greatest duties of such committee would be to have the judgement to know what it should investigate and what it should not29 moreover with the creation of this committee an internal disciplinary body was established in congress for the first time on continuing basis the six members of the new committee were not appointed until year later in july 1965 however because of the senate leaderships desire to wait until the rules committee had completed the baker investigation30 in october 1965 the committee elected chairman and vice chairman appointed its first staff and began developing standards of conduct for the senate31 25 continued xlii to the standing rules of the senate report to accompany sres 337 88th cong 2nd sess srept 881125

creation of the select committee on ethics although the select committee on standards and conduct undertook several investigations from 1969 to 1977 it was sometimes characterized as antiquated dolittle or as watch dog without teeth32 moreover the senate ethics code which the committee wrote in 1968 was often viewed as ineffective33 in 1976 select committee created to study the senate committee system recommended that the functions of the select committee on standards and conduct should be placed under the senate rules and administration committee34 the rules committee however rejected the idea and instead recommended establishment of newly constituted bipartisan ethics committee to demonstrate to the public the seriousness with which the senate views congressional conduct35 in response the permanent select committee on ethics was created in 1977 to replace the select committee on standards and conduct36 initially membership on the new select committee was limited to six years two years later the sixyear limitation was removed37 jurisdiction when the select committee on standards and conduct was created in 1964 it was given the authority to 1

conduct his own affairs so as to infringe on the public interest all official conduct of members of the senate should be guided by this paramount concept of public office b these rules as the written
