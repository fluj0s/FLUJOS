small nuclear reactor at yongbyon 5mwe capable of producing about 6kg of plutonium per year began operating in 19861 later that year us satellites detected high explosives testing and new plant to separate plutonium in addition construction of two larger reactors 50mwe at yongbyon and 200mwe at taechon added to evidence of serious cla ndestine effort although nort h korea had joined the nuclear nonproliferation treaty in 1985 the safeguards inspections that began only in 1992 raised questions about how much plutonium north korea had produced covertly in 1994 north korea pledged under the agreed framework with the united states to freeze its plutoniumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21391crs2 2 see crs report rl33590 north koreas nuclear weapons development and diplomacy by larry niksch 3 highly enriched uranium heu has 20 or more u235 isotope 90 u235 is weaponsgrade 4 the physical principles of weaponization are wellknown but producing weapon with high reliability effectiveness and efficiency without testing presents significant challenges 5 plutonium that stays in reactor for long time reactorgrade with high burnup contains about 20 pu240 weaponsgrade plut onium contains less

committeeprograms and eventually dismantle them in return for several kinds of assistance2 at that time western intelligence agencies estimated that north korea had separated enough plutonium for one or two bombs other sources estimated four to five bombs weapons production milestones acquiring fissile material plutonium239 or highly enriched uranium heu is the key hurdle in nuclear weapons development3 producing these two materials is technically challenging in comparison many experts believe weaponization to be relatively easy4 north korea has industrialscale uranium mining and plants for milling refining and converting uranium it also has fuel fabrication plant nuclear reactor and reprocessing plant in short everythi ng needed to produce pu239 in its nuclear reactor north korea uses magnox fuel natural uranium 99u 238 metal wrapped in magnesiumalloy cladding about 8000 fuel rods constitute fuel core for the reactor when irradiated in reactor natural uranium fuel absorbs neutron and then decays into plutonium pu239 fuel that remain s in the reactor for long time becomes contaminated by the isotope pu240 which can poison the functioning of nuclear weapon5 spent or irradiated fuel which poses radiological hazards must cool after removal from the reactor the cooling phase estimated by some at five months is proportional to the fuel burnup reprocessing to separate plutonium from waste products and uranium is the next step north kor ea uses purex separation process like the united states after shearing off the fuel cladding the fuel is dissolved in nitric acid components plutonium uranium waste of th fuel are separated in to different streams using organic solvents in small quantities separation can be done in hot cells but larger quantities require significant shielding to prevent deadly exposure to radiation6 north korea appears to have mastered the engineering requirements of plutonium production its 5mwe nuclear reactor ope rated from 1986 to 1994 restarting in january 2003 north korean officials claimed to have separated plutonium in hot cells and tested the reprocessing plant in 1990 and to have reprocessed all 8000 fuel rods from the 5mwe reactor between january and june 2003 the ja nuary 2004 unofficial us delegation reported that all indications from the display in the control room are that the reactor is operating smoothly nowhowever we have way of assessing independently how well the reactor has operated during the past year7 the same delegation reported that the reprocessing facility appeared in good repair in st to

extremely primitive in the end however significant growth in north koreas arsenal depends on the completion of the two larger reactors and progress in the reported uran ium enrichment program in january 2004 north korean officials s howed an unofficial us delegation alloyed scrap from plutonium pu casting operation alloying plutonium with other materials is common in plutonium metallurgy to retain the delta phase of plutonium which makes it easier to cast and shap two steps in weapons production8 d r siegfried hecker delegation member assessed that the stated density of the material was consistent with plutonium alloyed with gallium or aluminum if so this could indicate certain sophistica tion in north koreas handlin g of pu metal but without testing the material hecker could not confirm that the metal was plutonium or that it was alloyed or that it was from the most recent reprocessing campaign there is reliable information on north ko rean nuclear weapons design although the us director of national intelligence c onfirmed that nuclear test was conducted on october 9 2006 in the vicinity of punggye th subkiloton yield of the test suggests that the weapon design or manufacturing process likely needs improvement9 environmental clues suggest that the device used plut onium by comparison simple plutonium implosion device normally would produce larger blast perhaps 5 to 20 kilotons the first nuclear tests conducted by other states range from 9 kt pakistan to 60kt but tests by the united states china britain and russia were in the 20ktrange implosion devices which use sophisticated lenses of high explosives to compress fissile material are generally thought to require testing although the cia suggested in 2003 that north korea could validate its weapons design us ing extensive high explosives testing10 it is possible that pakistani scientist aq khan may have provided north korea the same chineseorigin nuclear weapon sign he provided to libya if so this might help north korea develop reliable warhead for ballistic missiles small lig ht and robust enough to tolerate the extreme conditions encounter ed through ballistic trajectory although former dia director jacoby told the nate armed services committee in april 2005 that north korea had the capability to arm missile with nuclear device pentagon officials later backtracked from that assessment estimating nuclear material production most estimates of nuclear weapon stockpiles are based on estimated fissile material production factors in plutonium production include the average power level of the reactor days of operation how much of the fuel is reprocessed and how quickly and how much plutonium is lost in production proce sses according to north korea the 5mwe reactor performed poorly early on unevenly irra diating the rods there is data on the reactors current perform ance or the reprocessing facilitys efficiency north korea told the iaea that during the 1990 hot test it lost almost 30 of the plutonium in the wastehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21391crs4 11 david albright and kevin oneill editors solving the north korean nuclear puzzle isis report isis press 2000 p

according to north korean officials in january 2004 the plant nnual throughput is 110 tons of spent fuel about twice the fuel load of the 5mwe react or final factor in assessing how many weapons north korea can produce is whethe r north koreas tec hnical sophistication enables it to use more or less material than the international standards of 8kg of pu and 25kg for heu per weapon north koreas abilities here are unknown what does north korea have now secretary of state powell stated in decem ber 2002 that we now believe they north koreans have couple of nuclear w eapons and have had them for years12 on february 10 2005 north korea announced that it had manuf actured nukes for selfdefense and that it would bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal13 in june 2005 vice foreign minister kim gye

of plutonium that might have been repro cessed is unknown in 2004 north ko rean officials stated that the reprocessing campaign was conducted continuously four 6hour shifts us efforts to detect

2003 north korean officials announced that th 5mwe reactor was operatin g and comme rcial satellite photography confirmed activity in march in january 2004 north korean officials told us visitors that the reactor was now opera ting smoothly at 100 of its rated power the us visitors noted that the display in the reactor control room and steam plumes from the cooling towers confirmed operation but th at there was way of knowing how it had operated over the last year in april 2005 the reactor was shut down and on may 11 2005 north korean officials stated they harvested fuel rods for weapons18 according to commercial satellite images the reactor resume d operations in august 200519 common estimate is that the reactor gene rates 6 kg of pu per year roughly one bomb per year but the reactor would likely be operated for several years before fuel is withdrawn one estimate is that the reactor held between 10 and 15 kg pu in april 2005 and that north korea could have re processed all the fuel by mid200620 from august 2005 to 2006 the reactor could have produced anot her 6 kg of pu in total there could be enough separated plutonium for another three weapons complete other reactors the reactors at yongbyon 50mwe and taechon 200mwe are likely several years from comple tion us visitors in january 2004 saw heavy corrosion and cracks in concrete buildin g structures at yongbyon reporting that the reactor building looks in terrible state of repair21 the cia estimates that the two reactors could generate about 2 75kg of plutonium per year22 in august 2005 another unofficial us

korea began seeking centrifugerelated materials in large quantities pakistani president musharraf revealed in his september 2006 memoir in the line of fire that doctor aq khan transferred nearly two doz p1 and p2 centrifuges to north korea he also provided north korea with flow ter some special oils for centrifuges and coaching on centrifuge technology including vi sits to topsecret centrifuge plants25 however the united states has not been able get direct confirmation from khan questions have been raised about whether us estimates we re accurate in hearing before the senate armed services committee on february 27 2007 joseph detrani the mission manager for north korea from the office of the director of national intelligence was asked by senator reed whether he d any further indica tion of whether that program has progressed in the last six years one or two the evidence the credibility of the evidence that we had initially suggesting they had program rather than aspirations detrani responded that the assessment was with high confidence that indeed they were making acquisitions nece ssary for if you will productionscale program and we still have confidence that the program is in existence at the midconfidence level how to verify north korean claims information about north koreas nucl ear weapons producti on has depended on remote monitoring and defector information with mixed results satellite images correctly indicated the startup of the 5m we reactor but gave details about its operations satellites so detected trucks at yongby on in late january 2003 but could not confirm the movement of spent fuel to the reprocessing plant26 imagery reportedly detected activity at the reprocessing plant in april 2003 but could not confirm largescale reprocessing27 and satellite imagery coul d not peer into an empty spent fuel pond which was shown to us visitors in january 2004 even us scientists visiting pyongyang in january 2004 could not confirm north korean cl aims of having reprocessed the spent fuel or that the material shown was in fact pl utonium verifying thos claims would require greater access to the material and north korean cooperation this is particularly true in the case of uranium enrichment us inte lligence officials have said they do not know where the uranium program is and more r ecently have shown less confidence about what the scope of the program might be althoug h seismographs registered the october 9th detonation and environmenta l sampling confirmed radio activity there is still information on what north korea intended to accomplish with the test from technical security political and diplomatic perspectives more data is necessary to project what this new capability might mean for north korea the region and the united states
