zoellick to fight terrorism by spreading the messa ge of prosperity and democracy throughout the world1 one way the administration chose to spread that message was through proposed middle east free tr ade agreement mefta the mefta initiative was proposed by pr esident bush on may 9 2003 and was slated for completion within decad ie by around 2013 more detail on the administrations plan was revealed on june 23 2003 at the world economic forum in jordan when us trade representativ zoellick spoke on the conceptual details mr zoellick outlined six steps for middle east countries wishing to enter into free trade agreement with the united states meanwhile on may 22 2003 senators max baucus and john mccain and representatives adam smith and calvin d ooley introduced bipartisan legislation s

of world and us foreign dir ect investment respectively in various countries impetus for the initiatives both middle east trade initiatives captured an idea that was already being debated in washington using trade as tool to fight terrorism for example in february 2003 report by policy analyst edward gresser argued that the muslim world had been the blank spot on the us trade agenda fact that risked undermining rather than supporting the wa r on terrorism gresser pointed to an economic crisis affecting almost all of the western muslim states which have seen their share of world trade and investment collapse since 1980 resulting in stagnant growth and falling income with social consequences of unemployment political tension and rising appeal for religious extremists3 gresser argued that strategic initiative for the muslim4 world could end or at least ease the tilt gresser called for an initiative analogous to the programs now available for central america the andean nations and africa in order to possibly spark growth and creation and so reduce the attraction of radicalism and religious fundamentalism another article written by policy analyst brink lindsey of the cato institute argued for two concepts the first was an additional shorterterm program to include temporary dutyfree quotafree access to the us market for exports of selected muslim countries the shorter term progra m he declared would give tangible dramatic proof of us co mmitment to the region thereby providing an impetus for the longer arduous process of negotiating fr ee trade agreements the second concept lindsey called for was the expansion of th definition of middle east beyond the traditional geographic area to incl ude other countries with geopol itical significance5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32335crs3 6 the caribbean basin economic recovery act cbera the andean trade preference act atpa and the african growth and opportunity act agoa offer trade preferences to

latter is in tended as shortterm trade preference stepping stone to middle east free trade area mefta the administrations plan on the other hand would specifically cr eate the mefta in this respect the two initiatives may be viewed as complementary to summarize the differences in approach the administration would continue its efforts to negotiate tifas bits and ftas with middle east countries to create mefta by 2013 s 1121hr 2267 on the other hand pa tterned after agoa would offer intermediate shortterm pref erences that would expire in 2011 two years before the administrations target

serve as necessary precursor to free trade agreement23 although the administration is committe d to its own initiative it has been ambivalent in its support of s 1121hr 2267 ustr zoellick argued in testimony on march 9 2004 that it is good in itiative on march 10 2004 however representatives from the departments of state and commerce argued that the administration would prefer to follow its own countrybycountry approach24 they argued that this approach was more likely to help middle east countries to become sustainable trading partners25 because each of th successive steps involved in negotiating tifas bits and ft as could help induce internal changes in the laws and regulations of the various countries conclusion both middle east trade proposals would aim to help stimula greater economic development in the middle east shorter term goals from these stimuli would be for the region to grow enough to begin ab sorbing some of the unemployment which averages around 2226 arguably the regions most pressing economic problem and b for the region to begin attracting more foreign investment to help diversify output beyond oil and gas tex tiles and apparel and few other commodities as the shorter term stretches into the longer rm goals would be for the middle east to develop alternative ec onomic resources and industries that could help ease and even reverse its declining share of worl d economic growth and investment its unemployment and perhaps some of the c onditions in the middle east that support terrorismhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32335crs15 table 1 countries covered by
