alleged violations under the religion clauses must meet two threshold requirements government action and standing in order to bring claim to enforce rights provided by the religion clauses an individual must show that government action s interfered with those rights in other words actions by private actors cannot violate the religion clauses the individual must also have standing cases brought under the religion clauses are governed by general standing rules standing is the legal term used to indicate that the person has an individualized interest that has actually been harmed under the law or by its application2 for instance person who has been barred by the government from attending religious services or required by law to attend religious services would have standing because the individual has been individually affected by the governments action for some establishment clause cases the court has recognized special exceptions to the general rules for standing3 generally taxpayers do not have standing to sue the government on the grounds that their tax money has been spent in manner that they consider improper4 the court has recognized an exception to this rule known as the flast exception under the flast exception taxpayers may raise establishment clause challenges of actions taken by congress under article is taxing and spending clause5 the court has maintained its narrow interpretation of this exception refusing to extend it to permit taxpayer lawsuits challenging executive actions or taxpayer lawsuits challenging actions taken under powers other than taxing and spending 6 g7g156g157g138g139g149g146g156g145g150g142g151g157g561g5g149g138g158g156g142g561 the establishment clause provides for separation of church and state but advocates differ as to

not been practiced throughout american history7 g22g142g156g157g156g561g23g156g142g141g561 the primary test used to evaluate claims under the establishment clause is known as the tripartite test often referred to as the lemon test under this test law 1 must have secular purpose 2 must have primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion and 3 must not lead to excessive entanglement with religion 8 although the lemon test is the one commonly employed by the court it has been criticized by some justices who have applied the test in different ways one application of the lemon test focuses on whether the government has endorsed religion the government is prohibited from making adherence to religion relevant in any way to persons standing in the political community9 this application of the lemon test forbids government endorsement or disapproval of religion ting that endorsement sends message to nonadherents that they are outsiders and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders favored members of the political community disapproval sends the opposite message10 another application of the lemon test focuses on neutrality as the governing principle in establishment clause challenges under this interpretation the essential element in evaluating challenges under the lemon test is whether or not the government act is neutral between religions and between religion and nonreligion 11 in addition to the lemon test the court has used two other tests to evaluate establishment clause claims the coercion test forbids the government from acting in way that may coerce support or participation in religious practices this test is typically invoked in the school setting because of the impressionability of those affected by possible acts of establishment 12 another test permits government acts that involve religion if the court finds that the religious element has played part in the history of the nation or as the court has phrased it has become part of the fabric of our society13 g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g20g142g149g146g144g146g152g158g156g561g21g153g142g142g140g145g561 when faced with issues regarding religious speech the court may also encounter free speech claims under the first amendment as general rule the government may not limit religious speech without compelling reason or in

held that regulations that broadly prohibit religious speech eg prohibiting first amendment activities in airports including ban on distribution of religious literature or requiring permits for all doortodoor canvassing including religious proselytizing cannot be held constitutional15

the court has held it unconstitutional to deny religious groups access to public facilities including public schools if the same facilities are made available at similar times to nonreligious groups 16 such circumstances treat religious groups differently in manner that suggests disapproval of religion in violation of the establishment clause the court interpreted this requirement of equal access to include access to benefits offered by public institutions when it required public university to provide student activity funds to student groups regardless of the religious content of the groups activities17 g18g158g139g149g146g140g561g6g146g156g153g149g138g162g561g152g143g561g20g142g149g146g144g146g152g158g156g561g21g162g150g139g152g149g156g561 the court has applied variety of tests in determining the constitutionality of religious displays on public property and its analysis in such cases is very factspecific generally the court will uphold displays that are set in diversified religious context for example display that included christian jewish and nonreligious holiday elements at government building has been held constitutional but display of christian symbol by itself has been held unconstitutional18 the court generally also will uphold religious displays that are given historical secular context for example the court has upheld display of th ten commandments placed among dozens of other secular historical monuments on the grounds of state capitol for several decades but held display that included the ten commandments among other religious items unconstitutional19 g20g142g149g146g144g146g152g151g561g146g151g561g21g140g145g152g152g149g561g21g142g157g157g146g151g144g156g561 the court has addressed the issue of prayer in schools by holding schoolsponsored religious activities unconstitutional the first amendment prohibits the legislature teachers and school 14 the court has developed the notion of the public forum ie that certain sites are by their nature and history particularly appropriate for speech activities see hague v cio 307 us 496 515 1939 roberts j concurring schneider v state 308 us 147 1939 it also posited that not all

schoolsponsored events20 the court has also struck down mandatory moments of silence if those moments are required for the purpose of voluntary prayer21 it also has held mandatory displays of the ten commandments in schools and prohibitions on teaching evolution to be unconstitutional22

to religi ous organizations generally depends on the purpose for which the aid is distributed and the manner in which it is distributed23 generally the government may not provide direct aid to religious organizations that use the aid for religious purposes but the court has allowed aid for nonreligious purposes the supreme court currently interprets the establishment clause to permit public school teachers to provide remedial and enrichment educational services to sectarian school children on the premises of the schools they attend24 it has held the use of federal funds to provide instructional materials and equipment to public and private religious schools to be constitutional25 the court appears to have abandoned distinction it had previously recognized that prohibited public aid to pervasively sectarian organizations instead suggesting that the purpose of the aid and the types of programs that it was used to fund are the critical factor in its analysis not the type of organization that received and administered the public funds26 if government aid is distributed in an indirect manner ie if an individual uses funds received from federal agency to pay for some sectarian service the court has held the aid to be constitutional when the distribution reflects the individuals choice27 in other words if the individual can be seen as intervening in the chain of distribution the aid is considered to be the individuals rather than the governments thereby negating threat of establishment the court has upheld aid programs in which the aid was distributed to the initial recipients on religion neutral basis and the initial recipients had genuine choice among options public and private secular and religious 28 20 see treen v karen b 455 us 913 1982 affg mem 653

government act that infringed on religious practices of citizens had to serve compelling state interest29 in 1990 the supreme court significantly altered its interpretation of the free exercise clause it abandoned the compelling state interest test strict scrutiny standard with respect to neutral statutes the court held that the free exercise clause never relieves an individual of the obligation to comply with valid and neutral law of general applicability30 the constitutional strict scrutiny standard was not abandoned entirely though it still applies to cases that involve religious claims for exemption in programs allowing for individualized assessments and cases that involve deliberate governmental targeting of religion 31

to the courts reinterpretation of the standard necessary under the free exercise clause congress brought back the compel ling interest test by statute congress sought to broaden the legal protection afforded religious exercise with the religious freedom restoration act rfra of 1993 32 which prohibited government action that has the effect of substantially burdening religious practice rfra pr ovided that statute or regulation of general applicability could lawfully burden persons exercise of religion only if it were shown to further compelling governmental interest and to be the least restrictive means of furthering that interest33 this statutory requirement for any law including those of general applicability not aimed at religious practice would supplement the constitutional protection which prohibits only government action that intentionally burdens the exercise of religion rfra when originally passed applied to federal state and local government actions in 1997 the court held that because of federalism congress lacked the constitutional power to impose such sweeping requirement on states and localities34 therefore the strict scrutiny standard imposed by rfra applies only to actions of the federal government congress responded to the inapplicability of rfra to state and local government by enacting the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of 2000 rluipa35 to avoid the federalism problems presented by rfra congress limited the scope of rluipas application rluipa applies only where the burden could be linked to situations involving congresss spending power or commerce power or 29 sherbert v verner 374 us 398 1963 wisconsin v yoder 406 us 205 1972 30 employment div oregon dept of human resources v sm ith 494 us 872 879 1990
