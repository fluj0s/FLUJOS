president selects but before the senate considers by the senate judiciary committee on rare occasions presidents also ve made court appoi ntments without the senates consent when th senate was in recess such recess appointments however were temporary with their terms expiring at the end of the senates next session the last recess appointments to the court made in the 1950s were controversial because they bypassed the nate and its advice and consent role the appointment of justice might or might not proceed smoothly from the first appointments in 1789 the senate has confirmed 122 out of 158 court nominations of the 36 unsuccessful nominations 11 were rejected in senate rollcall votes while nearly all of the rest in th face of committee or senate opposition to the nominee or the president were withdraw n by the president or were postponed tabled or never voted on by the senate over more than two centuries recurring theme in the supreme court appointment process has been the assumed need for excellence in nominee however politics also has played an impor tant role in suprem court appointments the political nature of the appointment pr ocess becomes especially apparent when president submits nominee with controversial views there are sharp partisan or ideological differences between the president and the senate or the outcome of important constitutional issues

withdrawal message u s congress senate journal of the executive proceedings of the senate of the united states of america vol 1 p 135 president washington indicated that the nomination was in violation of article i section 6 of the constitution which provides senator or representative shall during th time for which he was elected be appointed to any civil office which shall have been created during such time paterson had been member of the senate when the judiciary act of 1789 was passed creating the associate justice position to which washing ton nominated paterson in february 1793 though paterson had resigned from the senate in 1790 the senate term to which he had been elected would not conclude until ma rch 3 1793 washington renominated paterson on march 4 1793 and later that day special session of the senate of new congress confirmed the nominee by voice vote another court nominee to be renominated and then confirmed was pierce butler of minnesota in 1922 butler was first nominated by president warren g harding on november 23 1922 during the 3rd session of the 67th congress although reported favorably by the judiciary committee the nomination failed to be confirmed before the end of the 3rd session president harding renominated butler on december 5 1922 during the 4th session of the 67th congress and shortly thereafter on december 22 1922 the senate

involved individuals who subsequently were renominated and confirmed21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31989crs7 21 continued third court nominee to be renominated and then confirmed was john m harlan ii of new york harlan was first nominated by president dwight d eisenhower on november 9 1954 but the nomination r eceived action in the senate before the the final adjournment of the 83rd congress less than month later president eisenhower re nominated harlan on january 10 1955 at the beginning of the 84th congress and shortly thereafter on march 16 1955 the senate confirmed harlan by 7111 rollcall vote two other nominees who were not confirmed the first time only to be later re nominated and confirmed received senate confirmation in spite of significant senate opposition one was roger b taney nominated twice by president andrew jackson in 1835 and stanley matthews nominated first by president rutherford b hayes in 1881 and by president james garfield later in 1881 ta neys first nomination to associate justice was postponed indefinitely by the senate duri ng the next congress he was renominated and confirmed as chief justice by 2915 rollcall vote in the senate mathews first nomination was never reported out of committee but in the following congress under new president he was renominated and confirmed by 2423 rollcall vote the final nominee not confirmed but later renominated and confirmed was current chief justice john g roberts as noted previ ously in this report judge roberts was first nominated to replace associate justice sandra day oconnor but when chief justice rehnquist died suddenly president bush wit hdrew his nomination and resubmitted it for the position of chief justice 22 during the 19672006 period two other cour t nominations the associate justice nominations in 2005 of john g roberts jr and harriet miers were withdrawn by the president before receiving hearings on th day his nomination was withdrawn however judge roberts was renominated to be chief justice and 39 days later confirmed 23 according to one author when justic sandra day oconnor in 2005 announced her plan to retire the court was regarded as playing an extremely important role in american life for the past fifty years beginning under th leadership of earl warren the court had confronted americas most pre ssing social controversies the court showed little hesitation in interjecting itself into those disputes nd attempting to solve the nations most vexing problems from the bench even if that meant wr esting them away from the state legislatures continued from the presidency of george washington until early in the 20th century the senate took final action on th vast majority of suprem court nominations within one week of receiving them in recent decades by contrast the senate has tended to proceed much more slowly from 1967 through 2006 the year of the most recent supreme court confirmation 13 of the 21 court nominations that advanced to the committee hearing stage were pending in the senate for more than nine weeks before receiving final action22 the contemporary senates inclination to proceed more slowly with supreme court nominations has been due at least in part to several developments starting with the warren court in the 1950s under thenchief justice earl warren the supreme court became an ongoing focal point of controversy as it handed down succession of rulings ushering in profound changes in american society and politics by the late 1960s the perceived potency of the court as catalyst for change underscored to many senators especially those on the judiciary committee the importance of closely evaluating the attitudes and values of persons nominated to serve on the court23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31989crs8 23 continued and the congress in the process the cour t became moral compass identifying new constitutional rights not specifically addresse d in the constitution liberals believed that was an entirely proper role

itself greenburg supreme conflict pp 2324a general trend among senate committees beginning in the 1970s and 1980s was to intensify their sc rutiny of presidential nominations and to augment their investigative staffs for this purpose thorough and unhurried examination was regarded as especially justified in the case of supreme court nominations accordingly close scrutiny by the senate judiciary committee becam the norm even if nominee were highly distinguished and untouched by controversy many if not most of the nominees in recent decades proved to be controversial because of questions raised concerning their backgrounds qualifications or ideological orientation it has become increasingly common for presidents to state the philosophical or ideological values that they look for in supreme court nominee practice which may immediately raise concerns about the nominee on the part of senators who do not share the presidents philosophical prefer ences or vision for the court many court appointments in recen t decades were made during times of divided government when one political party controlled the white house and the other was in the majority in the senate the frequency of 54 decisions by the court has underscored to senators how important even just one new appointment might be for future court rulings presidents selection of nominee the need for supreme

and federal judges the intent of the founding fathers capitol studies vol 2 winter 1974 p 66 since the convention acted at time when nearly every state constitution and the articles of confederation permitted legislative voice in the selection of judges it is inconceivable that the delegates could have intended something less than full senate pa rticipation in the appointment process 27 see for example harris advice and consent of the senate p 34 the debates in the convention do not support the thesis since adva nced that the framers of the constitution intended that the president should secure the advice that is the recommendations of the senate or of individual members before making nominationannounces the intention to retire or resign24 it then becomes the presidents constitutional responsibility to select successor to the vacating justice25 the role of senate advice constitutional scholars have differed as to how much importance the framers of the constitution attached to the word advice in the phrase advice and consent the framers some have maintained contemplated the senate performing an advisory or recommending role to the pres ident prior to his selection of nominee in addition to confirming role afterwards26 others by contrast have insisted that the senates advice and consent role was meant to be strictly that of determining after the presidents selection had been made whether to appr ove the presidents choice27 bridging these opposing schools of thought another scholar recently asserted that the more sensible reading of the term advice is that it means that the senate is constitutionally entitled to give advice to president on whom as well as what kinds of persons he should nominate to certain posts but this advice is

who wanted to testify against nominee79 also notwithstanding stones appearance at his hearings in 1925 the judiciary committee over the next 30 years usually declined to invite supreme court nominees to testify if confirmation hearing were held80 hence as recently as 1954 earl warren did not appear at his conf irmation hearings to be chief justice however hearings in 1955 on the suprem court

of the questionnaire that request biographical and financial disclosure information as well as the nominees responses to questions about the constitution and the law treated to date by the committee as confidential and not available to the media or the public are the nominees responses to more sensitive questions such as whether he or she ever had been under federal state or local investigation for possible violation of ci vil or criminal statute or had ever been sued by client or other partywhereas historically nominees were routinely uninvolved in the appointment process they have now become active par ticipants indeed at hearings nominees demeanor responsiveness and knowledge of the law may be crucial in influencing the committee members and other senators votes on confirmation another important historical trend has involved the pace and thoroughness of the judiciary committee in acting on supr eme court nominations throughout the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century it was the standard practice unless nators at the outset found nominee to be objectionable for some reason for the committee to act on and dispose of nomination within days of receiving it in recent decades by contrast the committee has tended to proceed much more deliberately with its official involvement in the appointment process now usually measured in weeks or months83 since the late 1960s the judiciary co mmittees consideration of supreme court nominee almost always has consisted of three distinct stages prehearing investigative stage followed by public hearings and concluding with committee decision on what recommendation to make to the full senate prehearing stage immediately upon the presidents announ cement of nominee the judiciary committee initiates its own intensive inve stigation into the nominees background one primary source of information is committee questionnaire to which the nominee responds in writing84 confidential fbi reports

such requests citing the need to protect the confidentiality of advice provided or decisions made by the nominee while having served within an admin istration and typically invoking an executive privilege or attorneyclient priv ilege to support his re fusal to make such information available to the judiciary committee85 in such an event committee members or their staff might then devot significant amount of time prior to confirmation hearings to identifying and ju stifying disclosure of specific kinds of documents that would aid the committee in making more informed evaluation of the nominee as well as to examining what ever documents are eventually released in some cases the committee may be in position to exert leverage over an administration particularly when majority of the committees members are insistent that at least some executive branch documents be released before the committee will act on the nomination this crs report notes was the case in 1986 when the judiciary committee prepared to consider the nomination of william h rehnquist to be chief justice during the confirmation proceeding for the elevation of justice rehnquist to be chief justice the judiciary committee sought documents that he had authored on controversial subjects when he headed dojs office of legal counsel president reagan asserted ex ecutive privilege claiming the need to

subsequently the full senate rejected the haynsworth nomination by 5545 vote 128 concern that vacancies on the court be fille d as expeditiously as possible appeared to figure in the decisions to

dvt had reached with the senates party leaders concerning the scheduling proc edures for the confirmation hearings on the roberts nomination the particulars of the ag reement senator specter said were shaped by what he said was the senates duty to have the nominee in place on the court by the start of its next term on october 3 2005 in the list of particulars agreed to including the start of hearings by set date and the waiving by members of the judiciary committee of their right under committee rules to hold over th nomination for one week when first placed on the committees executive

nominee john roberts congressional record daily edition vol 151 july 29 2005 p s9420 senator leahy as well in floor statement immediately afte r senator specter indicated that the joint agreement allowed for dispensing with written committee report on the roberts nomination and we recognize senator leah stated that nothing in the senate or judiciary committee rules precludes the senate from considering the nomination on the floor without committee report ibid the scheduling of judiciary committee vote on the alito nomination without printed report by the committee to follow also appeared to be grounded on concerns of acting as quickly on the nomination as possible in chairman specters initial announcement on november 3 2005 of schedule for the judiciary committee and senate floor action on the alito nomination he specified that floor action was to begin the day after the committees vote hence not allowing time fo r preparation of printed report senator continuedreport however might not always be consid ered necessary reference for the senate as whole for instance in some cases senators not on the judiciary committee might believe they have r eceived adequate informati on about nominee from other sources such as from news media reports or gaveltogavel video coverage of the nominees confirmation hearings further preparation of written report will mean additional days for nomination to stay with the committee before it can be reported to the senate127 in some situations this might be viewed as creating unnecessary delay in the confirmation process particular ly if there is desire to fill court vacancy as quickly as possible128httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31989crs41 128 continued specter observed that the court was then in the midst of its october 2005 term with the possibility of various cases already heard by the court having to be reargued if the departure of outgoing justice sandra day oconnor during the term were to result in 44 decisions thus senator

take senate institutional factors into account for instance the role if any that senators from the home state of nominee played in the minees selection as well as their support for or opposition to the nominee may be of interest to other nators at the same time senators may be interested in the extent to which the president prior to selecting the nominee sought advice fro m other quarters in the

decades prior to 1991 it was the usual practi ce for senators during the calling of the roll to be free to come and go and not have to be present in the senate chamber for the entire calling of the roll for the five most recent supreme court nominations however starting with nominee clarence thom as in 1991 the majority leader or the presiding officer immediately prior to the calling of the roll has asked all of the senates members to remain seated at their desks during the entire vote with each senator rising and responding wh his or her name is called197 voting from the desk during roll calls is in keeping with standing order of the senate198 which rarelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31989crs58 199 senators are required to vote from their desk s but this requirement rarely is enforced on

after new chief executive has been elected presents an additional factor upon which to base opposition to confirmation the vacancys unfavorable timing he xplained can generate opposition of its own as well as activate the otherwise dormant ideologi cal resistance significantly increasing the likelihood of the senates refusal to confirm this is readily seen in the remarkably high refusal rate of seventyone percent ten of f ourteen for such nominations when they are also forwarded to senate in which the chie f executives party is in the minority which rightly or wrongly the nominee presumably supported 4 senatorial courtesy closely linked to the consu ltative nominating process 5 nominees perceived political unreliability on the part of the party in power 6 the evident lack of qualification or limited ability of the nominee 7 concerted sustained opposition by interest or pressure groups and 8 fear that the nominee would dramatically alter the courts jurispr udential lineup usually several of these reasons not one alone figure in th rejection of nominee to which poor timing and poor presidential management of nomination eg reagan in borks case could readily be added209 another scholar in analyzing the illfa ted nominations of abe fortas 1968 clement f haynsworth jr 1969 g rrold carswell 1970 and robert h bork 1987 has focused on the ric h interplay among the three leading factors associated with unsuccessful supreme court nomin ations specifica lly the senates perception of the nominees ideology th timing of the nomination and less appreciated factor presidential mana gement of the conf irmation process210 the timing of nomination may create pr oblems for confirmation of supreme court nominee especially against an ection backdrop timing for example might be less favorable for nomination if it is ma during the last year of presidents term if the president is not seeking ree lection if his reelection prospects are doubtful or if an ffyear election is approaching in which the presidents party is expected to lose senate seats such circ umstances might influence some senators to delay action on nomination in order to allow the next president to make the appointment or the ne xt senate to decide whether to confirm211 nominees prospects also may be put in jeopardy if president has not used careful presidential management to pave the way for smooth confirmation process among other things sound presidential ma nagement of the process it has been suggested entails goodfaith consultation with the senate before choosing nominee

on january 26 1925 the senate reco mmitted the supreme court nomination of attorney general harlan f stone to the judiciary committee earlier on january 21 the judiciary committee had favorably re ported the nomination to the senate however one historian wrote stones unanimous judiciary committee approval ran into trouble when it reached the senate floor219 principal point of concern to some senators was the decision made by stone as attorney general in december 1924 to expand federal criminal investigation of senator burton k wheeler dmt an investigation initiated by stones predecessor as attorney general harry daugherty stones most prominent critic on this point montanas other democratic senator thomas j walsh demanded that th nomination be returned to the judiciary committee220 by

majority leader george j mitchell dme explained the need to delay the thomas vote it is most unfortunate that we have been placed in this situation but events which ar unpredictable unplanned and unfortunate can and frequently do intervene and cause change in the plans of human beings that has now occurred in this matter in my judgment for that reason i believe the action we have taken to change the time of the scheduled vote until next tuesday october 15 and to gi ve time for further inquiry into this matter by the judiciary committee is an appropriate action sen george j mitchell

judicial officers in recent years the most common practice of new appointees has been to take their judicial oath in private usually within the court and as desired by the presidents who nominated them to take their constitutional oaths in nationally televised ceremonies at the white house229 subsequently the court itself in its courtroom also affords public recognition to the new justices

the new justice publicly takes his or her courtroom seat alongside the other members of the court231 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31989crs67 conclusion over the course of more than two centuries the supreme court appointment process has undergone important changes while rema ining constant in other key respects the process is now much longer than it used to be from the appointment of the first justices in 1789 continuing well into the 20th century most senate confirmations of supreme court nomin ees occurred within week of the nominations being made by the president in recent decades by contrast it has become the norm for appointment to the c ourt from nomination by the president to confirmation by the senate to take from tw to three months with the process even longer if nominati on is controversial prior to 1868 the senate judiciar committee sometimes was excluded from or played perfunctory role in the ppointment process but now the judiciary committee rather than the senate as whole invariably assumes the principal responsibility for investigating the back ground and qualifications of each supreme court nominee and typically the committee c onducts close intensive investigation of each nominee the process is also much more open now than it once was from the outset starting with george washington and fo r more than hundred years thereafter presidents transmitted their nominations to the senate without pub lic fanfare and the confirmation process that followed in the senate judiciary committee and the senate as whole likewise occurred away from public view in closed executive sessions by contrast in the modern appointment pr ocess presidents typically announce their supreme court nominations to the nation before broadcast television cameras in carefully staged presidential news events in turn nearly all of the official confirmation process that follows confirmation hearings by the judiciary committee the committees vote on the nominee senate debate and finally senate vote on the nomination is conducted in pub lic ssion r eceives intensive news media coverage and is wa tched by hundreds of thous ands and sometimes millions of american television viewers in another major change from earlier practice there are now many more participants in the supreme court appoin tment process historically nominees did not participate in the appoin tment process but now they regularly appear before the judiciary committee likewise in the modern era public witnesses testify during each confirmation hearing among the witnesses are representatives of powerful interest groups which often take positi ons in support of or in opposition to nominees confirmation if nominee is c ontroversial intere st groups may commit themselves to sustained involvement in the confirmation pro cess mounting support for or opposition to nominee at the very beginning of the process and seeking through publicity lobbying and grassroots fforts of their members to influence how both the judiciary committee and the senate as whole vote on the nomination from the beginning an almost unchanging theme underlying the supreme court appointment process has been the assumed need for excellence or merit in nominee as requisite for appointment to the c ourt the continuing expectation of highhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31989crs68 qualification in nominees has been demonstr ated by the senates periodic rejection of nominees for alleged lack of qualification also from the beginning politics as well as the search for excellence has played continuing important role in supreme court appointments the political nature of the supreme cour t appointment process become s especially apparent when president submits nominee with controversial views there are sharp partisan or ideological differences between the president and the senate or the outcome of important constitutional issues before the court is seen to be at stake under these and other circumstances divisi ons may occur in the senate bringing to the fore the differing political views of senators supporting and those opposing the nominee if the nomination of person to the supreme court sometimes produces confirmation battle s the appointment process at othe r times is remarkable for its lack of conflict particularly when the senate votes overwhelmingly for confirmation various factors might be present when supreme court appointment process is characterized more by harmony than by c onflict at the start of the process for example there might be close consultation between the president and senate members over suitable candidates for th court the president may choose distinguished uncontroversial nominee who immediately attracts widespread support from senators of both parties the presidents party might be in firm numerical superiority in the senate thus discouraging detractors of the nominee from mounting vigorous opposition or partic ular court vacancy might not be regarded as of great moment to the future of the court in c ontrast to vacancy situations where opposing political interests perceive very much to be at stake over more than two centuries the s upreme court appoin tment process has remained constant in one other constituti onally fundamental respect in the sharing of the appointment power between the pres ident and the senate justice has ever been appointed for life to the court except through this shared process of appointment although as noted earlier pr esidents on rare occasions have made temporary recess appointment s to the court without the senates consent whenever new supreme court vacancy occurs the president and the senate face situation that is both unique and familiar unique are the political circumstances of the moment and the legal controversies that l oom before the court at that point in time familiar are the basic roles to be performed in the appointment process following pattern adhered to for more than 200 years the president and the senate will again share the appointment power one will nominate the other will decide whether to confirm only when the two reach agreement may new justice join eight others on the
