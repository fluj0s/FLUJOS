medicaid and uninsured patients dsh payments for mental hospitals cannot exceed an aggregate cap based on percentage of such payments in 1995 however within these broad guidelines states also have great deal of discretion in designating dsh hospitals and calculating adjustments for them for this reason congress has required states to report the methods used to identify and pay dsh hospitals and the payments made to each of the identiﬁed hospitals annual state reporting however is not yet being routinely collected by the centers on medicare and medicaid services cms congress has intervened

disp roportionate share dsh adjustments to the payment rates of hospitals treating large numbers of lowincome and medicaid patients this provision is intended to recognize the disadvantaged situation of those hospitals although th requirement was tablished in 1981 dsh payments did not become significant part of the program until after 1989 when they grew from just under 1 billion to almost 17 billion by 1992 during that time states medicaid budgets were facing numbe r of upward pressures while states were learning about financing techniques that made it easier to collect increased dsh payments from the federal government in 1991 congress intervened to control the growth of dsh payments by limiting the amounts available to each state and setting national limits the law was successful the rapid growth in dsh pa yments had been halted in 2005 the most recent year for which data were available total reported dsh payments were 17 billion1 today states dsh payments cannot exceed an allotment amount calculated based on statutory formula for that state states must define in their state medicaid plan hospitals qualifying as ds h hospitals and dsh payment formulas dsh hospitals must include at least all hospitals meeting minimum criteria and may not include hospitals that have medicaid utilization rate below 1 the dsh payment formula also must meet minimum criteria and dsh payments for any specific hospital cannot exceed hospital specific cap based on the unreimbursed costs of providing hospital services to medicaid and uninsured patients dsh payments for mental hospitals cannot exceed an aggregate cap based on percentage of such payments in 1995 however within these broad guidelines states also have great deal of discretion in designating dsh hospitals and

federalstate program providing medical assistance for specified groups of lowincome persons who are age d blind disabled or members of families with children within federal guidelines each state designs and administers its own program thus there is substantial vari ation among the states in terms of persons covered types of be nefits provided and payment rates for covered services the federal government shares in the cost of medicaid services through variable matching formula after state pays for medicaidcovered service it makes claim for the federal share of the payment and is reimbur sed at the federal matching rate for that state the federa l matching rate known as the federal medical assistance percentage fmap is inversely related to states per capita income and may range from 50 to

d sh adjustment was established by congress in 1981 the dsh provision was included in package of provisions referred to as the boren amendment after its sponsor david boren who was democratic senator from ok lahoma prior to 1981 state medicaid programs were required to follow medicare reimbursement prin ciples in paying for inpatient hospital services medicare utilized reasonable cost system for paying for hospital services at that time as result every state used reasonable cost system to pay for medicaid services the boren amendment was intended to give states greater flexibility to use other payment methods and at the same time provide protections for hospitals specifically hospitals with rge caseloads of lowincome and uninsured patients the protections in cluded requirement that states make assurances to the secretary that payment rates were reasonable and adequate and that states take into account the situation of hospitals wh ich serve disproporti onate number of low income patients with special needs by raising payment rates dsh adjustments for those hospitals the requirement to make dsh adjustments implicitly recognized the disadvantaged situation of hospitals whic h treated large numbers of medicaid and other lowincome patients and which had to depend on the relatively low payment rates of most medicaid programs at the time in the years between 1986 and 1991 however dsh payments grew dramatically prompting congress to establish ceilings on each states dsh payments on the amounts that individual hosp itals can receive and to establish other rules regarding dsh payments table 2 total federal and state medicaid disproportionate share payments and percentage change 19902005 by fiscal year in billions of dollars yeartotal medicaid dsh paymentspercentage

tabulations of percentage growth today the federal share of dsh payments are limited to levels that are calculated based on formula the formulabased ceilings referred to as dsh allotments are calculated by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and promulgated in the federal register state allotments state dsh allotments are the maximum amount of federal matching payments that each state is permitted to claim for dsh payments dsh allotments have both state and national limitations that are speci fied in title xix section 1923 of the social security act total dsh payments across all 50 states may be more than 12 of the total amount of medicaid medi cal assistance spendi ng during the fiscal year as result of this rule cms must publish preliminary dsh allotments before the start of the fiscal year that are based on estimated total medicaid outlays only after the end of the fiscal year when actual expenditure data are available are final dsh allotments published statebystate dsh allotme nts were specified in statute for 19982002 after that each states dsh allotment was calcula ted based on the prior years amount and subjected to set of rules defining min imum and maximum amounts all of these rules have been modified number of times in subsequent legisl ation current laws and allotment amounts are discussed in this section for more complete information on legislative activity related to dsh see section below entitled legislative history each states allotment can be more th an the greater of the prior years amount or 12 of total medical assistance payments for the prior year this ensures that states with dsh allotments above 12 of total medical assistance spending referred to as high dsh states receive allotments that do not grow until the dsh allotments are below 12 of medical assistance spending in each state this rule is vestige of the original dsh allotments established in 1991 wh ich were set based on historical dsh spending the states that had been paying the largest dsh payments relative to other medicaid payments received higher allotments but those amounts did not increase over time states ma king the smallest historical payments received allotments that were to increase each year until they reached the 12 cap in general to arrive at each states dsh allotment for the years after 2002 the prior years amount is

adjustments to at least those hospitals meeting certain minimum criteria most states expand on the minimum criteria to allow additional hospitals to be designated as dsh becau of the flexibility there is great amount of variation across the states in the number and types of hospitals that are designated as dsh at minimum states must include all hospitals with 1 medicaid inpatient utilization rate in excess of one standard devia tion above the mean rate for the statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97483crs8 6 the standard deviation is statistical asure of the dispersion of hospitals utilization rates around the average the use of this measure identifies hospitals whose medicaid utilization is unusually high the lowincome utilization rate is the sum of two fractions medicaid payments plus state and local subsidie s divided by total patient care revenues and inpatient charges attributable to charity care other than charity care subsidized by state or local government divided by total inpatient charges 7 there are exceptions to this rule for child rens hospitals hospitals that do not offer non emergency obstetric services and certain rural hospitals 8 the medicaid utilization rate is defined as the number of days of care furnished to medicaid beneficiaries during given period divided by the total number of days of care provided during the period or 2 lowincome utilization rate of 256 to be included as dsh hospital the hospital must retain at least two obstetric ians with staff privileges willing to serve medicaid patients7 hospital cannot be identified as dsh hospital if its medicaid utilization rate is below 18 minimum and maximum dsh payments to hospitals even more flexibility is available in terms of the form ulas and methods stat use to distribute dsh funds among hospitals the statute pr ovides only the principles by which states should distribute the funds and sets minimum and maximum payment amounts but does not address the amount of funds the st ates pay to individual dsh hospitals from their capped allotment states must make minimum payments to dsh hospitals using either the medicare methodology or formula providing payments that increase as the hospitals medicaid inpatient utilization rate increases over the states average if state uses its own formula it may vary payments to different types of hospitals as long as all hospitals of each type are treated equally and adjustments are reasonably related to the hospitals medi caid or lowincome patient volume and the minimum payment requirement is met since obra 93 dsh payments to indivi dual hospitals are subject to cap these hospitalspecific limits in general prohibit hospitals from receiving dsh payments that exceed the unreimbursed costs incurred of furnishing hospitals services to individuals who are eligible for medicaid and those who have health insurance for services providing during the period the hospitalspecific cap was phasedin for certain public hospitals and became effective for private hospitals in 1995 this cap when fully phased in may ve been the force behind the large drop in total dsh payments in fy1996 there are however exceptions to this rule the hospital specific cap for certain public hosp itals in california is equal to 175 of those unreimbursed costs for two stat fiscal years beginning in 2003 all public hospitals were subject to hospitalspecifi c cap of 175

health bills ceilings and special rules are routinely moved about or debated further the financing arrangements that congress has repeatedly tried to address with dsh amendments continues to vex the administration and congress as evidenced by recent regulations limiting certain financing arrangements11 this section describes why and how dsh law was changed and shaped over time the requirement to make dsh payments was originally established in 1981 but by the late eighties members of congress became aware that many states were not making those payments several congressiona l actions followed including 1986 provision aimed at supporting state flex ibility to make dsh payments and 1987 provisions requiring states to submit medicaid plan amendment describing their dsh policies and establishing certain minimum standards and payments12 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1986 obra 86 pl 99509 obra 86 included provision clarifying that the health care financing administration now cms had authority to limit payments adjustments to dsh hospitals omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 obra 87 pl 100203 specifically congress required that each state describe the criteria used to designate hospitals as dsh hospitals and fine the formulas used to calculate the increase in the payment rate the dsh adju stment for inpatient services provided by these hospitals obra 87 included minimum criteria for defining hospital as dsh hospital and minimum criteria for calculating dsh adjustments for purposes of designating hospitals as dsh obra 87 required that at least those hospitals

medicaid plans specify the increase in payment to be made to dsh hospitals and gave states two options for determining dsh payment amounts states were allowed to make minimum payments to dsh hospitals

formula could vary paym ents to different types of hospitals as long as all hospitals of each type were treated equally and adjustments were reasonably related to the hospital s medicaid or lowincome patient volume again upper payments limits were established following the passage of obra 87 and until 1990 total payments for dsh adjustments remained relatively low until combination of events occurred that resulted in rise in dsh adjustments from just under 1 billion in fy1990 to 174 billion two fiscal years later14 in the late 1980s states were experiencing number of upward pressures on their medicaid budget s general health care inflation was rising at unprecedented high rates nationa l health spending timated by the centers for medicare and medicaid rvices cms then known as hcfa rose by over 20 during the 1990 to 1992 period15 the medical component of the consumer price index common measure of health care pr ices rose by almost 17 at the same time recession was increasing the rolls of eligible medicaid beneficiaries while states were being required to phasein number of mandatory eligibility expansions in addition the recession shrank the tax base from which states could fund increasing program costs in response to these pre ssures states turned to funds donated by health care providers or taxes paid by t hose providers to leve rage federal matching payments these factors combined led to an enrollment increase of more than 24 or 6 million new people on the medicaid rolls between 1990 and 1992 and incited states to identify funding mechanisms to in crease the flow of federal funds into their stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97483crs14 16 obra 90 included two provisions addressing provider specific taxes that were interpreted as conflicting the first provision

1991 may 10 1991 october 11 1990 prepared by richard ku sserow inspector general washington continuedthree funding techniques began to sp read among the states to leverage additional federal medicaid f unds the three approaches were collecting donations collecting providerspecific taxes and tran sferring funds from different levels of governments or governmental entities to the state govern ment the funds collected through one or more of the three mechanisms were aggregated at the statelevel and used for the state share of medicaid spendi ng often paying back the very providers who gave the state the money in the first place the medicaid spending at that time was usually claimed as dsh payments and would be matc hed with federal medicaid matching funds all or part of the additional federal m oney generated through these mechanisms would be returned to the states at the time few were aware of the potential for misuse and for escalating federal medicaid spending except for the health care financing administration hcfa now cms in 1988 hcfa indicated that it planned to issue regulations limiting the use of donations as the state s share of medicaid the agency also provided instructions to state medicaid programs that attempted to distinguish between taxes of general applicability that would be allowable as state share of medicaid and providerspecific taxes for which federal matching medicaid payments would not be allowable the technical and miscella neous revenue act of 1988 tamra pl 100647 before hcfa could issue final regu lations defining its position congress intervened tamra included provision prohibiting the secretary from issuing final rules that would change the treatment of voluntary contributions or provider specific taxes before may 1 1989 the pr

memorandum 18 inspector general memorandum data july 25 1991schemes were used by states to reduce the effective state share of the program forcing the federal government to pay more for medicaid dsh adjustments rose coinciding with the use of providerspecific taxes and donations dsh had become the most popul ar mechanism for returning targeted taxes or donations back to the hospitals since dsh adjustments were uncapped and did not need to be tied to pa rticular beneficiaries or serv ices some providers shared in the proceeds that states generated by the federal matching payments on the donation and tax programs states returned dsh payments to those donors in excess of their contribution or in creased their payment rates18 medicaid voluntary contribution and providerspecific tax amendments of 1991 pl 102234 after intense negotiations between the white house the governors and the congress the medicaid voluntary c ontribution and providerspecific tax amendments of 1991 pl 102234 was passed in november of that year the law established the first upper bounds on dsh payments and prohibited the use of donated funds and health care related taxes that were not broadbased for the purpose of claiming federal matching payments it established cap on the portion of the state share of medicaid spending that coul d be raised through providerspecific taxes and established aggregate national and state limits on dsh payments the national limit on dsh adjustments was set at 12 of medicaid costs in any year and beginning in 1993 state dsh adjustment s would be limited to published amounts above which federal ma tching payments would not be available under the law each state would be eligible to receive the dsh adjustment amount published in the federal register for that year and more than that amount the published amount for each fiscal year would be based on 1992 payments states with 1992 dsh adjustments exceeding 12 of their 1992 medicaid costs would continue to receive allotments at thei r 1992 level until those payments became 12 of total medicaid spending in that state these states were classified as high dsh states states with 1992 dsh payments below 12 could receive allotments increasing their dsh adjustments subject to formula up to limit of 12 the medicaid voluntary c ontribution and providers pecific tax amendments specifically protected intergovernmental transfers while restricting the use of the other two funding mechanisms the w prohibited the secretary of hhs from limiting the use as the nonfede ral share of medicaid of funds derived from state or local taxes or funds transferred by units of government within the state despite the remaining in tergovernmental transfer loophole the upper caps on dsh payments had significant impact on total dsh spending the rapid climbhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97483crs16 19 more recently however intergovernmental tran sfers have increasingly been used to raise the federal share of medicaid instead of claiming dsh payments with the intergovernmental funds states have claime d inflated hospital charges for certain public hospitals see crs report rl31021 medicaid upper payment limits and intergovernmental transfers current issues and recent regulatory and legislative action by elicia j herz 20 medicaid inpatient utilization means the total number of medicaid inpatient days in cost reporting period divided by the total number of the hospitals inpatient days in the same periodin dsh payments had been stopped19 concerns then turned to the distribution of those payments among hospitals there we re anecdotal reports that some hospitals were receiving large dsh payments even though they had few medicaid patients and that other hospitals were receiving dsh pa yments so large that the amount of their dsh payments exceeded the amount of uncompensated care provided by the hospital omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 in response to these concerns cong ress included in obra 1993 number of provisions intended to better target dsh hospital payments the policies in obra 1993 were different from earlie r laws limiting dsh payments in that the earlier laws sought only to cap total dsh payments fl owing to the states obra 1993 however set limits on the amounts of dsh payments that individual hospitals would be allowed to receive and limited states flex ibility to designate hospitals as dsh hospitals it prohibited signation of hospital as dsh hospital for purposes of medicaid reimbursement unless the hospital has medicaid inpatient utilization rate of at least 120 it also limited dsh adjustments to more than the costs of providing inpatient and outpa tient services to medicaid and uninsured patients less payments received from medicaid and uninsured patients the hospitalspecific dsh cap was phasedin for certain public hospitals and later became effective for private hospitals after obra93 was passed ds h payments to hospitals continued to be focus of congressional atten tion despite the laws success in stopping their rapid growth this was because dsh payments were bot h large and little information existed on what precisely those payments accomplished as result dsh again became the target of congressional budget cutters balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 provisions were included in bba 97 to reduce dsh spending and to address other issues affecting dsh the formulabased dsh llotments set into law in 1991 were replaced with fixed dsh allotments for states for 1998 through 2002 the federal share of dsh payments were set at 103 billion in 1998 approximately 18 billion if matched by states at the 57 federal43 state matching rate and were to decline to 85 billion by 2002 approximately 15 billion if matched by state at the 5743 rate httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97483crs17 bba 97 also imposed hospitalspecific cap on dsh payments to mental health facilities beginning in 2003 dsh payments to institutions for mental

medicaid patients served by such hospitals payments made to each of the identified dsh hospitals we re required to be reporte d annually the bill also clarified that dsh payments be made directly by

fy2007 for tennessee equal to the greater of the amount that the secretary determines is equal to its federal matching for dsh hospital payment for the demonstration year ending in 2006 or 280 million the provision however only allows for dsh pa yments of 30 of that amount in addition the provision would allow tenness ee to submit state plan amendment describing its dsh methodologies the s ecretary is instructed to consider dsh payments under this provision as expe nditures under the states tenncare demonstration project when determining budget neutra lity of the project in addition trhca established ds h allotment for hawaii of 10 million uses of disproportionate share funds major reason for the perennial focus on dsh payments is that very little reporting information about the uses of dsh funds has in the past been required of states despite reporting provisions in the law since 1997 combined with the size of dsh payments the inability to precisely sa what the funds are used for leads to concern that the program is either unn ecessary or abused there has been some evidence that dsh payments may be only tenuously related to their original purpose hospitals have reported receiving only portion of reported dsh payments while an even smaller portion goes to hospitals that serve disproportionate share of medicaid and lowincome beneficiaries relative to other hospitals in 1994 the urban institute conducted survey of stat on medicaid dsh practices they found that about half of the 1993 dsh payments were used to pay providers back for their cont ributions about onesixth of reported payments went to private and county providers and state hosp itals while onethird was kept by the states to finance diverse expenditures including general health and welfare expenditures21 based on state reporting collected by cms for only few years and from only portion of the states mark merlis reported that states vary widely in the degree to which they have targeted payments to public hospitals and mental hospitals for fy1998fy2002 some states paid nearly ll dsh payments to private general hospitals for others however nearly all payments went to public mental hospitals in addition some states distributed funds among large number of hospitals whereas others make dsh payments to only handful of facilities22 reporting requirements originally blished in bba 97 were

congressional report c9401 january 1 1994 p 26 24 cbo fact sheet march 2007 baseline medicare 25 total medicaid payments to inpatient hospitals were 420 billion excluding mental hospitals in 2005 based on cms64 state financial reports50262 to implement the reporting and uditing requirements for dsh payments under the mma provisions as of the date of this publication the rule has not been finalized and detailed state reporting is still not being required for dsh payments how are medicaid disproportionate share adjustments different from medicare disproportionate share adjustments medicaid and medicare dsh hospital adjustments are similar in that the major basis for designating hospitals to receive payments is the proportion of services provided to lowincome patients for medicare designation though only hospitals meeting the medicare criteria qualify for payments medicare dsh hospital is one that has disproportionate patient percentage that ex ceeds certain levels depending upon the type of hospital hospitals disproportionate pa tient percentage is defined as the hospitals total number of i npatient days attributable to federal ssi medicare beneficiaries divided by the to tal number of medicar patients days plus the number of medicaid patient days divided by the total patient days for medicaid designation on the other hand states are not limited to the federal criteria as long as at least those hospitals meeting the min imum criteria are classified as dsh the state may establish more liberal met hodology of designating dsh hospitals calculating payment adjustments for dsh hospitals can be different for medicaid and medicare dsh hospitals although states may use the medicare payment methodology to calculate medicaid dsh payments most states do not and many of those that do use the medicare methodology also use another methodology for different types of hospitals propac found in 1994 that there is s triking disparity between medicare and medicaid dsh expenditures both in tota l amounts and as proportions of inpatient hospital spending then medicare ds h adjustments were 27 billion and only equal to just over 4 of medicare hospital spending co mpared to medicaid payments of well over 10 billion equal to about onethird of medicaid hospital payments23 more recently this disparity is even more striking medicare dsh adjustments were estimated to be 95 billion in 2006 or 69 of medicare hospital inpatient care24 2005 medicaid dsh payments were over 171 b illion or more than 40 of the size of regular medicaid payments to hosp itals for general inpatient services25
