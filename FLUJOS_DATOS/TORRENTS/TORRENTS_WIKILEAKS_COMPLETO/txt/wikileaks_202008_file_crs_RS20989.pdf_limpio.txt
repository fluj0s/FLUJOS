adjusting three features of the tax the top rate is to be gradually lowered2 the applicable exclusion amount is to be gradually raised3 the credit for death taxes estate or inheritance taxes paid to state is to be gradually lowered and replaced by deduction for such taxes4 also the 5 surtax used to recapture the benefits of the graduated tax rates on taxableestates of over 10000000 is repealed 5 and after the applicable exclusion amount has surpassed th 1300 000 level used to protect fa mily owned businesses the family owned business deduction is repealed6 applicable exclusion amount the applicable excl usion amount is unified amount which can be exempted from the gift and or estate tax to the extent it is used to offset taxable gifts it is unavailable to offset the taxable estate7 after the applicable exclusion amount surpasses 1000000 in the year 2004 the amount which may be exempted from gifts is limited to 1000000 with the remainder of the exempt amount reserved to the taxable estate credit for state taxes an estate is allowed credit for state death taxes including estate inheritance legacy or succession taxes actually paid by the estate or any heir with respect to property included in the federal gross estate the internal revenue code contains table setting out the limits for the allowable state death tax credit graduated by the size of the adjusted taxable estate the taxable estate ss 60000 currently the maximum allowable credit is the lesser of the net tax paid to the state or the statutory ceiling the maximum state death tax credit would be 1082800 plus 16 of the adjusted taxable estate above 100400008 most states use the maximum credit allowed under 2001b to constitute the st ates estate tax the act gradually reduces this credit and then replaces it with deduction phase out of graduated rates under current law the ffect of the graduated rates is phased out for estate and gift tr ansfers exceeding 10000000 this phase out is accomplished by adding 5 tax to the tax on taxable transfers over this amount until the benefit of the graduated rates has been recaptured and the average rate for the entire taxable estate is 55 once the recapture is complete 55 again becomes the tax rate9 this provision is repealed for estate s of decedents dying after december 31 2001httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20989crs3 10 26 usc 2057 11 26 usc

generationskipping tax is accomplished primarily through lowering the rates and increasing the lif etime exemption the generationskipping transfer tax is imposed at the top rate of the estate tax11 therefore when the top rate of the estate tax is lowered unde r the act it has the effect of lowering the generation skipping tax as well the lifetime exemption is increased by making the exemption equal to the estate tax applicable exclusion amount12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20989crs4 13 pl 10716 511c see discussion above 14 pl 10716 511d 15 pl 10716 521 16 all of the gift tax exemptions and deductions are preserved including the exemption of gifts to ones spouse 26 usc 2523 the char itable deduction 26 usc 2522 the 10000 per donee annual exemptions 26 usc 2503b and the exemption for educational and medical gifts 26 usc 2503e 17 26 usc 2501 18 26 usc 2001cmodification of the gift tax the gift tax was not repealed as originally proposed in order to protect the integrity of the income tax it was felt that absent gift tax income producing property could be gifted to taxpayers in lower brackets sold the taxes paid and the proceeds gifted back to the higher bracket taxpayer thus avoidi ng great amounts of income tax on the sale of capital assets the gift tax was modified by lowering the rates and increasing the applicable exclusion amount the top rate of the gift tax declines with th top rate of the estate tax13 after the repeal of the estate tax the top gift tax rate is lowered to 35 of the excess over 50000014 the applicable exclusion amount is raised to 1000000 in the year 2002 this amount remains constant th rough the phase out period of the estate tax and after the repeal of the estate tax15 thus when the unified app licable exclusi on amount increases for the estate tax in the phase out pe riod only 1000000 may be us ed to cover lifetime transfers ie gifts the tax on taxable gift16 is measured initially by the value of the transferred property and is cumulative in nature17 the applicable rate of tax on taxable gift is determined by the total of the donors lifetime taxable gifts the applicable rate of tax on each successive lifetime taxable gift is higher than on previous gifts18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20989crs5 19 26 usc 1014 20 pl 10716 541 21 pl 10716 542gift tax rate schedule for gifts made after december 31 2009 tentative tax amount

tax rules basis is used to determine gain on the sale of capital assets for income tax purposes often basis and cost are equivalent generally to determine taxable income from sale of capital asset the basis in that asset is subtracted from the sale price currently the basis in property received from decedent is steppedup basis19 the inheritor of property instead of having the basis of the one from which he received the property carryover basis has basis in the prope rty of the fair market value of the property at the date of death of the decedent the purpose of the steppedup basis rule was to avoid double taxation the property had been subject to the estate tax if the property had carryover basis and was sold after inheritance there would be capital gain subject to the income tax the use of the steppedup basis eliminates this capital gain and thus the income tax on the sale with the repeal of the estate tax this need for the steppedup basis rules will be removed the act repeals the steppedup basis rule at the end of the year 2009 when the estate tax is repealed20 the new basis rule will be that the basis in property received from decedent is the lesser of carryover basis or the fair market value of the property on the date of death of the decedent21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20989crs6 22 the applicable exclusion amount and all property passing to the spouse under the unlimited marital deduction would not be subject to the estate tax while still receiving the steppedup basis and thus avoiding the income tax on the subsequent sale of the property 23 pl 10716 542 decedent who
