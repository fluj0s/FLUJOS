defense and the 911 commission report recommended that congress regularly assess the ability of northern command to defend the united states against military threats protecting us airspace may require improvements in detecting aircraft and cruise missiles making quick operational decisions and intercepting them number of options exist in each of these areas variety of issues must be weighed including expediency cost and minimizing conflicts with civ ilian aviation this report will be updated background in response to the cold war threat of soviet bombers and cruise missiles the department of defense dod established the north am erican air defense command norad in19581 norad deployed network of radars fighter aircraft and surface toair missiles sams around the united stat the emergence of intercontinental ballistic missiles in the 1960s dr ew attention away from us air defenses the air and cruise missile threat appeared to decline further with the soviet unions demise and growing us superiority over other hostile air forces because an air attack on the united states appeared unlikely dod relaxed its posture by september 11 2001 only 14 air force fighters at 7 bases were assigned to protect the continental united states conus from air attacks2 this number has subsequently been increased to over 100 today norad operates radars in the unite d states and canada oriented outward to detect air attacks from foreign c ountries norad augments these radars by communicating with the federal aviation administration faa which operates its own radars and by flying e3

the air force had permanently transferred the homel and defense air patrol mission to the air national guard shifting more than 84 million from the air force operations and maintenance budget3 due to the september 11 attacks and the growing threat of cruise missiles some policy makers are reevaluating todays modest us air defenses improving defense of us airspace poses numerous challenges to defense planners who must assess the pros and cons of several military options as part of its oversight role congress may be called upon to assess these options and determine the most effective mix of systems employed indeed the 911 commission report h ttpwww911commissiongov specifically recommended that dod and congressional overs ight committees should regularly assess the adequacy of northern commands strategi and planning to defend the united states against military threats to the homeland subsequent congressi onal legislation on intelligence reform hr 10 and s 2845 do not directly addre ss this recommendation air defense challenges effectively protecting us airspace requires detecting threatening aircraft and cruise missiles making decisions on how to address these threats called command and control or c2 and negating these threats on j une 9 2004 small aircraft carrying the governor of kentucky flew into rest ricted airspace around washington dc the misidentified aircraft caused panic among capitol hill employees and two f15s were scrambled to intercept the aircraft4 this event suggests that 2½ years after the september 11 attacks effective defense of us airspace is still in question surveillance detecting and tracking airborne threats to the united states are complicated by environment and enemy tactics the large volume of airspace that must be surveyed presents one key environmenta l challenge airspace over the continental united states is estimated at approximately 3 million square miles5 enemy tactics could include flying low to the ground which make s detection difficult or applying stealth technology which reduces an ai rcrafts vulnerability to radar detection as the september 11th hijackers demonstrated turn ing commercial or civil aircra ft into weapons is another tactic that would make threat detection difficult command control expediently identifying airborne threats and accurately verifying that they are not civilian or friendly military aircraft is key air defense challenge the large amount of air traffi c within conus will lik ely make separating friend from foe difficult faa data show that on given day over 80000 distinct domestic

do not in clude international flights or the approximately 200000 civil aircraft in the ited states that fly some 24 million flight hours annually nor does this num ber include military aircraft th at fly within both civilian and military airspace air defense c2 over conus is further comp licated by the fact that decision making will not be solely military enterprise civil entities such as the faa and the us customs service and military authorities will require seamless communications and hardware interoperability to make effective decisions intercept antiaircraft artillery surfacetoair missiles sams or military aircraft can shoot down enemy aircraft and cruise missile s in dire situations hijacked civilian aircraft may also need to be shot down alt hough negating this threat in other ways will likely be preferred minimizing civilian cas ualties both in the air and on the ground may be key challenge especially if the threaten ing aircraft or missile carries weapons of mass destruction adequately covering the large number of ssets eg cities nuclear power plants military facilities nati onal buildings and monuments will also be challenging options and issues following the terrorist attacks of ptember 11 2001 dod increased the resources devoted to conus air defense by deploying an aircraft carrier to new york harbor and by flying fighter caps over major cities nato allies contributed to this effort called operation noble eagle by flying awacs aircraft ove r conus although these efforts were welcome they appear unsustainable in the long term as operation noble eagle costs dod about 3 billion per year7 dod must still develop longterm plan for improving air and cruise ssile defense of conus when considering air defense options dod may evaluate factors such as expediency potential impact on commercial and civil air traffic potential competition with other military needs and minimizing collateral damage and civilian casualties designing defense that can address the whole range of potential threats eg enemy bombe rs stealthy cruise missiles and hijacked commercial aircraft yet be optimized to address the most likely or most dangerous threat may also be key challenge cost is another key consider ation estimated costs for air and cruise missile defense of conus vary widely depending on assump tions regarding the threat eg number of attackers flight characteristics and payload what is to be protected system effectiveness the number of leakers that is acceptable and the exact mix of systems deployed 1986 study timated that system capable of defeating soviet air and cruise missile attack would cost on the order of 70 b illion8 1989 study estimated that fielding system that could defend the 20 largest us cities and 50 military installations from large scale air and cruise missile attack would cost between 54 billion and 170 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21394crs4 9 arthur charo continental air defense neglected dimension

neighborhood of 30 billion with annua l operating costs on the order of 1 billion10 surveillance surveillance radars can be di vided into three categories ground based airborne and spacebase d the primary advantage of groundbased radars is that they tend to be less expensive to field and operate than other radars shortcoming of groundbased radars is that they tend to ve trouble detecting low flying aircraft features such as mountains and buildings bl ock or clutter the radar picture and the earths curvature leaves gaps in coverage that lowflying threats can exploit norad already operates network of ground base d radars and it will likely serve as one component of conus defense surveillance system improve ments in this network may be considered however including upgrading the radar to improve its ability to detect stealthy threats deploying more radars to cove r gaps in coverage and fielding radars that survey airspace within conus to augm ent todays outward looking radars airborne radars offer some advantages over ground based radars they are more mobile because they operate tens of thousands of feet bove the earth they are not as subject to radar clutter and are thus well ited to detect low flying and in some cases stealthy aircraft the e3 awacs and e2c hawkeye surveillance aircraft are examples of current airborne sensors their main disadvantage is that they cost more to field and operate than groundbased radars the air force estimates that the e3 alone costs 123 million in 1998 dollars the fps117 long range air search radar that forms the backbone of norads north warning system in contrast costs between 58 and 22 million11 operating costs for aircraft are similarly hi gher than operating costs for ground systems unmanned aerial vehicles uavs use has increased militarily and commercially some suggest that uavs could help conduct surveillance over conus for enemy aircraft and cruise missiles while uavs cost less to field and ope rate than manned aircraft concerns exist about operating these aircraft over populated areas or in airspace heavily used by civilian aircraft the faa curren tly prohibits uavs from flying in commercial us airspace although these restrictions could be change d also todays uavs operate sensors optimized for ground surveillance not air surveillance using uavs for air defense would require replacing the sens ors on current uavs or fielding new uavs radars deployed on aerosta ts tethered unmanned ball oons are less expensive than surveillance aircraft and can also detect low flying aircraft and cruise missiles aerostats are attractive because of their long onstation time they can remain aloft for months aerostats cannot fly cannot be moved rapidly and may prove some hazard to civilian aircraft aerostats are curre

sed radars applicable to air defense surveillance may be developed in the long term but questi ons about technical feasibility and cost effectiveness remain command control several options exist for improving norads air defense c2 capabilities one menu of options focuses on improving norads ability to detect identify and track threats originatin g from conus dod has engaged in 30 million upgrade of norads computers to better integrate faa and military airspace management systems13 other options that might be pursued would be to make permanent ad hoc c2 relationships devise d after september 11th to integrate norad radars with customs service aerostats and with the navys aegis ship radars norad may also wish to find ways to leverage the civil air patrol for air defense the civil air patrol is an auxiliary of the air force and typically flies disaster relief search and rescue and counter drug surveillance missions properly integrated with norad c2 however the civil air patrol might perfo rm niche air defense functions second menu of options pertains to improving norads ability to counter an attack by low flying and stealthy cruise ssiles dod has attemp ted to improve theater air and cruise missile defenses by promoting interoperability among the services and creating single integrated air picture dod may consider expanding these efforts to make them applicable to conus air fense it is not clear that the c2 improvements designed to counter cruise ssile attacks would also help detect and counter threats originating from inside conus another option for improving c2 would be to mandate improved identification friend or foe hardware and procedures for civilian aircraft that operate near high risk areas this could help reduce the number of accidental incursions into restricted airspace whi ch require military response and risk downing civilian aircraft but would likely be resisted by civilian pilots due to increased costs intercept similar to the options for air defense surveillance options to intercept aircraft and cruise missiles can be divide d into surface and airbased each offering strengths and weaknesses figh ter aircraft are well suited to shoot down other aircraft and cruise missiles they are inherently deployable and flexible they also tend to cost more to procure and operate than other intercept options imme diately following september 11th the air force began 24 hour combat air patrols over new york and washington and intermittent patrols over other major cities cost estimates of these patrols vary between 100 million to 200

cbs jan 9 2003 19 hawk surfacetoair missile system fact file httpwwwhqmcusmcmilother personnel and the unanticip ated wear and tear they put on fighter aircraft have led some to recommend reducing these patrols nd search for other intercept solutions15 the costs of using combat aircraft for air defense might be reduced in three ways first combat aircraft could be kept on 15 minut strip alert rather than having them fly patrols during the cold war norad kept aircraft on strip alert at over 100 sites16 some loss of responsiveness would be exp ected on january 6 2002 private aircraft flew into an office building in tampa fl passing over macdill afb in the process the air forces inability to intercept the aircraft before it crashed suggests how strip alert may be less responsive to intercept needs than fi ghter cap another way to reduce the cost of using combat aircraft for air defense woul d be to design aircraft specifically for this mission one company claims it can build an interceptor for 4 million fraction of the cost of modern fighters17 the feasibility of building such low cost combat aircraft is still unproven third potential wa of reducing aircraft costs would be to field airtoair missiles on uavs the air force is currently experimenting with the stinger on its predator uav which reportedly engaged in dogfight with an iraqi fighter aircraft18 dod operates many sam systems the armys patriot the marine corps hawk and the navys shipbased standard missile are examples of sams that could be part of conus air defense sams tend to be less expensive than combat aircraft and carry more missiles the hawk for instance costs approxima tely 25 million and battery can fire 48 missiles19 sam warheads are generally larger than airtoair missile warheads which provides more destru ctive power unlike aircra ft sams cannot chase enemy aircraft and cruise missiles and their depl oyment must be carefully planned unlike combat aircraft sams cannot visually identif target and deter mine if it is hostile regardless of which systems are deployed conus air nd cruise missile defense system will likely be made up of layered elements mix of fighter aircraft and sams or other options is typically more attrac tive than deploying only fighters or only sams similarly defense planners will likely lean toward mix of surveillance platforms and sensors rather than just one type mix of systems reduces the chance of single point failure complicates an adversarys attack planning and can ma ke more effective system determining the best mix however may be critical
