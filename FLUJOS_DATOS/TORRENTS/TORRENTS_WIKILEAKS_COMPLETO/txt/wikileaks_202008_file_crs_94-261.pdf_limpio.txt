summary although the united states intelligence community encompasses large federal agencies the central intelligence agency cia the defense intelligence agency dia the national reconnaissance offi ce the national ge ospatialintelligence agency nga and the national security agency nsa among others neither congress nor the executive branch has regularly made public the total extent of intelligence spending rather intelligen ce programs and personnel are largely contained but not identified within th capacious budget of the department of defense dod this practice has long been criticized by proponents of open government and many argue that the end of the cold war has long since removed any justification for secret budgets in 2004 the 911 commission recommended that the overall amounts of mone being appropriated for na tional intelligence and to its component agencies should longer be kept secret the constitution mandates regular statem ents and accounts of expenditures but the courts have regarded the congress as having the power to define the meaning of the clause from the creation of the modern us intelligence community in the late 1940s congress and the executive branch sh ared determination to keep intelligence spending secret proponents of this practi ce have argued that disclosures of major changes in inte lligence spending from one year to the next would provide hostile parties with information on ne w program or cutbacks that could be exploited to us disadvantage secondly they believe that it would be practically impossible to limit disclosure to total figures and that explanations of what is included or excluded would lead to damaging revelations on the other hand some members dispute these arguments stressing the positive effects of open government nd the distortions of budget information that occur when the budgets of large agencies are classi fied legislation has been twice enacted expressing the sense of the congress that total intelligence spending figures should be made public but on several separate occasions both the house and the senate have voted against making such information public the clinton administration released total appropriations figures for intelligence and intelligencerelated activities for fiscal years 1997 and 1998 but subsequently such numbers ve not been made public legal efforts to force release of intelligence spendi ng figures have been unsuccessful central to consideration of the issue is the composition of the intelligence budget intelligence authorization bills have included not just the national intelligence program the budgets for cia dia nsa et but also wide variety of other intelligence and intelligence related efforts conduc ted by the defense department shifts of tac tical programs into or out of the total intelligence budgets have hitherto been important only to budget analysts disclosing total inte lligence budgets could make such transfers matters of concern to far larger audience legislation reported by the senate intelligence committee in january 2007 s 372 would require that funding for the nati onal intelligence progra m be made public but it does not address other intelligence activities earlier versions of this report were entitled intelligence spending should tota l amounts be made public this report will be updated as circumstances changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94261

total amounts be made public introduction since the creation of the modern us intelligence community after world war ii neither congress nor the executive branch has made public the total extent of intelligence spending except for two fiscal years in the 1990s rather intelligence programs and personnel have largely been contained but not identified within the capacious expanse of the budget of the depa rtment of defense dod this practice has long been criticized by proponents of open government the intelligence reform effort of the mid1970s that led to greater involvement of congress in the oversight of the intelligence community also genera ted number of proposals to make public the amounts spent on intelligence activities many observers subsequently argued that the end of the cold war further reduced the need to keep secret the aggregate amount of intelligence spending according to this view with the dissolution of the soviet union there are few fo reign countries that can take advantage of information about trends in us intelligence spending to develop effec tive countermeasures terrorist organizations it is argued lack the capability of explo iting to tal intelligence spending data in recent years proposals for making public overall tota ls of intelligence spending have come under re newed consideration in 1991 and 1992 legislation was enacted that stated the sense of the congress that the aggregate amount requested and authorized for and spent on inte lligence and intelligen cerelated activities should be disclosed to the public in an ppropriate manner ne vertheless both the house and the senate voted in subseque nt years not to require release of intelligence spending data during the c linton administration di rector of central intelligence dci george tenet twice took th initiative to release total figures for appropriations for intelligence and intelligencerelated activities despite the release of data for fiscal years 1997 and 1998 howev er subsequent ppropriations levels have been made public the issue has not however died the 911 commission in its final report recommended that the overall amounts or the top line of money being appropriated for nati onal intelligence and to its component agencies should longer be kept secret congress should pass parate appropriations act for intelligence defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work1 number of proposals for intelligence reform legislation in 2004 in cluded provisions for making the budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94261public but the legislation ultimately enacted as the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 hereafter referred to as the intelligence reform act did not include provisions for making budget numbers public more recently the fy2007 intellig ence authorization legislation s 372 reported in the senate in january 2007 would require publi cation of budget totals for national but not tactical intelligence programs this report describes the constituent parts of the intelligence budget past practice in handling intelligence authorizations and appropriations the arguments that have been advanced for and against making intelligence spending totals public legal analysis of these issues and review of the implications of postcold war developments on the question it also descri bes past congressional interest in keeping intelligence spending totals secret what constitutes the intelligence budget the meaning of the term intelligence budg et is not easily described although some may assume it is equi valent to the budget of the central intelligence agency in actuality it encompasses wide variety of agencies and functions in various parts of the federal government that are invol ved in intelligence collection analysis and dissemination at the same time some important informati on collection efforts such as reporting by us embassies to the state department are not considered as intelligence activities and their funding is not included in the intelligence budget further complication to be ddressed below is the sepa rate category of intelligence related activities undertaken in dod that are included in overall intelligence spending categories for some purposes it is sufficient to describe intelligence and intelligencerelated activ ities as those authorized by nnual intelligence authorization acts in the context of annual budget reviews both the executive branch and congress have sought comprehensive overview of all intelligence collection systems and activities thus there emerged the concept of an intelligence community not monolithic organization but grouping of g overnmental entities ranging in size from the cia and nsa down to the small intelligence offices of the treasury and energy departments except for the cia this co mmunity consists of components that are integral parts of agencies that are not themselves part of the intelligence community and their budgets are subject to separate au thorization processes thus for instance the state departments bureau of intelligence and research is both part of the intelligence community and an organizati onal component of the department of state its budget is considered as part of the overall intelligence budget and as component of the state department budget similar situations apply on much larger and expensive scale in the defense department since these intelligence components are closely tied to their pare nt departments and share facilities and administrative structure with them it is not always possible to desegregate intelligence and nonintelligence costs with precision for the purposes of this discussion the us intelligence budget is considered to consist of those activities authorized by the annual intelligence authorization acts viz the intelligence and intelligencerelated activities of the following elements of the united states governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs942612 us congress house of representatives 103rd cong 1st sess permanent select committee on intelligence intelligence authorization act

informationgathering efforts can be fine as noted earlier reporting by the state departments foreign service officers is an invaluable adjunct to intelligence collecti on but is not considered an intelligence activity similarly some reconnaissa nce and surveillance activities mostly conducted in dod are very closely akin to intelligence but for administrative or historical reasons have never been considered as being intelligence or intelligence related activities per the intelligence budget as authorized by congress is now divided into two parts the national intelligence program nip and the military intelligence program mip nip programs formerly categorized as the national foreign intelligence program nfip are those undertaken in support of nationallevel deci sion making and are conducted by the cia dia nsa the nro nga and other washingtonarea agencies mip programs are those unde rtaken by dod agencies in support of defense policymaking and of military co mmanders throughout the world until september 2005 there were two sets of programs within dod the joint military intelligence program jmip and tactical intelligence and related activities tiara jmip programs established as separate category in 1994 supported dodwide activities tiara programs we re defined as diverse array of reconnaissance and target acquisition programs which are functional part of the basic military force structure and provide direct support to military operations2 in recent years the overlap among intelligen ce and intelligencere lated activities has grown satellite photography for instance can now be made immediately available to tactical commanders and intelligence acquired at the tactical level is frequently transmitted to nationallevel agencies as result jmip and tiara were combined by the defense department in to the mip in september 2005 within the mip are programs that formerly constituted the jmip that support dodwide intelligence efforts as well as programs directly

nt printing office 1962 p 88intelligencerelated programs to regular intelligence programs is complex one that is not likely to be understood by many pub lic observers in 1994 thendci r james woolsey described them as loose amalgamation of activities that may vary from year to year depending on how the various military services decide what constitutes tactical intelligence3 intelligencerelated programs which may constitute somewhere around third of total intelligence spending are integral parts of defense programs in many cases they are also supported by nonintelligence personnel and facilities the administrative expenses for instance of military base that has intelligencerelated missions as well as nonintelligence functions would probably not be included in intelligence accounts the role of intellig encerelated programs is sometimes misinterpreted in public discussions of the multibillion dollar intelligence effort with the passage of the intelligence reform act in 2004 the director of national intelligence dni has extensive statutory authorities for developing and determining the nip and for presenting it to the president for approval4 t h president in turn forwards the nip to congress as part of the annual budget submission in january or february of each year the office of the dni odni serves as the dnis staff for annual bud get preparation and submission the dni participates in the development of the mip by the secretary of defense the under secretary of defense for intelligence usd i has the responsibility to oversee all defense intelligence budgetary matters to sure compliance with the budget policies issues by the dni for the nip5 the usdi also serves as program executive for the mip and supervises coordination during the programming budgeting and execution cycles thus in the developmen t of both the nip and the mip essential roles are played by the office of the dni and the office of the usdi the two offices have overlapping responsibilitie s and close coordination is required past budgetary practice budgeting for secret intelligence efforts has long presented difficult challenges to the congress realizing the need for some direction over the intelligence effort that had been disbanded in the immediate aftermath of world war ii president truman established in directive of january 22 1946 coordinative element for intelligence activities the cent ral intelligence group cig headed by director of central intelligence and consisting of representatives from the state war and navy departments this was not the creation of new agency but coordinative group personnel and fac ilities were to be provided within the limits of available appropriations6 this arrangement was questioned however because of concern that specific authorization by congress would be legally re quired to make fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs942617 see the discussion in an official cia history prepared in 1952 1953 and published

of unvouchered funds ie funds provided to the dci for unspecified purposes they must be kept secret even the provision for them by congress should not be known ibid darling continues the comptroller general was willing that unvouchered funds which the national security council approved should be exempt from the normal restrictions upon expenditure but the bureau of the budget held that such approval in advance was more properly the function of the director of th budget to this the comptroller agreed and the proposal went to congress the senates committee however thought otherwise and exempted the agency from any control by the bureau of th budget over the amount of the expenditures which should be unvouchered page 190 this passage reflects the concern that existed in congress in 1947 for the secrecy of intelligence expendituresavailable to any agency in existence more than year thus it might have been illegal for the cig to expend funds after january 22 19477 shortly after taking office in june 1946 the second dci general hoyt s vandenberg arranged for the creation of working fund cons isting of allotments from the departments of state war nd the navy under the supervision of the comptroller general to cover the costs of the relatively small cig8 it cannot be readily determined if funds were transferred from all th ree departments the larger budgets of the war and navy department s may have made them more likely contributors than the state department9 vandenberg realizing the administrative weakness of this situation began an effort to obtain congressional approval of an independent intelligence agency with its own budget the national security act of 1947 which created the unified national defense establishment included provisions for central intelligence agency headed by director of central in telligence it also authorized the transfer of personnel property and records of the cig to the new cia it did not however provide additional statutory nguage regarding the administration of the cia with the creation of the cia by the national security act of 1947 arrangements were made for the continuation of previous f unding mechanisms the agency was to conform as nearly as possible to normal procedures until further legislation by congress should make exceptions fitting the special needs of the agency10 it was recognized that followon enablin g legislation would be required after some delays congress passe d the central intelligence act of 1949 pl 81110 to provide firmer statutory base for the ci and to establish procedures for regular appropriations this legi slation reported by the tw armed services committees provided authority for the cia to transfer to and receive from other government agencies such sums

the house shortly after passage of the 1949 act stated that the legislation contained the authority to transfer and receive fro m other government agencies such sums as may be approved by the bureau of the budget for the performance of any of the agency functions this is how the central intelligence agency gets its money it has been going on since the agency was created and this simply legalizes that important function which is the only means by which the amount of money required to operate an effici ent intelligence service can be concealed11 in practice the cia act of 1949 provide s funding for cia through the defense authorization and ppropriation process12 funding for other intelligence activities undertaken by dod agencies was logi cally included in defense bills for many years authorizations and ppropriations for cia were handled by relatively small number of members and staff of the two appropriations committees with consultation with members of the two armed services committees according to available sources senior members of the appropriations committees insisted on maintaining the secrecy of the conten ts of the cias budget requests and congressional actions in response13 in 1956 subcommittees were created in the armed services and appropr iations committees of each house to oversee the cia many assessments of the practice of congressional oversight of intelligence activities during the truman eisenhower kennedy and johnson administrations have concluded that the cong ressional role was in large measure supportive and perfunctory this view has however come under serious challenge and there is considerable evidence that congress took close interest in intelligence spending especially in regard to major surveillance systems and the construction of headquarters buildings14 the small handful of memb ers responsible for intelligence oversight had close working relationship with the cia for number of years beginning in the eisenhower administra tion senator richard russell served both as chairman of the armed services committee and of the subcommittee on defense appropriations and had an especially important influence on intelligence spending15httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9426116 quoted in dwayne day john m logsdon and brian latell eds eye in the sky the story of the corona spy satellites washington smithsonian

intelligence shall provide guidance to elements of the intelligence community for the preparation of their annual budgets and shall approve such budgets before their incorporation in the national

of intelligence agencies and components of dod president lyndon johnson said on march 16 1967 i wouldnt want to be quoted on this but weve spent 35 or 40 billion dollars on the space program and if nothing else had come out of it except the knowledge weve gained from space photography it would be worth 10 times what the whole program has cost because toni ght we know how many missiles the enemy

budget has been increasingly detailed oversight by c ongress efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to establish intelligence committees or to involve larger number of members in intelligence oversight were rebuffed with oversight remaining in the hands of small number of senior members this situa tion was altered in the aftermath of the vietnam war in reaction to series of revelations about allegedly illegal and improper activities by intelligence agen cies in 1975 congress created two temporary select committees to investigate the cia and other intelligencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9426119 the senate select committee to study governmental operation with respect to intelligence activities known as the church committee and the house select committee on intelligence known as the pike committee

investigated wide range of intelligence issues and conducted wellpub licized hearings although budgetary issues were not at the heart of the investigations there emerged consensus that congressional oversight of intelligence agencies needed to be strengthened and formalized and permanent intelligence committees established there was also widespread sentiment expressed that more information regarding intelligence agencies and activities should be made public20 following the work of the church and pike committees congress moved to revamp oversight of intelligence agencies the senate select committee on intelligence ssci was established in 1976 the house permanent select committee on intelligence hpsci in 1977 each of these committees was granted oversight of the cia as well as other intelligence agencies and charged to prevent the types of abuses that the church and pike committees had criticized in conjunction with their oversight duties hpsci nd ssci were responsible for authorizing funds for intelligence activities undertaken by the ci and other agencies throughout the government there is however crucial difference between the charters of the two committees although hpsci has oversight of nip and shares with the armed services committee oversight of the mip the ssci has oversight only over the nip in the senate oversight of the mip is conducted by the ar med services committee with informal consultation with the intelligence committee21 both ssci and the senate armed services committee are repr esented in confer ences on intelligence authorization bills the final bill as reported by the conference committee authorizes both intelligence activities and intelligencerelated activities the two intelligence committees are not the sole organs of congressional oversight the armed services committees often issue sequential reports on intelligence authorization bills annual defe nse authorization act s include the large national intelligence

programs were enacted in the fy1988 fense authorization act pl 100180services intelligence activities of agenci outside of cia and dod are authorized in other legislation although some departments ve standing authorizations rather than annual authorization acts authorization as is the case with other congressional committees intelligence oversight has entailed reviewing annua l budget proposals for the intelligence community submitted by the administration conduc ting hearings preparing an annual authorization bill and managing it for the respective chamber the two committees publish reports to accompany the annual inte lligence authorization bills with dollar amounts for various inte lligence agencies and activ ities included in classified annexes22 the classified annexes are available to all members but only within intelligence committee offices and sanctions exist for any unauthorized release of classified data the intelligence committees however do not have exclusive jurisdiction over expenditures for intelligence programs national defense authorization acts also contain authorizing legislation for intellig ence activities funded within their purview there are various parts of defense authorization bills that are classified some cover what are known as special access or black programs23 these include not only some intelligence programs but also proc urement of new weapons systems such as stealth aircraft members can obtain inform ation about classified parts of defense authorization bills from the armed services committees other authorization bills cover some intelligence activities providing form of shared oversight budgets for inr dea and the fbi are funded through the appropriation bills that cover the departments of commerce justice and state and similar procedures are used for treasury and energy department intelligence entities in the treasury postal service and ge neral government nd energy and water development appropriations bills all of these combined however represent small percentage of total intelligence spendingfor instance the fy2007 budget request for inr totaled only 51 million and other ag encies are considerably smaller there has been some controversy regarding the nature of authorizing legislation required section 504a of the national security act provides that appropriated funds may be obligated or expended for an intelligence or inte lligencerela ted activity only if those funds were specifically au thorized by the congress for use for such activities the nature of specific au thorization had not however been

appropriations committees have had an increasingly significant influence on the conduct of intelligence activities in 1998 supplemental appropriation act pl 105277 added substantial f unds for intelligence efforts not included in the annual authorization bill and in the post911 pe riod the practice of relying on supplemental appropriations for funding the regular ope rations of intelligence

911 commission stated the specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified as they are today opponents of declassi fication argue that americas enemies could learn about intelligence capabilities by tracking the topline appropriations figure yet the topline figure by itself provides little insight into us intelligence sources and methods the us government readily provides copious information about spending on its military forces including military intelligence the intelligence community should not be subjected to that much disclosure but when even aggregate categorical numbers remain hidden it is hard to judge priorities and foster accountability 911 commission report p 416activities of the government woul d be in the public interest36 with the failure of either chamber to take action the disclo sure question receded into the background as efforts ultimately unsuccessful were underway during the carter administration to draft legislative charter for the entire intelligence community the reagan administration showed markedly less interest in such questions as it launched major expansion of intelligence activities the issue would return during the clinton administration after the end of the cold war and again in the recommendations of the 911 commission as noted below it should be understood that with the establishment of the two intelligence committees in the 1970s members have been ab to review budget figures contained in the classified annexes accompanying reports inte lligence authoriz ation bills although rules of both chambers prevent th divulging of classified information policy arguments pro and since the 1970s arguments for and agains t the public disclosure of intelligence spending levels have turned on essentially the same issues viz the constitutional issue regarding the requirement for full reports of government expenditures discussed below and the broader question of the value of open political discourse the dangers of revealing useful informati on to actual or potential enemies and the difficulty of providing and debating aggr egate numbers without being drawn into providing details37 advocates of disclosure argue that greater public discussion of intelligence spending made possible by the disclosure of spending levels would ultimately lead to stronger intelligence effort they ma intain that organization even one with superior management and personnel is imm une to waste and inefficiency and that wider appreciation of the costs and benefits of intelligence could contribute in the long run toward improvements in the or ganization and functioning of intelligence38 senator william proxmire put the case as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9426139 us congress senate 95th cong 1st sess select

information if you know that there is certain am ount being spent on intelligence then you are in much stronger position to criticize what you are getting for that expenditure39 also in terms of efficiency publication of an aggregate figure for intelligence spending would result in cleaner more accurate defense budget as presently handled the defense budget includes significant unspecified national intelligence expenditures eg the greater part of th cia budget that in many cases are not actually part of defense spending per such expenditures make the defense budget and various components of it seem larger th an is the case identification of those intelligence expenditures that are extraneous to defense could give the public more accurate perception of defense costs40 those holding this position argue in addition that publication of limited intelligence spending totals would provide useful information to present or future adversary even during the height of the cold war soviet authorities they maintain undoubtedly had reasonably accurate knowledge of the extent of the us intelligence budget and in any event were more concerned with the nature of our activities rather than the size of expenditures noting the demise of the soviet union representative dan g lickman then the chairman of the house intelligence committee stated in 1994 that unless justification on national security grounds exists keeping the budget totals secret serv only one purpose and that is to prevent the american taxpayer from knowing how much money is spent on intelligence41 opposition to public release has been ba sed on the conviction that intelligence by its very nature stands apart from other activities of the government and the publication of general budgetary information potentially exploitable by an adversary attempting to discern us intelligence capabilities and operations could compromise the nations intelligence capabilities this concept perceives intelligence to be an exceptional activity that cannot be handled according to normal procedures of an open society this is partic ularly true of those operations that involve the collection of intelligence

this information coul d then be used to frustrate united states intelligence missions42 at the end of the cold war along with the downsizing of the defense budget it was argued that intelligence spending should be significantly reduced some advocates of reduction anticipated that publi cation of spending totals would lead to perception by the public that such levels of intelligence spending were unjustified and could be lowered this potential fo r public opposition to existing levels of spending was also recognized by many who defended intelligence spending levels and probably reinforced their oppos ition to making the budget public although such perspectives may have b een widely shared in the early 1990s later in the decade the emergence of international terrorism and other transnational threats lead to concerns that intelligence sp ending should not be further reduced the 911 attacks altered the clima regarding intelligence spending even though there was widespread criticism of the performance of intelligence agencies there was pervasive determination to spend whatever was necessary on intelligence as part of the global war on terrorism in recent ears the argument for making intelligence spending levels public has not in gene ral been proxy argument for reducing intelligence spending inasmuch as few would argue that less intelligence is needed given the realistic potential for more qaeda attacks other opponents of disclosure have argued that making public few numbers indicating total spending levels whether budget re quests authorizations or appropriations will be meaningless to th public debate explanations will be immediately required to show that these figures are divided among several functions threats and agencies cover national and tactical programs may or may not include administrative and logistical support etc pressures will in politically adversarial context mount to publish these subtotals as we ll as an aggregated figure it is further argued that these explanations would likely result in degree of transparency for us intelligence activ ities that would allow dversaries to take eff ective countermeasures there is also contrary argument that intelligence spending even within the nip is in large measure related to defens programs and could be usefully expressed as percentage of overall defense spendi ng admiral bobby ray inman who served as deputy director of central intelligence in the early reagan administration testified in 1991 that i am certainly prep ared to make unclassified the total amount and defend to

that large fluctuations in intelligence spending might also reveal major new programs under development the example of the u2s and satellites is so metimes mentioned premature exposure of such new

lost by publishing the annual aggregate budget total since then44 unconvinced defense analysts insist that revealing the fact of significant changes in us intelligence budgets from year to year will alert unfriendly governments or groups to new efforts against them or to slackened effort by the us that can be exploited public discussion of the question of making intelligence budgets public has usually turned on the question of the cons titutionality or the propriety of keeping intelligence spending figures classified beyond these issues however lies the less discussed issue of the nature of intelligence and intelligencerelated spending the existence of the nip and the mip has been publicly acknowledged in many executive and legislative branch publications howe ver the respective roles of the separate programs are not well known outside of relatively narrow circle of intelligence specialists the role of tactical programs in particular is rarely considered in the context of discussions of making intellig ence spending levels public observers express concern that characterizing some projects related to information support for targeting as tactical intelligence program could be characterized in some cases as arbitrary inasmuch as similar projects may be included in other parts of the defense budget reportedly inclusion of some proj ects in the mip program is not consistent from year to year and thus could lead to confusion in tracking intelligence spending some consideration has been given to making public only the budget for the nip which contains funding for the cia the national reconnaissance office nro the national geospatialintelligence agency formerly the national imagery and mapping agency nima and the national security agency nsa when making total nip spending public some observers would consolidate responsibility for authorizing nip in the two intelligence committees leaving the armed services to deal with the mip it is likely that jurisdiction of the armed services committees will continue inasmuch as the nip includes the budgets of major defense agencies that report to the secretary of defense and to which are assigned many thousands of

intelligence agencies constitutional questions related to disclosure of aggregate intelligence budget figure an issue that arises in considering whether or not to disclose an aggregate intelligence budget figure is whether the st atement and account clause of the united states constitution requires such disclosure the pertinent constitutional language is contained in article i s ection 9 clause 7 which states money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law and regular statement and acc ount of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time emphasis added brief examination of the history of this language and of the scant case law interpreting the statement and account clau may be of assistance in placing the disclosure issue in context history of the constitutional language during the constitutional convention in ph iladelphia the first language on the subject of statements and accounts was offered on september 14 1787 by george mason the debate on the matter as reflect ed in madisons notes of debates was as follows col mason moved clause requiring that an account of the public expenditures should be annually published mr gerry 2ded the motion mr govr morris urged that this wd be impossible in many casesmr king remarked that the term expenditures went to every minute shilling this would be

the existing system that part which authorizes the government to withhold from the public knowledge what in their judgment may require secrecy is imitated from the confederation that very system which the gentleman advocates46 on the 17th of june 178847 george mason raised question as to the from time to time language and the following debate ensued mr george mason apprehended the l oose expression of publication from time to time was applicable to any time it was equally applicable to monthly and septennial periods it might be ex tended ever so much the reason urged inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94261favor of this ambiguous expression was that there might be some matters which require secrecy in matters relative to military operations and foreign negotiations secrecy was necessary sometimes but he did not conceive that the receipts and expenditures of the public money ought ever to be concealed the people he affirmed had right to know the expenditures of their money but that this expression was so loose it might be concealed forever from them and might afford opportunities of misapplying the public money and sheltering those who did it he concluded it to be as excep tionable as any clause in so few words could be mr lee of westmoreland thought such trivial argument as that just used by the honorable gentleman would have weight with the committee he conceived the expression to be sufficiently explicit and satisfactory it must be supposed to mean in the common acceptation of language short convenient periods it was as well as if it had said one year or shorter term those who would neglect this provisi on would disobey the most poi nted directions as the assembly was to meet next week he hoped gentlemen would confine themselves to the investigation of the principal parts of the constitution mr mason begged to be permitted to use that mode of arguing to which he had been accustomed however desirous he was of pleasing that worthy gentleman his duty would not give way to that pleasure mr george nicholas said it was better direction and security than was in the state government appropriation shall be made of the public money but by law there could not be any misapp lication of it therefore he thought instead of censure it merited applause being cautious provision which few constitutions or none had ever adopted mr corbin concurred in the sentiments of mr nicholas on this subject mr madison thought it much better than if it had mentioned any specified period because if the accounts of the public receipts and expenditures were to be published at short stated periods th ey would not be so full and connected as would be necessary for thorough compre hension of them and detection of any errors but by giving them an opportunity of publishing them from time to time as might be found easy and convenient they would be more full and satisfactory to the public and would be sufficiently fre quent he thought after all that this provision went farther than the constituti on of any state in the union or perhaps in the world mr mason replied that in the confed eration the public proceedings were to be published monthly which was infinitely better than depending on mens virtue to publish them or not as they might please if there was such provision in the constitution of virginia gentlemen ought to consider the difference between such full representa tion dispersed and mingled with every part of the community as the state representation was and such an inadequate representation as this was one might be safely trusted but not the other mr madison replied that the inconveniences which had been experienced from the confederation in that respect had their weight in him in recommending this in

to the idea manifested by the virginian bill of ri ghts or that of the other states the restraints in this congressional bill of righ ts are so feeble and few that it would have been infinitely better to have said nothing about it the fair implication is that they can do every thing they are not forbidden to do what will be the result if congress in the course of their legi slation should do thing not restrained by this 9th section it will fall as an incidental power to congress not being prohibited expressly in the constitution if the government of virginia passes w in contradiction to our

any thing under heaven than the expenditure of m oney will not the representatives said he consider it essential to their popularity to gratify their constituents with full and frequent statements of the public accounts there can be doubt of it49 on november 29 1787 the delegates to the constitutional convention were called before the maryland h ouse of delegates to explain the principles upon which the proposed constitution was founded50 james mchenry in his explanation of section 9 stated in part when the public money is lodged in its treasury there can be regulation more consistent with the spirit of ec onomy and free government that it shall only be drawn forth under appropriation by law and this part of the proposed constitution could meet with opposition as the people who give their money ought to know in what manner it is expended51 thus the history of this provision sheds some light upon the range of views with regard to anticipated benefits and intended sweep of this language but does not give great attention to the possibility of secret funding for intelligence activities rather the debate focused principally upon the general need for such provision the timing of the statements and accounts and the practical impact of such requirement neverthe less there were few indications that some of the delegates considered the possibility of secrecy att ached to some of those statements and accounts for example one might comp are mr wilsons observations during the constitutional convention with those of mr mason at the virginia ratifying convention mr wilson noted that some fi nancial operations c ould not be published at certain times mr mason recognized that at times necessity might dictate that some secrecy would attach to military operations or foreign negotiations but rejected the notion that receipts and expenditures of public money should ever be concealed52 the most explicit mention of receipts and expenditures shrouded in secrecy is contained

douglas dissenting opinion 418 us at 197202 justice douglas reviewed the history of the statement and ccount clause concluding that it was inserted into the constitution to give the public knowledge of the way public funds are spent he concluded that to permit congress to determ ine to withhold regular statement and account with regard to an agency is to reduce the clause to nullity further he asserted that if the solution to the failure of the congress to provide such statement and account is the electoral process then the public must have basic knowledge of at least the generality of the accounts under every head of government if the franchise is to be exercised intelligently id at 201 justice douglas would have affirmed the court of appeals holding that the taxpayer had standing to suepublic wealth in secrecy or to conceal what they determine requires secrecy the history of the clause leaves it uncertain whether or to what extent his views were shared by others it appears clear that the concern over how public funds would be spent was the motivating force behind the inclusion of the statement and account clause the clause seems to impose an affirmative duty to disclose information with regard to public receipts and expenditures these general outlines do not appear to provide unequivocal guidance as to the scope and frequency of these disclosures however and there are some indications that at least delay in releasing some information and possibly secrecy of some information wa s anticipated whethe r with approbation or alarm by some of those at the c

constitutionality of provisions of the central intelligence agency act of 1949 concerning public reporting of expenditures on the ground that they violated the statement and account clause the provi sions at issue permitted the cia to account for its expenditures solely on the certificat of the director 50 usc 403jb richardson had made severa l attempts to obtain detailed information regarding the cias expenditures from the government printing office and the fiscal service of the bureau of accounts of the treasur department but found the information he received unsatisfactory he questioned the constitutionality of the provision and requested that the treasury department s eek an opinion from the attorney general on this question the treasury department declined to do so and richardson then filed suit the district court dismissed fo r lack of standing and on the ground that the subject matter raised political questions not amenable to judicial determination richardsons request for threejudge court to try the matter was also rejected by the district court the court of appeals for the third circuit sitting banc reversed and remanded for consideration by threejudge court the supreme court granted certiorari and reversed the issue before the court was whether the respondent had standing to sue the court found that he did not without reaching the merits of the constitutional question53 in so doing the court notedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9426154 418 us at 179 55 553 f2d at 194 196 it can be argued that if respondent is not permitted to litigate this issue one can do so in very real sense the abse nce of any particular individual or class to litigate these claims gives support to the argument that the subject matter is committed to the surveillance of the congress and ultimately to the political process54 in footnote 11 418 us at 178 the court also observed although we need not reach or decide precisely what is meant by regular statement and account it is clear that congress has plenary power to exact any reporting and accounting it considers appropriate in the public interest it is therefore open to serious question whet her the framers of the constitution ever imagined that general directives to the congress or the executive would be subject to enforcement by an individual citizen while the available evidence is neither qualitatively nor quan titatively conclusive historical analysis of the genesis of cl 7 suggests that it was intended to permit some degree of secrecy of governmental operations the ultimate weapon of enforcement available to the congress would of course be the power of the purse independent of the statute here challenged by responde nt congress could grant standing to taxpayers or citizens or both limited of course by the cases and controversies provision of art iii not controlling but surely not unim portant are nearly two centuries of acceptance of reading of cl 7 as vesting in congress plenary power to

circuit dismissed the suit for lack of standing plaintiff did not challenge the constitutional sufficiency of the funding and reporting provisions55 in outlining the statutory and constitutional framework to set the case in context the court noted that the funding and reporting requirements of the cia act represent an exception to the general method for appropriating and reporting the expenditure of federal funds article i section 9 clause 7 of the us constitution is not selfdefining and congress has plenary power to give meaning to the provision the congressionally chosen method of implementing the requirements of article i section 9 clause 7 is to be found in various statutory provisions with respect to the reporting of expend itures the key statutory provision of general application is 31 usc 1029 which imposes duty on the secretary of the treasury to provide congress on an annual basis with an accuratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9426156 553 f2d at 19495 relying in part on

section 6 of the central intellig ence act 50 usc 403g 197657 the plaintiff argued that application of these statutes under the foia exemption was violative of the statement and account clause the appellate c ourt relying upon united states v richardson supra rejected his argument holding that he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of secret appropriations and expenditures for the cia the court found that the nature of the inju ry alleged by the plaintiff under foia was undifferentiated and common to all members of the public and therefore like the taxpayer in richardson the plaintiff had not shown the particular concrete injury required for standing58 in determining the constitutionality and justiciability of statutory secrecy for cia expenditures the halperin court reviewed the history of the statement and account clause as to the debates in th virginia ratifying convention in june of 1788 the court opined masons statement clarifies several points concerning the framers intent first it appears that madisons comment on gove rnmental discretion to maintain the secrecy of some expenditures far fro m being an isolated statement was representative of his fellow proponents of the from time to time provision second as to what items might legitimately require secrecy the debates contain prominent mention of military operations and foreign negotiations both areas closely related to the matters over which the cia today exercises responsibility finally we learn that opponents of the from time to time provision exemplified by mason favored secrecy only for the operations and negotiations themselves not for receipts and expenditures of public money connected with them but the statement and account clause as adopted and ratified incorporates the view not of mason but rather of his opponents who desired discretionary secrecy for the expenditures as well as the related operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9426159 as the court relied upon elliot as its source fo r patrick henrys words it references date of june 15th rather than june 17th of 1788 as noted in fn 3 bove the correct date appears to be june 17th 60 629 f2d at 156 61 3 journals of the

regarded pa trick henrys concern59 over the time to time language and the potential for expenditures being concealed by congress as confirmation for the courts interpretation of the madisonmason debate it observed further viewed as whole the debates in th constitutional convention and the virginia ratifying convention convey very strong impression that the framers of the statement and account clause intended it to allow discretion to congress and the president to preserve secrecy for expend itures related to military operations and foreign negotiations opponents of the from time to time provision it is clear spoke of precisely this effect from its enactment we have record of any statements from supporters of the stat ement and account clause indicating an intent to require disclosure of such expenditures60 the halperin court also found confirmation for its conclusion that the statement and account clause did not re quire disclosure of the expenditures at issue from the historical evidence of government practices with regard to disclosure and secrecy before and after the advent of th constitution the committee of secret correspondence of the continental c ongress was created on november 29 1775 congress resolving to provide for expenses incurred by the committee in sending out its agents61 when the committee received information from arthur lee one of its agents regarding french plans to send arms and ammunition to the continental army it determined to maintain strict secrecy even from congress because of the nature and importance of this information62 the court notes that the congress appears to have exerted greater direct control over the committee after the declaration of independence the camouflaging of the actual recipien t and intended use of intelligence funds also appears to have had early usage under george washington commanderinchief of the colonial armies as reflected in letter to him from robert morris member of the committee of secret corresponde nce from january 21 1783 the letter reflects both the provision of cash account in anticipation of needs which might arise for contingencies and secret service drafts drawn from that account appear to have been drawn in favor of members of washingtons family on account of secret services seemingly means of concealing the identity of the actual recipients63 the court also noted

for more detailed discussion of the stat utes and historical precedents upon which the halperin court relied see 629 f2d at 15760 67 while they have not provided additional constitutional analysis other foia cases have also involved plaintiffs who have sought disclosure of the executive budget request for intelligence and intelligencerelated activities for example in aftergood v central intelligence agency 1999 us dist lexis 18135 ddc 1999 aftergood i steven aftergood on behalf of the federation of ameri can scientists sought disclosure of the administrations total budget request for fy 1999 for all inte lligence and intelligencerelated activities the cia denied this request under exemption 1 on the grounds that the information was properly classified in the in terest of national defense or foreign policy under eo 12958 and under exemption 3 on the ba sis that release of the aggregate figure would tend to reveal intelligence sources and methods which are expressly exempted from disclosure by statute in its motion for summary judgment the cia relied upon statements by from dci tenet one filed as an unclassified exhib it attached to the motion and two classified statements filed under seal and ex parte for in ca mera review by the district court in order to be satisfy the exemption 1 requirements an agency must show that the records at issue logically fall within th exemption ie that an executive order authorizes that the particular information sought be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and that the agency followed the proper procedures in classifying the information id at 34 the court found both of these criteria to be satisfied in so doing the court rejected the plaintiffs argume nt that the dcis determination differed from the presidents and was therefore invalid ba sed upon statement three years earlier by presidential spokesman that as general matte r the president believed that disclosure of the annual amount appropriated for intelligence purposes will not in itself harm intelligence activities id at 56 the court acknowledged that the president should he choose to do so had the authority to disclose the information sought but noted that he had not done so nor had he ever addressed the impact of disclosure of the 1999 aggregate intelligence budget request or the amount appropriated for these purposes in fy1999 similarly the court found the fact that the president had permitted release of similar information in other years unpersuasive in th absence of the presidents order to release the information or his withdraw of the dcis authority to make classification decisions where there is indication that the dci has acte d in bad faith in his refusal to release the information sought the court found the dci aut horized to make the classification decision at issue and found that his dete rmination was done properly id at 6 continuedintelligence activities64 for example in the act of july 1 1790 1 stat 128 10 the congress created such fund appropriating such monies for persons to serve the united states in foreign parts in this act the president was required to provide regular statement and account of his ex penditures from the fund but permitted him to not disclose such expenditures as he may think it advisable not to specify65by the act of february 9 1793 1 stat 299 300 1793 congress reenacted the 1790 statute but modified its language to allow the president to make secret expenditures without specification by making certificate or by directin g the secretary of state to make certificate for the amount66 it might be noted that although the specific expenditures from these funds do not appear to have been expected to be disclosed the statutes did include aggregate numbers for the appropriations for the funds created67httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9426167 continued in its novo determination as to whether the information was properly classified the court applied deferential standard thus summary judgment for the government in an exemption 1 foia action should be granted on the basis of agency affidavits if they simply contain reasonable specificity and if they ar not called into question by contradictory evidence in the record or by evidence of agency bad faith id at 8 the court found that dci tenets declarations satisfied this standard essentially dci tenet explains that disclosure of the budget request reasonably could be expected to cause damage to national security in several ways 1 disclosure reasonably could be expected to provide foreign governments with the united states own assessment of its intelligence capabilities and weaknesses tenet declaration p 14 2 disclosure reasonably could be expected to assist foreign go vernments in correlating specific spending figures with particular intelligence programs tenet declaration p 16 and 3 official disclosure could be expected to free foreign governments limited collection and analysis resources for other efforts targeted against the united states tenet declaration p 18 id at 9 the court did not require the dci to demonstrate certainty as to the damage that disclosure of the requested information would cause to national security in the area of intelligence sources and methods the dc circuit has ruled that substantial deference is due to an agencys determination regarding threats to national security in terests because this is necessarily region for forecasts in which the cias informed judgment as to potential future harm should be respected id at 10 the investigative zeal of foreign intelligence agencies was deemed matter the cia appropriately could assume in concluding that the plaintiff had offe red contrary evidence which undercut the dcis highly factdependent determination the aftergood i court found the 1996 non binding recommendations of congressionally chartered commission of private citizens without classification author ity the brown commission made to the congress and the president in favor of disclosure did not compel disclosure by the court in so finding the court noted that neither congress nor the president had acted upon those recommendations the court also noted that the brown co mmission did not consider whether it would recommend disclosure of the 1999 figures under the circumstances which the dci described in his unclassified declaration the court found the fact that the dci had disclosed aggregate intelligence budget figures in other years indicative of his careful case by case assessment of the impact of each disclosure therefore the court must defer to dci tenets decision that release of third cons ecutive year amidst the information already publicly available provides too much trend in formation and too great basis for comparison and analysis for our adversaries id at 1012 as to the applicability of foia exemption 3 to the requested disclosure the court applied 2 step analysis looking at whethe r the statute relied upon was statute which fell within the exemption and whet her the withheld material sa tisfied the criteria of the exemption statute involved id at 12 see cia v sims 471 us 159 167 1985 fitzgibbon v cia 911 f2d 755 761 dc cir 1990 the court relying upon sims found it wellsettled that the statute relied upon the 1947 national security acts requirement that the dci protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure 50 usc 4033c6 formerly 4033cd was an exemption 3 statute id at 13 the court again applying deferential standard concl uded that the dci had demonstrated that the information sought related to intelligence sources and methods the necessary connection was found in the special appropriations process used for inte lligence activ ities see military audit project v casey 656 f2d 724 745 dc cir 1981 the aftergood court continuedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9426167 continued relied upon the determination by dci tenet that release

never has to report its intelligence expenditures what the plaintiff ignores is that fact that within the same opinion the court explains that the absence of any particular individual or class to

states v ri chardson 418 us 166 179 1974 70 as noted in iii j story c ommentaries on the constitution of the united states 1342 21314 1970 in his discu ssion of the purpose of article i section 9 clause 7 the object is to secure regularity punctuality and fidelity in the disbursements of the public money congress is made the guardian of this treasure and to make their responsibility complete and perfect regular account of the receipts and expenditures is required to be published that the people may know what money is expended for wh at purposes and by what authority conclusions regarding statement and account clause the statement and account clause app ears to impose an affirmative duty upon the congress to periodically make statem ent and account of its disposition of the public funds70 the questions that arose during the debates upon this clause at the constitutional convention and the ratifying conventions went largely to the timing and scope rather than the fact of that ob ligation the debates suggest that at least some of the delegates to the constitutiona l convention and the participants in the debates on ratification anticipated that some secrecy might be expected or needed in dealing with military and foreign affairs and that the language of the clause might be broad enough to permit the congress to determine what expenditures should be kept secret historically both before and after the constitutions advent some provision in practice or statute appears to have been made to keep the substance of some intelligence information or activities closelyheld as well as the nature and recipients of funds for intelligence activitie s the early statutes creating funds for contingent expenses or secret service do s eem to include aggregate figures as to the money appropriated but permit circumspection as to the documentation of expenses from the funds so created the judicial interpretation of the statement and account clause appears to lay the power to define the sweep of the language in the hands of the congress the courts have been consistent in deny ing standing to those who have sought to challenge the constitutionality of the funding structure of the central intelligence agency act of 1949 under the statement and account clau to try to access information not disclosed because of the strictures of the 1949 act the richardson court and its progeny have indicated that the cong ress possesses plenary authority to give substance to the language of the clause nd to require such reporting of expenditures as it deems in the public interest the ve hicle by which congress gives substance to the clauses obligations is by statutory mandate the courts seem to suggest that secrecy as to some expenditures particularly in the area of foreign or military affairs appears to have been anticipated in the crafting of the clause and reflected in contemporaneous practice httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9426171 congressional record nov 10 1993 p s15569 72 senator deconcini noted that the intellig ence community had failed to analyze the condition of the soviet union maybe they had too much money maybe there was wrong direction coming from the executive br anch therefore what does congress do when some agency does something like that you start cutting away at their budget and rightfully so that is what we have done congressional record nov 10 19 93 p s15565since the early years of the nation c ongress has from time to time by statute created funds for expenditures for foreig n intelligence activities and has permitted expenditures from those funds to be made by certificate many of the statutes do specify aggregate amounts to be appropriate d for the contingent or secret funds in question but do not require detailed reporting on the natu re of the expenditures therefrom the central intelligence agen cy act of 1949 permits transfer of funds for intelligence purposes from funds appr opriated for other agencies thereby facilitating concealment of the act ual intelligence funding levels it appears that there was some uncertainty among the framers of the constitution as to the scope of the oblig ation the clause imposed upon the congress from our review of the constitutional language its history and the sparse judicial interpretation of its import it seems that the courts regard the congress as having the power to define the meaning of the clau the courts have not had occasion to address the issue on the merits and ind eed might refuse to do so on political question grounds if the issue were presented however the judicial interpretation of the statement and account clause to date suggests that court would be unlikely to find the disclosure of the aggregate in telligence budget constitutionally compelled postcold war developments the end of the cold war had signifi cant effect on intelligence budgets since the country does not face the relentless cha llenge of an enemy superpower with its own hostile intelligence services significant reductions in intelligence spending were enacted and criticisms of the continued need for budgetary secrecy were raised anew senator robert kerrey stated in november 1993 openness is the order of the day and unless threat as formidable and as lethal as the old soviet union comes along our society and government will steadily become more open our task is to make intelligence more useful to more americans not hoard it71 some also maintained that the alleged failures of intelligence agencies to appreciate the essential fragility of the soviet system or to collect intelligence on the iraqi nuclear capabilities warrant significant overhaul and downsizin g of collection and analytical efforts72 reductions in defense spending across the board affected intelligence spending in two ways first it was assumed that smaller military force structure reduced requirements for intelligence infrastructure fewer forces would likely require fewer intelligence support personnel this argume nt was countered by some who argued that leaner force structur actually required stronger intelligence support to ensure their most effective and efficient use secondly as the bulk of intelligence funding continued to be hidden within the dod budget reduc tions in overall defense spending required either proportional reductions in intelligence programs or disproportionate reductions in nonintelligence programs to compensate forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9426173 see bruce d berkowitz and allan goodman strategic intelligence for american national security princeton nj

existing levels the latter alternative engendered strong resistance among defe nse planners already hard pressed to maintain other priority programs73 in short as defense spending contracted it became more difficult to launch new intelligence efforts or even to maintain intelligence programs this debate over future requirements for intelligence programs was related to albeit not identical with the continuing controversy over the desirability of public disclosure of intelligence spe nding levels some opposed to existing or higher levels of intelligence spending consider that public knowledge of the high costs of intelligence spending would lead to demands that they be drastically reduced74 efforts to reduce funding levels in intellig ence authorization bills are complicated by the question of shared oversight in 1991 there was concern that reductions in fy1992 intelligence programs were reallocated to other defense programs rather than being used to reduce the deficit75 with the end of the cold war the ques tion of the desirability of making public the extent of the intelligence budget ree merged in congressi onal debates and floor votes for the first time since 197576 in the

the clinton admin istration in january 1993 some observers believed that the question would be revis ited with different conclusion senator howard metzenbaum member of the ssci wrote to the president on february 24 1993 urging the public disclosure of the intelligence budget woolsey the newly appointed dci testified to hpsci on march 9 1993 of his concerns regarding making the intelligence budget public there is electronic or data fence around the united states or around american citizens disclosing that inte lligence spending levels and the ensuing debate publicly means disclosing it to the people overseas who sic we target our intelligence assets on my real sense of skepticism about this derives principally from the fact that coming forth with single number communicates really nothing until one knows what goes into the number and theref ore proposals either to reduce or to increase that number would require public debate in such debate it is inconceivable to that we wouldnt release information and details as the public and the congress debated these issues in public and that would be damaging86 clinton himself responded to metzenbaum on march 27 asking for the opportunity to evaluate both the benefits and legitimate concerns which are associated such public disclosure87 the house version of the fy1994 intelligence authorizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9426187 continued

compelling disclosure88 on august 4 1993 the h ouse considering hr 2330 under an open rule debated an amendment offere d by representative barney frank mandating disclosure of the aggregate amounts requested and authorized for and spent on intelligence and intelligencerelate d activities beginning in 1995 the amendment failed on vote of 169264 many of those who voted for the frank amendment supported other amendments aimed at reducing the si ze of the intelligence budget and many observers hoped or feared pending on their point of view that making the budget public would lead to public demands for sp ending cuts this view was not however universal89 in the senate an amendment to the fy1994 defense appropriation b ill hr 3116 was introduced on october 18 1993 by nator daniel p moynihan to require separate unclassified statement of the aggregate amount of budget outlays for the prior fiscal year for national and tactical intelligence activities this figure shall include without limitation outlays for ac tivities carried out under the department of defense budget to collect analyze pr oduce disseminate or support the collection of intelligence although senator moynih an critic of the intelligence community who had also introduced legislation s 1682 to transfer the functions of the cia to the state department90 withdrew the amendment shortly after introducing it the proposal drew s upport from senator daniel inouye then the chairman of the appropriations committee subcommittee on defense91 three weeks later on november 10 1993 the senate debated an amendment to the fy1994 intelligence authorization b ill offered by sena tor metzenbaum to include essentially the same sense of c ongress language as included in the two previously enacted intelligence authoriza tion bills although the provision had not been controversial in the senate on th two earlier occasions in 1993 the incoming republican vice chairman of the ssci nator john warner spoke out against the proposal after lengthy deba the senate first voted not to table the metzenbaum amendment by vote of 4951 and then voted 5248 to incorporate it into thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9426192 congressional record nov 10 1993 pp s1555315570 93 the conference report continued neverthel ess the house conferees did state their willingness to entertain bill language expressing the sense of the senate as opposed to the sense of the congress expressing the views of both houses in favor of disclosure of the aggregate budget figure but senate conferees opposed to disclosure prevented agreement to such modification of the senate amendment on an evenly divided vote of the senate conferees to resolve the impasse the senate conferees ultimately agreed to recede to the position of the house us

conferees were of the view that in light of the house vote on the frank amendment they could not agree to the inclusion in the conference report of the senates sense of the congress provisi ons and therefore voted to insist on the house position93 thus the fy1994 intelligence authorization act pl 103178 that was signed by president clint on on december 3 1993 did not address the question of public disclosure of the intelligence budget along with the strong opposition to public disclosure by senator warner the vice chairman of the ssci unlike his predecessor senator frank murkowski who supported disclosure an important factor was opposition from the clinton administration during the november 10 1993 debate senator warner inserted into the congressional record sections of letter from the office of management and budget dated october 18 1993 that st ated the administration opposes any change to s 1301 the senate version of the fy1994 intelligence authorization bill that would disclose or require the disc losure of the aggregate amount of funds authorized for intelligence activities the current procedure that provides for the authorization of appr opriations in classified

were scheduled for 1994 and an nsclevel review was underway at the hpsci hearings c onducted on february 2223 1994 dci woolsey repeated his opposition to budgetary disclo sure he emphasized the difficulty of conducting debate on intelligen ce programs and priorities in public and his concern that it would be impossible to avoi d moving from one aggregate number to disaggregated details that would educate the rulers of north korea iran iraq libya terrorist groups and others bout our plans and programs97 the 19941995 debate took place in the c ontext of declining budgets and an intelligence community grappling with world that in the oftquoted phrase used by dci woolsey in his confirmation hearings s seen the slaying of the soviet dragon but still contained jungles filled with bewildering variety of poisonous snakes nevertheless on july 19 1994 the house voted in the committee of the whole 19422124 to reject an amendment to th intelligence authorization bill hr 4299 proposed by representative glickman chai rman of the permanent select committee on intelligence to amend the national secu rity act of 1947 to require annual reports of amounts expended and amounts

aggregate amounts requested and authorized for intelligence and intelligencerelated activities again the senate bill had provision relating to the question the senate did support di sclosure in 1996 when it passed its version of the fy1997 intelligence authorization bill s 1718 with provision requiring the president to include with the annual budget submission the aggregate amount appropriated for the current year for intelligence and intelligencerelated activities and the amount requested for the next year on may 22 1996 however the house voted in the committee of the whole 176 2489 to

bill hr 1775 offered by representatives conyers that would require the president to submit separate unclassified statement of the appropriations and pr oposed appropriations for the current fiscal year and the amount of appropriati ons requested for the fiscal year for which the budget is submitted for national and tactical intelligence activities the senate voted shortly thereafter on june 19 1997 43561 to reject an amendment to the fy1998 intelligence au thorization bill s 858 proposed by senator torricelli to require the presiden t to submit annual aggregate figures on amounts requested and amounts appropriated for inte lligence and intelligencerelated activities despite these congressional votes interest in and pressure for public release of intelligence spending levels persisted the commission on the roles and capabilities of the us intelligence community known as the aspinbrown commission established pursuant to the fy1995 inte lligence authorization act pl 103359 recommended in 1996 that at the beginning of each congressional budget cycle the president or designee disclose the total amount of money appropriated for intelligence activities for the current fiscal year to include nfip jmip and tiara and the total amount being requested for the next fiscal year such disclosures could either be made as part of the presiden ts annual budget submission or separately in unclassified letters to the congre ssional intelligence committees further disclosures should be authorized98 responding to the commissions reco mmendations on april 23 1996 president clinton authorized congress to make public the total appropriation for intelligence at the time the appropriations conference report was approved99 such action was not however taken by the legislative branch in october 1997 dci tenet announced that president clinton had authorized him to release the aggregate amount ppropriated for intellig ence and intelligence related activities for fy1997 266

budget whether the information concerns particular intelligence agencies or particular intelligence programs in other words the administration intends to draw firm line at this topline aggregate figure beyond this figure there will be other disclosures of currently classified budget informati on because such disclosures could harm national security100 the press release took note of the wsuit filed earlier under the freedom of information act and indicated that the president had preferred to take action concerning the declassification of the intelligence budget in concert with the congress but the present circumstances related to this lawsuit do not allow for joint action101 the following march tenet announced th at the aggregate amount appropriated for intelligence and

sources and methods102 the release of the figure for fy1998 was however the final such release after litigants had sought to require the release of the amount requested for intelligence in addition to the amount appropr iated which had been made public tenet declined to make public the amount appropriated for fy1999103 some observers speculate tenet may have been reluct ant to address the substan tial additional intelligence funds that were reportedly incorporated in the supplemental appropriation act pl 105 277 enacted on october 21 1998 in any even t such releases have been made subsequently recommendations by the 911 commission and subsequent legislation the attacks of september 11 2001 had profound affect on intelligence issues longer was there concern to reduce intelligence spending the goal was to determine why there had been tactical warning of the attacks that shattered thousands of american lives series of investigations was launched to fix the blame and to make recommendations for improved intelligence performance there was clear disposition in the executive branch and in congress to increase intelligence spending significantly in suppor t of the counterterrorism effort many of the recommendations for intelligence reor ganization lie beyond the scope of this report but some addresse d issues of intelligence acquisition and budgeting

authorities for developing and determining the national intelligence budget and for ensuring the effective execution of the budget for intelligence nd intelligencere lated activities104 in addition the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states known as the 911 commission r ecommended that the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should longer be kept secret105 this would be different from the clinton administrations practice in fy1997 nd fy1998 when the total appropriated amount for all intelligence and intelligen cerelated activities was released the senate bill introduced in respons to the recommendations of the 911 commission s 2845 provided that the nf ip would be renamed the national intelligence program nip and that the pres ident disclose for each fiscal year the aggregate amount of appropriations requested for the nip furthermore congress would be required to make public the aggregate amounts au thorized and appropriated for the nip the house bill dealing with intelligence reorganization hr 10 contained similar provision an amendm ent to remove this provision in the senate bill was tabled on october 4 2004 by vote of 55 to 37 ultimately the legislati on that was enacted largely in response to the recommendations of the 911 commission the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 did not include the senates provision to make intelligence spending figures public the issue resurfaced in 2006 when th senate intelligence committee reported its version of authorizati on legislation for fy2007 s 3237 section 107 of the bill would require that the president disclo to the public the aggregate amount of appropriations requested annually for the nip the bill would further require that congress make public the aggregate am ount authorized and appropriated by congress on an annual basis which would presumably include funds provided by supplemental appropriations bills the b ill further mandates study by the dni of the advisability of making such informati on public for each of the 16 elements of the intelligence community similar provision exists in the house version of fy2007 intelligence authorization legislati on hr 5020 an identical provision was included in the fy2007 intelligence au thorization bill s 372 reported in the senate in january 2007 in approaching the provision in s 3237 congress will likely weigh number of factors some members believe that not only the spirit of constitutional provisions but also the interests of democracy have always required that intelligence budgets be identified even some of those who believed that cold war conditions necessitated that intelligence budgets be kept secret now argue that conditions have changed and that current enemies would not be able to make use of inform ation on overall levels of intelligence budgets this view is opposed by others especially in the house who believe that the declassification of the in telligence budget could inevitably lead to the compromise of important inform ation on sources and methodshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94261there are in addition other factors that members may wish to take into consideration first making the nip public might lead to the need for separate intelligence appropriations bill this in turn could prevent the possibility of easy tradeoffs between intelligence and nonin telligence defense programs arguably to the detriment of the intelligence effort second is the fact that actions taken in regard to national intelligence efforts in s upplemental appropriations b ills would have to be reflected in accounts of intellig ence spending arguably with more public justification than would be sirable in some circumstances in addition providing information on the nip but not the mip could give false sense of the dimensions of the intelligence effort most observers argue that in operational terms intelligence and intelligencerelated activities are mutually supportive even intertwined and that cons idering them separa tely does not permit an understanding of intelligence capabilities this could affect both those who want to reduce intelligence spending across the board as well as those who argue that intelligence spending has not kept up with the growth of the threats facing the country if the intelligencere lated activities were to be included as was the case when fy1997 and 1998 budget levels were ma public by dci tenet there would have to be recognition of the subtle and porous dividing lines between intelligence related activities and other targeting and informationgathering and processing efforts it would be possible to play budg et games to demonstrate greater or lesser levels of commitment to intelligence by moving individual programs into or out of intelligencerelated categories conclusion after decades of debate the issues rrounding the question of public disclosure of the intelligence budget have not changed there is question of the degree to which the constitution requires such budget ary information to be made public another question centers on whether limite d budgetary data can be made public without leading to detailed re velations of properly classi fied programs and whether information might be made available to adversaries who will use it against the us beyond these questions there is an issu of how to frame an informed public debate on the extent of intelligence spending how do you provide sense of how the complex and disparate us intellig ence community fits together without revealing the extensive detail that almost all observers would consider unwise even sophisticated outside analys ts are unlikely to appreciate some of the finer and in some cases arbitrary distinctions among military and national programs and the relationship of noninte lligence communications and rec onnaissance programs to the overall intelligence effort funding for in telligencerelated activ ities presents special difficulties budgetary totals can fluctuate from year to year solely because certain dod programs are transferred into or out of intelligence accounts making public only the figure for national intelligence programs would simplify the task but would not give the public an accurate understanding of the extent of the whole intelligence effort there will continue to be philosophical and political disagreements concerning how much if any information regardin g the intelligence budget should be provided the disagreements may in some cases mask policy objectives some argue for ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94261inclusive number as possible pointing to th size of the total as the basis for urging its reduction in order to transfer funds to what they consider more important governmental functions or to reduce the federal deficit others will seek to show barebones intelligence spending and urge more rather than less intelligence spending to cope with the uncertainties of the current international environment ultimately the fundamental issue is wh ether adequate resources are being devoted to intelligence given the extent of requirements by policymakers military commanders and other government officials the more immediate issue for congress is how to ensure that there is enough information available to inform this public debate without pl acing intelligence sources and methods at risk
