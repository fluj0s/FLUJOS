reciprocal trade agreements act of 1998 floor action on fasttrack legislation has been anticipated in both houses the house and senate bills contain the same basic elements contained in th otca list of general and specific negotiating objectives temporary bu t extendable grant of authority to the president to enter into tariff and nontarif fhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97957crs2 agreements and to implement tariff agreements by proclamation requirement that nontariff barrier agreements be approved and impleme nted by statute provision that any such statute will be accorded expedited legislative treatment provided th president abide by certain statutory notification and consultation requirements procedural provisions for extending the general availability of fasttrack procedures to given date as well as for prohibiting their use for specific trade agreements incorporation by reference of the fasttrack procedures conta ined in section 151 of the trade act of 1974 and provision that the procedural provisions of the bill are an exercise of congress constitutional rulemaking authority and are subject to change by rule within this basic structur however the bills differ from the otca in variety of ways many of these restricting the availability of fasttrack procedures among these they incorporate certain labor and env ironmental aims as principal negotiating objectives as separate international economic policy objectives tha t complement the trade agreements process or as both they limit the use of fasttrack procedures to agreements meeting principa l negotiating objectives and prevent the u of these procedures to modify us law where international economic policy objective are implicated they further define and limit the elements of implementing legislation tha t may be considered under fasttrack procedures refining the trade act s language allowing provisions in an implementing bill that are necessary r appropriate to implement an agreement they require the pre sident between the time he notifies congress of his intent to enter into an agreement and his submission of an implementing bill t submit to congress an assessment of which changes in us law will b required as result of the agreement they prescribe additional executive branch consultations during the pre negotiating and negotiating phases of the trade agreements process the bills also differ from each other in number of respects includin g negotiating objectives prenegotiation committee disapproval their formulation f provisions that may be included in implementing legislation and other points fo r example though the bills share negotiating objectives in number of areas eg trade barriers trade in services foreign investment inte llectual property agriculture and the use of foreign governmental regulations in certain tradedistortin g ways the senate bill contains most of the principal negotiating objectives set forth in the otca though updating some of them while the house bil l contains fewer though also updated objectives the house bill contains guidance for negotiators regarding domestic polic aims eg health an d safety applicable to all principal negotiating objectiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97957crs3 while the sena bill contains similar language applicable only to negotiations on services nd investment and refers to these aims as being legitimate the latter limited approach was taken by the otca the house pays additional attention to agriculture in requiring special pre negotiation consultations on the matter placing concern over importsensitive items within negotiating objectives and creating special agricultura l negotiator within the office of the united states trade representativ ustr while each bill would seek as principal negotiating objective to preven t foreign governments from lowering regulatory standards to gain competitive advantage the breadth of foreign measures to be addressed in negotiation s differs the house bill refers to the waiving of or derogation from existin g environmental health safety or lab or measures while the senate bill refers to the use of foreign government regulations and other government measure s general ly for this end and includes within this broad category the specifi c actions and regulatory areas mentioned the house bill each bill specificall refers to child labor howevernote also that house bill titles this sectio n labor environment and other matters while the senate bil l labels its similar section regulatory competition each of the sections containing these regulatory objectives contains different provisos the house bill focusing on its meaning fo r foreign law the senate bill on its meaning for us law the bills differ in emphasis as to their international economic polic objectives with the senate bill treating them as supportive of the trad agreemen ts process and the house bill providing that the president shoul d ensure that us trade agreements complement and reinforce these othe r policy goals with respect to us worldwide advancement of labor standards as n international economic policy objective the senate bill is more specific than the house bill s to the us mandate in the international labor organization ilo forum in which this global action may take place the senate bil l provides that the us objective is to seek the establishment of an il mechanism for the systematic examination and reporting on the promotion and enforcement by ilo members with respect to specifically named worker rights while the house bill provides for working within the ilo to encourage th observanc and enforcement of core labor standards each specifically refers however to prohibition on exploitative child labor only the senate bill provides for two committee disapproval of the use of fast track procedures for specific nontariff barrier agreement procedure tha t was available in the otca for free trade area negotiations authorized in the act the senate bill contains additional provisions for notification of an d consultation with congress with respect to tariff agreementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97957crs4 it is unclear from the house bill whether agreements authorized under 103 that t4 international economic policy objectives set fo rth in 102c could be approved under fast track procedures where change in statute was necessary section 102c does not authorize the use of fasttrack procedures to modify united states law were mere approval of an agreement to be considered such modification the use of fast track procedures to approve such an agreement would seemingly be precluded the house bill also provides tha t provisions of law neces sary for the operation or implementation of us rights or obligations under 103b agreements generally may only be included in an implementing bill subject to fasttrack procedures if these provisions are directly related to the bills principal trad negotiating objectives see 103b3b in the past congress made all changes to domestic law that it viewed were needed to implement the agreements within the implementing legislation and included in it provision that denies domestic effect to provisions of agreements pproved in the legislation that conflict with federal law see eg uruguay round agreements act uraa pl 103465 102a as explained in the house ways and means committee report on the uraa this treatment is consistent with the congressional view that necessary changes in federa l statutes should be specifically nacted not preempted by international agreements since the uruguay round agree ments as approved by the congress or any subsequent amendment to those agreements are not selfexecuting any dispute settlement findings that us statute is inconsistent with an agreement lso cannot be implemented except by legislation approved by the congress unless consistent implementation is permissible under the terms of th statute hrept 103826 pt 1 at 25 note also tha t s 2400 requires the president before an agreement is entered into to notify congress as to whether the agreement includes subject matter for which supplemental i mplementing legislation may be required which is not subject to fasttrack procedures see 2004b2c while each bill requires that trade agreements addressing both tariff an d nontariff barriers must reduce eliminate or prohibit duties trade barriers or other distortions the b ills differ in the negotiating objectives that must be met in any such agreements the house bill provid that the agreements may make progress toward any of the negotiating objectives set forth in the bill while the senate bill limits these agreements to those making progress toward meeting principal negotiating objectives4 the bills differ somewhat in characterizing what may be included in n implementing bill subject to fastt rack procedures the senate bill requires that the bill must approve trade agreement that achieves one of the principa l negotiating objectives of the bill while the house bill requires that th agreem ent simply be one that is entered into under its authority for suc h agreements while each refers to implementing provisions as bein g necessary the house bill relates this requirement to provision that ar directly related to principal trade negot iating objectives while the house bill allows pro visions that define and clarify or provisions that are related to the operation or effect of the provisions of the trade agreement the senate bil l allows provisions that are otherwise related to the enforcement an d adjustment to the ffects of such agreement and are directly related to trade the house bill additionally allows provisions for adjustment assistance t workers and firms adversely affected by trade in general each allows fo r provisions necessitated by budget lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97957crs5 s 2400 essentially restates the fasttrack provisions of s 1269 with th following modifications 1 it revises provision regarding workers rights by naming specific declaration of the international labor organization ilo that should be effectively implemented within the ilo 2002c1cii 2 it requires that the international trade commission submit an assessment of the economic impact of any resulting trade greements later than 90 days after they have been entered into 2004e and 3 it adds agreements resulting from negotiations to achieve fre trade area of the americas to the list of trade agreements exempted from the pre negotiation notice and consultation requirements of the bill 2006a4 as this report is based
