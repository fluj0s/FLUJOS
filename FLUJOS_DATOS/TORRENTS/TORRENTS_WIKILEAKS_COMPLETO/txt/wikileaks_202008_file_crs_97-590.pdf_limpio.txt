enforcement and visitation should there be federal connection carmen solomonfears specialist in social legislation education and public welfare division summary from time to time the issue arises of whether the federal child support enforcement cse program should be actively involved in enforcing visitation rights both federal and state policymakers agree that denial of visitation rights should not be considered reason for stopping child support payments historically congress has treated visitation and child support as legally separate issues with only child support enforcement activities under the purview of the federal government however census bureau data 1995 show that noncustodial parents are more likely to make payments of child support if they have either joint custody or visitation rights in recent years congress has moderated its position against using federal cse funds to promote enforcement of visitation rights in 1988 it authorized cse funding for child access demonstration projects in six states and in 1996 it 1 permitted the federal parent locator service which is under the direction of the administrator of the federal office of child support enforcement to provide information on the location of custodial parents and children to noncustodial parents and 2 authorized an annual 10 million entitlement of cse funds to states to establish and operate access and visitation programs some view these recent steps as too intrusive on state and domestic court authority while others contend they are long overdue and do not go far enough background many noncustodial parents argue that it is unfair to look at the child support issue only from the viewpoint of the custodial parent traditionally they argue courts have sided with mothers in awarding custody and have paid insufficient attention to enforcing visitation rights of fathers as result they say mothers have had the rewards and obligations connected with rearing children while fathers have sometimes had share in the rewards but have the continuing obligation to pay support to be fair it is arguedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97590crs2 1 crs report 84796 epw the child support enforcement

status hr 3073 was passed by the house on november 10 1999 but has not been acted on by the senate hr 4469 the child support distribution act of 2000 introduced on may 16 2000 also includes many of the provisions related to fatherhood that are contained in hr 3073 one of the goals of the proposed fatherhood grant program is to increase the parental involvement social emotional psychological and financial of noncustodial parents in the lives of their childrenfederal laws and procedures should be reformed not only with respect to enforcement of the child support obligation but also with respect to visitation and custody rights1 empirical research seems to support the contention of noncustodial parents that child support payments and visitation are complementary according to 1995 census bureau data paying child support was more common among noncustodial parents that were allowed to visit their children than among noncustodial parents that did not have visitation or joint custody rights in 1995 74 of noncustodial parents with visitation rights andor joint custody paid child support and only 35 of noncustodial parents with neither joint custody or visitation rights paid child support2 most policymakers oppose conditioning the obligation to pay child support on noninterference with visitation rights they maintain that denial of visitation rights should be treated separately and should not be considered reason for stopping support payments current literature and studies3 suggest that in most cases visitation with the noncustodial parent is important to the healthy emotional development of children children with regular contact with their noncustodial parent often adjust better than those denied such contact moreover it is generally thought to be in the best interest of the child to receive social psychologic and financial benefits of relationship with both parents visitation ie contact with ones children is the primary means by which noncustodial parents carry out their parenting duty4 the terms visitation and access are not defined in federal cse law generally access means contact with ones children and therefore would include visitation rights policymakers and the public usually use the terms access and visitation together or interchangeably in some cases access andor visitation are legallyestablished obligations mandated by court in other instances they are informal privileges for specific legalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97590crs3 5 us dept of health and human services office of child support enforcement summaries of reports by state

and of course the terminology and definition would apply only to the state in question 1984 law state commissions to examine visitation issues pl 98378 the child support enforcement amendments of 1984 required the governor of each state to appoint state commission on child support which was to report its findings and recommendations by october 1 1985 one of the duties of the commission was to examine the problems associated with visitation rights the commissions discussions of visitation issues generally covered two areas the relationship between visitation and support and methods of enforcing visitation rights some commission reports cite research that shows correl ation between regular highquality visitation and payment of child support but causal relationship has been established certainly however statements in public hearings offer anecdotal evidence of such link noncustodial parents often testified at public hearings that she wont let see my children so why should i pay support while custodial parents argued he doesnt pay dime why should i let him see the children5 the commissions generally favored the following methods of enforcing visitation rights 1 contempt of courtjail 2 allowing parents to take the missed visitation at later time 3 supervised visitation 4 criminal penalties 5 mediation 6 fines and 7 change of custody6 the 1984 law also set forth as the sense of the congress that state and local governments must focus on the vital issues of child support child custody visitation rights and other related domestic issues that are properly within the jurisdiction of such governments 1988 law child access demonstrations pl 100485 the family support act of 1988 authorized 4 million for each of fy1990 and fy1991 to permit states to conduct one or more demonstrations to develop improve or expand activities designed to increase compliance with child access provisions of court orders in october 1990 the office of child support enforcement ocse funded four demonstration projects in the states of florida idaho and indiana these projects were designed to test whether mediation services for couples with child access problems would alleviate parental conflict reduce interference with visitation rights and encourage full voluntary compliance with child support obligations in october 1991 ocse funded four additional demonstration projects in arizona idaho iowa and massachusetts the goal of this second round of demonstration projects was to test the effectiveness of broader range of interventions in resolving andor preventing disputes between parents regarding access to their children7httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97590crs4 7 continued pearson jessica nancy thoennes david price and robert williams for the office of child support

agencies to establish and enforce child support orders the fpls conducts weekly or biweekly matches with most of the agencies each agency runs the cases against its data base and the names and social security numbers that match are returned to the fpls and via the fpls to the requesting state or local cse office upon request the department of health and human services hhs secretary must provide to an authorized person ie an employee or attorney of cse agency court with jurisdiction over the parties involved the custodial parent etc the most recent address and place of employment of any absent parent if the information is contained in the records of hhs or can be obtained from any other department or agency of the united states or of any state the fpls also can be used in connection with the enforcement or determination of child custody and in cases of parental kidnapingthese eight demons tration projects were funded to develop improve or expand activities designed to increase the compliance with child access provisions of court orders the 1996 report on the evaluations of the demonstration projects indicates that when both parents attend mediation sessions parenting plans can be agreed to in 65 to 70 of cases that had experienced child access problems the evaluations found that there was some increase in both visitation and child support compliance in the experimental groups compared to the control groups relitigation on child access cases was low but unaffected by the demonstrations and the time to resolve disputes also was not affected in addition they found that other interventions eg educating parents about their responsibilities to their children improving communication skills sensitizing parents to the other parents point of view and counseling for more long term and problematic cases did not have significant impact and that it was difficult to assess the impact of the demonstrations on the childs emotional adjustment to divorce and separation current rules pl 104193 the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 took two significant steps in the area of visitationchild access one step involved authorizing grants to states to implement accessvisitation programs and the other step provided that noncustodial parents in certain circumstances could obtain access to information on the whereabouts of custodial parent that was denying him or her visitation or custody rights noncustodial parents successfully argued that if custodial parents refuse to make children available for courtordered visitation they should have access to information in the federal parent locator service fpls to locate the custodial parents and children8 mandate to provide locator information on certain custodial parents pl 104193 expands the scope of the fpls which is under the purview of the ocse to provide for the provision of location information on custodial parents under current law the fpls must obtain

accessvisitation to their children an annual entitlement of 10 million from the federal cse budget account is available to states for these grants eligible activities include but are not limited to mediation counseling education development of parenting plans visitation enforcement and development of guidelines for visitation and alternative custody arrangements the amount of grant to state will be equal to the lesser of 90 of state expenditures during the fiscal year for eligible activities or the allotment for the state for the fiscal year the allotment formula is based on the ratio of the number of children in the state living with only one biological parent in relation to the total number of such children in all states the amount of the allotment available to state will be this same ratio to 10 million the allotments will be adjusted to ensure that there is minimum allotment amount of 100000 for any year after fy1998 the access and visitation programs are required to supplement rather than supplant state funds states may use the grants to create their own programs or to fund programs operated by courts local public agencies or nonprofit organizations the programs do not need to be statewide states must monitor evaluate and report on their programs in accord with regulations issued by the hhs secretary10 in 1997 states reported serving about 20000 persons in their accessvisitation programs11 concerns lingering question about the cse program is whether the cse program should be actively involved in enforcing visitation rights historically congress has held that visitation and child support should be legally separate issues and that only child support should be under the scope of the cse program since the 1980s however congress has taken several significant steps in the area of visitationchild access is the federal government becoming too intrusive in family law policy congress does not have general authority to pass laws dealing with family law issues unless there is connection or nexus between such legislation and one of the areas in which it is authoriz ed to act in the case of the cse program the federal nexus is thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97590crs6 12 some analysts argue that like the courts the federal government would be ineffective in enforcing visitation and custody rights unless it adopted measures that would adversely affect children and be inconsistent with former federal policy eg reduce child support payments if it is proved that the custodial parent is preventing the noncustodial parent from visiting the child 13 evaluation of the child access demonstrat ion projectsreport to congress prepared by pearson jessica nancy thoennes david price and robert williams for the office of child

4547billions of federal dollars used to fund the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program before enactment of the cse program in 1975 congress had perceived connection between the failure to pay child support and growth in the number of families receiving cash welfare benefits some observers contend that by requiring states to use specific procedures to enforce child support congress inserted itself into matters of family law to such degree that it may be obligated by political forces and by sense of fairness to respond to demands of noncustodial parents for action in the areas of visitation and custody although most reports of the state commissions see discussion of 1984 law agreed that visitation and child support should be legally separate issues many also pointed out that visitation rights usually are not rigorously enforced through the courts12 others are concerned that by allowing the fpls to provide information on the location of custodial parents to noncustodial parents the federal government may have gone too far should the federal government promote accessvisitation rights many fathers rights groups argue that by being solely concerned about increasing child support collections the federal government is limiting its approaches to accessvisitation issues according to the child access project evaluations relatively few noncustodial parents 18 attributed their access problems to disputes about child support while this was mentioned by about half of custodial parents 48 generally noncustodial parents cited economic factors such as low wages unemployment or job instability as reasons for nonpayment as opposed to access or visitation disputes13 there is some evidence that indicates that among fathers who visit their children fathers who do not pay their child support are more likely to have frequent contact with their children many on daily basis than fathers who pay their child support14 some fathers rights groups would argue that spending time with ones children especially on daily basis should be counted in terms of reducing that fathers financial obligation more generally advocates of increasing parental responsibility would argue that it is now time for the federal government to focus more attention on the nonfinancial benefits associated with preserving the connection between noncustodial parents and their children many policymakers and analysts maintain that distinction must be made between men who are dead broke and those who are deadbeats they argue that the federal government should help dead broke noncustodial fathers meet both their financial and emotional obligations to their children and vigorously enforce cse laws against deadbeat parents
