congressional interest in patent policy and possible patent reform has expanded as the importance of intellectual prope rty to innovation has increased patent ownership is perceived as an incentive to the technological adva ncement that leads to economic growth however growing interest in patents has been accompanied by persistent concerns about th fairness and effectiveness of the current system several recent studies including those by the national academy of sciences and the federal trade commission have reco mmended patent reform to address perceived deficiencies in the operation of the patent regime other experts maintain that major alterations in existing law are unnecessary and that the patent process can adapt and is adapting to technological progress pending patent reform proposals would wo rk significant legal changes to the patent system among the more notable of th proposed changes is shift to first inventortofile priority system substan tive and procedural modifications to the patent law doctrine of w illful infringement and adoption of postgrant review proceedings prior user rights and pr eissuance publication of all pending applications several of these proposals have been th subject of discussion within the patent community for many years but others are more novel propositions current legislative reform efforts h r 1908 s 1 145 also w ould address several issues of concern including the quality of issued patents the expense and complexity of patent litigation harmonization of us pa tent law with the laws of our leading trading partners potential abuses committed by patent speculators and the special needs of individual inventors universities and small firms with respect to the patent system in addition although the ex isting patent statute in large measure applies the same basic rules to different sorts of inventions regardless of the technological field of that invention the patent system is widely believed to impact different industries in varying ways the provisions of the proposed legisl ation would arguably work the most sweeping reforms to the us patent system since the nineteenth century however many of these proposals such as preissu ance publication and prior user rights have already been implemented in us law to more limited extent these and other reforms such as the firstinventortofile priority system and postgrant review proceedings also reflect the decadesold patent practices of europe japan and our other leading trading partners other observers are nonetheless concerned that certain of these proposals would weaken the patent right thereby dimin ishing incentives for innovation some also believe that changes of this magnitude occurring at the same time do not present the most prudent course for th patent system patent re form therefore confronts congress with difficult legal practical nd policy issues but also with apparent possibilities for altering and possibly improving the legal regime that has long been recognized as an engine of innovation within the us economyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33996contents introduction 1 patents and i nnovation policy 2 t h m c h n i c s f t

innovation issues introduction congressional interest in patent reform has increased as the patent system becomes more significant to us industry1 there is broad agreement that more patents are sought and enforced then ever be fore that the attention paid to patents in business transactions and corporate boardr ooms has dramatically increased and that the commercial and social significance of patent grants licenses judgments and settlements is at an alltime high2 as the united states becomes even more of hightechnology knowledgebased economy the importance of patents may grow even further in the future increasing interest in patents has been accompanied by persistent concerns bout the fairness and effectiveness of the current system several recent studies including those by the national academy of scien ces and the federal trade commission have recommended legal reform to address perceived deficienci in the operation of the patent regime3 other experts maintain that major

greater detail patents and innovation policy the mechanics of the patent system the patent system is grounded in article i section 8 clause 8 of the us constitution which states that the cong ress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their re spective writings and discoveries as mandated by the pa tent act of 19524 us patent rights do not arise automatically inventors must prepare and submit applications to the us patent and trademark office uspto if they wish to obtain patent protection5 uspto officials known as examiners then assess whether the application merits the award of patent6 the patent acquisition process is commonly known as prosecution7 in deciding whether to approve pate nt application uspto examiner will consider whether the submitted application fully discloses and distinctly claims the invention8 in addition the application must di sclose the best m ode or preferred way that the applicant knows to practice the invention9 the examiner will also determine whether the invention itself fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute to be patentable an invention must be useful novel and nonobvious the requirement of usefulness or utility is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides tang ible benefit10 to be judged novel

enjoined from further infringing acts14 the patent statute also pr ovides for the award of dama ges adequate to compensate for the infringement but in event less than reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer15 the maximum term of patent protection is ordinarily set at 20 years from the date the application is filed16 at the end of that period others may employ that

35 usc 154 23 eisenberg supra at 1017patent is intended to stimula the investment necessary to develop an idea and bring it to the marketplace embodied in product or process patent title provides the recipient with limitedtime monopoly over the use of his discovery in exchange for the public dissemination of in formation contained in the patent application this is intended to permit the inventor to receive return on the expenditure of resources leading to the discovery but does not guarantee that the patent will generate commercial benefits the requi rement for publication of th patent is expected to stimulate additional innova tion and other creative means to meet similar and expanded demands in the marketplace innovation produces new knowledge one characteristic of this knowledge is that it is public good good that is not consumed when it is used this public good concept underlies the us patent system absent patent system free riders could easily duplicate and exploit the inventions of others further because they incurred cost to develop and perfect the technology involved copyists could undersell the original inventor the resu lting inability of inventors to capitalize on their inventions would lead to an envir onment where too few inventions are made20 the patent system corrects this market fa ilure problem by providing innovators with an exclusive interest in their inventions for period of time thereby allowing them to capture the innovations marketplace value the regime of patents purporte dly serves other goals as well the patent system encourages the disclosure of products nd processes for each issued patent must include description sufficient to enable skilled artisans to practice the patented invention21 at the close of the patents 20year term22 others may practice the claimed invention without regard to the ex pired patent in this manner the patent system ultimately contributes to the growth of the public domain even during their term issued patents may also encourage others to invent around the patentees proprietary interest patentee may point the way to new products markets economies of production and even entir industries others can build upon the disclosure of patent inst rument to produce their own technologies that fall outside the exclusive rights associated with the patent23 the patent system has also been identified as facilitator of markets absent patent rights an inventor may have scant tangible assets to sell or license in addition an inventor might otherwise be ble to police the conduct of contracting party any technology or knowhow that s been disclosed to prospective licensee might be appropriated without compensation to the inventor the availability of patent protection decreases the

does not result in the disclosure of publicly valuable information that is becau an enterprise must take reasonable measures to keep secret the in formation for which trade secret protection is sought taking the steps necessary to maintain secrecy such as implementing physical security measures also imposes costs that may ultimately be unproductive for society25 the patent system has long been subject to criticism however some observers have asserted that the patent system is unnecessary due to market forces that already suffice to create an optimal level of innova tion the desire to obtain lead time advantage over competitors as well as the recognition that technologically backward firms lose out to their rivals may we ll provide sufficient inducement to invent without the need for further incentives26 other commentators be lieve that the patent system encourages industry concentration and presents barrier to entry in some markets27 still other observers believe that the patent system too frequently attracts speculators who prefer to acquire and enforce patents rather than engage in socially productive activity28 when analyzing the validity of these competing views it is important to note the lack of rigorous analyti cal methods available for study ing the effect of the patent law upon the us economy as whole the relationship between innovation and patent rights remains poorly understood as result current economic and policy tools do not allow us to calibrate the pate nt system precisely in order to produce an optimal level of inve stment in innovation thus each of the arguments for and against the patent system remains open to challenge by those who are unpersuaded by their internal logic current issues and concerns pending legislation hr 1908 and s

concern for the quality of issued patents the expense and complexity of patent litigation harmonization of us patent law with the laws of our leading trading partners potential abuses committed by

different industries can be expected to espouse dissimilar views of certain patent reform proposals before turning to more specific analysis of individual legislative proposals this report reviews the proposed legislations broader themes with regard to these issues and concerns patent quality government industry academia and the patent bar alike have long insisted that the uspto approve only those patent app lications that desc ribe and claim patentable advance30 because they meet all the requirements imposed by the patent laws quality patents may be dependably enforced in court and employed as technology transfer tool such patents are said to confirm private rights by making their proprietary uses and therefore their value more predictable quality patents also may clarify the extent that others may approach the protected invention without infringing these traits in turn should st rengthen the incentives of private actors to engage in valuemaximizing activitie s such as innovation or commercial transactions31 in contrast poor patent qua lity is said to hold delete rious consequences large numbers of inappropriately granted patents may negatively impact entrepreneurs for example innovative firms may be approach ed by an individual with low quality patent that appears to cove r the product they are marketing the innovative firm may recognize that the cost of challenging patent even of dubious validity may be considerable therefore the firm ma choose to make payments under licensing arrangements or perhaps decide not to mark et its product at all rather than contest the

behavior perhaps attracted by large damages awards and potentially porous uspto rentseeking entrepreneurs may be attracted to form speculative patent acquisition and enforcement ventures industry particip ants may also be forced to expend considerable sums on patent acquisition and enforcement33 the net results would be reduced rates of innovation decreased patentbased transactions and higher prices for goods and services although low patent quality appears to ffect both investors and competitors of patentee patent proprietors themselves may also be negatively impacted patent owners may make managerial decisions such as whether to build production facilities or sell product ba sed upon their expectation of exclusive rights in particular invention if th eir patent is declared invalid by the uspto or court patentees will be stripped of exclusive ri ghts without compensation the issuance of large numbers of invalid patents would increase the possibility that the investment backed expectations of pate ntees would be disappointed34 the notion that high patent quality is socially desirable has been challenged however some commentators believe that market forces will efficiently assign patent rights matter what their quality others observe that few issued patents are the subject of litigation and further estimate that only minority of patents are licensed or sold because many patented i nventions are not used in way that calls their validity into question some observe rs maintain societ may be better off making detailed review into the patentability of an invention only in those few cases where that invention is of commercial significance35 pending legislation bears upon the patent quality issue both the house and senate bills hr 1908 and s 1145 would allow for incr eased public participation in uspto decisionmaking through preissuance submission procedure these bills also allow for postissuance review proceedings which would potentially allow interested parties to weed out invalid patents before they are the subject of licensing or infringement litigation litigation costs patent enforcement is often expensive the complex legal and technological issues

average of 35 to 40 pate nt lawsuits annually at cost of almost 100 million40 the intel corporation has r ecently been estimated to spend 20 million year on patent litigation41 the high costs of litigation may discourage patent proprietors from bringing meritorious claims against infringers they may also encourage firms to license patents of dubious merit rather than contest them in c ourt pending legislation would endeavor to make patent litigation less costly and complex through modification of the doctrine of willful infringement h r 1908 and s 1145 would also allow for an

inventors as result us inventors commonly seek patent protection abroad doing so can be costly timeconsuming and difficult process there is global patent system inventors who desire intell ectual

rather than engage in research development manufacturing or other socially productive activity43 p t n t speculators are sometimes termed trolls after creatures from folklore that would emerge from

mentioned in this context the total revenue of the lemels on estates patent li censing program has been reported as in excess of 15 billion45 but as explained by journalist michael ravnitsky critics charge that many lemelson patents are socalled submarine patents overly broad applications that took so long to issue or were so general in nature that their owners could unfairl claim broad infringement across entire industry sectors46 of such patent ventures pate nt attorney james pooley observes of course there is nothing inherently wr ong with charging someone rent to use your property including intellectual prope rty like patents but its useful to keep in mind especially when listening to prattle about losing american jobs to foreign competition that these patent mills produce products their only output is paper of highly threatening sort47 patent enforcement suits brought by patent speculators appear to present special concerns for manufacturers and service provi ders if one manufacturer or service provider commences litigation against another the defendant can often assert its own claims of patent infringement against the plaintiff because patent speculators do not otherwise participate in th marketplace however the fendant is unable to counter with its own patent infringement charges this asymmetry in litigation

nonmanufacturing pa tentee may lack the expertise or resources to produce patented product prefer to commit itsel f to further innovation or otherwise have legitimate reasons for its behavior49 universities and small biotechnology companies often fit into this category further whether classified as troll or not each patent owner has presumptively fu lfilled all of the re levant statutory

and small innovative firms play role in the technological advancement and economic grow th of the united states51 several studies commissioned by us federal agencies have concluded that individuals

do not have these mechanisms at their disposal as result the patent system may enjoy heightened importance with respect to these enterprises54 in recent years universities have also b ecome more fullfledged participants in the patent system this trend has been attributed to the bayhdole act55 federal statute that allowed universi ties and other government c ontractors to retain patent title to inventions deve loped with the benef it of federal funding56 in recent years there has reportedly been dramatic incr ease in academic institutions investments in technology licensing activities57 this increase has been reflected in the growth in the number of patents held by uni versities the number of universities with technology transfer offices and the amount of patentbased licensing revenues that these offices have raised58 the us patent system has long acknow ledged the role and particular needs of independent inventors small firms and universities for example the patent statute calls for each of these tities to r eceive 50 discount on many uspto fees59 as the uspto is currently entirely funded by the fees it charges its users60 this provision effectively calls for larger institutions to subsidize the patent expenditures of their smaller competitors beyond potentially diminished financial resources visavis larger concerns however observers have disagreed over whet her independent inve ntors small firms and universities have particular needs with respect to the patent system and if so whether those needs should be reflected in patent law doctr ines with respect to

subject to the same patentability requi rements scope of rights nd term of protection both experience and economic research suggest that distinct industries encounter the patent system in different ways however64 as result it can be expected that particular industries will react differently to the va rious patent reform proposals currently before congress65 although broad generalizations should be drawn with care two industries widely perceived as viewing the patent system in different ways are the pharmaceutical and software sectors with in the pharmaceutical industry individual patents are

expensive complicated and time consuming to duplicate an airplane it is relatively simple to perform chemical analysis of pill and reproduce it66 in contrast to the pharmaceutical field the nature of software development is such that innovations are typically cumulative and new products often embody numerous patentable inventions this environment has led to what has been described as poor match between patents and products in the software industry it is difficult to patent an entire product in the software i ndustry becau any particular product is likely to include dozens if not hundreds of separate technological ideas67 this situation may be augmented by the multiplicity of patents often associated with finished computer product that utilizes the software it is not uncommon for thousands of different patent s relating to hardware and software to be embodied in one single computer in addition owners hip of these patents may well be fractured among hundreds or thousands of di fferent individuals and firms in summary then the patent laws provide one size f its all system where all inventions are subject to the same re quirements of patent ability and scope of protection regardless of the technical field in which they arose innovators in different fields nonetheless ve varying experiences with the patent system these discrepancies among others lead to the ex pectation

disputes may be resolved via interference proceedings conducted at the uspto76 an interference is complex administrative proceeding that may result in the award of priority to one of its participants these proceedings are not especially common one estimate concludes that less than onequarter of one percent of patents are subject to an interference77 this statistic may mislead however because the expense of interference cases mayresult in their use only for the most commercially significant inventions shift to firstinventortofile priority rule would eliminate the need for interference proceedings instead the applicant with the earliest filing date rather than the first individual to have created the invention w ould have been eligible for the patent the relative merits of the firsttoinve nt and firstinventortofile priority principles have been the subject of ngthy debate within the patent community supporters of the current first toinvent principle in part ssert that the firstinventor tofile system would create inequities by sponsoring race to the patent office they are also concerned that the firsttofile system would encourage premature and sketchy technological disclosures in hastilyfiled pate nt applications 78 supporters of the firstinvent ortofile principle in part assert that it provides definite readily determined and fixed date of priority of invention which would lead to greater legal certainty within innovative industries they also contend that the firstinventortofile principle would d ecrease the complexity length and expense associated with current uspto interference proceedings rather than being caught up in lengthy interference proceedings in an attempt to prove dates of inventive activity that occurred many years previously they assert invent ors could continue to go about the process of innova tion supporters also observe that informed us firms already organize their affairs on firsti nventortofile basis in order to avoid

enterprises81 whether the us constitution places rest raints upon the selection of patent priority principle has also been debated article i section 8 clause 8 of the constitution provides congress with the authority to award inventors with exclusive rights some observers suggest this language suggests or possibly even mandates the current firsttoinvent system others conclude that because the first inventortofile only awards patents to individuals who actually developed the invention themselves rather than derived it from another this priority system is permissible under the constitution82 in weighing the validity of this position it should be noted that under well established us law the firstinventorinfact does not always obtain entitlement to patent if for example firstinventorinfact maintain ed his invention as trade secret for many years before seeking patent protection he may be judged to have abandoned suppressed or c oncealed the invention83 in such case second inventorinfact may be awarded patent on that invention courts have reasoned that this statutory rule encourages individuals to disclose their inventions to the public promptly or give way to an inventor who in fact does so84 as the first inventortofile rule acts in similar fashion to this longstanding patent law principle conflict between this rule and the constitution appears unlikely notably firstinventortofile priority rule does not permit one individual to copy anothers invention and then by virtue of being the first to file patent application be entitled to pa tent all patent applicants must have originated the invention themselves rather than derived it from another85 in order to police this requirement both bills would provide for inventors rights contests that

knows that she has one year from the publication date in which to file patent application im portantly uses sales and other technical disclosures by third parties will also start the oney ear clock running as result inventors have broader range of concerns than merely their own activities90 suppose for example that an electrical engi neer files patent application claiming new capacitor on

invented the subject matter of their application prior to the date of the reference if the applicant can make such showing then the reference cannot ordinar ily be used to defeat the patentability of

this proposal disclosures made by the inventor or joint inventor or by others who obtained the subject matter disclo sed directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor would not be patent

if they were made either by 1 the inventors and their associates more than one year before the patent applications filing date or 2 anyone else prior to the filing date provided that such disclosure occurred prior to the invent ors own disclosure these amendments would in essence protect the patent pos itions of individuals who disclosed their inventions up to one year before they f iled patent

obtain for this country the free use of the inventions of foreigners as soon as they became free abroad this is indicated by the use of the phrase first patented or caused to be patented in foreign country for it was presumable that american citizens would obtain their first patent here while foreigner woul d first patent his invention in his own country the statute was designed to prevent foreigner from spending his time and capital in the development of an invention in his own country and then coming to this country to enjoy further monopoly when the invention had become free at home the result of such course would be that while the foreign country was developing the invention and enjoying its benefits its use could be interdicted here while if the term of the monopoly could be further extended here the market could be controlled l ong after the foreign nation was prepared to flood this country with the unpatent ed products of the patented process99 section 102d has been

appli cation must be filed by the inventor that is to say the natural person or persons who developed the invention102 this rule applies even where the invention was deve loped by individuals in their

for the patent in particular s ection 115 of the patent act obliges each applicant must also submit an oath or declaration stating that he believes himself to be the original and firs t inventor of the subject matter for which he seeks patent section 118 of the pa tent act allows few exceptions to this general rule if an inventor cannot be located or refuse s to perform his contractual

encouraging this shift 1966 report of the presidents commission on the patent system recommended the allowance of assignee filing as way to simplify formalities of application filing and to avoid delays caused by the need to identify and obtain signatures from each inventor106 the 1992 advisory co mmission on patent law reform was also in favor of this change the 1992 commission observed that the united states was the only country which does not permit the assignee of an invention to file patent application in its own name107 i n the opinion of the 1992 commission assignee f iling would appropriately accompany us shift to firstinventortofile prio rity system as the reduction of formalities would allow innovative enterprises to file patent applicati ons more promptly the 1992 commission also explained that adoption of assignee filing may have some negative consequences the commission noted that patent applications filed by assignees may lack the actual inventors personal

product or process that is found to infringe may incorporate numerous additional elements beyond the patented invention for example the asserted patent may relate to single component of an audio speaker while the accused product consists of the entire stereo system in such circumstances court may apply the entire market value rule which permits recovery of damages based upon the entire apparatus cont aining several features where the patentrelated feature is the basis for consumer demand109 on the other hand if the court determines that the infringing sales were due to many factors beyond the use of the patented inven tion the court may apply principles of apportionment to measure damages based upon the value of the patented feature alone110 some observers believe that courts have sometimes been overly generous in assessing damages in patent cases as one commentator asserted broad application of the entire market value rule appears to broaden the practical scope of remedy for patent infringement beyond the legal scope of the patent and despite careful attention to precise and proper construction of claim terms further although the entire market value rule was conceived to ensure proper level of damages for the infringemen t by recognizing patents value that went beyond sales of single product the courts abandonment of meaningful basis of consumer demand test requires an infringer to pay damages for an entire system despite that the patent has been issued on only narrow piece that has little market impact on sales of unpatented components similarly failing to provide subsequent inventors with clear notice of their potential liability by uneven application of the entire market value rule may chill innovation and interfere with the public notice requirements on which the patent laws depend overcompensating initial inventors and ov erdeterring subsequent inventors interferes with the balance sought to be struck by proper claim interpretation111 other commentators disagree believing that current case law appropriately incorporates apportionment principles th commentators also believe that the proposed reforms would diminish the value of the patent right to the detriment of the innovation environment of the unite d states one observer states courts have had little difficulty applying the current law on apportionment and the entire market value rule to reach just and reasonable findings on assessment of damages patent infringement damages are the culmination of the courts long and careful efforts to adhere to the stat utory requirement to provide damages adequate to compensate for the infri ngement of an inventors patent apportionment recognizes the reality that consumer demand for an infringing product or process

can reliably determine the correct royalty base and rate that will award damages adequate to compensate for the infringement112 in brief hr 1908 calls for court to select one of the following methods for determining reasonable royalty as the measure of damages 1 the economic value of the properly attributable to the patents specific cont ribution over the prior art 2 the entire market value rule or 3 other factors such as terms of the nonexclusive marketplace licensing of the invention113 s 1145 requires courts to select the method for calculating reasona ble royalties from either 1 the entire market value rule 2 an established ro yalty based upon marketplace licensing or 3 the economic value of the infringement attributable to the claimed inventions specific contribution over the prior art114 views differ on the appropria teness of this reform some believe that current damages standards have resulted in the systemic overc ompensation of patent owners such overcompensation may place unreas onable royalty burdens upon producers of high technology products ultimately imp eding the process of technological innovation and dissemination that the patent system is meant to foster others believe that current case law appropria tely accounts for apportionment concerns these observers are concerned that this reform might overly restrict damages in patent cases thereby

in re seagate technology federal circuit decisions emphasize d the duty of someone with actual notice of competitors patent to exercise due care in determining if his acts will infringe that patent119 in seagate technology however the federal circuit opted to abandon the affirmative duty of due care120 the court of appeals instead explained that proof of willful infringement permitting enhanced damages requires at least showing of objective recklessness121 prior to 2004 the federal circuit held that when an accused infringer invoked the attorneyclient or workproduct priv ilege courts should be free to reach an adverse inference that either 1 opini on had been obtained or 2 an opinion had been obtained and was contrary to the infri ngerss desire to c ontinue practicing the patented invention122 however in its decision in knorrbremse systeme fuer nutzfahrzeuge gmbh v dana corp 123 the federal circuit ex pressly overturned this principle the court of appeals further st ressed that the failure to obtain legal advice did not occasion an adverse inference with respect to willful infringement either following the knorrbremse opinion willful infringement determinations are based upon the totality of circumstances but without the evidentiary contribution or presumptive weight of an adverse inferen ce that any opinion of counsel was or would have been unfavorable124 patent laws willful infringement doctrine has proven controversial some observers believe that this doctrine ensures that patent rights will be respected in the marketplace critics of the policy believe that the possi bility of trebled damages discourages individuals from reviewing issu ed patents out of fear that their inquisitiveness will result in multiple damages innovators may simply avoid looking at

1908 and s 1145 include identical language that would add several clarifications and changes to the law of willful infringement first finding of willful infringement would be appropriate only where 1 the infringer received specific written notice from the patentee and continued to infringe after reasonable opportunity to investigate 2 the infring er intentionally copied from the patentee with knowledge of the patent or 3 the infringer continued to infringe after an adverse court ruling second willful infringement cannot be found where the infringer possessed an informed good faith belief that its conduct was not infringing finally court may not determine willful infringement before the date on which the court determines that the patent is not invalid enforceable and infringed126 marking the patent act encourages patent proprietors that manufacture their patented inventions to notify the public of their pa tent rights section 287a provides that patent owners should place th word patent or the bbreviation pat along with the number of the patent on patented goods if the nature of the article does not allow this notice to be placed directly upon it then label may be placed on the article or its packaging this pr actice is commonly termed marking127 there is absolute duty to mark if patent proprietor fails to mark in the specified manner however then it may receive damages only for infringing acts that occur after the infringer receives actual notice of infringement128 filing an infringement lawsuit is considered to provide such actual notice less severely patent owner may issue specific charge of infringement commonly by sending cease and desist letter to the infringer the marking statute is said to give patentees the proper incentive to mark their products and thus place the world on notice of the existence of the patent129 the marking statute does not apply in some situations obviously if the patent owner does not sell products that embody th

patent system trade secrecy protects individuals from misappropria tion of valuable information that is useful in commerce one reason an inventor might maintain the invention as trade secret rather than seek patent protection is that the subject matter of the invention may not be regarded as patentable such inventions as customer lists or data compilations have traditionally been regarded as amenable to trade secret protection but not to patenting134 inventors might also maintain tr ade secret protection due to ignorancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33996crs28 135 david d friedman some econom

statutorily prescribed patent rm the patent law grants patents term of twenty years commencing from the date patent application is filed137 if the trade secret holder could make commercial use of an invention for many years before choosing to file patent application he could disrupt this regime by delaying the expirati on date of his patent on the other hand settled pate nt law principles establis hed that prior secret uses would not defeat the pate nts of later inventors138 if an earlier inventor made secret commercial use of an inven tion and another person indepe ndently invented the same technology later and obtained patent protection then the trade secret holder could face liability for patent infringement th is policy is based upon the reasoning that once issued publ ished

uspto approves the patent application then inventor faces infringement liability should inventor b file suit against him the american inventors protection act of 1999 somewhat modified this principle

congress intended reexamination procee dings to serve as an inexpensive alternative to judicial determinations of patent validity143 reexamination also allows further access to the legal and technical expertise of the uspto after patent has issued144 however some commentators believe that reexamination proceedings have been employed only sparingl and question their effectiveness145 both the house and senate bills propos an additional postissuance proceeding termed postgrant review proceeding wh ich are similar in broad aspect but differ on many significant details the two bills provide that any person other than the patent proprietor may comme nce this proceeding under hr 1908 the proceeding may begin either within 12 months of the date the patent was issued or at any time if the patent proprietor so consents146 s 1145 additionally allows the proceeding to begin within 12 months after the challenger has received notice from the patent holder alleging infringement provided that the

that potential requesters are discouraged from commencing inter partes reexamination proceedings due to statutory provision that limits their future options in order to discourage abuse of these proceedings the inter partes reexamination statute pr ovides that thirdparty participants may not later assert that patent is invalid on any ground that they raised or could have raised during the

this concern hr 1908 would delete the phr ase or could have raised from the statute153 as result inter partes reexamination requesters would be limited only with respect to arguments that they actually made before the uspto many observers have called for the united states to adopt more effective post grant administrative revocation system in order to provide more timely lower cost and more efficient review of issued patents154 such system could potentially improve the quality of issued patents by weeding out invalid claims it might also encourage innovative firms to review issu ed patents soon after they are granted thereby increasing the opportunity for technology spillovers155 however concerns have arisen over oppositions because they t oo may be costly co mplex and prone to

until recent years the us patent system maintained pending patent applications in secrecy the first moment that the public would become aware of the existence of us patent application was the day the uspto formally allowed it to issue as granted patent this regime advantaged patent applicants because it allowed them to understand exactly what th scope of any allowed claims might be prior to disclosing an invention thus if the applicant was able to maintain the invention that was subject to patent app lication as trade secret then he could choose between obtaining the allowed patent claims and trade secret status in addition because the invention was not disclo sed prior to the award of formal patent rights unscrupulous competitors were di scouraged from copying the invention however this secrecy regime has been perceived as imposing costs as well others might well engage in duplicative research efforts during the pendency of patent applications unaware that an earlier inventor had already staked claim to that technology this arrangement also llowed inventors to commence infringement litigation on the very day patent issue d without any degree of notice to other members of the technological community157 industry in the united states possessed one mechanism for identifying pending us patent applications most foreig n patent regimes publis h all pending patent applications approximate ly 18 months after they have been filed158 as result savvy firms in the united states could re view pending appli cations filed before foreign patent offices and make an edu cated guess as to the existence of corresponding us application this ffort was necessarily inexact however particularly as some invent ors either lacked the resources or made the strategic decision not to obtain patent ri ghts outside the united states in enacting the american inventors protection act of 1999 congress for the first time introduced the concept of pregr ant publication into us law since november 29 2000 us patent applications have been published 18 months from the date of filing with some exceptions the most significant of these exceptions applies where the inventor represents that he will not seek patent protection abroad in particular if an applicant certifies that the invention disclosed in the us application will not be the subject of pa tent application in another country that requires publication of applications 18 months after filing then the uspto will not publish the application159 as result inventors who do not wish to seek foreign patent rights retain the possibility of avoiding pregrant publication hr 1908 and s 1145 would further modify the us pregrant publication system but the would do so in diffe rent ways under s 1145 all pending applications to

disclosing the invention publicly as result although both bills would eliminate the possibility of opting out of pregrant pub lication by certifying that patent will be sought only in the united states the precise timing of the publication of those applications potentially differs161 preissuance submissions both hr 1908 and s 1145 would expand the ability of members of the public to submit information to the uspto that is pertinent to pending applications under current law interested individuals may ter protest against patent application the protest must specifically identify the application and be served upon the applicant the protest must also incl ude copy and if necessary an english translation of any patent publication or other informa tion relied upon the protester also must explain the relevance of each item162 protest proceedings have traditionally played small role in us patent practice until congress enacted the american inve ntors protection act of 1999 the uspto maintained applications in secrecy theref ore the circumstances in which members of the public would learn of the precise cont ents of pending pa tent application were relatively limited with the uspto commenc ing publication of some pending patent applications protests would seem far more likely seemingly aware of this possibility the 1999 act provided that the uspto shall ensure that protest or other form of preissuance opposition ma be initiated after publication of the application without the express wr itten consent of the applicant163 of course the effect of this provision is to eliminate the possibility of protest in exactly that class of cases where the public is most likely to learn of the contents of pending application through rulemaking the uspto s nonetheless

each submitted document166 most observers agree that ideally the uspto should have access to all pertinent information when making patentability determinations more expansive pre issuance submission policy may allow members of the public to disclose relevant patents and other documents that the usptos own searchers may not have revealed thereby leading to more accurate uspto decision making on the other hand lengthy preissuance submissions may merely be repetitive of the usptos own search results but still require extensive periods of examiner review that might ultimately delay examinati on

proper either 1 in the judicial district where the defenda nt resides or 2 where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has re gular and established place of business an important question under this provision is where corporation is deemed to reside prior to 1988 corporation was viewed as residing in its state of incorporation179 commentators have explained th at during this period the patent venue statute was fairly restrictive tending to move infringement litigation into the defendants seat of operations180 congressional amendments subsequently liberalized venue c oncepts in patent litigation in 1988 congress adopted new definition of resid as it applies to venue for corporate defendants181 under the new definition corporation is presumed to reside in any j udicial district to which it could be subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the litigation commences congress codified this change in separate provision found at 28 usc 1391 although there is evidence that congress contemplated that these reforms would hold consequences for the specialized patent venue statute the fe deral circuit nonethel ess held that this amendment should also be read into 1400b182 the result of the 1988 amendments has been significant for corporate defendants which cons titute the majority of defendant s in patent litigation although 1400b still governs venue in patent cases few if any plaintiffs rely upon the restrictive second prong of that sec tion instead they base venue upon the residence requirement of the first pr ong which now is entirely conterminous with personal jurisdiction and which for larger corporations is likely to include every federal district in the country for corpor ate defendants then the venue statute has essentially become

of inequitabl conduct if an applicant intentionally misrepresents material fact or fails to disclose material information then the resulting patent will be declared unenforceable207 two elements must

prosecution of the patent208 second such nondisclosure or misrepresentation must ve been intentional209 during patent infringement litigation an accused infringer has the option of asserting that the plaintiffs patent is unenforceable because it was procured through inequitable conduct concerns have arisen that charge s of inequitable conduct have become routine in patent cases as one commentator explains the strategic and technical advantages that the inequitable conduct defense offers the accused infringer make it almost too attractive to ignore in addition to the potential effect on the outcome of the litigation injecting the inequitable conduct issue into patent litigation wreaks havoc in the patentees camp the inequitable conduct defense places the patentee on the defensive subjects the motives and conduct of the patentees personnel to intense scrutiny and provides an avenue for discovery of attorneyclient and work product documents 210 as the federal circuit put it the habit of charging inequita ble conduct in almost every major patent case has become an absolute plague211 other observers believe that because inequitable conduc t requires an analysis of the knowledge and intentions of the patent applicants the doctrine may also be contributing disproportionately to the time and expense of patent litigation212 due to these perceived burdens upon pa tent litigation some commentators have proposed that the inequitable conduct defense be eliminated213 others believe that inequitable conduct is necessary to ensu re the proper functioning of the patent

unenforceability defense provides necessary incentive for patent applicants to engage in fair nd open dealing with the uspto during the ex parte prosecution of patent applications by imposing the penalty of forfeiture of patent rights for failure to so deal the defense is also considered to be an essential safeguard against truly fraudulent conduct before the uspto finally the defense provides means for encouraging complete disclosure of information relevant to particular patent application thus from policy perspective the defense of unenf orceability based u pon inequ itable c onduct is desirable and should be retained214 both hr 1908 and s 1145 would for the first time codify th basic parameters of the inequitable conduct although their approaches somewhat differ under hr 1908 holding of inequitable conduct is appr opriate only if the patentee its agents or another person with duty of disclosure to the uspto intentionally misrepresents or fails to disclose materi information such that the uspto would have made prima facie finding of unpatentability215 s 1145 instead explains that information is considered material if it is not cumulative to evidence already before the examiner and reasonable patent examiner would consider such information important in deciding whether to allow the patent application216 both bills set the clear and convincing evidence standard for provi ng that inequitable conduct occurred modification of the best mode requirement currently inventors are required to set fo rth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention 217 failure to disclose the best mode known to the inventor is ground for invalidatin g an issued patent the courts have established twopart standard for analyz ing whether an invent or disclosed her best mode in particular patent the first inquiry was whether the inventor knew of way of practicing the claimed invention that she considered superior to any other if so then the patent instrument must identify and disclose sufficient information to enable persons of skill in the art to practice that best mode218 proponents of the best mode requirement have asserted that it allows the public to receive the most advantageous imple mentation of the technology known to the inventor this disclosure becomes part of the patent literature and may be freely reviewed by those who

the patentee on equal footing after the patent expires219 the best mode requirement has encountered severe criticism in recent years however220 for example 1992 presidential commission recommended that congress eliminate the best mode requi rement the commission reasoned that patents also are statutorily required to di sclose the manner nd process of making and using the invention in such full clear concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the same221 this enablement requirement was belie ved to provide sufficient info rmation to achieve the patent laws policy goals222 the commission further stated that the best mode requirement leads to increases in the costs and complexity of patent litigation as the commission explained the disturbing rise in the number of best mode challenges over the past 20 years may serve as an indicator that the best mode defense is being used primarily as procedural tactic party currently can assert failure to satisfy the best mode requirement without any significant burden this assertion also entitles the party to seek discovery on the subjective beliefs of the inventors prior to the filing date of the patent application this broad authority provides ample opportunity for discovery abuse given the fluidity by which the requirement is evaluated eg even accidental failure to disclose any superior element setting or step can negate the validity of the patent and the wide ranging opportunities for discovery it is almost certain that best mode challenge will survive at least initial judicial scrutiny223 the commission further reasoned that the best mode at the time of filing is unlikely to remain the best mode when the patent expires many years later224 because many foreign patent laws include analog to the best mode require ment inventors based overseas have also questioned the desirability of the best mode requirement in us law although legislation introduced in the 109th congress proposed the elimination of the best mode requirement225 hr 1908 takes different approach under this proposal the best mode require ment continues to apply to all patents but it longer forms the basis
