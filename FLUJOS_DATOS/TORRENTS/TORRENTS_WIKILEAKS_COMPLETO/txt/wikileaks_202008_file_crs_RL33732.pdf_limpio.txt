opm the method used to set locality rates closes uniform percentage of the remaining locality pay disparity after accounting for current locality rates even though the overall pay disparity is higher in the san josesan francisco locality pay area the pay disparity in the washington dc locality pay area increased faster between surveys so there is larger remaining pay disparity in the washington dc locality pay area hence the dc locality pay raise is higher in 2008 even though the san josesan francisco locality rate is higher the actual pay rates are calculated in the following way first the basic general schedule gs is increased by the annual adjustment percentage resulting in new gs schedule the new basic gs rates are then increased by the locality payments the resulting pay rates annual locality are compared with the pay rates annual locality for the previous year to derive the net increases in pay for the current year according to opm the net increase is calculated using this formula 1 plus the new local rate divided by one plus the old local rate times 1025 for the acrosstheboard increase minus 1 times 100 for example in the washington dc pay area the calculation is 1208911859 x 1025 1 x 100 449 salary tables for 2008 are available on the internet at httpwwwopmgov
