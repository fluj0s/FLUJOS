assessments an d decision making is being increasingly recognized numerous statutes direct federa l agencies to provide goods and services efficiently often necessitating measure of nonmarket values however legislative issues have focused on damage assessment under superfund because the tax authorization under this law expired at the end of 1996 and thus congress may debate its reauthorization including nonmarket values in damage assessment and decisionmaking can b highly controversial proponents assert that excluding not estimating such values understates to tal values affected often substantially and biases decisions in favor of development critics counter that the measurement methodology is weak and that such measures are not comparable to traditional measures of utilitarian values be cause resource use generates economic and social benefits beyond those measured by price and volume the traditional measures of utilitarian value thus they argue that including nonmarket values can lead to arbitrary assessments of damage contingent valuation is survey technique that is purported to estimate th nonmar ket value of the specified goods and services the regulations for cost an d damage recovery under the federal superfund program explicitly recognize the us of contingent valuation as tool for estimating such values contingent valuatio n surveys have be used in numerous settings three significant examples include the valuation of air qu ality improvement at the grand canyon the valuation of damages resulting from the exxon valdez oil spill in alaska and the valuation of benefits from altering glen canyon dam operations contingent valuation surveys use hypothetical markets to replicate actual mar kets or referenda for respondents to reveal their preferences for good typically respondents are asked h ow much they would be willing to pay in higher prices or in taxes for part icular action the results of such surveys can always be questioned because of the array of po ssible measurement errors and biases because of empirical evidence challenging their r eliability and validity and because of incompatibility with marketbased use values nonetheless nonuse values are real and ignoring the m could significantly understate total losses since nonuse values can at times b substantial thus using contingent valuation and other methods to estimate nonuse values is likely to continue and to become more controversialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30242contents introduction crs1 legislative background crs1 federal resource decisionmaking crs2

resources assessing nonmarket values through contingent valuation introduction contingent valuation is survey method used to estimate the nonuse value f public goo ds generally defined as the value people place on certain goods simply because those goods exist contingent valuation is becoming more widely used i n appraising natural resource damag and in decisionmaking critics object to its use arguing that such surveys of existence values are not comparable to the traditiona l measures of utilitarian values because resource use generates economic and socia l benefits beyond those measured by price and quantity the traditional measures f utilitarian value this issue is of interest to congress because the regulations t implement superfund allow the use of contingent valuation for measuring nonus values in damage assessment the superfund tax has recently expired and its re authoriz ation may be debated in the 106 congress other laws allow for nonus eth values in damage appraisals and cost recovery and federal resource managemen t agencies are often required to balanc values provided ultimately congress may be asked to decide whether and how nonuse val ues are to be included and balanced with use values in damage assessments and in resource management this report describes the use of contingent valuation surveys for estimatin g nonuse values it contains brief legislative background on the use of contingen t valuation surveys under superfun d and other statutes providing for cost recovery for resource damages that is followed by an overview of the economic theory behind measuring nonuse values and then brief discussion of three cases where contingent valuation surveys were used the remainder of the report describes the contingent valuation method survey design reliability and measurement error validity an d bias and three empirical critiques legislative background federal resource decisionmaking as described in the following section governments that own natural resources manage them for number of purposes their actions are sometimes justified by the real or perceived failures or limitations in the markets for many of the goods an d services provided by lands and resources for example the reclamation act of 1902 authorized the secretary of the i nterior to provide water to irrigate agricultural lands in the arid west when private developers were unable or unwilling to finance wate rhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30242crs2 see for example the water resources development act of 1986 wrda pl 991 662 which altered costsharing formulas for many corps projects typically authorizing legislation for water projects specify which costs are to be at least partly reimbursed by users such as for irrigation and for municipal and industrial use and which are to be borne by the federal government such as for recreation use nd fish and wildlife habitat these cost shares are allocated based on the relative benefits produced for more see crs report 9898 0 enr federal sales of natural resources pricing and allocation mechanisms pl 96510 94 stat 2767 as amended 42 usc 9601 et seq 2development the purposes for building and operating lar ge water projects have been expanded over the years to in clude municipal and other water supplies downstream flood control recreational use and fish and wildlife habitat the bureau f reclamation and the army corps of engineers which constructs and operates dams mainly in the east and midwest are required to allocate costs among the variou s beneficiaries and thus implicitly to value the goods and services that the project s provide and that are not sold in markets1 similarly management decisions for federal lands often address goods an d services that are not sold in markets the national forests managed by the fores t service an d the public lands managed by the bureau of land management are to be administered for sustained yields of multiple uses high regular or periodic outputs for outdoor recreation range timber watershed and wildlife and fish purposes while maintaining the productivity of the land the federal land policy and man agement act of 1976 also specifies that the federal government should receive fair market value of the use of the public lands and their resources unless otherwis provided for by statute beca use the level and mix of uses are mainly determined in public planning and by the annual congressional budget pr ocess some analysts believe comparable valuation measur for the marketed commodities and the nonmarketed goods and services could prove useful for approximating socially efficient mix f outputs this could i nclude more astute use of markets and market signals as well as nonmarket valuation techniques to date contingent valuation has apparently not been used by the agencies for valuing the unmarketed goods and services in either of these contexts the statutes and regulations governing these decisionmaking processes do not specify how t value the unmarketed goods and services or to balance these values with marketed goods and services however the necessary alloca tions explicit for water projects and implicit for land management requir some comparable valuation contingent valuation is technique that might prove useful in some situations damage assessment in contrast to federal resourc decisionmaking federal damage

assessment the panel conc luded that contingent valuation could be used for such purpose subject to numerous conditions the final report was published in the federal register on january 15 199310 economic theory of measuring values the capitalist economic system of the united states generally relies on trans actions between producers and consumers in free markets to determine the outputs of goods and services prices established within this private exchange system are the basis for allocating land bor and capital among producers and goods and services among consumers prices are also the standard measure of value for such privatel traded goods and services governments often intervene in private transactions by regulating privat actions by altering incen tives or by owning factors of production to alter market results that are deemed socially or politically unacceptable reasons cited for gov ernment intervention include two classical market limitations also called marke t failures externalities and public goods externalities occur when private trans actions between producers and consumers affect third parties those not involved in the exchange and those effects are not taken into account in the exchange for11 example timber sales re exchanges between landowners and timber processors buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30242crs5 john v krutilla conservation reconsidered american

hereafter referred to as mitchell and carsonsales can affect other people by altering animal habitats the quantity and quality f water flows and other land and resource conditions externalities are considere d market limitations because the exchanges ignore some of the costs or benefits they impose on society and thus may result in more or less production than is socially desirable the second classical market problem is public goods goods and services which can be used by one person without affecting the amount available for others an d which are provided to all because individuals cannot be excluded from the benefits such goods are also called nondepletable or nonrival goo ds if the good is provided at all it is not possible to exclude anyone from obtaining the benefits for example if we have national defense all citizens have the same amount available to them n matter how great demand they have for it or how much they pay two additional aspects are common but not required in public goods indivisibility and high trans action costs indivisibility resul ts when the good or service cannot be divided among users for example individually owned pieces of the statue f liberty would not make much sense because its value is in its entirety not in its constituent pieces hig h transaction costs occur when the owner or producer has difficulty controlling an d therefore charging for the use or enjoyment for example the sheer size an d accessibility of many lakes would prevent effective private control and access fees in the most extreme forms individuals cannot be excluded from receiving benefits private transactions in public goods may result in market failures because th possibility of simultan eous use the indivisibility and the difficulty or impossibility of controlling benefits make profitable private exchange ineffective and thus fewe r public goods would be provided by private markets than are considered sociall desirable nonuse values as discussed above public goods eg the statue of liberty provided by the government are ften used eg for recreation many public goods also have non use values the value individuals place on goods or services which they do t consume directly often because an amenity or resource simply exists known s existence value it appears to have been first described by john krutilla in 196712 evidence of such values is illustrated by voluntary contributions to multitude f efforts and organizations people are often willing to contribute time and money for things they feel have social value eg public television for individuals existence value can be inherent valued solely because it exists or for the future valued be cause future generations will have it available even if it is never used this i s sometimes known as bequest value13 when uncertainty is considered another form of existence value may result people may be willing to pay for the option of using good or service in the futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30242crs6 mitchell and carson pp 697414 this is not to say that markets ca nnot exist for many governmentprovided goods but15 rather that society has chosen not to use markets for allocating those resources and fo r determining efficient production levels livestock grazing on federal lands for example is not allocated among ranchers by market decision and is priced at an administrativel determined fee not at rate set by market for such grazingtypically at particular price for example although you may not currently want to visit recreational site you may be willing to pay to have the option to visit it later this is often known as option value people may also be willing to pay for delays until better in formation is available for example an individual may be willing to pay to delay project that may cause some irreversible effects that are not fully under stood if further informa tion is likely to eliminate or to clarify those effects on the14 other hand markets exist f or option values of depletable goods and services and are generally considered an efficient means of valuing future options and compensating the owner for maintaining that option measuring value in market economy private goods and services are exchanged between pro ducers and consumers the standard measure of value for such goods and services is the price at which the exchange occurs willingly many governmentprovide d goods however cannot be valued so readily because they are not traded in markets and thus ve market price as sign of the willingness of users to pay for th good nonetheless having values for such governmentprovided goods to approx15 imate market prices can be useful for comparing alternative gove rnment programs that provide goods both to improve government effi ciency and to achieve balance when the production of various goods confl ict eg in situations where timber production compromises production of clean water from federal lands when market prices do not exist for governmentprovided goods alternativ methods must be used if one is to estimate the benefits of the public project and to encompa ss total value both use and nonuse values one common approach physical lin kages uses damage functions to estimate changes in direct use values but it does not yield complete measure of benefits because it does not measur existence values the second gener approach behavioral linkages aggregates individual behaviors to estimate values several approaches are possible based on whether some relevant market behavior can be observed

which ar capitalized in the property value or wage respectively as with observeddirec t methods these methods may be inadequat for goods with substantial nonuse values in addition the severe data

on contingent valuation is one such technique it surveys the affected population to elicit the willingnesstopay or willingnessto acceptcomp ensation for change in the amount of good provided or available another technique is to survey citizen opinions concerning the adequacy of current spending levels for public projects such methods are useful because they measure both use and existence values for public goods and they can support the estimation of demand curv and thus be more comparable to market prices for private goods however the rigorous data nd methodological requirements make these techniques difficult to use fairly hypothetica lindirect methods rely on hypothetical markets to indirectly obtain values for the public good in question examples include contingent ranking or

t market prices for private goods and services property rights and value private markets work because the owne rs of the various goods have the right to deny use of the good to those who dont pay thus private goods are also called excludable goods in trast public goods are characterized partly by the inability of owners to exclude beneficiaries who do not pay the rights of individuals to use particular public good or to have it exist are often illdefined this lack of clarity leads to two different questions that can be asked to elicit the value of particula r public good how much would you be willing to pay to acquire the proposed change willingnesstopay or how much would you be willing to accept for the loss of use of quality etc associated with the proposed change willingnesstoaccept compensation willingnesstopay essentially presume s that respondents do not have rights to the good in qu estion and must buy it willingnesstoaccept presumes that respondents do hold property rights to the good in question and that the right t change current conditions must be bought from them16 researchers have found differences between willingnesstopay and willingness toaccept amounts for the same public good with the willingnesstoaccept amount sometimes being bstantially larger willingnesstoaccept is likely to be higher for those goods that do not have close s ubstitutes andor where people refuse to sell the good in question or want very high compensation for it because of some persona l attachment furthermore uncertainty and aversion to risk may lower responses f willingnesstopay other theoretical explanations exist such as that losses in utility wellbeing are valued differently than equivalent gains in utility the choice be17 tween willingnesstopay and willingnesstoaccept depends essentially on who s the right to the good in question since those rights are often not clearly established statutorily the choice may not be obvious

one that has already occurred httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30242crs13 portney p 834 mitchell and carson pp 21122935the implications of any decision should be described in detail respondents should be re minded of their budget constraints that spending for good means reduction in other kinds of goods that can be purchased respondents should also be made aware of possible substitutes for the goo d they are valuing and followup questions should test how well respondents understood the scenario and to try to determine the motivation behind the different responses34 the goal f contingent valuation researchers is to elicit responses that are both reliable and valid variety of techniques such as pretesting tools and trainin g interviewers can reduce or minimize measurement error and bias texts on how to conduct good surveys exist see eg mitchell and carson and the techniques are not described here reliability and measurement error reliability measures the variability among responses valuations with relatively low variation among responses are considered more reliable estimates of value reliability measures whether the responses are consistent with each other and thus is compara ble to precision in statistics it does not measure whether the response s accurately estimate the tr ue value of the good the latter measure is called validity and is dis cussed below reliability contains deterministic component the normal variation in values among individuals and random error due to imperfections in the survey instrument andor sampling variance sampling procedures which are controlled by the researcher influence relia bility two approaches can improve the reliability of responses 1 larger sampl sizes and 2 robust statistical techniques to handle outliers responses that ar considered too extreme relative to the presumed distribution robust statistica l techniques adjust responses that do not represent the true value eg response of 99 to nu mber of dependents in the household and would significantly influence the total valuation average willingnesstopay for example can be significantl influenced by very high responses using robust chniques such as the median value or trimmed value eliminating percentage of responses from both ends of th distribution generally improves the statistical reliability of contingent value surveys35 validity and bias validity measures how accurately the contingent valuation of the good estimates the goods true value to society this is compara ble to accuracy in statistics and bias is the term for the difference between the estimated value and the true value four categories of validity can be used to assess whether the responses are biased 1 content validity 2 criterion validity 3 construct validity and 4 theoretica l validity contents are typically deemed valid if the survey questionnaire i s unambiguous and accurate and closely matches the theoretical concept to b ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30242crs14 on the other hand in the case of the exxon valdez the contingent valuation survey36 tried to measu re the total value of the losses caused by the oil spill while the travel cos t method tried to measure t he lost recreational value one might anticipate that the total value would greatly exceed the recreational value because 1 the beauty and uniqueness of th alaskan coast are well known but the distance to alaska inhibits recreational use thu s making nonuse values substantial relative to use values and 2 the recreation increase in the second year might be attributable to rubbernecking that occurs with many disasters an d does not necessarily offset the nonuse value losses of the disaster mitchell and carson pp 18920937 mitchell and carson pp 23129338measured ce questionnaire surveys are necessarily subjective content validity is always concern with such surveys criterion validi ty requires comparison with some other method that is closer to being theoretically accurate such as an estimate based on derived demand curve for goods whe re use is the majority of the value prices from simulated markets can be used for comparison an example would be simulated market for hunting per mits for goods where nonuse accounts for the majority of the value hypothetica l values can be compared to actual referenda results construct validity comp ares different measures for consistency one form is to compare two methods such as contingent valuation and the trave l cost method to see if the results are reasonably consistent this in essence assesses the correlation be tween two or more measures significant differences such as were found for th exxon valdez raise questions about the co nstruct validity of the contingent valuation survey36 theoretical validity evalu ates whether the results are consistent with theoretical expectations this typically invol ves regression of the willingnesstopay with other independent variables to ch eck whether the direction magnitude and strength of the relationships among variables are consistent with what would be expected unde r economic theory t he lack of criteria and truly comparable methods makes some of these tests of the val idity of contingent valuation difficult but surveys can usually be evaluated for their content and theoretical validity37 certain aspects of contingent valuation surveys could influence responses an d lead to biased results biases can arise in numerous ways be cause individuals behave differently in various settings respondents may interpret the questionnair differently may be motivated by different aspects of the scenario when makin g decisions may respond based on inferences about the use of t heir answers or may use different costminimizing p rocedures or rulesofthumb to make decisions when they know little about th good mitchell and carson describe four types of biases 138 incentiv to misrepresent responses 2 implied value cues 3 scenario specification and 4 sampling design and benefit aggregation biases incentives to misrepresent responses compliant and str ategic behaviors may lead respondents to inaccurately represent their preferences because there are n incentives to tell the truth when the constructed market is hypothetical compliancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30242crs15 bias occurs when respondents give answers that they feel the interviewer wants surveying by neutral party can usually correct for such bias but respondents may still feel the need to give right or normal ie compliant answer strategic bias arises when respondents intentionally misrepresent their pre ferences becau they believe it will influence the amount of the good provided the amount or system for collecting money to provide it or in damage appraisals th compensation table 3 shows the types of strategic behavior depending on the like lihood of t he good being provided and the perceived obligation to pay for the good table 3 strategic behavior in valuing public goods obligation to pay obligation to pay obligation to pay perceived as the perceived as being perceived as being amount offered uncertain fixed provision of good true preference variable true overpledge perceived as reveals true value value might be overstates true contingent on overstated or value revealed preference understated provision of good free ride free ride nonstrategic perceived as likely understates true understates true minimum effort regardless of value value answers that revealed preference minimize time effort source mitchell and carson p 144 the table describes predictions of how individuals would act under differen t payment nd provision characterizations contingent valuation survey is intended to identify true values true val ues are most likely to be revealed when both the fees charged and the amount provided will be based on the response ie on the state d willingnes stopay on the other extreme is minimal effort where respondents feel they will have to pay fixed amount and the good wil l be provided regardless of what they say the other categories contain different types of strategic behavior that will cause respondents to bid inacc urately freeriding underbidding is more likely to occur when respondents feel that the good will be provided irrespective of thei r response overpledging overbidding is more likely to occur when respondent s believe that the good is more likely to be provided with higher bids but the bidders expect to pay fixed amount regardless of the bids most contingent valuatio n studies fall into the variable category because the payment amount is typicall uncertain and provision is usually believed to depend on stated amounts in thi s situation freeriding and overpledging are both possible outcomes other indivi dual behaviors may mitigate strategic behavior including altruistic motives personal honesty and integrity interest in telling the truth the belief tha t many people are being i nterviewed in the survey consideration of ones budget straint when offering bid and the possibility that the good may not be provided at all nonetheless if respondents have beliefs about the likelihood of the good beinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30242crs16 mitchell and carson pp 23125939provided or about the obligation to pay or if they infer such information from th survey strategic behavior can bias the valuation implied value cues another type of bias arises when respondents decide on valuation b ased on some particular aspect of the survey this characteristic of the survey appears to give them clue as to the right answer even if it were not in tended to do so starting point bias which typically occurs when using biddin g game format can result when respondents feel that the starting bid is intended t approximate the correct value related problem yeas aying can occur when respondent s simply accept bid even if it doesnt match their true valuation th paymen t card approach was developed to correct the starting point bias of biddin g games respondents also infer values from other aspects of the survey for example some respondents give high valuations because they feel that study would not be conducted unless the resource or project being valued was imp ortant some methods such as payment cards include range f values and typically benchmarks to suggest how much is spent on other presumably similar comm odities range bias can occur when respondents valuations are high er or lower than the highest or lowest amounts listed when the amounts listed influence the bids or when respondents do not find their valuations listed on the card relational bias can occur when respondent s focus on benchmarks particularly benchmarks related or similar to the good i n question to help determine their va luation finally if several items are being valued respondents may infer an indication of their values from their order in the list typically items listed first are perceived as being more valuable than items liste d later thus position bias could lead to invalid results altering the order in different interviews can overcome this bias but it substantially increases the number of inter views needed scenario misspecification third type of bias scenario misspecification can arise when the scenario is either not specified properly according to theoretical r policy information theoretical bias or it is inter preted incorrectly by the respondents methodolog ical bias theoretical misspecification occurs when part of the survey is incorrectly specified based on theoretical knowledge or polic information this bias can usually be minimized with sufficient research beforehand to check the survey s consistency with theoretical and policy guidelines methodological biases can occur in numerous ways including39 when respondents value the symbolic nature of good rather than the amount resulting in the same willingnesstopay for different levels of the good when respondents include items beyond the level of the good in question such as items outside of the specified location and benefits often associated wit h but not part of the good in question when responden ts use different measurement scale eg general qualitative terms rather than exact numerical changes than the researcher intendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30242crs17 when respondents are skeptical that the good will be provided that adequate funding exists or that the project will achieve the desired goals after com pletion when respondents value the good differen tly based on how it is funded or who provides it if respondents fail to adequately reconcile purchases with their income straints when respondents give n amount that they think the project will cost feeling that if they bid their higher valuation portion will be wasted when respondents use other materials in the survey such as general questions in the opening part of an interview to help come to decision or if respondents dont treat unrel ated valuations as independent similar to posi tion bias discussed above the need to devise realistic scenario leads to three criteria to assess the survey instrument familiarity understandability and plausibility particularly importan t survey elements include the description of the good the quantity produced th market the payment vehicle and the elicitation method the scenario may be familiar to respondents if they have previous information if not i t must be easy to understand and must convey new information effectively the scenario m ust convey the expected change and consequences accurately the studies of grand canyon air quality an d glen canyon dam reoperation were criticized for presenting excessive qualit improvement s the scenario must also seem plausible or responses may not b meaningful the research er faces realismbias tradeoff because more information makes the scenario more realistic but may cause stra tegically biased responses when responde nts feel that the survey is unrealistic they typically give dontknow responses guess randomly or respond to other cues this is particularly problem for assessing damages after disaster such as the exxon valdez oil spill since the scenario for contingent valuation cannot be an event that has already occurred sampling design and inference biases the oth er principal type of bias arises when sampling design or benefit aggregation is not performed properly the sample used for the contingent valuation survey must be designed so that the appropriat population is sampled and the sample fully represents that population determining the appropriate population of individuals or households can be difficult when th people who pay differ from those who benefit from the proposed change this i s further complicated by affected private property owners and individuals with exist ence values for the good who live at substantial distances from the affected site sufficiently large population is needed to capture all of these values furthermore the portion of the p opulation that is sampled must accurately represent the values of the entire population or the results could be biased inadequate or unrepresentativ samples were criticisms of all three of the applications discussed earlier nonresponse to the survey in general or to specific questions can also lead to biased results nonresponse to questions can include dont know refusal to answer protest ze ros obviously erroneous answers usually of zero to register objection to the survey or the issue and responses that are not internally consistent followup questions are usually necessary t distinguish between protest zeros where respond ents do not agree with the survey procedure and actual zeros where respondent s would pay nothing for the good internally inconsistent responses eg responseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30242crs18 mitchell and carson pp 26128740 mitchell and carson pp 26128741 peter diamond jerry hausman gregory k leonard and mike denning42 does contingent valuation measure preferences experimental evidence in contingent valuation critical assessment ed ja hausman amsterdam northholland 1993 pp 4162that are improbable or infeasible given the identified income can also bias results other outliers can be eliminated by statistical techniques or judgment but arbitrar or biased decisions could affect the validity of the survey stratified sampling pro cedures can moderate nonresponse biases among distinguishable groups where the individuals v alue the good differently within the population but cannot account for nonresponse biases among people with similar characteristics who have differen t nonresponse rates and value the good differently inference biases may occur when the results from one particular contingen t valuation study are used to timate the value of different good temporal selec40 tion bias may occur when data from one study are used for different time period because public preferences for the good may change however evidence from two sources public opinion polls and other contingent v aluation studies indicate that valuation results are fairly stable over time valuations are also likely to be more stable for good with which respondents are familiar than for one with which they have little experience41 sequence aggr egation bias may occur when data from independent studies are aggregated over additional locations or goods for example if several areas are to be cleaned up the valuations of each area measured in particular sequence ma differ from the valuations of each area measured independently or in differen t sequence because of income and substitution effects mon ey spent on the first area in the surv ey typically reduces the amount identified as being spent on other areas income effect and the first area may act as substitute to some of the features f additional areas to be valued substitution effect items reached at later point in sequence thus are likely to be valued less than if they were valued independently or earlier in the sequence bias arises when values from these kinds of surveys ar aggregated without considering the sequence of valuations empirical criticisms several studies have attempted to empirically assess the reliability and validity of conting ent valuation surveys one should be aware however that such studie s typically use existing contingent v aluation surveys or conduct new ones and thus are subject to all of the errors and biases of the contingent valuation surveys being eval uated therefore th eir conclusions may be more reliable or valid than the results of the surveys they critique diamond et four researche rs used their own contingent valuation studies42 to determine whether economic preferences are actually being measured the focused on criticism called the embedding effect that willingnesstopay is th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30242crs19 william h desvousges f reed john richard w dunford sara p hudson

1993 pp 91114same whether one item is valued or several items are valued this is similar t symbolic and sequence aggregation biases discussed above under scenario specification and samplin g design and inference biases respectively the example presented by diamond et is that similar valuations res ulted from different numbers of wilderness areas protected pro ponents of contingent valuation argue that income and substitution effects explain the discrepancy in value s diamond et counter that this effect is insufficient to explain the large variation in values observed in contingent valuation studies because the porti on of income lost in valuing sequence of goods is typically small relative to average income they conclude that income effects ar insignificant diamond et conducted several tests to d etermine whether substitution effects could explain differences in valuations other researchers have noted that in quence of valua tions the valuation of goods later in the sequence will be lower than the valuation obtained independently if some items can be substituted for others diamon d et designed survey to test the hypothesis that respondents would b willing to pay higher income taxes to prevent the development of more wildernes s areas they posited that as more areas are developed fewer substitute wildernes s areas exist for recreation so the current ar ea being considered should be valued more highly their re sults led them to reject the hypothesis implying that the substitution effect is not large at least in this case further tests were conducted to examin whether alternative means of measuring the same quantity yielded the same answer for example they compared the value assigned to two areas with seven alread developed to the sum of the value of one of the ar eas with seven already developed plus the value of the other area with eight already developed using parametri c tests which put less weight on outliers they conclude that such different ways f measuring the same quantity fail to give similar results and thus violate one of th validity standards described above diamond et argue that these results arise from warm glow effect where respondents feel sense of improved wellbeing b contributing to good cause and that contingent valuation does not measure tru economic preferences desvousges et study by six researchers was conducted to determine if43 contingent valuation surveys yield valid and reliable results the authors used three hypotheses to test for validity and reliability data on willingnesstopay to protect different numbers of migratory waterfowl by improvin g response services for oil spills were used to test these hypotheses based on statistical analysis of the re spondents th researchers concluded that responses to different levels of protection were taken from the same population the first hypothesis was that higher levels of good would elicit higher values to test this hypothesis the authors used an openended q uestion to measure the value of protecting 2 thousand 20 thousand and 200 thousand migratory waterfowl from small and all oil spills the results showed similar valuations across the changes i

5770quantities leading the authors to reject the hypothesis and conclude that contingent valuation surveys were not valid the second hypothesis wa s that openended and dichotomouschoice questions would yield sim ilar results when used to value the same quantity to test this hypo thesis the two formats were used to measure the difference in the value associated with differing levels of response service for oil spills the authors found that th dichotomouschoice format yielded significantly larger number of high bids an d generally yielded higher results than did the openended questions since the ques tions were measuring the same quantity bu t yielded different results they rejected the hypothesis and again concluded that c ontingent valuation does not yield valid results the third hypothesis was that the results would not be affected by the pro cedures used to handle the data such as functional forms or the bid structure t assess the reliability of contingent valuation results the first test compared tota l values calculated using linear and nonlinear functional forms for responses th second compared to tal values from survey using high bid of 250 versus another survey using high bid of 1000 the authors found that results varied significantly leading them to reject the hypothesis and conclude that estimates from contingen t valuation surveys are not reliable as well as not valid kahneman and knetsch these two researchers concluded that responses44 to contingent valuation questions represent peoples willingnesstopay for mora l satisfaction rather than for the good in question they also concluded that peopl derive more benefits when they contribute more to good cause rather than whe n they consume more the authors found that ranking of projects based on mora l satisfaction predicts the ranking by different willingnesstopay amounts with high degree of correlation willingnesstopay as an index of m oral satisfaction also helps to explain the embedding effect discussed by diamond et because additiona l amounts of the good m ay add little to moral satisfaction the second point made by the authors is that many individuals have portion of their budget already devoted to purchasing moral satisfaction they found that measured willingnesstopay fo r additional moral satisfaction reduced discretionary spending rather than reducin g substituting for current purchases of moral satisfaction conclusion contingent valuation is b ecoming more widely used in natural resource damage appraisal nd in decisionmaking it is and will likely remain controversial however because it is c omplicated and imperfect device its application is an expensive and timeconsuming research project and host of potential problems make the results of contingent valuation surveys suspect ho wever the relevance or magnitude of the many types of errors and biases scribed in this report can only be assessed for eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30242crs21 survey it is impossible to reach an unqualified conclusion as to the reliability an d validity of such surveys generally when attempting to assess public preferences nonuse values are real and t times significant possibly exceeding use values substantially proponents conten d that excluding nonuse values in calculating damages and in decisionmaking woul d understate tota l values affected and that contingent valuation is theoretically valid way to estimate nonuse values opponents argue that the methodology is weak and the measures are not comparable to traditiona l measures of utilitarian values because resource use generates economi c and social benefits beyond those measured by price and volume and thus can lead to arbitrary assessments of damage congress s recognized such values in directing
