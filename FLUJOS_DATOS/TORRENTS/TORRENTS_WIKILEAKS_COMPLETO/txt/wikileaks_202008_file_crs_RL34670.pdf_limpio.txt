government contractors summary many overseas federal contractors are c overed by the defense base act dba which mandates that they provide workers compensation insurance for their employees as the us military has increased operations in iraq the size of the dba program has grown and in 2007 over 170 milli on in cash and medical benefits were paid to nearly 12000 dba claimants who were injured or killed while working under contract to the federal government congress has become increasingly concer ned with the costs involved in the dba program because the federal government usually reimburses its contractors for their dba premiums the department of state dos and the us agency for international development u said have seen some cost savings since adopting singlesource model for their dba insurance in which contractors for each agency are required to purchase insurance from single company selected by the agency the us army corps of engineers usace is currently testing such model for its dba system for the rest of the department of defense dod however including the armys large logistics civil augmentation program logcap contract individual contractors are free to select their own dba insurers and negotiate their own rates the duncan hunter national defens authorization act ndaa for fy2009 s 3001 pl 110417 includes provision th at requires dod to change the way its contractors provide dba coverage for their workers in addition the house committee on oversight and g overnment reform held hearings in 2008 on the dba current dod dba policies have so been criticized by the government accountability office gao and the armys ow n auditors it is expected that cost issues associated with the dba will continue to be the subject of congressional attention for the remainder of the 110th congress and beyond this report provides an ove rview of the dba and the systems used to provide dba insurance at dos usaid dod and usace also included are criticisms of the current dod dba

exceptions to coverage include injuries caused by the willful misconduct of an employee the drug or alcohol use of an em ployee or acts of god traditionally only injuries or deaths that resulted from specific accidents were covered by workers compensation modern workers compensation systems now generally provide coverage for illnesses or other conditions such as hearing ss that are the result of prolonged exposure to dangerous workplace environment 3 in five states firms are required to pur chase workers compensation from state funds federal agencies that provide workers comp ensation for their employees essentially self insure and are responsible for 100 of the cost of all benefits paid 4 the texas workers compensation system is not mandatory for privatesector employers in that state however privatesector em ployers who do not participate in the workers compensation system can be sued for damages by employees injured on the job 5 sengupta et w orkers compensation p 19the workers compensation system is nofault system that pays workers for injuries or illnesses related to employment without c onsidering the culpability of any one party in exchange for this nofault protection and the guarantee of benefits in the event of an employmentrelated injury illness or death workers give up their rights to bring actions against employers in the civil court system and give up their rights to seek damages for injuries and illnesses including pain and suffering outside of those provided by the workers compensation laws with limited exceptions injuries illnesses or deaths that are the result of accidents or incidents that occur in the workplace or that are the result of ac tivities related to empl oyment are covered by workers compensation2 state and federal laws differ on how private employers may meet their responsibilities to insure against the ec onomic losses to employees from workplace injuries and illnesses in nearly every state and federal system firms can selfinsure or purchase workers compensation insura nce from private providers or in some states from state funds3 federal workers compensation workers compensation policy is largely determined by the individual states each state and the district of columbia with the exception of texas has its own basic workers compensation policy that mandates that privatesector employers and state and local government agencies insure against the financial damages caused by employmentrelated injuries and illnesses and provide nofault cash and medical benefits to employees who are injured killed or become sick on the job4 the federal government has only limited role in the workers compensation system and administers workers compensation programs for federal employees and several limited classe s of privatesector workers in 2005 state workers compensation programs paid 521 billion or 942 of the 553 billion in total cash and medical benefits paid by the workers compensati on system federal workers

the states however the federal government has intervened in workers compensation policy in three cases first the federal government administers workers co mpensation program for most federal employees under the federal employees compensation act feca second the federal government administers workers compensation programs for the longshore and harbor and railroad industries because of the intersta nature of those industries third the federal government administers limited workers compensation systems for coal miners with black lung disease and energy workers with cancer and other diseases

major providers of dba insurance coverage are aceusa american international group aig and cna16 selfinsurance insurance prices can be quite variable moving between hard market periods with higher premiums and difficulties for consumers finding insurance and soft market periods with low premiums and relatively easy availability particularly when faced with high premiums some insurance consumers choose not to purchase insurance from an insurance company but instead choose to selfinsure selfinsurance is very br oad term possibly covering any situation in which an entity chooses to retain risk rather than purchasing insurance self insurers can cover spectrum from 1 entities who essentially ignore risk and take few if any steps to financially prepare for loss to 2 entities who consider and evaluate risks while perhaps setting up so sort of savings or reserve accounts to pay for future losses to 3 entities who set up legally licensed insurance company known generally as captive insurer to whom actuarially determin ed premiums are paid but ownership of the insu rer is retained by the insu red so both profits and risks are also retained by the insured because the dba mandates workers compensation insurance for federal contractors overseas the firs t selfinsurance option essen tially ignoring the risk is generally not an option under the dba however employers do have the option to selfinsure if they meet certain financia l criteria and are approved to do so by dol17 under the federal regulations selfinsurers are not required to go so far as to set up captive insurers in order to selfinsure nearly 170 employers are listed by dol as authorized selfinsurers18 firms may also selfins ure under most state workers compensation laws and according to the lfinsurance institute of america more than 6000 corporations and their subs idiaries selfinsure their workershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34670crs8 19 selfinsurance institute of america workers compensation programs available on the website of the selfinsurance institute of america at http wwwsiiaorg i4apages indexcfmpageid3284compensation risks19 many selfinsurers still purchase some form of insurance typically catastrophic policy that would take effect if extraordinarily high losses occurred and federal rules act ually require such policy many selfinsurers also hire thirdparty administrat ors who undertake much of the administrative burden of dealing with claims but without ssuming any of the financial risk choosing to selfinsure is decision taken on wide variety of business grounds in general those selfinsuring are seeking to reduce insurance costs and ensure the availability of insurance selfinsurance can reduce costs through three primary mechanisms first any profits that would have flowed to the insurer could be captured by the selfinsurer second th selfinsurer may be able to save on administrative costs either by undertakin g the administration inhouse or finding more efficient thirdparty administrator and third if the selfinsurer is relatively lowrisk its costs would be lower if it were not pooled with other higher risk parties dba waivers the secretary of labor may at the request of federal agency grant waiver that exempts firm from the dba if the firm can demonstrate that an alternative workers compensation system that provides be nefits in the case of disability or death is in

department of defense dod the department of defense dod permits its overseas contractors to purchase dba insurance from any insurance company approved by dol in 1996 dod studied the dba issue and

required to consider when formulating its overall dba strategy53 in hr 5658 the housepassed version of the bill section 850 contains policy options that fall into three broad categories of dba reform that are similar to those mentioned in reviews of the dba perform ed by the gao the congressional budget office cbo the usaaa and the house oversight and government reform committee the three categories of policy options are using single contracted source or limited set of contracted sources for all dod dba contracts similar to the model used by dos usaid and the usace pilot program using rating system to set premiums based on past claims incurredsimilar to the experience rating systems used in many private insurance lines and having the federal government selfinsure for all dba costs similarto what is currently done with the workers compensation for injuries and death related to war hazards under the whca and workers compensation for federal employees under the feca program singlesource contract for dba insurance currently dos and the usaid use si nglesource contract to provide dba insurance for their contractors under this model all agency contractors purchase dba insurance from single source selected through competitive bidding process usace is currently testing this model for its contracts as part of pilot program this process allows single insurer to pool the risks of multiple contractors and contracting activities with the goal of using this pooled risk to reduce the premiums paid by all contractors as shown in table 3 above usaid dos and us ace have experienced cost savings by singlesourcing dba insuran ce currently premiums under the usaid dba contract are lower than those paid by dos and usace contractors as well as those paid by kbr under the logcap contr act in addition report issued by the majority staff of the house oversigh t and government reform committee found that underwriting gains were significantly higher for major dba contracts

doption by dod of singlesource model for dba insurance could result in cost savings the size and complexity of the dod and its contracts may result in difficulties in that agency adopting the system used by the smaller dos and usaid it is not know n if single insurer would be willing or able to take on all of the dods dba business usaaa reports that only one insurance carrier bid to provide coverage under the logcap contract and an earlier effort by dod to find single carrier for all dba contracts in iraq resulted in carriers placing bids56 additionally it is not known whether contractors would accept not being able to select their own insurance carriers to cover their employees usace reports that even with sing source for all dba insurance under its pilot program the agency is still require d to provide administrative support and bear administrative costs57 the cbo concurs with th is assessment and notes that although it estimates overall cost savings if dod were to adopt singlesource model for dba insurance these cost estima tes do not take into account the costs to dod involved in setting up and administering the system and that these costs could greatly diminish savings58 experience rating for dba insurance in its audit of dba insurance for th logcap contract usaaa concluded that the premiums being paid by kbr did not reflect either the expected claims to be paid or the risks involved in the covered activities especially given kbrs relatively low accident rates usaaa also found th at logcap dba rates were subject to large annual fluctuations nd were major component of the overall cost of the logcap contract the use of experience ratings in which current premiums are based on past claim rates could bring dba premiums more into line with the risks faced by dba contractors experience rating is common in the insura nce industry and is feature of many workers compensation systems governed by state laws under an experience rating system

premiums59 there may be difficulties in using experience ratings to determine dba premiums the fluctuations in the pr ice of premiums charged under the logcap program may indicate difficulties in accura tely estimating insurance risk in war zone one such difficulty involves the termination of whether claim should be paid under the dba or the whca fo r example usaaa reports that kbrs insurance broker was concerned with the probability of increased dba claims due to plane crash and the current dos insurance contract allows for higher premiums for security contracts that involve aviation60 however under some circumstances plane crash would be covered not by th insurer under the dba but rather by the federal government under the whca in addition in response to usaaas audit of the dba insurance under the logcap contract the us army sustainment command stated that it may prove diffi cult to find insurance carriers who use retrospective rating plans in determinin g dba insurance premiums for countries where war risk hazards have been recognized by the dos61 federal selfinsurance the dba is privatized workers compensation system in which individual contractors either purchase insurance from private carriers or selfinsure however because the terms of many fe deral contracts allow the cont ractors to bill the federal government for the cost of dba insurance dba insurance costs are often ultimately paid by the federal government one op tion for dba insurance reform would be to eliminate the private nature of dba insurance and have the federal government act as the sole dba insurer and pay 100 of all dba administrative and claim costs having the federal government selfinsure for dba insurance would be similar to the way workers compensation insurance is ndled for injuries and deaths caused by war hazards under the whca and for fede ral employees under the feca program there are several potential advantages to having the federa l government self insure for dba hazards first rather th an paying insurance premiums the federal government would only be responsible for paying the actual cost of claims and administration given that cl aims make up just over 25 of total costs paid for dba insurance under the logcap c ontract the federal govern ment could potentially see cost savings through selfinsurance in addition issues involving premium loading and the charging of dba insurance pre miums on noncovered co mponents of payroll such as hazard pay would be eliminated if the federal government selfinsured httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34670crs23 second the use of the federal government as selfinsurer would eliminate the need to distinguish between dba and whca claims because every claim would be paid by the federal government there is evidence that the current process in which the federal government identifies whca claims after they have been paid as dba claims and then reimburses insurers for claim and administrative costs results in the federal government paying si gnificant amounts that do not go directly to claimants over the past five years under the whca the federal government has paid more in reimbursements to insurers for administr ative expenses 7610260 than it has paid in compensation to claimants 5207461 having the federal govern ment selfinsure for dba hazards would change the historic private nature of the dba program and place the program at odds with the privatized lhwca program in additi on federal selfinsurance for dba claims would go against current trends in state workers compensation programs exclusive state funds in which the state pays all workers compensation claims are being replaced either by state funds that compete on the open ma rket with private carriers or by systems in which all workers co
