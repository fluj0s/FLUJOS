the kyoto protocol bali action plan and international actions summary concerns over climate change often termed global warming have emerged both in the united states and internationally as major policy issues reports in 2007 by the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc provided scientific underpinnings for these conc erns and the number of proposals and international meetings devoted to these issues has grown as discussed in this report in december 2007 the meeting of partie s to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc convened in bali indonesia and agreed on the bali action plan to guide negotiations over the next two years with the goal of formulating by 2009 decision that w ould identify the next round of commitments by the nations of the world to address climate change veral working group meetings are scheduled to work on these issues during 2008 beginning with meeting in bangkok thailand in april that formulated work pl an for negotiations the first treaty to address climate change the unfccc was completed and opened for signature in 1992 it incl udes voluntary commitments to establish national action plans for measures that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions the united states was one of the first nations to sign and ratify this treaty and it entered into force in 1994 however it was soon concluded by parties to the treaty that mandatory reductions in emissions of the six major greenhouse gases of which carbon dioxide mainly from burning of fossil fuels is the most prevalent would be required the resulting kyoto protocol which was completed in 1997 and entered into force in february 2005 committed indus trialized nations that ratify it to specified legally binding reductions in missions of the six major greenhouse gases the united states has not ratified the protocol and thus is not bound by its provisions in march 2001 the bush adminis tration rejected the kyoto protocol and subsequently announced us policy fo r climate change that relies on voluntary actions to reduce the greenhouse gas in tensity ratio of emissions to economic output of the us economy by 18 over the next 10 years under the kyoto protocol the coll ective commitments of the industrialized nations are to reduce the par ties emissions by at leas t 5 below their 1990 levels averaged over the commitment period 2008 to 2012 over the past year several highlevel meetings have focused on the need to deal with climate change including the g8 meeting in june 2007 and meetings at the united nations president bush announced on may 31 2007 that the united states would convene meeting of major economies to begin series of m eetings in washington dc through 2008 to find voluntary framework for dealing with energy security and climate change as of november 2007 the unfccc secretariat listed 174 nations and the european union as parties to the kyoto pr otocol australia announ ced its ratification at the december

discussion of interna tional negotiations and other actions related to decisions on climate change taken by nations underlying much of the growth in interest and urgency have been the reports of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc that were issued during 2007 these sc ientific reports are not discussed in this report for discussion of the scientific fi ndings and these reports see crs report rl33849 climate change science and policy implications by jane leggettclimate change the kyoto protocol bali action plan and international actions introduction and overview1 responding to concerns that human ac tivities are increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere and causing potentially damaging climate change and global warming nearly all nations of the world joined together in 1992 to sign the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc the united states was one of the first nations to ratify this treaty it include d legally nonbinding voluntary pledge that the major industrializeddeveloped nations would establish national action plans aiming to reduce their greenhouse gas emissi ons to 1990 levels by the year 2000 and that all nations would undertake voluntary actions to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions to the unfccc secretariat the parties to the unfccc hold annual meetings called conferences of the parties cops at which unr esolved issues are negotiate d rules of procedure are established or amended and reviews of progress are c onsidered as scientific consensus grew that human activities are having discernible impact on global climate systems contributing to warming of the earth that could result in major impacts such as sea level rise changes in weather patterns and health effects and as it became apparent that many major nations such as the united states and japan would not be able to reduce their emissi ons to 1990 levels by 2000 parties to the treaty decided in 1995 that it would be n ecessary to move beyond voluntary measures and to enter into legally binding commitments negotiations began on protocol to establish legally binding limitations or reductions in gree nhouse gas emissions it was decided by the parties that this r ound of negotiations would in keeping with principles established in the unfccc establish limitations only for the developed countries the 38 nations listed in annex i to the unfccc including the former communist countries plus the european union and referred to as annex i countries developing countries are referred to as nonannex i countries basic principle established in the unfccc and continuing in negotiations on the kyoto protocol is that parties ve common but differe ntiated responsibilities in dealing with climate change issues nd that first steps in reducing greenhouse gashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33826crs2 2 the six gases covered by the protocol are ca rbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o hydrofluorocarbons hfcs perfluorocarbons pfcs and sulphur hexafluoride sf6 the most prominent of these and the most pervasive in human economic activity is carbon dioxide produced when wood or fossil fuels such as oil coal and gas are burned concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have increased from 280 parts per million ppm in 1850 to some 380 ppm in 2006emissions should be taken by the annex i countries because developed countries have emitted the largest share of the gr eenhouse gases already in the atmosphere carbon dioxide releases remain in the tmosphere for many decades and because they are wealthier and more able to incur costs of any necessary changes in their economies it was agreed by negotiators of the unfccc and subsequently the kyoto protocol that this principle would be basic tenet of climate negotiations the kyoto protocol negotiations were completed in late 1997 the protocol establishes legally binding mandatory emissions reductions for the six major greenhouse gases2 it requires that annex i countri listed again in annex b of the protocol reduce their aggregate greenhous gas emissions by 5 below 1990 levels 1990 is the baseline for carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide 1995 is the baseline year for the other 3 gases av eraged over the commitment period of 2008 to 2012 each country was assigned indi vidually negotiated ta rgets which differed according to their situations the united states signed the protocol in 1998 however country is subject to the provisions of treaty until it has been ratified which in the united states requires the consent of the us senate because the senate was on record in mid 1997 in sres 98 objecting to treaty th at had mandatory obligations for developing countries president clinton did not submit the protocol to the senate for advice and consent therefore the united stat did not ratify the protocol during his administration then in march 2001 soon after president george w bush took office he rejected the ky oto protocol and the united states declined further participation in kyoto prot ocol negotiations after veral years the required number of annex i countries had ratified and the protoc ol entered into force in february 2005 as of december 2007 follo wing the announcement that australia had ratified the protocol 175 nations plus the european union had ratified it representing over 62 of annex i countri 1990 greenhouse gas emissions since the united states has not ratified the pr otocol it is not subject to its terms negotiations continued after the 1997 treat was finalized in order to put in place the detailed rules for how the kyoto protocol would operate and to establish procedures for how its provisions would be carried out these negotiations were continued through two subsidiary bodies that address technical issues and then decisions were made at th annual conferences of the parties cops to the unfccc until february 2005 when the kyoto protocol had achieved the n ecessary ratifications to enter into force the annual meeting is now unfccc cop combined with meeting of the parties mop to the pr otocol thus the annual meetings are now referred to as copmop meetings the united states continues to participate in the discussions and negotiations of the cops but as it is not party to the kyotohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33826crs3 protocol it does not pa rticipate in kyotorelated mop negotiations attending those as an observer in december 2007 cop13mop3 convened in bali indonesia and began the process of formulating an agreement that would succeed the kyoto protocol when its commitment period ends in 2012 as summari zed below in the section on the bali action plan the negotiations at this meeting were closely watched for signs that the process agreed on would produce an outco that would be sufficient to the challenge of mitigating and adapting to climate change final decisions on what the commitments of developing and developed countries would be were not expected at bali but the considerations to be included in negotiations toward these decisions are outlined in the bali action plan key existing kyoto protocol provisions the major commitments in the treaty on the key issues are as follows obligations of all parties the kyoto protocol calls on all parties veloped and devel oping to take number of steps outlined in article 10 to contribute to scientific research and monitoring of the climate system and gree nhouse gases in their countries they are also committed to formulate national and regional programs to improve local emission factors carry out steps to pr omote and transfer environmentally sound technologies strengthen national capacity building ac tivities and c onduct national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks that remove these gases from the atmosphere in keeping with the principle of comm on but differentiated responsibilities the unfccc and the kyoto protocol recognize the relatively low per capita greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries and the need to take into account the development activities of these countries that will require increased energy use the protocol does not impose any binding re quirements on developing countries the commitments in article 10 are regarded as essentially voluntary obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emi ssions by annex i countries are the focus of most of the kyoto protocol which outlines the legally binding emissions reductions that the parties to the tr eaty are to undertake and provides for development of procedures and rules that apply to parties as they move toward meeting these binding obligations these are briefly summarized below emissions reductions the kyoto protocol states that annex i parties are committed individually or jointly to ensuring that their aggr egate anthropogenic carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of greenhouse gases do not exceed amounts assigned to each country in annex b with view to reducing their ove rall emissions of such gases by at least 5 below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012 negotiations on thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33826crs4 3 when the united states signed the protocol and based on projections of the growth of emissions using current technologies and processes the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions required of the united states w ould likely have been between 20 and 30 below where it would be otherwise by the 20082012 commitment period however inclusion of greenhouse gas sinks greenhouse gases especially co2 are absorbed by number of processes in forests soils and other ecosystems these are called sinks which the protocol adopted as urged by the united states and emissions trading means that the domestic us emission reductions fro m fossil fuels needed to meet 7 target would have been substantially less 4 the other mechanisms are joint implementa tion article 6 and the clean development mechanism article 12 5 credit would generally represent the re duction of one metric ton of carbon dioxide continuedkyoto protocol included nationbynation allocation of the percentage each annex i country would be obligated to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in order to collectively reach the overall 5 reduction agreed to in the protocol annex b to the kyoto protocol lists 39 nations including the united states the european union plus the individual eu nations japan and many of the former communist nations the same countries as annex i to the unfccc the amounts for each country are listed in this annex as percentages of the base year 1990 except for some former communist countries wh ich use more recent year and range from 92 reduction of 8 for most eu ropean countries to 110 an increase of 10 for iceland in negotiations on the protocol the united states agreed to commitment on this list to 93 or reduc tion of 7 below 1990 levels these commitments refer to averages that would be below each partys 1990 levels for three major greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and below 1995 levels for the three other manmade gases av eraged over the commitment period 2008 to 2012 as noted above only nations that ratif the protocol are subject to its terms the united states later rejected par ticipation and thus is not bound by it3 however two of the most difficult issu unresolved in 1997 at kyoto and still under discu ssion are related to counting emissions of nation specifically how to take into account 1 emissions trading specifically how much of countrys obligation to reduce emissions can be t through purchasing credits from outside vs taking domestic action and 2 th extent to which carbon sequestration by forests soils and agricultural practices can be counted toward countrys emission reductions these are discussed below implementation flexibility mechanisms emissions trading emissions trading is one of three flexibility mechanisms contained in the kyoto protocol article 174 under the kyoto protocol developed countries are given greenhouse gas emissions budgets or emissions caps for the compliance period 20082012 ba sed on percentage of their 1990 or 1995 emissions levels depending on the pa rticular greenhouse gas if country determined that it would exceed its missions limit during the compliance period emissions trading would permit it to purchase emissions reductions credits5 fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33826crs5 5 continued equivalent emissions 6 for detailed discussion see crs report rl33799 climate change design approaches for greenhouse gas reduction program by larry parker 7 although called annex 1 countries in reference to annex 1 of the framework convention on climate change fccc the correct reference is to annex b of the kyoto protocol the lists of countries in annex 1 nd annex b are very similar but not identical crs uses the common usage term annex 1 in this report 8 article 17 kyoto protocol 9 for more information see crs report rl33581 climate change the european unions emission trading sy stem euets by larry parker and crs report rl34150 climate change the eu emissions trading sche ets gets ready for kyoto by larry parkeranother country that deter mined it would achieve more emissions reductions than necessary to comply with emissions trad ing countries that can make relatively inexpensive emissions reductions have an incentive to reduce emissions below the level required by the kyoto protocol and sell the extra credits to other countries whose emissions control costs are more ex pensive thus both the seller and the buyer would have lower costs by virtue of the sellers profit nd the buyers savings this type of implementation scheme is commonly called capandtrade program6 this mechanism however comes with si gnificant restrictions under the kyoto protocol first emissions trading is restri cted to countries that have legally binding greenhouse gas emission limitations the nnex 1 parties which as noted above includes only developed industr ialized countries that ve ratified the protocol7 another requirement is that emissions credits must be supplemental to domestic actions for the purpose of meeting quantified emission limitations and reduction commitments8 however the protocol is vagu as to what supplemental means and the term is subject to continuing interpretation currently the largest emissions trading scheme in use under the kyoto protocol is the european unions emissions trad ing system ets the euets is cornerstone of the eus efforts to meet its obligation under the kyoto protocol and it currently covers more than 11500 energy intensive facilities across the now 27 eu member countries including oil refine ries powerplants over 20 megawatts in capacity coke ovens and iron and steel plants along with cement glass lime brick ceramics and pulp and paper installations covered tities emit about 45 of the eus carbon dioxide emissions the trad ing program does not cover emissions of nonco2 greenhouse gases which account for about 20 of the eus total greenhouse gas emissions the first trad ing period began january 1 2005 second trading period is scheduled to begin in 2008 covering the period of the kyoto protocol with thir d period planned for 20139 clean development mechanism cdm the kyoto protocol supplements the capandtrade implementa tion scheme discu ssed above with two projectbased schemes that permit nnex 1 countries to obtain additi onal credits that they can use to meet their emission caps the first is cdm the only mechanism under the kyoto protocol that involves nonanne x 1 countries under its provisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33826crs6 10 point carbon carbon 2006

have occurred in the absence of the project cers can be issued from appropriate projects initiated after 2000 in 2005 china india and brazil were estimated by point carbon to be responsible for about

jointly between two annex 1 countries like cers erus can be used by the participating countries for compliance purposes there are two tracks under ji called track 1 and track 2 track 2 mirrors the process used by the cdm but involves different institutions track 1 is simplified process that puts more of the responsibility on the host country like the cdm erus issued under ji must represen t reductions achieved in addition to those that would have occurred in the absence of the project unlike cdm projects erus can only be transferred beginning in 2008 romania has been the most active host ji country however it should be noted that in 2005 the volumes involved in the project markets were overwhelmingly the result of cdm projects which accounted for 93 of tonnage transacted 397 million metric tons mmt compared with 28 mmt for ji11 carbon sinks one of the most contentious issues in the negotiations over kyoto protocol rules has been how to give nations credit for carbon sinks forests and land uses that absorb sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have the effect of reducing the net additions country makes to atmospheric co2 levels this has been negotiated under the term land use landuse chan ge and forestry lulucf issues include how to allocate credit for existing forest cover of which some nations like the united states have great deal and others have very little and what actions in relation to lulucf would constitute legitimate carbon re ductions only increased sequestration above 1990 levels achieved by specific sequestration ac tivities would be counted the final decisions were that only certain activities would be eligible for use as offsets against protocol obligations affore station planting forest cover where therehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33826crs7 had been none reforestation replantin g tree cover where it had been removed deforestation prevention forest management cropland management grazing land management and reve getation the rules of the pr otocol do not put an overall cap on sinks for countries but instead incorpor ated countryspecific limits on each of the categories of sinks activities listed in an appendix z exactly how carbon absorbed in sinks will count toward nations obligations is s till the subject of ongoing discussion and refinement compliance mechanism achieving agreement among kyoto prot ocol negotiators on compliance in particular penalties for noncompliance by annex b protocol parties was difficult and took several years after the protocol was finalized in 1997 this was one of several controversial issues that wa s resolved as part of the marrakech accords at the cop7 meeting in 2001 in the final rules on compliance parties agreed that if party falls short of its emissions target during the first commitment period 2008 to 2012 it must make up the difference in the second commitment period plus penalty of 30 such party will lose its eligibility for emissions trading and must develop compliance action plan this decision included establishment of compliance committee composed of plenary an operational bureau and two branches the facilitative branch and the enforcement branch the facilitative branch is intended to provide advice and assistance to parties and to provide an early warning to parties that may be in danger of not complying the enforcemen t branch would have the responsibility of applying consequences for parties that do not meet their commitments protocol rulebook provides procedures for consider ing cases of noncompliance or possible noncompliance and procedure for revi ewing the cases regarding eligibility to participate in the protocols financial and other mechanisms compliance involves not only meeting emissions reductions commitments but also preparation of adequate ghg inve ntories and severa l other procedural requirements there are penalties for failures of compliance in these areas however the mechanisms penalties for failure to meet emissions reductions targets would come into play only when the commitment period is well underway there remain number of uncertain ties as to how it will f unction it does appear as discussed below that many parties to th protocol may find that achieving their emissions reductions obligations will prove to be difficult or impossible within the commitment period leading up to cop13mop3 in bali indonesia at the first meeting of the par ties of the kyoto protocol in novemberdecember 2005 the 11th cop of the unfccc cop11mop1 in montreal canada both the united states and developing countri were resistant to the idea of negotiating new legally binding commitments for the postkyoto afterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33826crs8 12 for more detailed summaries of the cop nd copmop meetings see the reports of the earth negotiations bulletin enb at httpwwwiisdcaprocessclimate_atmhtm and the pew center on climate change at httpwwwpewclimateorgwhat_s_being_donein_the_ world2012 period12 the kyoto protocol parties were also reluctant to discuss new commitments in the postkyoto period if they did not include all the major emitters including the united states china and india by the end of that meeting compromise was reached in which two proce sses were set in motion to consider next steps an ad hoc working group awg was tablished under the protocol to begin cons ideration of next step s for developed country parties in the postkyoto period since the united states is not party to the protocol it does not play role in this process except of course as an observer from which vantage point its position has generally been made known nd generally taken into account by the parties nonbinding twoyear dialogu on longterm cooperation was launched under the auspices of the unf ccc that includes the united states and all parties to the unfccc virtually all of the worlds countries the decisi on on establishing the dialogue specifically ruled out including any negotiations leading to new commitments its goals are to support implementation of existing commitments under the convention support voluntary actions by developing countries and to s upport development of national and international res ponses to clima change the areas of focus for these discussions are sustai nable development adaptation technology development and transfer and marketbased opportunities both of these processes involve worksh ops and meetings with reports to the copmop meetings in 2006 and 2007 ne ither involves an deadlines for completion of the discu ssions or negotiations at cop12mop2 held in nairobi ke nya in november 2006 both the awg and the dialogue were involved in wo rkshops and discussions and the awg formulated work program fo r future meetings that invol ve analytical subjects that would underlie any considera tion of post2012 targets for developed countries the nairobi meeting also included the begi nning of review of the protocols effectiveness somewhat controversial issue because of the implications the review process is thought to have for future commitments l ittle progress was made at this copmop however and decisions on the scope and content of the review were put off until the cop14mop4 to be he ld in 2008 issues related to adaptation to climate change focused primarily on administration of an adaptation fund established to assist adaptation efforts in developing countries httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33826crs9 outcome of the bali negotiations framework for negotiating postkyoto commitments during 2007 climate change gained wide spread attention as critical issue facing the nations of the world and the negotiations held in bali indonesia december 314 2007 were widely regarded as key next step in continuing to chart an international course to mitigate global warming and deal with its impacts the kyoto protocol was always intended to be first step in moving toward reducing global accumulations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere negotiators recognized that the goals of the protocol even if met by all the parties would not produce the stabilization of atmospheric gr eenhouse gases posited as the goal of the unfccc the protocol set forth timetable for reviewing progress of actions undertaken to meet the protocols goals nd to consider next steps it has been generally anticipated that next steps afte r 2012 would include measures to be taken by both developed and devel oping countries throughout the process preceding the bali meeting developing countries had been unwilling to make binding commitments on greenhouse gas limita tions or management the kyoto protocol commitment period begins in 2008 and runs through 2012 it was widely expected when the protocol was negotiated that by 2008 next steps for the post2012 period would be either deci ded or under active ne gotiation however the challenge at the copmop meeting in bali and the negotiations to follow remains how to find agreement on the nature of commitments if any that would be acceptable to all the major players including kyoto protocol parties with existing obligations developing countries that ar major ghg emitters and the united states whose role is regarded as critical by ll potential participants in the post2012 period outcome in bali the bali action plan the outcome of negotiations at the bali copmop was expected to be at best what was termed road map for future ne gotiations it was ag reed by all parties that negotiations need to be completed by the end of 2009 some observers have noted that this is very tight time frame in that many parties are aware that the current us administration continues to reject mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reductions and they expect that fu rther progress on mandatory ghg limitations cannot be made unless new administration in 2009 is willin g to participate further it appears unlikely that major developi ng and developed countries will be willing to make legally binding commitments in the absence of such commitment by the united states at preliminary meeting leading up to the december copmop four key elements were outlined as the focus for bali road map 1 mitigation of climate change 2 adaptation to impacts of climate change 3 financial assistance issues and 4 technology development and transfer wh ile future negotiations will likely grapple with the effort to obtain some form of legally binding mandatory commitments from all parties the recognition of differing national circumstances and differing abilities of nations to take on various types of commitments will continue to be major elements in the discussionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33826crs10 13 see httpunfcccintmeetingscop_13items4049php for the full text of the bali action planwith this context it was surprise that negotiations in bali indonesia in december 2007 were highly contentious and extended day beyond the original ending date of december 14 in order to reach consensus on what is termed the bali action plan however despite some compromises participants generally lauded the final agreement as one that sets negotiating framework in place and includes developed and developing countries in the negotiations on considerations for final agreement that would include mitiga tion measures to address greenhouse gas emissions adaptation measures financia l support fo r developing countries and technology transfer issues key elements and issues of the bali action plan13 concerning mitigation include need for deep cuts in global emissions the decision at bali recognized that deep cuts in global emissions will be required to achieve the ultimate objective of the convention avoiding dangerous climate change and emphasized the urgency to address climate change as indi cated in the fourth assessment report of the ipcc some developed countries notably eu members had argued that specific goals should be articulated in terms of atmospheric concen trations of ghg that should not be exceeded but this was opposed by others including the united states and as compromise the limits discussed by the ipcc were referenced in general with footnote citation to the specific numbers negotiations process twotrack negotiating pr ocess was launched 1 an ad hoc working group on longterm c ooperative action was established as subsidiary body under the unfccc to conduct the process of negotiating agreement by 2009 on measures to be undertaken by ll parties to the c onvention developing and developed this was regarded as breakthrough because it established negotiations not just as previously dialo gue that would include developing countries and would address mitigation measures as well as the other items listed for consideration and 2 the ad hoc work ing group under the protocol will continue to consider action by deve loped countries to succeed the 2012 conclusion of the kyoto protocol explicit reference to this awg was made in the bali decision document thus it simply continues longterm cooperative action and differentiated responsibilities shared vision for cooperative action was ag reed on including longterm global goal for emission reductions to achieve the ultimate objective of the convention in accordance with the provisions and principles of the convention in particular the principle of common but differentiate d responsibilities and respective capabilities and taking into account social and economic conditions and other relevant factors mitigation action the actions to be consider ed forby developing country parties in the negotiations under the bali action plan prove d to be one of the most controversial points and lmost led to breakdown of ne gotiations on the final day inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33826crs11 14 agreements at cop meetings like most international negotiations are reached on the basis of consensus not through voting ther efore objections by any party can serve as veto and prevent consensus 15 the original version found in the document fccccp2007l7 distributed early on december 15 2007 stated ii measurable reportable and verifiable nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing c ountry parties in the context of sustainable development supported by technology and enabled by financing and capacitybuildingbali the document outlining the plan contains two separate paragraphs for mitigation considerations i for developed country cons iderations and ii for developing countries initially both paragraphs stated that enhanced nationalinternational action on mitigation of climate change would include consideration of measurab reportable and verifiab nationally appropriate mitigation actions by both developed and developing parties some developing countries objected that this language was not what had been agreed to and reversal of clauses in the language of paragraph ii regarding ac tions by developing countries was proposed by india this was opposed by the united states nearly causing the breakdown in negotiations14 the phrase as adopted af ter other countries loudly booed the united states over its objection and after several veloping countries stated that the change in language did not change their agreement to consider mitigation actions is as follows consideration of mitigation actions that would include ii nationally appropriate mitigation actions by devel oping country parties in the context of sustainable development supported and enabled by technology financing and capacity building in measurable reportable and verifiable manner15 those supporting this language argued th at the financing technology transfer and capacity building actions by develope d countries should also be measurable reportable and verifiable as the language was debated in the final plenary session some of the developing c ountries reassured participan ts that they had made commitment to consider mitigation actions in the negotiations that would follow however the united states was concerned that measurable reportable and verifiable in the adopted language appears to apply mainly or only to the financing technology and related ac tions and its applicability to mitigation actions by developing countries is unclear the lang uage as adopted does appear ambiguous on this point however this language lik the entire decision document applies only to the framework for future negotiations and those negotiations can themselves deal with any ambiguities and with concerns that arise as the negotiations proceed emissions from deforestation and forest degradation the decision to include reducing emissions from deforesta tion and forest degradation among the considerations in the negotiations to follow bali is widely regarded as major positive step by many

these countries constitute the vast majority of annex 1 signator ies to the kyoto protocol the most comprehensive effort at comp liance has been in europe for the eu the situation puts considerable pressure on the european commissions ec current review of member countries national allocation plans for the kyoto commitment period in october 2007 the ec complete d its review of the 27 members proposed plans and at least conditiona lly approved all of them16 as noted earlier the focus of the eus compliance effort is the emissions trading scheme ets that is completing threeyear trial

however several issues that arose during the trial phase remain contentious as the ets moves into its kyoto phase including allocation schemes shutdown credits and new entrant reserves and others in ddition the expansion of the eu and the implementation of the directives linking th ets to the kyoto pr otocol projectbased mechanisms created new issues to which the ec has had to respond the eu has consistently stated that it will meet its commitments under the kyoto protocol and is curre ntly developing targets for the post2012 period in 2006 the european environmental agency eeaprojected the 15 eu members that had jointly agreed to redu ce ghgs by 8 be low 1990 levels during the kyoto compliance period would meet their obligati on as whole although seven of those countries would not meet

to assist new zealand in complying with its kyoto obligations19 however the governments most recent analysis estimates the country will not comply with its kyoto obligations although that projection only reflect s policies adopted as of april 200720 in contrast canada has simply stated that it cannot meet its kyoto obligations and the government has adopted alternative goals21 finally japan is anticipated to have difficulties meeting its kyoto obligations and has been developing strategies to acquire substantial credits from the kyoto flexibility mechanisms ji and cdm in an attempt to bridge the expected gap be tween japanese emissi ons and japans kyoto target because of the flexibility mechanisms discussed above potential compliance with kyoto is not necessarily threatened by emissions growth in some countries since such nations can purchase emissions credits to offset some of their emissions increases indeed current analyses of credits available from economies in transition mostly eastern european count ries indicate that sufficient surplus credits will exist in such countries to cover the deficit creat ed by emissions growth in other countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33826crs15 22 preparations for the first session of the conf erence of the parties serving as the meeting continuedspecifically as indicated by figure 1 surplus credits are anticipated in russia ukraine and other eastern european countri sufficient surplus credits for other countries anticipated to have deficits such as parts of the eu japan and new zealand to purchase them in order to cover their compliance requirements source point carbon carbon 2006 towards truly global market february 2006 p 8 this long position with respect to credits does not include anticipated cers and erus from cdm and ji projects as indicated by figure 2 the potential for additional credits from these sources is substantial particularly from china of course there is range of risk with respect to these sources including the possibility that any given project may not be built or may not be certified as valid for issuing cers or erus but indications are that additional credits will be available from these sources there are some potential potholes on the road to compliance perhaps the most important is the requirement that credits gained through emissions trading and joint implementation be supplemental to domes tic actions this requirement under article 17 has been subject to extensive discussion and interp retation resisting efforts by the eu to place quantitative limit on the procurement of credit via these mechanisms the conference of parties decided to put quantitative limit on such mechanisms but that the use of the m echanism shall be supplemental to domestic action and domestic action shall thus constitute significant element of the effort made by each party22 means of determining the significance of domestic actions figure 1 2005

reduction programs difficult us positions the united states took an active role in the negotiations that shaped the 1997 kyoto protocol it signed the protocol in 1998 but president clinton did not submit it to the senate for approval citing the byrdhagel resolution sres 98 that passed unanimously just prior to the completion of the protocol in kyoto this nonbinding resolution expressed the

february 2002 president bush announced us policy of reducing the net greenhouse gas intensity of the us economy by 18 over the next 10 years23 greenhouse gas intensity measures the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to economic output ghg intensity has been d eclining in the united states and the 18 reduction goal compares to projected business as usual decline in intensity of 1424 for the 10year period according to some the 18 goal would not achieve reductions of greenhouse gases signifi cantly more than the existing trend the administration stated that the goal to be met through voluntary action is to achieve efficiency improvements th at would reduce the 183 metric tons of emissions per million dollars of gross domestic product gdp expected under business as usual to 151 tric tons in 2012 the plan noted that if in 2012 we find that we are not on track toward mee ting our goal and sound science justifies further policy action the united states w ill respond with additional measures that may include broad marketbased prog ram and other incentives and voluntary measures to accelerate technology development on april 16 2008 president bush deliver ed statement in advance of the major economies meeting in paris see below in which he announced new national goal to stop the growth in us greenhouse gas emissions by 202525 us actions related to climate change include extensive scientific and research programs26 and continuing interna tional activities to coopera on bilateral basis or through other international forums to support voluntary action among the most prominent international us activities have been the initiative taken in the asiapacific partnership on clean development and climate and the initiative by president bush to convene series of major economies m

work on cooperatively reducing greenhouse gas intensity of their economies this part nership agreement included three of the worlds largest emitters of greenhouse gase s the united states china and india plus japan australia and south korea of the three developed country nations in the partnership the united states aust ralia and japan onl japan has ratified the kyoto protocol the participants described the focu s of the partnership as technology development and reduction of greenhouse ga s intensity on voluntary basis specific targets were announced the members of the partnership i ndicated that their goal was to complement but not replace the kyoto protocol however concerns have been raised by some observers as to whether this partnership and its approach would in fact reinforce th resistance of the two largest developing country greenhouse gas emitters china and india to taking on mandatory emissions commitments in the next phase of the kyoto protocol the purposes identified by partnership members include to create voluntary nonlegally binding framework for intern ational cooperation to facilitate the development diffusion deployment and tran sfer of existing emerging and longer term costeffective cleaner more efficient technologie s and practices among the partners through concrete and substantial c ooperation so as to achieve practical results27 task forces focused on eight industrial or business sectors were established to review the status of their sectors with regard to clean development and climate to identify cost and performance objectives and realistic goals and report on recommended actions within their sectors the eight task forces are 1 cleaner fossil energy 2 renewable energy and distributed generation 3 power generation and transmission 4 steel 5 aluminum 6 cement 7 coal mining and 8 buildings and construction the task force reports termed action plans are now complete and can be accessed on the partnership website the

funding and investment will be forthcoming for the work plan goals also unclear is the degree to which the developing country partners will undertake activities in addition to those receiving outside funding another question critical to the future of the kyoto protocol and raised initially when the partnership wa s first announced is whether the two largest developing country emitters of greenhouse gases china and india will see this parallel effort as indeed complement ary to the kyoto protocol or whether they will continue to resist binding emissions reductions in the next commitment period of the kyoto prtocol in favor of the non binding voluntary approach espoused by the asiapacific partners hip with greenhouse gas intensity reduction as their focus major economies initiative by president bush on climate change just prior to the g8 meeting president bush announced may 31 2007 that the united states would convene meetin g in washington in late september of major economies those that are major emitters of ghg on energy security and climate change he indicated this would begin series of meetings starting in september to support an ffort to develop new post2012 framework on climate change by the end of 2008 so observers argued that this initiative could undercut the kyoto prot ocol negotiations but others seemed more positive in hoping that all efforts toward dealing with climate change especially when they include major emitters like india and china can prove useful white house fact sheet indicated th at this proposal breaks new ground in advancing areas of common interest between develope d countries and the major emerging economies and indicated that this effort will build on and advance us relations with the asiapacific partnership on clean

on climate and the upcoming negotiations at the cop13mop3 meeting in bali indonesia however both the outcome of the g8 meeting in june discussed below and the final statements inviting participants to the september meeting emphasized the integration of these highlevel dialogues into constructive contribution to the unfccc negotiations although some attendees d expressed their concerns that this initiative could undercut the kyoto protocol negotia tions all attendees welcomed the acknowledgment by the united states that climate change is major global problem and the endorsement by the united states of the process as the major forum for negotiating international action on climate change the us summary of the september 2728 2007 major economies mee ting on energy security and climate change stated discussion reflected common understanding that any long term goal is aspirational and that it should not be used as basis for burden sharing this continuing rejection of mandatory limits in favor of aspirational goals was disappointment to those in particular the european pa rticipants who hoped for breakthrough in the us approach followon meetings were held in late january in honolulu
