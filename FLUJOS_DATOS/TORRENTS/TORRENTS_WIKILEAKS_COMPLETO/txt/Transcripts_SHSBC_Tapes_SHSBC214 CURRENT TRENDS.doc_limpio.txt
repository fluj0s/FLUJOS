current trends lecture given on 25 september 1962 thank you well this is the what audience 25th of september this is the 25th of september oh youre day behind all right you can listen across that time gap ad 12 saint hill special briefing course lecture number one all right we havent got very much to tell you you know it all now you know everything there is to know but your basic dynamic assessment or looking for goal has many things on which it depends and first and foremost amongst these is the auditor knowing how to audit somebody can look over the directions for dynamic assessment and think he can do it because its very easy and all you do is fall on your head andand its very simple you just ask for list and thats all there is to that remember that lying underneath all this is the ability to audit i hope it doesnt happen to you but all youve got to have is one wrong goal listed on youone wrong wrong goal listed on yousee somebody stumbling around thats had wrong goal listed on him or her and youll never do it again let tell you youll never do it again man and you let bunch of hpas start finding goals youll get wrong goals found right now the main difficulty is not clearing people we can do that thats fait accompli welltrained auditor doing his stuff well and so forth and you can get somebody clear we have the technology with which to do this fact twentyfive hundred years after the facts of somebody dreaming it could happen on this planet ten thousand years after somebody hinted it might occur why we can do it not because they regard their navel meditatively or think right thoughts or realize that its all thought after all and not think bad thoughts about things and think right thoughts about things and read the book held in proper position on the knee and tie the eat properly to the bedpost without all that line ofwhy we can clear people and that is triumph of great magnitude because it takes it out of the sphere out of the sphere of gift because you are so holy something you deserve because you have believed right and of course that is the most fantastic trap of all your freedom depends upon your absolute slavery big brother is watching you 1984 here we come see inquisitionsall these various mechanisms and the only inclination we have in the direction of discipline in this particular lineup is getting it done thats the interest just lets get it done and thats all lets just get it done now the odd part of it is is there are certain things which occur which prevent it from getting done and amongst those things is not doing it saying you are but not doing it now we can see medicohes hard up cobwebs growing across his door poor fellow bill collectors coming around internal ravening screaming over the telephone for his income for the year 1915 and he finally has an enormous cognitionalmost blows his head apart its those cottonpickin scientologists that have done this to i am longer permitted by the publicbecause they dont want anymoreto rip open peoples bellies and take out odd organs on the belief that theres possibility that if i take out enough odd organs something odd will occur and well iiii can clear people too hohohohoho i can clear people haha what you do you get an emeter whats an emeter well we had one its umhmhm its galvanometer it developed the skin pore count i think well put him on that yeah thats good now well say their basic purposeall men are evilso the basic purpose of any of these people itd be to kill everybody or something like that and ill tell them thats the goal and of course do like the scientologists do haha and there it be you know all of sudden everybody around the place says well hes doing scientology and hes killing people you see the danger so actually certain amount of safeguard must exist in the vicinity of any such technology now thenot the most optimum way to do it or the most practical way to do it but sometimes the most desirable way to do it is just shoot people dead who dont do it right see not optimum or practical but its so satisfactory now all of sudden the other day inoh where else could it belos angeles all of sudden why all hpa students and all hcas in class and everybody else all of sudden started finding goals on everybody and ran out all the dynamic rock slams and now the saint hill auditors around there cant find any rock slams or find any items nobody bothered to mention it or anything now i think itll take them while to pull that one apart an air letter is just now aflight i think it has just now passed des moines iowa it is route and it is saying it takes two saint hill graduates to check out any goal found in the state of california and cable to before it can be listed now you say thats ridiculous i mean my god two saint hill graduates and so forth well i dont know why not see as far as cables theyre expensive human beings come cheap but cables they cost money now youll see somebody skirting around the edges of that one and they all of sudden will be stacking it up we have responsibility one is to make it very very clear to people that clearing is subject of very expert auditing and is not casual piece of nonsense that simply can occur anyplace on any crossroads and go to some lengths to make sure that people who have the penchant for trying to get trained before they do now thats our biggest danger right now thats our biggest danger now one of the ways you can always tell when were successful is the number of protests that come and the amount of attacks that develop you can always tell when were very successful i have various uses for hostile thought and activity i use this i use it very very good if i engage on certain plan and announce it in advance and there are great many protests against the plan i look up the people who are protesting against this plan and if they belong to the rock slammers club you know theyre old wellknown squirrels we havent heard from them for years but all of sudden this plan is announced and theyve written in to condemn it utterly i know man were on the right road and put it into effect at once its sure test its sure test now the other use the other use you put this to is i know were successful if were being counterfeited and these sad efforts to duplicate and that sort of thingvery pale they arestart springing up around and about certain something why i know were being very successful did you know that thone of these copycat outfits by the way is still in existence down in taxas taxasthats part of the united states its concept therapy its run by bunch of chiropractors down aroundi dont know oh some bayou andthats mud flats its run by them and theyre still concepting theyre still going on they picked up old concept therapy from 19i think it was 1953 or 52 or 54 i dont know way back anyhow whenever it was52 if i remember rightly summer isnt it52 concept therapy theyre still doing it well thats fine thats fine please let them keep on doing concept therapy dont let them get suddenly ambitious but unfortunately theyre liable to get ambitious because who appeared at the last washington congress but the chief movers in that movement they were all there and they heard all about clearing and are going to go home and theyre going to spin some people in we ought to make it law that they test it out on each other before they do this now the ethics of the situation then simply involve the effectiveness the ethics of clearing are the effectiveness of clearing in other words he who can clear can clear and he who hath not been trained into clearing had better keep his paws off and thats ethics now in any whenany time you get ethics matched up totally with effectiveness and so forth well youve got win on your hands because its not superstition because itll actually defend itself if we let it be known very broadly that this is what we stand for is effective clearing we dont care if somebody had fluke you know one fluke can kill somebody you know its horrible for instance even you even you can make fluke itll ruin you for while do you realize that you know you have lucky break im talking about bad one im talking about good one see and youre sitting there minding your own business and you accidentally ask the pc if he has any string in his pocket this is just sort of out of the clear you see and the pc says to you my god i know what my goal ismy goal is to string people along and so forth and there you are youve had it youve had it you havent got technology which expands beyond one pc now the fight has been to get technology which covered everybody and the assessments which youre doing now the dynamic assessments are very embracive you dont have exceptions to these things you see but you can derail yourselves on them by having lucky break i dont know there are couple of auditors around that have had lucky breaks and have been regretting them ever since becausewhy because they keep waiting for it to happen again and of course it doesnt happen again the pc does not have any string in his pocket you know pc after pc is stringless well now broad general technology then is desirable thing but it can get hacked up to where it particularly fits just few or fits very few cases or something of that sort therefore broken down then in its broad general application it ceases to be effective so you might say it becomes unethical to clear somebody unstandardly you gyou get the idea see this now can get up toward an idiocy simple simonness about the whole thing you see you have to clear somebody according to the rules you cant clear them any other way well of course that too outlaws the occasional lucky break so thatd be bad too wouldnt it heres the way you do it you clear somebody according to the rules and take advantage of every lucky break you get and then realize that the break will probably never again occur of that particular type you understand if you can realize that youre protected then very largely from stumbling around and making bunch of fruitless this and that about it so broad clearing technology of necessity must be preserved as it is and released and to marked degree safeguarded there is some responsibility for the knowhow see well because theres responsibility for the knowhow you do get some responsibility then for the communication lines of the knowhow and the communication lines of scientology are simply just that theyre the communication lines of the knowhow in that wise you keep broad breakdown you keep broad technology going and breakdown of broad technology from taking place now how are we able to suddenly interrupt all this in angeles at such asuch rate of speed well its just excellent communication lines good positioning communication centers operating people alert and so forth and it can all be put back together again zing zing zing you see in absence of these communication lines well you just either have to let it go just let it happen and go to pieces or wait until some far distant date when you can finally put it back together again you hope see well actually the way were operating right now is something goes wrongits pretty muchits pretty much this way something goes wrong anyplace in the world on the subject of clearing technology something like that and so forth why its just matter of zing zing zing we hear about it we do something about it bang bang you see and its within fortyeighthour sixtyhour proposition quite normally well thats how we can operate right now and we can put things back to rights before they can fall apart now its very important now its very important these data to you for this reason is youre going out and youre going to get stuck in some corner of central organization or into clearing coaudit or something of the sort and youre going to have everything up against your chest and your world is going to be the immediate zone of influence and youre going to have some tendency to say that is happening in the next block and is none of my business and that i dont approve of nobody on this planet could hold my post at this present time that i know would be completely impossible because i cant hold it its backing up man ive held on to it for years and kept it wheeling for years and so forth against all manner of this and that and its just getting too rough right now toto cope with frankly it is somehow or another itll get coped with but let point out something to you those things which i am handling at the present moment which are giving trouble are out of routine theyre offline you understand theyre difficulties which have not been predicted and eared for long since theyre offbeat things that are occurring here and thats whats giving trouble i can keep up with routine actions with the administration lines with all of these things i can keep up with these things but you start giving fistful of odditiesone corner and the other way and its this and its that and its the other thingand my god i feel like boxer backed up in the corner of the ring you know being hit by about four fighters i start getting punchdrunk now if im going to handle everything that goes wrong in port darwin everything that goes wrong in mexico city everything that goes wrong in tierra fuego and paris and rome and few other points all on nonroutine basis let tell you i cant do it its just not possible and whos going to do these and what goes wrong anyhow well ill give you little rundown on what goes wrong and maybe you can understand why im talking to you about this somebody doesnt act is the inscription on the tombstone of more graves than you can count somebody didnt act thats all something didnt happen you understand and it drops ball big one or little one ball gets dropped and an area of confusion occurs now prediction of what is going to happen is normally the common method of taking care of these emergencies and communication system or an administrative system is simply something which is already planned to handle traffic so that nothing becomes an emergency you see but if somebody doesnt act along those lines or if somebody doesnt use his noggin along these lines somewhere then the next thing you know why zipzapboom and youve got confusion going at mad rate all over the place confusion is occurring madly now who is this somebody who should have acted in the first place well today i got the most confoundedly confusing despatch you ever heard of an hcoi hate to use the name in this derogatory regard but its only temporary secretary on post thereactually wrote and said because the hco was not collecting any of the monies which were due and owing to it that it was out of funds and therefore couldnt continue very long that way what an incredible statement but the person actually wrote this statement and sent it through the lines and is feeling quite upset at this very minute and is quite resigned and feeling apathetic about it you know all this person has to do you see is just collect the monies owing to it they are not unreasonable pieces of money from unreasonable quarters dont you see this perfectly ordinary action has to be taken but is asking for an extraordinary solution because the ordinary solution has never been taken see all the sources of income are right there theyre perfectly able and competent to pay this hco its money but the hco cant ask for that money and somehow or another now an extraordinary solution has got to be dreamed up for this particular area and so on do you see the setup so actually what the despatch was doing was demanding that i take some extraordinary step with regard to this area it already isnt doing its job it already has dropped the ball now of course an unusual solution must be entered into the situation now lets see how fundamental this combination of events can become whenever you have an extraordinary solution demanded of youin supervising auditing or pcs or somethingwhenever you have an extraordinary solution demanded of you it will only be because the ordinary solution was never in action in the first place you have the unusual demanded of you because the usual has not been followed youve got pc suddenly appearing on your doorstep 300 am theyre shaking theyre sweating oh theyre just about ready to blow out their brains where did this pc come from how come whats the enturbulation in this immediate persons area wellnow look at this youre there theres the pc well its up to you to do something about it thats for sure youve got to do something about it you cant just recriminate and make everybody guilty for not having taken the usual steps but let call to your attention that you actually have two actions you are being asked for let please teach you this one thing theres the pc on your doorstep at 300 am shaking you know loaded revolver in hand ive just come by to say goodbye you know now you naturally would take hold of the pc or put him on the meter talk to him or give him some phenobarbital or anything you could think i dont care what solution you use see you get this pc calmed down and youll get the pc picked up in auditing or straightened out one way or the other i know youll handle that much of it you always have so youll handle that much of it well please can i point out to you theres another step you must always take find out who dropped the ball that brought that pc into that condition and straighten that area out got it always take that second action please id be less than doing my job if iif i didnt tell you about this you see always take the second action i know it takes few minutes longer i know you feel harddriven i know that theres two pcs upstairs and one in the basement that are waiting for your time i know theres three telephone calls in thecoming through the switchboard for you personally and nobody else can handle it you see i know all this just as i say that i remember telephone message i didnt deliver this evening see but the point is simply this youve got to find time between those two pcs you see youve already found out that this person who appeared on your doorstep was audited and goal was found last month by george snikwick and between the phone calls and so forth ask telephone do something who is george snikwick why thats easy hes the person who took the pe course and i think he went halfway through hca course but dropped outdropped out in the middle of the second week because he knew more than the instructors well your indicated action see is to do this second thing lets straighten out that zone otherwise that zone is going to multiply more pcs on the doorstep and youre not going to be able to breathe ever this way im giving it to you someday you can look forward to being able to breathe see now theres two or three things which are indicated there what instructor let him out of what class what d of t didnt take this person in and put him on the meter and pull his missed withholds and send him back to class who didnt do this who doesnt know the may 3rd 1962 bulletin you understand what hco area sec has not bent his ears over the top of his skull and tied knot in them you understand and just take enough time to call up and say at least what the hell are you going to do about george snikwick right now not next week but right now see thats actually about all you have to do because it belongs to somebody else you see and then that second step is not complete unless youve done the following what have you done about george snikwick understand and that way perhaps we can keep calm reigning someplace or another now of course theres things going to occur that the devil himself couldnt do anything about but then the devil isnt ot he got withholds so he couldnt be you got problem here of keeping the plate level on the table and keeping the soup in the plate not all over the room and if you always take this second step we can manage it and if you dont always take the second step why zzz youll have areas sometimesyou say oh my god nothing can be done about it true the united states air force signal corps or something has just decided to clear all of its pilots with auditors certified by the american medical association hahahahaha what can you do about something like that well i dont know it must have gotten pretty bad there must have been lot of balls dropped up to time when something like this could occur you know you say what can i do about something like that well you can scream you can always scream and because you can always scream scream you understand and remember that theres this interesting mechanism which exists in this particular universe you can always make force turn around and serve you ive taught few people this it can come absolutely deadly afterwards matter what force comes their way they use it its trick that is taught championship tennis players the force of the ball hitting the racket is employed to drive the ball back now theres little trick of rolling racket you know the ball hits the racket just little bit off slant and the racket is rolled and actually will go straight back to where it came from or it can be positioned almost anyplace did you ever hear of this tennis trick its terrific trick try it sometime try it with tennis racket youll find out that it isnt enough just to stand there and resist the impact of the ball you can actually by hitting the ball just right roll your racket just right and itll turn and lot of the force of incoming rolls outgoing do you get this trick its something tike dropping something into cup instead of hitting the bottom of the cup it comes up the other side this is merely illustrative not lesson in tennis all right use the force to serve you and you often can and its trick thats peculiarly adapted to this universe now you know that if auditors certified by the american medical association are going to clean up and clear the us army signal force air corps man thats going to be disaster thats going to be terrible thats going to be pretty grim so unable to prevent the emergency take advantage of it you know very well whats going to occur so you just publicize the fact and get everything all ready to take care of the catastrophe set yourself up as small civil defense unit all right were talking to somebody who went halfway through an hca class and hes read all the bulletins and he knows how to clear somebody and hes going to clear them thats fine hes got an emeter that was manufactured for the american medical association something like that and hes going to clear this person and hes going to work on his wife and youre talking to this fellow oh hes going to do it and you say but look you havent any right to do this see in the first place you havent been properly trained its very touchy operation and so forth and you havent any right to do it and youre actually putting your pc in considerable danger why dont you run nice problems intensive you can undoubtedly get away with that you can make your pc feel better why try to kill your pc off you know youall these arguments now theyre good arguments and most of the time theyd serve you but this time they fail well dont go off and hide your head do the secondary operation to that which is he finally says well im going to do it i dont care what you say this is the time to say well now heres my telephone number have you got it there you got pencil there heres your telephone now im going to put it right here under emergency and ambulance now heres my telephone number and heres the time i can usually be reached and so forth andnow ill tell you something that sometimes if the person gets shaky or something like that if you cover them up and keep them warm and you got any b1 got any b1 anything like that give them some b1 and cover them up and keep them warm and call this number in other words set it up to take care of the emergency cut the other trick the fact that you have set it up to take care of the emergency may very well give somebody enough pause that you get your own way in the first place guy says uh well i dont know you c rolling up his sleeves hes going to go on into session with his scalpel you know and do goal ectomy and he passes by the telephone and sneers at it you know collects an overt on the way by it and goes in and starts what is the detested person hes read that in bulletin someplace that you ask this and you dont much bother to put the data down but you must have the pc answering this question is what is the detested person wrong question but he knows youre supposed to do something like that and of course his wife says well lets see you and then theres you and uhyou you you yes thatsthats you and he says well it couldnt be because i have always been nice to you and youll have to give somebody else well you can imagine where with that small takeoff this activity is going to go and so forth and theres somebody pale and shuddering and he has finally found her goal which is to love my husband he lists her on this and theyits all gone very ruggedly in passing by the phone one day shes upstairs sickand he says well iii wont say anything i maybe just better call up and tell him how things are going and so he does and youve taken care of the emergency and you check out the goal and you find out that wasnt the goal and he by this time is thuuu and so forth and he finds somebody to find the right goal or hell go get trained to find goals or hell do something effective do you understand after of course the us army air force signal corps has plowed in 50 percent of its aircraft why they would begin to become aware that there was something more to this but they would think there was nothing to it at all if somebody had not set up the emergency ward for it you see so you do them up paper something like that you say well i can get in contact with about twentyfive auditors on emergency and we can set up an emergency unit you know and we can take care of the various suicidal and depressive effects which youre going to bring about and so forth and we want the name of every person you employ on this auditing project because we will hold them as untrainable thereafter and as not suitable for training in scientology and well do this and we will do that and you do it all up you know make sure the commanding general hears all about it and so forth just like this other guy hes going to laugh hollowly at first you see but finally why hes going to get those first bad reports and hes going to say uhuh uhuh uh hes going to get some more bad reports and very few good reports doesnt look good to him he probably wont go that far hell probably be on to you and hell say wait youreyoure member of the original group on this sort of thing and youre supposed to know your business on this sort of thing how about straightening this up and of course at that time you straighten it all up for him under the same conditions they imposed during world war ii unconditional surrender you just impose all of your conditions with monkey business about it now you see how to take care of this situation were walking into an emergency situation our secondgoal clear got out of hereyou probably dont know this story yet and you probably havent had it on the grapevine my lines are faster than grapevine my communication lines are the only lines in the world that are faster than grapevine she got down there and she announced clearing coaudit and to quote her she practically got her clothes torn off of her she just got ripped to pieces in the rush clearing coaudit announced in bulawayo the place where they all got killed caused stampede of magnitude and she was absolutely knocked appetite over tin cup in the rush and the reason why she signaled for john to come down there is she was actually going down for the third time and she had to have somebody on deck now she was trying to audit ten hours day and run coaudit and straighten everything out and handle everything and she couldnt make any part of it see well can happen you know it can also happen like this you go back into an area and everything is nice and sleepy and theres nothing wrong and everything is going along quietly and you clear somebody up and youre going to do all of your own listing and all of your own goals listing and youre going to do all of your items listing and youre not going to have to groove it in anyway because there isnt anything much to do about it and youyouso you clear up this person and then you do something with that person and then the next thing you know ityoure opening the door in mornings it just seems little more crowded out there and one morning you open the door and the whole house gets swept away it doesnt matter how quietly it starts or how long it takes to happen its going to turn into an enormously confused area in your immediate vicinity matter what you do about it give you some kind of an idea i was living sleepy life quiet everything was going along rather interestingly peter had very little to do sorted papers and he took most of the important despatches off the line and handled them and i didnt have anything to do id just sit at my desk and breeze along and practically emergencies anyplace this was 1960 well in the last month the last thirty days lets not look at seven thousand some odd miles of boat travel and seven hundred miles of car travel or congress or any one of these things just omit those because frankly i had time for them so they just have to be deleted off the time track you add the amount of auditing i have done in the last thirty days the number of cases that i have directly consulted about the number of cases ive straightened out the number of plans and solutions which ive had to put forward because the area was screaming for it the number of new transcription and communication activities which ive had to try to set up to cope with this sort of thing and you would realize what i was talking about on top of all this of course there are several emergencies around that have nothing to do with any of these lines dont you see but i actually could not at this present moment and have not been able to handle in the last thirty days just my auditing supervision see i havent been able to handle that much of my job thoroughly now when you add to my job all the things that are added to my job you get sort of feeling like things are going rather rapidly you also get the feeling like things are kind of out of control you get to wondering where its going to land i know this i know this before ive had it in 1950 and youre facing another 1950 but this one will come out straight and right providing we all keep our heads screwed on and keep the show on the road and dont monkey around with bunch of squirrel nonsense and dont tolerate bunch of bad clearing and if we can do these things why itll all come out all right in the end well get through this all right and if we dont take care of these things however if we just say well my job is an auditor and there isnt anything else to do on this particular line let tell you we wont get through it i mean its that rough well practically be wiped out in the rush because the number of times i have raised my voice in the last few days in exasperation and in total dismay well it must be six or eight times and its enough so the kids are now getting used to it and smile and pat on the back at the same time ive been able to kind of get things grooved in little bit so that just before the lecture tonight i was able to show them movie on tarzan of the apes and that sort of thing i hadnt put my tie on yet but i showed them movie you can also do living at the same time youre doing this you know if you kind of fit it in edgewise but i see all the symptoms here now whats even more interesting to you perhaps is whole new country just blossomed open suddenly crash japan and the biggest evening paper in japan has just run column stories on scientology and has tied up their switchboards totally john ockard from university department of mathematics was over in japan and he gave public lecturetalked about clearing and that sort of thing now little bit of pioneer work had been done there few contacts had been made he evidently went along these lines and i dont think the gentleman who is sitting right there realized that this wire was that live he thought maybe it had hundred and ten volts in it but its got couple of hundred million volts in it the japanese public four hundredfour and half million readers of that one single paper almost knocked the building down now this leaves meof course i know we dont have time to do this but i have to do thisleaves with the job of writing special articles for japanese papers of tailoring up and editing scientology textbooks to be translated into japan without time to train an auditor as translator grim i cant read japanese characters i can read little bit of roman which is their romanized letters my japanese is far too rusty i spoke it bit once but not anything in gear see theres just nothing in gear here at all now theres country large population vital very vital very forceful people george jellinek going over some surveying with this evening you say where did that hat come from well it just happens to be another hat we were standing out here talking about surveying and surveying things up and we were talking about various types and classes of architecture so as to plan up whats to be done with that courtyard over there and he was talking about how vital japanese architecture was and how powerful how forceful and how brutal their architecture was he didnt think he could cope up to it well i doubted the last fact of course but heres very vital people poised on the threshold of asiathe newest awakened nation in the worldthese people with handful of battleships and so forth almost made it just few years ago man i know i was on the receiving end of some of that they darn near made it now nation which is whipped in war inevitably goes into thought theyll move up from force to thought but remember thetan never gives up they had conquest in mind and conquest they will attain only itll be conquest of thought there is an arrow poised at the heart of communism poised at the heart of all these enslaved states there is very interesting situation now sooner or later the japanese are going to break out theyve already broken most of their treaties with the us the us cant keep them in line now student riots and that sort of thing prevented eisenhower from going in there theres an interesting people there is philosophy tailormade of political nature which would handle that situation and all of sudden this wide people already they aretheir communistic aspects is they believe that the individual should have greater chance and the state should have this and that but the individualism of the individual should be terribly maintained in other words this is very confusing karl marx is dead right except where he was confused with nietzsche see and this is prettyits prettypretty confused that nation isnt half whipped all right if one can guide itsit by the way owes its primary upsurge of civilization to an incursion of buddhism many centuries ago buddhism was the first civilizing agent in there and they taught writing and they taught the various arts japanese had writing up to the time the first buddhist monks arrived from tibet its very interesting that into japan swept buddhism centuries ago and brought about literate civilization which eventually was opened up and suddenly with enormous enthusiasm we get the wide arm embrace for scientology coming in from the west which of course is whole wisdom all in itselfat moment when it is delivering the goods in other words you can take off all the slack of the years of hoping and waiting on ron and hoping it worked and the forward surge and so forth itll just come as the total impact from first book to last book all in one package bang pretty startling well whats this going to do i dont know i havent any particular plans of conquest in asia but it looks like i dont have to have any its there goes china man there goes china well which of you which of you right this minute could go to japan and train some auditors and do some clear up of the situation get sort of an organization together which can serve as library and can control the activity in the vicinity so it doesnt go all to pieces and so forth well which of you are going you know its that sort of question because of course you cant go because the place where youre already going to probably already expects you and so forth but there are many places in the world that need you equally as much you understand any saint hill graduate that doesnt know where to go for christs sakes get in touch with man despatches in my mail just this evening were demanding two saint hill graduates before yesterday morning the situation is totally out of control see now its also interesting that the fcdc income has doubled since the congress and is remaining at doubled state this has never happened before usually itll last for week or so as an upsurge income and then drops off quite markedly well it is doubled and is slightly increasing their units are kicking now around seventy cents with every sign of rising income theyve just moved into another building and so forth and an additional building just for the hgc alone and all kinds of things like this and theyre on my back on the subject of more saint hill graduates theres new plan of clearing and all clearing plans are the same plan now only we call them staff clearing project we call it the public clearing project we call it staff coaudit clearing project i dont care what you call it its all the same plan is you get an untrained or welltrained untrained is pe levelor welltrained hpa level auditor who does the prepchecking the first pe level of course does it under heavy supervision and the hca would do it under less heavy supervision he does all the basic auditing in other words he gives whoever comes in problems intensive and he lists all the goals and he gets them all padded into shape and their needles fine and he gets their withholds off he gets them straightened up in other words so that they can fly then he turns them over to saint hill graduate who audits them just long enough to find their goal and as soon as that persons goal is found and proven out that person is put back into the pack again to get the goal tiger drilled at the beginning of every session and listed so your auditor whos doing this has to know how to tiger drill at one goal alive and list out goal all right now that is the clearing plan that is the way it is working out you dont let saint hill graduate do prepchecking you dont let him list the original goals and you dont let him list the items youre doing it here so youll know how but heres ordinarily how it goes this is youryour hcalevel activity or very heavily hcasupervised public activity and it runs along on this track and then it doesjustthis person is ready to have his goal found or there is auditing time to have this persons goal found and it suddenly goes tick tick boom bang and hes back on the track you understand he comes right along this line here and so forth and then hes totally derailed off it into the hands of saint hill graduate persons goal is found and instantly he is put back immediately on this other line anybody who isnt doing that any saint hill graduate who isnt operating that way these days is operating at hell of waste not just for himself but waste of treasure and waste of human time see because thats the way it ought to run now what do you have you have staff staff auditor number one is saint hill graduate goals finder you call him the staff goals finder and staff coaudits on their own time see they coaudit each other and then soon as one is ready to have his goal found why hes passed over to this staff staff auditor number one and for that period of time he is in that auditors auditing room getting his goal found and as soon as the goal is found and checked out why he is put right back into his coaudit thing but you have two things running on staff one is coaudit that is the untrained staff people are done in coaudit that meets monday wednesday friday sort of thing and then you have the trained staff member who is permitted to coaudit on his own time and doesnt attend this co auditing these coauditing sessions which are supervised you see how thats done and the staff staff auditor number one has an hca assigned to him who operatescould be as parttime or even two parttime hcas or hpas and these people review the folders and make sure that the staff members that are doing the coaudit hand in their auditors reports and keep the thing scheduled and that sort of thing and handle the administration for them or you can have fulltime administration person who also does the supervision so on doesnt much matter exactly how this is worked out the basic plan is that theres saint hill graduate there finding goals and people are being all handled and squared uphes not having to do any of this handling squared up and then they hand him person and he finds the goal and feeds the person back into the other lineup you see that all right you do that with the public for instance we have new release form the darnedest release form that anybody ever heard of you know our old release form it says nobody were not responsible for anything that happens in the hgc you ever read one of those release forms if you fall down or break your neck or anybody audits you badly why you darent sue l ron hubbard or the organization or the assoc sec or anybody and its nobodys fault but yours and thats what the old one reads the new one reads just this and more it says the organization takes full responsibility for clearing you and you on your part pledge to make yourself available for processing and pay for the auditing until this is done signed by the person signed by an officer of the organization you look it over from legal standpoint its very amusing that its more legal contract than the other i can just see some old judge trying to settle this thing as release form see well they took full responsibility for you what did you do youre suing them what did you do what did you do i mean did you make yourself available as it says here for what well you didnt i thought not thirty days or oh its civil suit you see different spirit pervades the land so what happens what happens this guy receives this contract someplace out in the field and he signs the contract and sends it back in what does he get for signing the contract promise that we will not raise our rates to him for year thats the only reward he gets for it because believe cost of processing is going up everyplace we promise not to raise our rates to him if he signs contract and this is the person we promise to clear central organizations some time ago sent out letters to everybody saying we werehad them on our clearing list well this is their first issue on that subject afterwards is this release form and it says sign it and tremendous numbers of them will be signed and sent back in but thatsame thingall of sudden youve got two three four saint hill graduates on the staff and you got lot of staff auditors and all these saint hill graduates are doing theirbut not being permitted to be ds of t or anything else they can only be technical directors by my special permission and assoc secs yes they can be an assoc sec providing theyre not needed someplace else you get the idea i mean this is different look so you got two three four of these people and theyre on staff and just as fastyoubring these people in from the field fix them up get them all ready and so forth and when youve got saint hill graduate call him in again and find their goal and feed them back to listing and zip them out of there in other words this is assemblyline clearing and this is world clearing program of course your coaudit is you get sixty people together and theres lot of tricks that you can use on that ill talk to you lot about that later on and i figured out new angle on how you charge for this if youre going to do one of those so that it makes the people who join the coaudit very anxious to bring in new people because it costs them less see the basic cost of the coaudit is five hundred dollars or thousand dollars week and of course if they only had one person itd cost him thousand dollars week hes very anxious itll have hundred people and in any event you getyou get twentyfive dollars more per week or something like that for every person there i can just see some guy trying to leave that coaudit you know but anyway these are the problems this is the atmosphere of thethe world is living in right now central orgwise and central organizations are short of saint hill graduates theyre trying to start this and trying to do that and not enough time and not enough people and not enough technology and already using the bulletin thats going to be received tomorrow you know and this is the operating climate that were moving up into and that operating climate of course will smooth out some years from now perhaps if you live long enough maybe even in your lifetime but this is what youre walking forward toward and this is what it looks like and i just wanted to talk to you about these various things and talk to you about the ethics of the situation to talk to you aboutyou got to keep clearing good and you got to keep it getting done thats the only thing thats really effective and take the steps necessary to make clearing effective and keep it from being messed up and weve got our job done we got the technology were on the way and so forth and even you will be clear very shortly thank you very much
