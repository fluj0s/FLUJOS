procedure act pa was enacted in 1946 to ensure fairness and due process in executive ag ency actions or proceedings involving rulemaking and adjudications1 in pursuit of this goal the apa created the position of the administrative law judge alj within the federal government aljs were originally called hearing examiners and the apa established certain protections to preserve the independence of these hearing officers2 because aljs are employees of federal agencies one of the primary goals behind the creation of the position of aljs was to ensure that such hearing fficers are able to c onduct triallike hearings free from agency coercion or influence to the extent that the apa or other relevant laws are applicable parties in agency proceedings are afforded protections that include among other things hearing on the record with an impartial presiding officer3 the apa provides that when statute requires an agency adjudication to be determined on the record an alj or the agency head must preside4 the subject matter of the hearing or proceeding varies among the agencies and includes disab ility determinations as well as licensing sanctions and ci vil penalty determinations in general aljs have two primary duties in the administrative adjudication process the first duty is to preside over the taking of evidence at agency hearings and act as the finder of facts in the proceed ings in support of this duty aljs are authorized to regulate the c ourse of the hearing issue subpoenas rule on offers of proof and receive relevant evidence take depositions or have depositions taken hold

opm approved pursuant to its authority to issue variances from the regulations resulted in scoring system that assigned proportionally greater weight to the veterans preference than the previous

of the 1996 scoring formula in 2003 but the agency did not accept new pplications at that time because it planned to hire new aljs from the pool of available applicants who qualified prior to the

eliminated the detailed regulations describing the alj examina tion process 2 required an active bar membership or current state license to practice law 3 disallowed an agencys grant of monetary or honorary award to an alj for any superior accomplishment so as to maintain alj independence and 4 revised alj pay to allow an agency to reduce an aljs pay for good cause after disciplinary proceeding or based on an aljs voluntary request for personal reasons22 opm created the pay reduction procedure because it periodically receives such requests from agencies due to the aljs desire for position of

any person on the qualif ied list effectively ensured that agencies wishing to appoint persons with specialized knowledge would be free to do so38 in 1962 civil service commission advisory committee on aljs recommended allowing individual agencies to require speci qualifications for appointment39 the same year however the staff director of the administrative conference wrote report opposing selective certifica tion on the ground that general capabilities and intelligence were more important than skill in the law and politics of particular agency40 this report noted that selective

requested that opm allow them to choose an alj candidate from the entire list of elig ible hires based on the candidates agency experience and technical qualifications rather than the candidates placement as one of the top three candidates47 the social security administration and others have argued in favor of granting bonus points to candidates who have subject matter experience to provide

the administrative law judge53 however the apa does not specifically prevent agencies from undertaking performance evaluations of aljs54 rather civil service performance appraisal statutes prohibit an

individuals and companies in order to enforce federal law entitlement cases usually involve adjudication of an individuals claim that he or she is eligible to receive certain federal benef its regulatory cases gene rally involve decisions about rates licenses or other re quirements that govern certain industries contract cases typically involve claims against the government for contractual breaches not all executive branch agencies use js to adjudicate di sputes before the agency for example immigration judges in the executive office of immigration review are not required to be aljs nor are hearing officers at the veterans administration who review certain benefits cases74 there are numerous nonalj hearing officers who review similar adminis trative appeals throughout the federal government in fact when the apa was enacted the statute did not require agencies to use aljs because congress intended to leave the decision to employ aljs to agencyspecific legislation by stating that aljs would only be required where statutes called for on the record hearings75 thus upon enactment of the apa the alj provisions became applicable only to those agencies that were required to conduct on the record hearings or that subsequently were subject to such requirement agencies that are not required to conduct hearings on the record may also use hearing examiners to preside over various agency proceedings but the decisionmaking independence of these nonaljs is generally less protected than that of their alj counterparts76 although there is ample precedent for us ing nonaljs to conduct administrative adjudication in the federal agencies there are significant differences between aljs and nonaljs in terms of i ndependence training experi ence and compensation that may affect how these two types of hearing officers review administrative appeals indeed despite the fact that aljs are agency employees and are located within and paid by the agency they are not subject to agency management certain requirements operate to preserve the aljs integrity independence and insulation from agencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34607crs12 77 the federal courts have generally upheld these requirements relating to alj independence see eg ramspeck v federal trial examiners conference 345 us 128 142 1953 finding that hearing officers late r aljs were not to be paid promoted or discharged at the whim or caprice of the agency or for political reasons 78 5 usc 7521 5 cfr 930214 79 acus 1992 supra note 8 at 78788 80 id at 78990 81 charles h koch jr administrative law and practice 524 82 id 83 acus 1992 supra note 8 at 866influence77 for example the competitive sel ection process scribed above is conducted by opm not the agency appointme nt is restricted to those determined eligible by opm and an agency may re move suspend reduce in grade reduce in pay or furlough for 30 days or less an j only for good cause which is established and determined by the mspb on the reco rd and after opportunity for hearing78 thus aljs are largely independent of thei r employing agencies in matters of their salaried compensation and tenure since nonaljs are appointed by the agenci that employ them rather than neutral party the terms and conditions of their employment are controlled by their respective agencies therefore nonaljs are potentially subject to greater degree of agency influence than aljs in ddition the alj merit selection procedure ensures that aljs are highly qualified and trained79 in contrast nonaljs come from variety of backgrounds and range wi dely in terms of experience and legal training for example h earing officers may be nonalj judges or even nonlawyers or nongovernmental examiners80 nevertheless many of these presiding officers preside over relatively formal proceedings and perform functions virtually indistinguishable from those performed by aljs according to one law professor81 such hearing officers are prevalent thr oughout the federal government 1991 study identified over 2700 federal agency employ ees who preside at hearings but are not aljs82 as result of these perceived di fferences between aljs and nonaljs proponents of using aljs argue that th eir independence and generally superior training and experience make aljs better qualified to review administrative appeals on the other hand proponents of using nonal js point to the successful use of non aljs in variety of administrative settings as evidence of the merits of nonaljs in addition some observers argue that j independence has disadvantages as well as advantages when many similar cases have to be decided in circumstances where consistent outcomes are desirable maximum inde pendence of deciders may not be an institutional asset it is at least arguab in other words that the great value of the alj that of decisional independenc is diminished in system where caseload management must be the critical variable83httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34607crs13 ultimately it appears that both types of hearing officers aljs and nonaljs have strengths and weaknesse s if however congress is concerned about approving the use of nonaljs it could consider lternatives such as imposing time limits on any use of nonaljs or by specifying precise ly what types of review mechanisms the agency should use
