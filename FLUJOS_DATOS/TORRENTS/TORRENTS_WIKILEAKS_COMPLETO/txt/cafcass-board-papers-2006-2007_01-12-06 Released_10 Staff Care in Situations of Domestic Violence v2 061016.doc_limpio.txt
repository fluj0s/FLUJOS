policy in situations of domestic violence policy statement 11 the purpose of this policy is to make clear how cafcass will respond to staff who are experiencing domestic violence 2 cafcass routinely deals with situations of domestic violence as feature of our core work we also recognise that domestic violence affects all sections of the community irrespective of professional status and that there will be staff members within the organisation who either have experienced or are currently experiencing domestic violence 3 because of the nature of the work we do some staff may feel less able to seek appropriate help from us than in some other sectors those who routinely work in the arena of domestic violence may be concerned about their credibility in the workplace if they acknowledge they are experiencing violence themselves cafcass takes its duty of care to its employees very seriously and wishes to develop climate of trust in which staff are encouraged and feel able to seek help and support definition context 1 cafcass defines domestic violence as any behaviour which is characterised by the misuse of power and control by one person over another within family context andor with whom she has been in an intimate relationship this behaviour can be overt as in threatened attempted assault or actual assault or harassment it can also be subtle such as the imposition of social isolation on partner and or herhis children it can thus take the form of emotional financial physical psychological or sexual abuse or any combination of these 2 domestic violence is usually committed against women by their male partner or expartner although other relationships may be violent or abusive it includes violence to men by their female partners or ex partners domestic violence also happens in same sex relationships and within extended families 3 domestic violence occurs across all races classes nationalities religions cultures ages and abilities cafcass recognises that employees from ethnic minority groups who have experienced domestic violence can also face institutional racism and cultural misunderstandings by range of services in their attempts to access support and advice other employees including disabled gay and lesbian and male employees may also face barriers when seeking help cafcass is committed to providing help and support that recognises the difference and uniqueness of all individuals and their particular circumstances 4 research1 has shown that domestic violence is very common within british society and that there is strong link between domestic violence and child abuse s120 of the adoption children act widened the definition of harm for children to include the harm caused by witnessing harm to others for example in domestic abuse situations cafcass domestic violence policy and toolkit provides detailed information about the extent nature and impact of domestic violence 5 domestic violence can have devastating impact on children as safeguarding agency cafcass will always prioritise the need to protect and promote the welfare of children 6 many staff will at some time experience crisis in their personal relationships the high emotional impact of our work for practitioners but also for other staff working in the organisation can compound the problems caused by such crises cafcass wants to provide an environment where these difficulties can be shared and staff receive support support for staff experiencing difficulties from domestic violence fits within this context 3 aims of the policy 31 the aims of this policy are as
