in increasingly negative light ottawa 00000136 0012 of 003 1 sbu summary the canadian broadcasting corporation cbc has long gone to great pains to highlight the distinction between americans and canadians in its programming generally at our expense however the level of antiamerican melodrama has been given huge boost in the current television season as number of programs offer canadian viewers their fill of nefarious american officials carrying out equally nefarious deeds in canada while canadian officials either oppose them or fall trying cia rendition flights schemes to steal canadas water the guantanamosyria express f16s flying in for bombing runs in quebec to eliminate escaped terrorists in response to the onslaught one media commentator concluded somewhat tongueincheek that apparently our immigration departments real enemies arent terrorists or smugglers theyre americans while this situation hardly constitutes public diplomacy crisis per the degree of comfort with which canadian broadcast entities including those financed by canadian tax dollars twist current events to feed longstanding negative images of the us and the extent to which the canadian public seems willing to indulge in the feast is noteworthy as an indication of the kind of insidious negative popular stereotyping we are increasingly up against in canada end summary the border canadas answer to 24 wo that sutherland guy 2 sbu when american tv and movie producers want action the formula involves middle eastern terrorists ticking nuclear device and somewhat ironically canadian guy named sutherland canadian producers dont need to look so far they can find all the action they need right on the uscanadian border this piece of real estate which most americans associate with snow blowing back and forth across an imaginary line has for the past three weeks been for canadian viewers the site of downed rendition flights f16 bombing runs and terrorist suspects being whisked away to middle eastern torture facilities the border which stateowned cbc premiered on january 7 attracted an impressive 710000 viewers on its first showing not exactly hockey night in canada but equivalent to an american program drawing about eight million us viewers the show depicts canadian immigration and customs officers efforts to secure the uscanadian border and the litany of moral dilemmas they face in doing so the cbc bills the highbudget program as depicting the new war on the border and the few who fight it while the war is supposed to be against criminals and terrorists trying to cross the border many of the immigration teams battles end up being with us government officials often in tandem with the ciacolluding canadian security and intelligence service csis 3 sbu the clash between the americans and canadians got started early in the season and has continued unabated in episode one syrian terrorist with belt full of gelbased explosives is removed from plane in canada while the canadiansyrian man sitting next to him is rendered by the ciacsis team to syria fairly transparent reference to qciacsis team to syria fairly transparent reference to the maher arar case fortunately for the incarcerated individual the sympathetic canadian immigration and customs security official recognizes the mistake and shrewdly causes the government to rescue him from syrian jail through organized media pressure the episode ends with preview of things to come when one of the canadian immigration officers notes with disgust homeland security is sending in some hot shot agent 4 sbu episode two expands on this theme featuring the arrival of an arrogant albeit stunningly attractive female dhs officer sort of cross between salma hayek and cruella vil the show portrays the dhs official bossing around her stereotypically more compassionate canadian colleagues while uttering such classic lines as who do you think provides the muscle to protect your fine ideals and you would have killed him let the american justice system do it for you her fallback line in most situations is its matter of national security 5 sbu but the oneliners and crossborder stereotypes really take off in episode three in which an american ottawa 00000136 0022 of 003 rendition aircraft with three terrorist suspects on the guantanamo to syria express crashes in quebec and the terrorists escape however not before killing quebec police officer whose sympathetic widow appears throughout the show the dhs officers answer to everything is american firepower but in this episode even csis gets chance at redemption as the csis officer in charge challenges her ms dhs barks back you really want to talk territorial sovereignty or should we talk about getting the terrorists back after being chased through the woods of quebec by crossculturally balanced csisjtf2 team which kills 15yearold terrorist in shootout the bad guys are finally cornered on the side of pristine canadian lake then after conversation with washington in which she asks can you bypass nsa and state our dhs official calls in an airstrike on the terrorists without canadian concurrence canadian planes another official has explained are already deployed to afghanistan helping our neighbors fight their war on terror with only seconds to spare before the bombs are dropped on the quebec site the planes are called off when the csisjtf team affirms positive control over the terrorists finally in lastminute allowance for redemption the csis officer informs his dhs colleague that the captured terrorists will not be turned over to the us but will stand trial for the death of the quebec police officer she does get the final word though hissing the classic phrase you people are so nave before the screen goes blank dea also takes some hits 6 sbu if that isnt enough the border is only one of the cbc programs featuring crossborder relations intelligence which depicts canadian intelligence unit collaborating with local drug lordturned government informant is just as stinging in its portrayal of uscanada law enforcement cooperation through its two seasons the program has followed plot lines including dea attempt to frame the canadian informant for murder cia plot to secretly divert canadian water to the american southwest and rogue dea team that actually starts selling drugs for profit columnist in conservative canadian daily newspaper the national post commented theres question that the csis heroes on intelligence consider the americans our most dangerous enemies even the little mosque gets in to the act 7 u even little mosque on the prairie popular canadian sitcom that depicts muslim community in small saskatchewan town has joined the trend of featuring uscanada border relations this time however the state department is the fall guy december 2007 episode portrayed muslim economics professor trying to remove his name from the noflylist at us consulate the show depicts rude and eccentric us consular officer stereotypically attempting to find any excuse to avoid being helpful another episode depicted how an innocent trip across the border became jumble of frayed nerves as grandpa was scurried into secondary by us border officials because his name matched something on the watch list qhis name matched something on the watch list give us your water oh what the heck well take your country too 8 u and it appears that the season is just warming up after cia renditions dea murder plots dhs missteps and unhelpful consular officers us takeover of canada may have been the only theme left for the cbc h20 miniseries the series was first broadcast in 2005 when it featured an investigation into an american assassination of the canadian prime minister and very broadbased and wildly implausible us scheme to steal canadian water twopart sequel set to be broadcast in march and april 2008 will portray the united states as manipulating innocent trusting canadians into voting in favor of canadas becoming part of the united states then after the united states completely takes over canada one brave canadian unites canadians and europeans in an attempt to end americas hegemony another ottawa 00000136 0032 of 003 program could prove more benign but will certainly include its share of digs against all things american global tv reportedly is gearing up for march 2008 debut of its own border security drama set to feature canadian searchandrescue officers patrolling the uscanada border comment 9 sbu ekos pollster frank graves told poloff he thought that at this point such shows are reflective and not causal in determining attitudes in canada they play on the deepseated caution most canadians feel toward their large neighbor to the south sort of zeitgeist that has been in the background for decades as one example december 2007 strategic counsel poll showed that nine percent of canadians thought us foreign policy was the greatest threat to the world twice as high as those who were concerned about weapons of mass destruction what graves does find disturbing and here he believes that the causal or reflective question is not important is that support for less porous border is increasing in both canada and the us in the us because of generalized fear of terrorism and in canada because of concern over guns sovereignty and the impact that terrorist attack on the us would have on trade graves has detected an increasingly wary attitude over the border that he believes could lead to greater distance between the two countries 10 sbu while there is single answer to this trend it does serve to demonstrate the importance of constant creative and adequatelyfunded publicdiplomacy engagement with canadians at all levels and in virtually all parts of the country we need to do everything we can to make it more difficult for canadians to fall into the trap of seeing all us policies as the result of nefarious faceless us bureaucrats anxious to squeeze their northern neighbor while there are those who may rate the need for usg publicdiplomacy programs as less vital in canada than in other nations because our societies are so much alike we clearly have real challenges here that simply must be adequately addressed visit canadas economy and environment forum at httpwwwintelinkgovcommunitiesstatecan ada wilkins
