centralized clearing bottlenecks and paralysis plag ued the processing of trades producing significant accounting and reporting abuses th subsequent stock market decline pushed many securities firms into financial difficu lties as many firms rged failed or ceased operating some firms used customer prope rty for their own trading while others experienced procedural breakdowns in the management of

them congress has designed sipc to recover prorated position for customers out of the remaining assets of failed firms paying remaining covered claims up to the statutory limits if nece ssary to fill any shortfalls typically the sec or selfregulatory organization like the new york stock exchange or the nasdr the regulatory arm of the national association of securities dealers alerts sipc when securities firm that is sipc member is in serious financial difficulty sipc normally responds by filing an administrative petiti on in federal court to liquidate the firm the court will usually appoint sipcrecommended trustee although sipc will so metimes itself be the trustee where liabilities are limited and collapse affects fewer than 500 customers when the liquidation proceedings are removed to us bankruptcy court the trus tee notifies the firms customers and attempts to sell or transfer customer acc ounts to viable sipc members if the firms customers are unable to recover missing funds or securities from the firm they may file claims whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21741crs3 4 investors whose funds embezzled had sipc claim for securities not cash bnas securities regulation and

customer cl aims sipc advances funds up to statutory amounts noted above sipc will not directly compensate for losses in commodities precious metals derivatives investment contracts limited partnerships or any other securities that are not registered the corporation notes that since 1970 99 of eligible investor s have gotten their investments back via sipc it has distri buted more than 14 billion aiding perhaps 625000 investors around 400 million less than 3 came from the sipc fund with the vast majority of disburse ments having been recovered from liquidations etc sipcs fund balance exceeds 12 billion and it has an additional 1 billion line of credit with banks and the same as draw upon the treasur noted above allowing it to resolve cases directly if necessary it has about 6500 member firms ye t has had to take on only around six new cases year for decade far less th an the large case load in its initial years of operation in dollar terms it ma its largest distributions to customers in 2001 following stresses in the stock market the larges t number of its proceedings occurred in 1972 sipc does not however insure against ma rket losses unlike governmental fixed dollar protection for depository institutions and insurance companies positions delivered to investors may have gone up or down after resolution of collapsed securities firms and thus except the cash portion fluctuate in va lue surveys find many small investors believing that the federal government insures their accounts against market losses however the sec and sipc have tried to address these misconceptions in addition some believe that it c overs losses due to securities fraud etc which it does not do unless an errant covered firm collapses4 for years securities firms could purchas excess sipc coverage supplementing the governmental coverage up to customer protections of many millions of dollars the insurance policies varied in coverage but as surety bonds promised to cover gigantic losses carriers generally stopped writing excess sipc po licies in 2003 fearing enron like surety bond claims as the policies expire their original insurers generally have not renewed them brokerages typically longer advertise multimilliondollar account protection looking to remedy this situa tion consortium of 14 large brokerages has formed captive insurer called the customer asset protection co they have designed the new insurer to restore account excess cove rage as surety bond activated when customers claim exceeds the sipc amount5 major issues sipc has confronted several major criticisms among them are 1 whether it imposes unreasonable requirements on invest ors for redress from failed brokers who conducted unauthorized trades 2 whethe r its overall mission is too restrictive particularly with respect to stock fraud and 3 whether c oversight is strong enoughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21741crs4 6 us government accountability office followup on gao recomme ndations concerning the securities investor protection corporation gao04848r july 9 2004 p 7concerns that sipc imposes unreasonable do cumentation requirements for claims of unauthorized trading sipc is obligated to pay for losses gene rated by unauthorized trading by failed firms yet some have criticized it for the large number of denied claims in this area sipc has historically denied claims for uthorized trades unless customers complained in writing to the firm within few days of the trade and then giving sipc proof of correspondence because most securities orde rs and associated transactions occur over the phone some observers have said that expecting unsophisticated investors to make written complaints is unreasonable courts ve generally upheld si pcs requirement for hard documentation which sipc officials say is necessary to ensure accuracy of claims and to minimize false allegations nevertheless some argue that sipc could probably document unauthorized trades through other m eans such as telephone complaints under sec supervision sipc has dopted written guidance for revi ewing unauthorized trading claims6 expanding sipcs mission to cover fraud an investor believing to have been victimized by brokerage firm scam can file claim with national association of securitie s dealers nasd arbitration court the nasd has primary regulatory jurisdiction over brokerage firms if the nasd arbitration panel rules for the investor its decision then requires the firm to reimburse the losses yet if the brokerage firm s filed for bankruptcy protec tion sipc then takes on the claim sipc recompenses investor funds stolen or used for unauthorized trading it does not however have jurisdiction over other fraud such as broke r refusal to sell security or making false claims about security entrance of many relatively unsophisticated investors in the securities markets appears to have led to increasing brokerage fraud some industry observers including state s ecurities regulators have argued that consequently sipc needs to broaden its mandate to include these kinds of securities fraud sipc and industry officials had opposed broadening sipcs mission maintaining that investors should be held accountable for th eir risk taking they are also concerned that insurance against securities fraud would fuel the misconception that sipc covers market loss they question whether the rge number of wellbeha ved brokers should pay the added costs of insuring investors who invest with bad brokers they are also concerned that reconfiguring sipcs missi on to redress securities fraud could imperil sipcs reserve fund requiring higher paymen ts from its members which they would pass on to their customers and increasing the risk that sipc might tap into the us treasury proponents of reform however counter that negligible yearly assessment of 150 finances the sipc fund far less than many trading commissions and thus the corporation could greatly increase it sipc officials have however said that they would accept broadening its mandate conditioned upon congressiona l amendment of sipa httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21741crs5 7 us government accountability

investors by providing fictitious computer addresses the result is kind of brokerage identity theft sec oversight of sipc in 2001 government accountability office gao report7 criticized sec oversight of sipc among other things the report stated that the overseeing agency too infrequently conducted onsite ex aminations of sipc that the examinations were too limited in scope and that the agency had formal mechanisms for sharing sipc generated information investor complaints status of liquidations among the various sec divisions and offices gao also noted th at public and private bodies may not have sufficiently mentioned the exact coverage of sipc protection to investors especially brokerages in 2003 gao released its first followup report8 finding that the sec had taken steps to implement its recommenda tions gaos recommended disc losures to investors about sipc coverage had generally become effective on sec sipc selfregulatory organization and brokerage website s sipc had added links to other sites in its brochure offering information about investment fra ud gao found however that investors could benefit from more specific links to invest or education information including any remaining excess sipc insurance coverage since then investor education efforts have involved selfregulatory organizations wo rking with the sec and sipc to give customers better information on sipc and its limitations sec and sipc representatives generally agreed with the 2003 reports findings and recommendations as noted above gao i ssued another followup document in 2004 noting their generally affirmative respons addressing prio r concerns over sipc practices concern remains that brokerages ar not required to give new customers the sipcs brochure called how sipc protects you however9
