immigration policies is longstanding one particularly with regard to us employers use of workers fr om mexico the congress is revisiting the issue as it debates guest worker programs increased border enforcement and employer sanctions to curb the flow of unauthorized workers two decades ago the congress passed the immigration reform and control act irca pl 99603 to reduce illegal entry into the united states by imposing sanctions on employers who knowingly hire persons who lack permission to work in the country in addition to general legalization program irca included legalization programs specific to the agricultural industry that were intended to compensate for the acts expected impact on the farm labor supply and encourage development of legal crop workforce these provisions of the act have not operated in the offsetting manner that was intended substantial numbers of unauthorized aliens have continued to join legal farm workers in performing seasonal agricultural services sas little more than onehalf of the sas workforce is not authorized to hold us jobs crop growers contend that their sizable presence implies shortage of nativeborn farm workers grower advocates argue that farmers would ra ther not employ unauthorized workers because doing so puts them at risk of incurring penalties farm worker advocates counter that crop growers prefer unauthorized workers because th ey are in weak bargaining position if the supply of unauthorized workers were curtailed it is claimed farmers could adjust to smaller workforce by introducing laborefficient technologies and management practices and by raising wages which in turn would entice more us wo rkers to accept farm jobs growers respond that further mechanization would be difficult for some crops and that much higher wages would make the us industry uncompetitive in world markets without expanding the legal farm workforce these remain untested arguments because perishable crop growers have rarely if ever operated without unauthorized foreignborn workers trends in the agricultural labor market generally do not suggest the existence of nationwide shortage of domestically available farm workers in part because the governments databases cover authorized and unauthorized workers while nonfarm employment generally has increased thus far in the current decade farm jobs generally have decreased the length of time hired farm workers are employed has changed little or fallen over the years as well their unemployment rate has varied slightly and remains well above the us average underemployment among farm workers also remains substantial in addition the earnings of farm workers relative to other private sector employees has changed little over time this assessment does not preclude the possibility of labor shortages in particular geographic areas at particular times of the year some statistical evidence suggests that california growers experienced tighter labor market in july 2007 compared to peak harvest season year earlier it nonetheless appears that the offer of larger wage increases than those of employers in other industries contributed to there being sufficient authorized and unauthorized workers available to enable california growers to increase employment on their farms in the year ended july 2007

have arisen over the years about 1 whether sufficient workers are available domestically to meet the seasonal employment dema nd of perishable crop producers in the us agricultural industry1 and 2 how if at all the congress should change immigration policy with respect to farm workers immigration policy has long been intertwined with the labor needs of crop eg fruit and vegetable growers who rely more than most farmers on hand labor eg for harvesting and consequently are the largest users of hired and contract workers on perfarm basis 2 since world war i the congress has allowed the use of temporary foreign workers to perform agricultural labor of seasonal nature as means of augmenting the supply of domestic farm workers3 in addition sizeable fraction of immigrants historically have found employment on the nations farms4 the intersection between farm labor and immigration has again emerged as policy issue the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 effectively quashed the discussions on this subject between the bush and fox administrations that took place shortly after president bush first came into office but the proposal of broadbased temporary foreign worker program that president bush sketched in december 2003 revived interest in the laborimmigration nexus for discussion of bills and the presidents proposal see crs report rl32044 immigration policy considerations related to guest worker programs by andorra bruno the lack of progress on broadbased immigration reform before the summer 2007 recess has led to speculation that congress now will narrow its focus to the supply of temporary foreign workers to the agricultural sector and to professional specialty occupations this report first explains the connection made over the past several years between farm labor and immigration policies it next examines the composition of the seasonal agricultural labor force and presents the arguments of grower and farm worker advocates concerning its adequacy relative to employer demand the report then analyzes trends in employment unemployment time worked and wages of authorized and unauthorized farm workers to determine whether they are

fy1994fy1995 shortly thereafter fy1997fy1998 unauthorized aliens share of the estimated 18 million workers employed on crop farms reached 525 by fy1999fy2000 their proportion had increased to 55 before retreating somewhatto 53in fy2001fy20026 although number of studies found that nationwide shortage of domestic farm labor existed in the past decade7 case has been made that the considerable presence of unauthorized foreign born workers in seasonal agriculture implies lack of legal workers relative to employer demand arguably the purported imbalance between authorizedtowork farm labor and employer demand would become more apparent were the supply of unauthorized workers curtailed sufficientlya fear that has plagued growers for some time crop producers and their advocates have testified at congressional hearings and asserted in other venues that they believe the latest risk of losing much of their labor force comes from efforts by the bureau of citizenship and immigration services and the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement within the department of homeland security dhs to stepup employment verification and enforcement activities in concert with mailings of nomatch letters by the social security administration ssa growers have asserted that these activities disrupt their workforces by increasing employee turnover and therefore decreasing the stability of their labor supply the perception that government actions negatively affect us agriculture has prompted legislative response in the past

sometimes has been crafted to take into account the purported labor requirements of us crop growers in 1986 fo r example congress passed the immigration reform and control act irca pl 99603 to curb the presence of unauthorized aliens in the united states by imposing sanctions on employer s who knowingly hire individuals who lack permission to work in the country in addition to general legalization program pl 99603 included two industryspecific legalization programsthe special agricultural worker saw program and the replenishment agricultural worker raw program 8that were intended to 5 according to us department of labor report to congress the agricultural labor marketstatus and recommendations the 18 million figure was developed by dividing the hourly earnings of field and livestock workers into farm labor expenditures to estimate the number of work hours on crop and livestock farms as it was calculated that 72 of the hours were being worked on crop farms the percentage was then applied to the commission on agricultural workers estimate for 1992 of 25 million persons employed for wages on us farms to yield current estimate of the hired crop workforce the commission had developed its earlier farm employment figure from variety of data sources because there is actual head count of farm workers for other current estimates of hired farm and crop workers see table 1

encourage the development of legal crop workforce these provisions of the act have not operated in the offsetting manner that was intended however as substantial numbers of unauthorized aliens have continued to join legal farm workers in performing seasonal agricultural services sas9 on the basis of case studies that it sponsored the commission on agricultural workers concluded in its 1992 report that individuals legalized under the saw program and other farm workers planned to remain in the agricultural labor force indefinitely or for as long as they are physically able 10 according to the dols national agricultural workers survey twothirds of socalled saws stated that they intended to engage in field work until the end of their working lives11 for many saws the end of their worklivesat least their worklives in farmingmay now be near at hand the diminished physical ability generally associated with aging in combination with the taxing nature of crop tasks could well be prompting greater numbers of saws to leave the fields relatively few farm workers are involved in crop production beyond the age of 44 and even fewer beyond the age of 54 19 and 7 respectively in fy2001fy2002 12 the commission on agricultural workers noted that the typical saw in 1990 was 30yearold male who is likely to remain in farm work well into the 21st century13 as the average age of saw legalized workers in 2007 will be 47 increasing numbers of them are likely to be curtailing their participation in sas labor force14 it thus appears that the 1986 legalization program has become less useful over time in fulfilling the labor requirements of crop producers combination of factors likely has contributed to the decrease in saws share of agricultural employment15 while the share of ircalegalized farm workers has been falling over time due to aging and the availability of nonfarm jobs the leading factor probably is the substantially increased presence of illegal aliens16 in the first half of the 1990s unauthorized workers rose continued legal permanent residents anticipating that saws would leave farming because irca did not require them to remain in order to adjust their status pl 99603 included the raw program as backup measure to ensure growers of an adequate labor supply the raw program was never used because the annual calculations of farm labor supply and demand that were made by the us departments of labor and agriculture during the fy1990fy1993 period found national shortages of farm workers 9 seasonal agricultural services sas were defined broadly in irca as field work related to planting cultivating growing and harvesting of fruits and vegetables of every kind and other perishable commodities the terms sas seasonal farm work field work and crop work are used interchangeably in this report 10 caw report of the commission on agricultural workers p 75 11 dol us farmworkers in the postirca period research report 4 march 1993 hereafter cited as dol us

alternatively there are number of reasons why saws would remain in farm employment eg limited english language fluency and little formal education in light of these competing factors the caw concluded that it would be difficult to estimate the attrition rate of saws from the fi elds the existence of fraud in the saw program further complicates such calculation because the stock of saws who genuinely were farm workers is unknown when congress was debating immigration proposals in the mid1980s the us department of agriculture estimated that there were 300000 to 500000 unauthorized farm workers but more than twice the upperend estimate were legalized under the saw program this large discrepancy as well as dditional research led to the widely held conclusion that fraud was extensive 16 the caw determined that the design of the saw program was at least in part responsible for the increase in continued httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30395g8g138g155g150g561g14g138g139g152g155g561g21g145

between fy1989 and fy200220 in addition of the many foreignborn newcomers to the sector in fy2000fy2002 99 were em ployed without authorization unauthorized aliens arguably have been displacing legal workers from jobs in the agricultural industry farm worker advocates assert that crop producers prefer unauthorized employees because they have less bargaining power with regard to wages and working conditions than other employees growers counter that they would ra ther not employ unauthorized workers because doing so puts them at risk of incurring penalties they argue that the considerable presence of unauthorized aliens in the us farm labor force implies shortage of legal workers farm worker groups and some policy analysts contend that even if the previously mentioned dhs and ssa activities were to deprive farmers of many of their unauthorized workers the industry could adjust to smaller supply of legal workers by 1 introducing laborefficient technologies and management practices and 2 raising wages which in turn would entice more authorized workers into the farm labor force grower advocates respond that further mechanization would be difficult to develop for many crops and that even at higher wages not many us workers would want to perform physically demanding seasonal farm labor under variable climactic conditions moreover employer representatives and some policy analysts maintain that growers cannot raise wages substantially without making the us industry uncompetitive in world markets which in turn would reduce farm employment in response farm worker supporters note that wages are small part of the price consumers pay for fresh fruits and vegetables and accordingly higher wages would result in only slight rise in retail prices these remain untested arguments as perishable crop growers have rarely if ever had to operate without unauthorized aliens in their workforces

available farm workers in part because the governments statistical series cover authorized and unauthorized workers this overall finding does not preclude the possibility of spot shortages of farm labor in certain areas of the country at various times of the year continued unauthorized immigration because if dependents of saws did not similarly have their status adjusted they might have illegally entered the united states to join family members in addition the network or ki nship recruitment process for sas work continued to flourish and to facilitate not only job placement but also migration by assisting in border crossing and in acquiring fraudulent work authorization documents these findings led the commission to conclude that the concept of workerspecific and industryspecific legalization program was fundamentally flawed it invited fraud posed difficult definitional problems regarding who should or should not be eligible and ignored the longstanding priority of us

workers employment unemployment time worked and wages that follow the surveys from which the data are derived cover somewhat different groups within the farm labor force eg all hired farm workers as opposed to those engaged only in crop production or workers employed directly by growers as opposed to those supplied to growers by farm labor contractors and they have different sample sizes household survey such as the current population survey cps could well understate the presence of farm workers because they are more likely to live in less traditional quarters eg labor camps and of unauthorized workers generally because they may be reluctant to respond to government enumerators and some of the surveys have individuals as respondents eg the cps and dols national agricultural workers survey while others have employers as respondents eg the us department of agricu ltures national agricultural statistics service farm labor survey fls surveys that query employers are more likely to pickup unauthorized employment than are surveys that query individuals g23g151g141g142g155g149g162g146g151g144g561g3g156g156g158g150g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 estimating whether the number of workers in the united states is sufficient to fulfill employer demand is difficult because there is agreedupon definition of labor shortage economists believe labor markets reach balance between supply and demand with lag absent government policies that prevent shortage or surplus from occurring for example economic theory posits that firms needing more workers to fill jobs in particular occupation will initially raise wages to attract employees from elsewhere in the economy and thereby restore equilibrium between supply and demand in the occupation in contrast businesses tend to think there is shortage in given occupation if as many workers as they want cannot be obtained at the current wage being offered estimating shortages or surpluses also is not straightforward because the supply of and demand for labor generally cannot be measured directly there is proxy for the supply of workers to most occupations 21 an oftused measure of demand is employment accordingly an increase in an occupations employment denotes that employers have increased their demand for labor and may be moving towardbut have not reacheda shortfall of workers while decrease in an occupations employment signals that employers either have 1 reduced their demand for labor and may be moving away from shortage or 2 maintained or increased their demand but may have exhausted the supply of readily available workers the trend in wages commonly is used to clarify the latter situation if employment in an occupation falls despite employers substantially bidding up wages it is assumed that the number of workers readily available to fill jobs in the occupation may have reached its limit 21 exceptions are those occupations with very well delineated and widely agreed upon credentials in the case of registered nurses for example the number of students graduating from nursing programs as well as the number of workers in the united states already licensed as registered nurses would compose the available supply of individuals to the occupation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30395g8g138g155g150g561g14g138g139g152g155g561g21g145 g152g155g157g138g144g142g156g561g138g151g141

overall has been downward see columns 3 and 7 in table 1 the employment pattern among crop workers hired directly by growers ie excluding those supplied by farm bor contractors and crew leaders has regularly risen and then fallen back but to higher vel through 2000 column 4 this ratcheting upward of employment produced 12 gain over the 19902000 period in contrast other wage and salary workers experienced steady and robust job growth over almost the entire period from 1990 to 2000 wage and salary employment in nonfarm industries advanced by 18 these divergent employment patterns suggest that hired farm workers did not share equally in the nations long economic expansion and appear to be inconsistent with the presence of nationwide farm labor shortage at that time the labor market

demand employment of hired farm workers in the year ended july 2007 fluctuated much like it had previously over time in the 15 regions and 3 states into which nass divides the united states see table 3 farmers in eight regions florida and hawaii reduced their demand for directhire farm workers this past july in addition employment of hired farm workers remained the same between july 2006 and july

out of 15 and states 2 out of 3 for which the fls provides data variable climate conditions may explain good deal of the longstanding yearly fluctuations in farm employment for example drought or hurri canes could severely curtail crop production in given region in one year that would greatly reduce labor requirements the following year the same area could have more normal weather cond itions that would produce larger crop and hence greater demand for labor specific example involves washington state different weather conditions in 2006 than 2005 affected when demand peaked for harvesting

market at the same time that employment in given occupation is decreasing or increasing relatively slowly unemployment in the occupation might be falling employers would then be faced with shrinking supply of untapped labor from which to draw falling unemployment rate or level would offer some basis for this possibility as shown in table 4 the unemployment rate of hired farm workers engaged in crop or livestock production including contract labor is quite high even the economic boom that characterized most of the 1990s did not reduce the groups unemployment rate below doubledigit levels or about twice the average unemployment rate in the nation at minimum discouragement over their employment prospects in agriculture or better opportunities elsewhere may have prompted some unemployed

looking at monthly unemployment rates for these areas in order to take into account the seasonality of farm work the agency found that the agricultural counties exhibited comparatively high rates of joblessness24 these kinds of findings imply surplus rather than shortage of farm workers25 another perspective on the availability of untapped farm labor comes from the dols national agricultural worker survey naws during fy2001fy2002 the typical crop worker spent 66 of the year performing farm jobs the remainder of the year these farm workers either were engaged in nonfarm work 10 of the year or not working 16 while in the united states or they were out of the country 726 this pattern also suggests an excess supply of labor assuming that the workers wanted more farm employment grower advocates contend that the pattern is manifestation of working in season industry even in month of peak industry demand however only small majority of farm workers hold farm jobs27

of hired farm workers has ranged narrowly around 400 hours since the mid 1990s thus neither the trend in employment nor in work hours imply the existence of farm labor shortage there also is not much

for workers consequently earnings in the shortsupply field would be expected to increase more rapidly than earnings across all industries or occupations the ratio of in this instance farm to nonfarm wages also would be expected to rise if the farm labor supply were tight as shown above in table 6 the average hourly earnings of field excluding contract workers rose to greater extent than those of

with demand it is akin to the offshoring of work engaged in by other us industries thus the farm labor market in california functioned as economists theorize growers were able to attract more workers by substantially raising wages and they economized on us labor by offshoring production

aboveaverage wage increases among field workers shown in table 7 in mountain ii colorado nevada and utah and mountain iii arizona new mexico is related to the same factor that pushed up the average hourly wage of all hired farm workersnamely greater percentage of salaried workers putting in fewer hours 33 the lower demand for labor evidenced by fewer hours worked appears due to different climate conditions in july 2007 compared to year earlier the reduced employment in mountain ii this past july resulted from the winter wheat harvest being behind last years pace and the lower employment in mountain iii resulted from abnormally hot and extremely dry weather that limited activity on farms during the surveys reference week 34 g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 in summary indicators of supplydemand conditions generally are inconsistent with the existence of nationwide shortage of domestically available farm workers in part because the measures include both authorized and unauthorized employment this finding does not preclude the possibility of farm worker shortages in certain parts of the country at various times during the year the analysis does not address the adequacy of authorized workers in the seasonal farm labor supply relative to grower demand whether there would be an adequate supply of authorized us farm workers if new technologies were developed or different labormanagement practices were implemented continues to be an unanswered question whether more us workers would be willing to become farm workers if wages were raised and whether the size of the increase would make the industry uncompetitive in the world marketplace also remain open issues these matters remain unresolved because perishable crop growers have rarely if ever had to operate without unauthorized aliens being present in the domestic farm workforce 35 32 short on labor farmers in us shift to mexico new york times september 5 2007 33 nass farm labor august 2007 p 1 and

and recommendations was issued in december 2000 recommendations included continuing appropriations for agwork ie an internetbased online job matching system specifically for agricultural employees and employers encouraging greater use of automated employee verification systems and further pursuing h2a program streamlining while maintaining farm worker protec tions the report concluded that ircas farm legalization program failed to turn an unauthorized into an authorized workforce it asserted that proposals to ease growers access to temporary farm workers outside the existing h2a program would not create legal domestic agricultural workforce and instead would lower wages and working and living c onditions in agricultural jobs resulting in fewer domestic workers continuing employment in agriculture and perpetuating the industrys dependence on foreign labor force the report noted that one approach to creating an authorized supply of crop workers had never been tried namely increasing wages and improving working conditions by normalizing legal protections for farm workers and increasing mechanization which has the potential to attract more us workers to agriculture and raise the productivity of possibly smaller farm labor force in reco gnition that there might be shortrun increases in growers labor costs were these recommendations implemented dol urged congress was urged to consider ways to temporarily assist them
