requires that contractors engaging in certain federal contract construction pay workers on such projects not less than the locally prevailing wage for comparable wo rk in addition such contractors are required to file payroll repor ts and to meet other administrative and labor standards requirements enacted at the urging of the hoover administration the statute was modified in 1934 with doption of the copeland antikickback act and in 1935 through general amendments dealing with administration and implementation among them establishment of 2000 coverage threshol d the threshold had been 5000 in the original enactment requirement that the prevailing wage rate be determined prior to submission of bids and extension of coverage both to public buildings and public works including painting and

suspended on three occasions in 1934 by president roosevelt in 1971 by president nixon and in 1992 by president bush in each instance the suspension was brief and the act was subsequently restored to

davisbacon act became apparent both industry and organized labor while voicing different concerns appealed to the congress and to the white house for revision of the statute early modification while mandating under davi sbacon that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid congress had not established regular system though which such wage rate determinations might be made thus contractors when bidding on public project had to commit themselves to pay whatever wage could be agreed upon or in the event of dispute whatever wage the secretary of labor might later decide was prevailing thus industry sought amendment of the act to provide for predetermination of wage rates organized labor was concerned that forcement procedures under the act were inadequate pointing to the 5000 threshold for triggering the statute it noted that certain employers might fragment contracts in order to escape the acts requirements besides the unions suggested many contr acts for painting and decorating fell below the threshold and thus workers in thos fields would not be covered at all8 it was alleged that some employers paid the locally prevailing rate to their employees as the act require d but would then demand under the table kickback of portion of that wage some estimate d that as much as 25 of the legitimate wage costs for federal projects was being returned to employers through kickback

act pro and through the years arguments for and ag ainst davisbacon have become largely fixed as have the counterarguments of defenders and critics the logic and many of the assumptions that these arguments c ontain have been questioned at length in the evolving debate few cont entions about the act have gone or are likely to go unchallenged arguments generally critical of davisbacon some critics of davisbacon argue among other things that the act has an inflationary impact unnecessarily increasing the cost of federal construction and that it hampers competition especially with respect to small and minorityowned businesses unfamiliar with federal contracting procedures they contend that it impedes efficient utilization of manpower limiting the use of helpers or general utility workers some argue were davisbacon restrictions absent that contractors would employ more minority and women workers because they can hire them more cheaply and by fragmenting the tasks to be performed use them as substitutes for more broadly skilled workers implicit here is the assumption that if employers are forced by davisbacon to pay not less than the locally prevailing wage in craft they will hire more broadly skilled highly trained or experienced workers besides critics note congress has provided general minimum wage floor with enactment of the fair labor standards act 1938 they argue that super minimum wage for federal construction work is both unnecessary and unjust they assert that labor costs for federal construction could be reduced with savings for the taxpayer if actual local market wages were paid rather than administratively determined locally prevailing wages often the union rate some argue in addition they urge simplification of the copeland act reporting requirements and of the compliance and wage rate determination processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94908crs11 arguments generally suppor tive of davisbacon supporters of davisbacon hold that the act prevents cutthroat competition from flybynight firms that undercut local wages and working conditions and compete unfairly with local contractors that the act helps stabilize the local construction industry an advantage to workers and empl oyers alike the act they suggest may tend to assure the consuming agency of higher quality work since employers who are required to pay at least the locally prevailing wage are likely to hire more competent and productive workers resulting in bette r workmanship less waste reduced need for supervision and fewer mistakes requiri ng corrective action this may lead to fewer cost overruns and more timely completion of public construction and in the longterm lower rehabilitation and repair needs down the line thus some argue the davisbacon act could act ually save the taxpayer money on public construction supporters of the act also argue that davisbacon deters contractors from fragmenting construction tasks to utilize lowwage and often lowskill helpers or pickup crews they believe this could result in tradeoff of longterm social benefits for shortterm prof its some argue that wit hout davisbacon and in the absence of collective bargaining agreement contractors would be unlikely to provide training whether formally throug h certified program or through informal investment in human capital improving the skills of their regular employees advocates also contend that repeal or weakening of the act may adversely affect apprenticeship programs in the construction industry to the disadvantage of minority and women workers who are entering the building trades in growing numbers if helpers are substituted for skilled craft workers it would likely be minorities and to lesser extent women who would be laid off or forced into lowerwage jobs some assert how good is the information we have concerning the effects of the davisbacon act the davisbacon act among labor laws is widely known but it may not be well known the davisbacon literatu re if one takes into account agency reports and congressional hearings is extensive th public documents ve provided basis both for popular and scholarly consideration of the act perhaps the most frequently asked questi on concerning the davisbacon act is would we save money if the davisbacon act were repeal ed or modified to narrow its scope the short answer is one really knows conversely might davis bacon result in savings to th federal government in its purchases of construction that too would seem to be an open question another question frequently asked by those both in industry and in the workforce who may have to deal with the davisbacon act is is this particular project covered and further if so wh if not why not to whom is assigned the judgment for making such determina tions such questions might be answered were there scholarly ins titutional history of the act and of its place within thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94908crs12 broader field of public contr acting policy if such study exists it does not appear to be generally available the general nature of davisbacon research there have been numerous hearings through the years since the davisbacon legislation was first considered they ve tended to focus on policy issues or have served as forum for airing complaints less time has been devoted to examination of economic impact or to its assessment the davisbacon literature is extensive and diverse generally it falls into three categories public materials ie agency reports and analyses journalistic pieces and academic studies the latter ar also diverse work commissioned by interest groups which may be scholarly nonetheless ar ticles that merge journalism with scholarship and putativel independent academic work given the number of projects covered by the act it is nearly impossible for an independent scholar to review its administration and to assess its impact first there is the scope of the task thousands of projects throughout the united states administered by different agencies nd involving hundreds of contractors second there is the problem of availability of basic documentation how much information has actually been preserved are th reports required unde r the copeland act factual and complete access to data presents third problem assuming that the data are available securing such documentation and access to administrative personnel may be problematic if one assumes that documentation exists that the independent analyst is granted access to it that all of the parties are cooperativ and that the means financial and other are available for such an undert aking the analyst is left with fourth complication he is comparing something that did happen with something that in fact for whatever reasons did not happen in the absence of davisbacon requirement would the contract have gone to the same cont ractor if so or if not would it have been managed in the same way did the contracting agency monitor the project carefully and was such monito ring comparable with that for non davis bacon projects did the act have any impact upon the wages actually paid or upon workforce utilization without davis bacon would different workers have been employed these same questions confront public agency in its efforts to investigate davisbacon impact the availability of the data the willingness of the various parties to cooperate in an investigation and the speculative character of the comparison between what did happen what did not happen and what might or might not have happened under differe nt circumstances for pub lic agency the task is less massive than for private scholar nd in the public sector there may be other constraints how much funding and staff time should be devoted to an investigation of davisbacon impact what political or policy concerns may come into playhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94908crs13 38 press briefing by secretary of labor f ray marshall july 17 1979 p 44 mimeographed press

the report maintaining that it had little credibility38 subsequently the report and the issues it raised were focus of review by three separate congressional committees during which both its methodol

market and the federal budget cbo attempted to set dollar figure for any increased cost of federal constr uction sparked by davi sbacon requirements cautiously cbo noted number of problem s in the availabl data and method and noted that data on these effects are highly inconclusive cbo does not appear to have conducted i ndependent research for its 1983 report relying upon the existing literature which estimated range of impact from 75 million to 1 billion year40httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94908crs14 41 us congress house committee on ducation and labor subcommittee on labor standards

subcommittee on labor standards cbo director robert d reischauer noted let at this point mention caveat about cbos estimates and th is is that they are based on relatively old information they are derived from 1983 report that cbo issued that weighed the evidence from all of the studies that were available at that time unfortunately he added little has been written about the impact of the davisbacon act since 1983 and so we have had reas on to adjust our estimates41 both the 1979 gao report and the 1983 cbo report which still provide basis for many davisbacon impact estimates are now dated the reagan administration regulations governing administration of the act issued in the early 1980s were proffered as means through which to re nder implementation more efficient and to eliminate unnecessary costs parts of these reforms have been given effect gradually through the past decade thus whatever the merit of gaos findings in 1979 and the cbos analysis in 1983 they may long er be valid new re search taking into account the effect of the reag an reforms may be needed views from the private sector the first question to ask when assessing davisbacon literature is what is the date of the data upon which it is based if the data are from the prereagan era as most are then the resultant studies may be of little use for current economic or policy an alysis the rules for implementation of the act having been changed during that period and thus presumably the cost impact of the statute for many years virtually the only ma jor study of the statute was armand thieblots 1975 monograph the davisbacon act funded in part by the us chamber of commerce and published by th wharton school of the university of pennsylvania it is strongly critical of the act thieblot concluded that the act makes little sense under conditions of prosperity and expansi on and provides far too few benefits to offset its immense costs42 thieblots work was updated in 1986 but appears to rely upon prereagan data what is thieblots impact assessment fo r davisbacon he notes broadening the range used by cbo that davisbacon impact estimates have been presented during the past 10 years ranging from ss than 50 million to more than 2 billion while he suggests there is direct way to measure the davisbacon impact43 still for his own part he asserts davisbacon costs more to operate than

productivity differe nces between lowwage and highwage workers allen and reich state paying at least the locally prevailing wage rate will make it possible to attract better trained and more highly skilled construction workers able to complete the job quickly and efficiently focusing upon state experience they conclude that once all the relevant variables are taken into consideration there is evidence whatsoev er of any correlation between the level of construction costs and the presence or absence of state little davisbacon act45 the essay was prepared for the center to protect workers rights chaired by robert georgine president of the bu ilding and construction trades department aflcio allen has developed this theme in subsequent academic work and is often cited 1982 study effect of the davisbacon act on construction costs in non metropolitan areas of the united states was prepared by martha n fraundorf with others of oregon state university fra undorf suggests that the cost estimates for davisbacon offered by gao thieblot and certain others are based on an erroneous procedure and she chides gao for working from sample even the agency recognized was really too small for extrapolation46 but the oregon team funded by the american farm bureau fe deration critic of davisbacon was forced to scale back its own work because of difficulties it encountered in securing adequate data fraundorf and her colleagues began with an assumption while it is fairly clear that the law results in higher wages it does not follow that the law therefore raises overall costs to determine the latter they attempted an empirical study of total costs but they found this to be complex first they looked only at rural non residential construc tion which they conceded might differ from urban work second they could not disaggregate da visbacon costs from other federal requirements ie affirmativ action or different standa rds for quality and safety third they were not able to access varyin g alternative method s of construction within those parameters they compared federal with nonfederal constructionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94908crs16 47 fraundorf et effect of the davisbac

wage and price stability cowps during the mid1970s the work of goldfarb and morrall was further developed in series of private academic articles at cowps they found themselves working with data provided by dol which they viewed as not entirely satisfactory for their purposes in their cowps analysis 1976 they identified the deficiencies they found in the data they were using and spoke of some rough order of magnitude of possible cost savings from changes in the administration of davisbacon but they cautioned by way of conclusion the data are somewhat ambiguous and perhaps unreliable48 in private academic article 1978 go ldfarb and morrall seem to have been somewhat less cautious suggesting that with administrative changes with respect to davisbacon an overall savings in the hundr eds of millions is possible and they point out various administrative changes might well encourage an expansion of the nonunion sector which might in turn have costlowering effects in the long run49 their work sparked some criticism whic h in yet another article 1981 they attempted to refute critiques in the abstract are di fficult to evaluate and even more so critiques of critiques and by the early 1980s the literature wa s beset by argument and counter argument often focusing s goldfarb and morrall had done themselves in 1976 upon the inadequacies of the data seeming to share the approach of thieblot and like thieblot basing their work on prereagan data goldfarb and morrall acknowledge the data pr oblems but reject the notion that this invalidates the usefulness of cost calculations they affirm rather that even rough estimates of possible magnitudes of effect s based on imperfect data are very useful background information for helping inform policy decisions50 during the early 1980s

do have positive economic impacts for the community apart fro m any advantage to workers further these studies seem to suggest that allegations of negative impact for example unjustifiably inflating the cost of public construction or increasing such costs at all may be overstated53httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94908crs18 53 continued institute washington dc october 2005 14 pbibliography through the
