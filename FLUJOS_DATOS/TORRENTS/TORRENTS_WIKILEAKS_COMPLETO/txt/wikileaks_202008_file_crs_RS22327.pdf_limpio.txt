division c allows covered person to be held liable is when death or serious physical injury was caused by the willful misconduct of covered person division c defines willful misconduct as an act or omission that is taken i intentionally to achieve wrongful purpose ii knowingly without legal or factual justification and iii in disregard of known or obvious risk that is so great as to make it highly probable that the harm will outweigh the benefit in addition the secretary of hhs in consultation with the attorney general shall promulgate regulations that further restrict the scope of actions or omissions by covered person that may qualify as willful misconduct furthermore the plaintiff shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence willful misconduct by each covered person sued and that such willful misconduct caused the death or serious physical injury the clear and convincing standard is higher than the usual burden of proof in civil cases which is

such act or omission shall not constitute willful misconduct if neither the secretary of hhs nor the attorney general has initiated an enforcement action with respect to th act or omission or if such an enforcement action has been initiated and the enforcement action has been terminated or finally resolved without specified penalty imposed on the covered person the proceeding in which an injured party may seek to prove that covered person had engaged in willful misconduct is new federal cause of action that division c created suits under state tort law are prohibited subsection d of the new 319f3 provides for purposes of section 2679b2b of title 28 united states code such cause of action is not an action brought for violation of statute of the united states under which an action against an individual is otherwise authorized this apparently means that the new federal cause of action may not be brought against federal employee 9 division c provides that suits under the new federal cause of action may be brought only in the us district court for the district of columbia and that such court with exceptions noted below shall apply the substantive law including choice of law principles of the state in which the alleged willful misconduct occurred the reference to choice of law principles means that the court will apply the law of the state in which the alleged willful misconduct occurred but if that states law provides that different states law should apply then the court will apply the other states law 10 although federal district court cases are usually heard by single judge cases under division cs new federal cause of action will be assigned initially to panel of three judges such panel shall have jurisdiction over such action for purposes of considering motions to dismiss motions for summary judgment and matters related thereto if such panel has denied such motions or if the time for filing such motions has expired such panel shall refer the action to the chief judge for assignment for further proceedings including any tr ial this suggests that the panels jurisdiction is limited to pretrial motions and that single judge will run the trial including ruling on motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment that were made after the trial began under the new federal cause of action certain matters are not governed by state law damage awards will be reduced by the amount of collateral source benefits with collateral source benefits defined to include amounts the plaintiff is entitled to receive from any governmental program workers compensation law health or disability insurance and the like collateral sources will have right of subrogation which means that they could not recover out of the damages the plaintiff recovers in lawsuit brought under the new federal cause of action benefits that they had paid the plaintiff under the new federal cause of action noneconomic damages which are damages for pain and suffering and other nonmonetary losses may be awarded only in an amount directly proportional to the percentage of responsibility of defendant for harm to the plaintiff this 9 strictly speaking 2679b2b does not authorize actions against federal employees but provides that 2679b1 which gives federal employees immunity from suits under state tort law shall not apply to actions brought under federal statutes it is such federal statutes not 2679b2b that authorize actions against federal employees 10 the reason that division c created federal cause of action and has federal courts apply state law rather than simply requiring state causes of action to be brought in federal court may be that it might have been unconstitutional to allow state causes of action between plaintiffs and defendants from the same state to be brought in federal court see in re tmi litigation cases consol ii 940 f2d 832 848851 3d cir 1991 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22327g18g138g151g141g142g150g146g140g561g8g149g158g561g138g151

g346g561means that if two defendants are found liable for willful misconduct then they will not be jointly and severally liable for noneconomic damages which means that they will not each be liable for the full amount of the plaintiffs noneconomic damages if for example one of the two defendants was 25 responsible for the harm and the other was 75 responsible for the harm then the plaintiff may recover more than 25 of his noneconomic damages from the first even if the second is insolvent with respect to economic damages however the plaintiff may recover up to 100 from either liable party if the relevant state law provides for joint and several liability under the new federal cause of action rule 11 sanctions against attorneys law firms or parties for filing frivolous claims or defenses or filing papers for improper purposes are mandatory rule 11 currently makes sanctions discretionary on the part of the court

service act which upon issuance by the secretary of the declaration referred to in the first paragraph of this report would establish in the treasury the covered countermeasure process fund the secretary shall after amounts have by law been provided for the fund under subsection 11 provide compensation to an eligible individual for covered injury ie serious physical injury or death directly caused by the administration or use of covered countermeasure pursuant to such declaration12 despite the shall quoted in the previous sentence an eligible individual has an election to accept the compensation or to bring an action under the new federal cause of action but may not do both compensation under this fund would be in the same amount as is prescribed by sections 264 265 and 266 of the public service health act for persons injured as result of the administration of certain countermeasures against smallpox13 these three sections provide respectively medical benefits compensation for lost employment income and death benefits but do not provide damages for pain and suffering

g21g157g138g157g158g157g142g156g561 congress has enacted other tort reform statutes to limit liability under state law14 the rest of this report describes the broad categories into which these statutes may be placed so that division c can be compared with them some federal statutes have eliminated tort liability with exceptions and without providing an alternative means of compensation other federal statutes have eliminated tort liability for ordinary negligence but not for gross negligence or willful 11 the reference to subsection seems unclear because subsection provides for the establishment of the f und not for its funding perhaps the reference was meant to be for the fund established under subsection 12 thus the covered countermeasure process fund will t provide compensation unless congress enacts separate statute that appropriates money for it 13 sections 264 265 and 266 were enacted by the smallpox emergency personnel protection act of 2003 pl 10820 2003 and are codified respectively at 42 usc 239c 239d and 239e 14 these statutes are listed in and briefly summarized in the appendix to crs report 95797 federal tort reform legislation constitutionality

g347g561misconduct division c eliminated tort liability except for willful misconduct and therefore falls in between these two categories in addition divi sion c would allow injured persons to recover compensation from the covered countermeasure process fund if congress appropriates money for it more than 50 federal statutes provide total immunity to particular private parties but make the us government liable under the federal tort claims act in their stead15 there are situations however in which the us government may not be held liable under the ftca and in those situations victims may be left without remedy16 even when the united states may be held liable under the ftca it may never be held liable for punitive damages even in states that authorize punitive damages awards occasionally congress immunizes private parties but establishes federal compensation program examples include the radiation xposure compensation act which immunizes government contractors who carried
