to congress highlights of the fy2007 defense budget request aspects of the defense departments fy 2007 request that appear to be of most immediate concern to congress include 1 the administration continues to request large amounts for iraq and afghanistan thr ough additional or mergency supplemental appropriations not subject to limit s on total discretionary federal spending and not subject to the full congressional authorization and appropriations review process in the fy2007 budget the administration has for the first time requested part of the f unding to carry on military operations in iraq and afghanistan before the start of the fi scal year in the form of 50 billion budget amendment to the fy2007 request in this the administration has followed congresss lead congress provided b ridge fund of 25 billion for iraq and afghanistan in the fy2005 defense appropr iations bill and of 50 billion in fy2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs10 by submitting budget amendment the administration gains more direct and formal voice in proposing how to allocate the additional funds the administration will continue however to request more additional funding in an emergency supplemental appropriations b ill to be submitted next year both the bridge fund and later supplemental appr opriations will be request ed over and above proposed limits on overall discretionary spending the key point remains this either in th form of bridge fund or of emergency supplemental appropriations the administra tion is requesting that additional war funding not count against restrictive cap s on regular annual fense and nondefense appropriations war expenditures however ve become very large part of total annual defense spending and for that ma tter of total defe nse and nondefense appropriations for fy2006 congress appr oved 50 billion bridge fund for war costs last fall and in june of 2006 it approved additi onal supplemental appropriations of 66 billi on for total of 116 bi llion few comparisons may help put this amount into perspective regular dod appropriations for fy2006 were 411 billion so the 116 billion for war increases defense funding by 28 in last years budget resolution the fy2006 cap on total nonemergency appropriations both for defense and for nondefense programs was 843 billion which wa s subsequently trimmed by 1 to 835 billion the 116 billion for war adds 14 to federal discretionary funding at the end of last years budget cycle congress imposed an across theboard cut of 1 in all ppropriations bills which trimmed federal spending by 84 billion 7 of the amount it is providing for war costs an equally important point is th at dod requests for additional or emergency war appropriations are not subject to nearly the extent of review that congress exercises over regular defense sp ending the administration decision to submit budget amendment for bridge fund is at most only limited step in the direction of greater oversight the amendment has not been submitted in advance of house action on the fy2007 defense authorization bill moreover neither supplemental appropriations requests nor budget amendmen ts are supported by the kind of detailed budget justif ication material that cong ress expects to be provided with regular dod funding requests in part because of that there appears to be growing sentiment in congress to the ffect that full funding for ongoing military operations should be considered through th regular annual fense authorization and appropriati ons processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs11 3 for full discussion see crs report rl32924 defense fy2006 authorization and appropriations by stephen daggett2 the regular dod appropriations request for fy2007 is for 4393 billion 285 billion above the fy 2006 enacted amount an increase of 7 viewed in this way the fy2007 budget appears to carry on the substantial defense buildup that has been underway for th past several years but the story is bit more complicated than that the increase appears so large in part because congress cut the fy2006 request by 85 billion 44 billion cut in the regular process and an additional acr osstheboard reduction of 41 billion at the end of the appropriations process3 moreover in an effort to stay within tight limits on overall appropriations for fy2007 the office of management and b udget trimmed dods fy2007 budget by 38 billion compared to th amount that was planned last year for fy2007 outyear budget projections for the regular defense budget show spending leveling off to very modest rates of growth the average increase between fy2005 and fy2011 is 17 per year above inflation far below the 5 per year growth between fy2001 and fy2005 see figure 1 that said when additional and suppl emental appropriations for war are included total defense spending is continuing to grow the total increase in defense between fy2005 and fy2006 will be about 56 billion if congress approves the pending fy2006 supplemental the in crease between fy2006 and fy2007 could be as great figure 1 dod discretionary budget authority fy2000fy2011 excluding supplementalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs12 so the summary story line might be rmed the tale of two budgets the budget is getting very tight for programs th at are funded strictly within the regular defense budget military service officials ve testified that the congressional cuts in the fy2006 defense budget are requiri ng substantial reductions in some operations at the same time supplementa l appropriations are soaring and money is readily available for programs that are tied to the war effort 3 the administrations fy2007 request rejects congressional proposals to increase army and mari ne corps endstrength and cuts air force and navy personnel levels for fy2006 congress authorized active duty endstrength of 512400 for th army of 179000 for the marine corps by the end of fy2007 however the defense department plans to restore army and marine corps endstrength to the pr efy2004 preiraq baseline level 482400 for the army which is 30000 troops lower than the current authorization and 175000 for the marine corps which is 4000 lower many members of congress have urged that the current authorized leve ls be made permanent in order to ease the pace of operations on ground forces th administration vigorously opposes permanent increase however arguing that costs are high and that forces can be organized more efficiently to provide required combat troops meanwhile the air force plans to liminate at least 40000 fulltime equivalent positions over the next five years throug h mixture of reductions in active duty reserve and civilian pers onnel and the navy is cutting 12000 active duty personnel between fy2006 and fy2007 though dditional navy cuts have been announced formally it is widely expected that the defense partment will trim an additional 20000 or so positions from th navy over the next few years 4 the administrations fy2007 request provides funds for 333000 army national guard arng troops rather than the 350000 authorized and reflects decision to reduce the number of combat brigades in the arng from 34 to 28 the army has been unable to recruit and retain enough troops in the national guard to reach its authorized endstrength in the fy2007 request the army has requested fundi ng only for 333000 troops though after the budget was released army officials said th at they would shift money into personnel and other related accounts if r ecruitment and retention improve s in its future plans however the army projects arng endstrength of 333000 more controversial issue is the army plan to reduce the number of new modularized arng combat brigades as ar my officials explain the purpose of the change is to fully man the new brigades within authorized arng endstrength and to fully equip the combat units within ava ilable budget constraints the change will likely mean that arng units in some states that will not as had been planned be outfitted as new more capable combat brig ades will lose personnel the units that remain therefore will also likely have less ability to carry out state disaster response and homeland defense missions as resu lt state governors and some national guard leaders have been very critical of the plan 5 the fy2007 request includes only modest 22 pay

administration has proposed increasing fees and copays for underage65 military retirees who are eligible for medical care through the military tricare program this is the firs t proposed increase in medical copays since the current tricare medical care system for retirees and dependents was established in 1995 6 the fy2007 request proposes few reductions in major weapons programs some of which have been controversial in congress with the defense department ca rrying out its quadrennial defense review in 2005 many expected some substantial changes in longterm budget priorities including some cuts in major weapons programs the qdr did not however make many farreaching changes in ongoing programs and only few reductions in weapons plan s are reflected in the fy2007 budget request two have so far been controversial in congress decision to halt procurement of the c17 cargo plane in fy2007 after buying 180 of the aircraft si nce the program began in the mid 1980s and decision to drop plans to develop and buy engines for the f35joint strike fighter from two manuf acturers and instead just to buy engines from one company 7 the quadrennial defense review did not result in decisions on major ongoing defense budget nd programrelated issues the official department of defense report on th 20052006 quadrennial defense review 5 which was released along with the admin istrations budget re quest in february stated plainly that the yearlong qdr exercise was not intended to be systematic assessment of major defense programs instead it was signed to provide vision of the national security challenges facing the nation and to identify the kinds of military capabilities that are needed true to its word the qdr report announ ced very few major program decisions though it did mention some perhaps the most significant is to add 15000 special operations troops though without increasin g overall military endstrength for the most part the qdr report simply endors ed ongoing initiatives though often with wording carefully designed to keep options for policymakers open the result is to leave undecided some very farreaching defense policy issues for the navy the qdr report endorsed increasing green and brown water capabilities construction of new prepositioninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs14 6 for an overview of army m odularization see crs report rl32476 us armys

conversion of number of triden t ii submarinela unched missiles to carry conventional nonnuclea r warheads but the report said nothing about other naval force issu notably it did not mention the recentlyreleased navy shipbuild ing plan for combat fleet of 313 ships many question whether that plan is affordable regarding fighter aircraft acquisiti on plans in the air force navy and marine corps the qdr repor t endorsed revised air force plan to stretch out f22 procuremen t but otherwise did not mention the number of shortrange fighter and ground attack aircraft needed in the long term the report put great deal of emphasis on the need for longrange prompt global strike capabilities this may appear to be at odds with plans to tinue large investments in shorter range strike aircraft that may have limited access to areas of combat in future conflicts but the re port did not address the issue the report endorsed the armys pl an to reorganize into more deployable modular combat brigad but notably did not make an explicit commitment to provide the full funding needed to modularize all active and reserve combat units as the army has planned6 the report also endorsed the capabilities being developed in the armys future combat sy stem development program but notably did not explicitly endorse the program as whole the report said very little at ll about satellites and other space programs the only mention of space program was to endorse an air force plan to restructure the transformational communications satellite tsat pr ogram to incorporate less risky technology other space programs have experienced problems like those in the tsat program but these are not mentioned space programs overall have grown dramatically as share of the defense budget and cost growth in major programs has been pandemic and major policy issue is how to protect space based systems from future threats and whether the us security will be advanced by developing offensive space capabilities the qdr discusses none of these issues key issues in congress last year congressional action on th annual defense authorization and appropriations bills featured extensive debates first over policy toward treatment of military detainees and toward the nd of the year over the pace of troop withdrawals from iraq this year tinued debate over iraq policy reemerged in congressional consideration of the fy2006 supplemental appropriations bill hrhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs15 4939 that debate was re newed first in the house on june 1516 when the leadership brought up resolution hjres 861 declaring that it is not in the national security interest of the united states to set an arbitrary date for the withdrawal or redeployment of united states armed forces from iraq the house approved the resolution by vote of 256153 the following week the senate debate d iraq policy in floor action on the fy2007 defense authorization bill on june 22 the senate rejected two amendments on iraq policy one by senator levin callin g for phased reduction of troops to begin this year rejected by vote of 3960 and another by senator kerry calling for withdrawal of most forces by july 1 2007 rejected by vote of 1386 in addition to iraq policy other issues have emerged what follows is list of selected issues that have come up as debate about the fy2007 defense budget has progressed funding cuts in the regular fy2007 defense appropriations bill last year congress trimmed 44 billion from the regular fy2006 defense appropriations bill and pplied the money to nondefense appropriations later at the end of the process congress trimmed defense appropriations by an dditional 41 billion as part of an acrosstheboard 1 cut in all appropriations as an offset for katrinarelated funding this year the senate took step to avoid similar guns versus butter tradeoffs in the fy2007 budget by adding 37 billion to the budget resolution sconres 83 cap on total discretionary spending as last ear there appears to considerable amount of opposition in congress to proposed cuts in nondefense appropriations and the defense bill may be seen as source of offsetting funds because of the amount of money available for defense in emergency fundi ng for overseas operations limits on emergency funding the senatepassed fy2007 budget resolution sconres 83 puts cap of 90 billion on total emergency funding war costs including 50 billion that the administration plans to request as an attachment to the regular fy2007 defense appropriations bill plus later emergency fy2007 supplemental request expected next february together with requests for funds for katrinarecovery bird flu border security agricultural disaster relief and other purposes will almost surely exceed the cap by substantial amount if cong ress ultimately approves such cap anything above 90 billion would require offsetting rescissions including quite likely cuts in regular defense funding providing full funding for overseas operations in regular defense funding bills both last year and the ear before the senate added sense of the senate language to the defense appropriations bill

the lowest pay raise since 1994 there is considerable sentiment in congress to provide more increased tricare fees and copays for under65 retirees there is also considerable sentiment in congress against the administrations proposed increases in fees and cop ays for tricare for retirees the administration argues however that rising medical benefits threaten to drive up military personnel costs s ubstantially and that concern has gained some traction in congress7 flexibility for the defense department to provide support to foreign nations the defense department made number of legislative proposals to expand its flexibility to provide various kinds of support to foreign nations that in the past have generally been provided through foreign assist ance programs several of these proposals expand or make perman ent temporary measures that congress has approved in bills providing funds for operations in iraq and afghanistan the most expa nsive dod proposal is to permit the secretary of

growth in weapons programs by requiring that the defense partment report changes compared to original estimates of the costs rather compared to periodically rebaselined program estimates the result

defense total the senate also approved an amendment by senator lott to add 37 billion to the enforceable cap on total discretionary fundi ng this was intended to avoid cuts in defense appropriations as offsets for hi gher levels of non defense spending the senate measure also put limit of 90 billion on total emergency funding in fy2007 which is substantially below the amount that appears likely to be requested to finance ongoing military ope rations and domestic disasterresponse commitments this effort in the senate to place constraints on emergency spending may become major issue when

armed services committee bill among the very broad range of issues that the house authorization bill addressed few major point s stand out one is that the house armed services committee appeared to have put somewhat more emphasis than dod on maintaining current military capabilities than on pursuing longterm defense transformation this was particularly true for some programs in which the risk of delays and cost growth in weapons development appears high httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs22 the committee seemed more inclin ed to support the current army modularization program for example than to continue investing increasing amounts in the future combat system similarly the committee slightly trimmed higher risk missile defense technologies in favor of more immediately deployable systems and the committee continued as it did in past ears to cut funding for satellite programs that may be seen as reaching too far ahead with tec hnologically risky approaches though cuts in the transformational communications sate llite tsat and the space radar were not nearly as large as c ongressional cuts in the past two years another key point is that the committee supported larger army marine corps and army national guard endstrength than the administration wants this may have very large longterm budget implications also as in the past the committee was reluctant to support proposed cuts in weapons programs it did not agree to lt production of the c17 cargo aircraft for example and it restored funds to develop an alternative second engine supplier for the f35 joint strike fighter the committee also did not fully support administration proposals to rein in the cost of personnel pay and bene fits and it added substan tial new health benefit for reservists the committee increased th proposed milita ry pay raise from 22 to 27 it rejected the dod proposal to redu ce health care costs by increasing under 65 retiree medical fees and copays and it made all reservists except federal employees covered by the government health insurance program eligible to enroll in the tricare medical insurance program with fee of 28 of the cost the committee did approve one measure to increase copays for some prescription drug purchases significantly the committee did not approve number of administration proposals to give regional combatant comma nders greater authority and resources to build the capabilities of foreign military forces the senate armed services committee in contrast appr oved most of the administr ations proposals although with some restrictions finally the committee slowed down two programs that might be seen to have negative international diplom atic consequences one to develop laser that might be used as an antisatellite weapon and the other hi ghprofile administration proposal to convert some trident ii miss iles to carry conven tional nonnuclear warheads highlights of committee action include 50 billion bridge fund for overseas operations the committee approved 50 billion in emergenc funding for costs of military operations in iraq afghanista n and elsewhere in fy2007 in fy2006 total costs of overseas ope rations were almost 120 billion so average monthly 12 billion if that rate continues the bridge fund will cover costs for the first five months of fy2006 that is through january 2007 additional funds will then be needed to cover costs for the remaining seven months of the yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs23 ground force endstrength the committee bill increased army endstrength by 30000 to 512400 nd marine corps endstrength by 5000 to 180000 the bill also authorizes funding for an end strength of 350000 for the army national guard 17000 above the request endstrength may be major dispute between congress and the administration this year pay raise the bill provided pay raise of 27 for uniformed personnel rather than the 22 requested tricare fees and copays for under65 retirees the bill rejected increases in

who were unemployed or who did not have access to employerprovided health insurance the committee action is especially significant because the house for the first time approved tricare for reservists

fy2007 defense authorization highlights of the senate armed services committee bill the senate armed services committee marked up its version of the defense authorization s 2769 on may 4 few themes stand out in the markup one is that the senate committee pproved 30000 more troops than requested for the army and 5000 more for the marine corps and also authorized 350000 troops for the army national guard rng 17000 above the number for which the army requested funding the house so approved the same higher endstrength for ground forces so congress did not agree with administration plans to reduce active ground forces to the preiraq level the senate committee also undertook num ber of initiatives to strengthen governmentwide capabilities to engage in counterterrorism and stability operations one potentially farreaching initiative is to agree to an administration proposal to expand the authority of regional military commanders to train and equip foreign military forces and to provide humanitarian and other assistance to foreign nations these activities have traditiona lly been managed by the st ate department under legal authorities that include among other things human rights conditions in bills funding operations in afghanistan and ir aq congress has tem porarily provided some of this authority but the administration wants congress to write it into permanent law the committee restricted funding for the most farreaching measure to two years saying that the program it should be regarded as pilot project with an assessment to follow the committee also required consultations with ambassadors and did not agree to allow waivers of human rights and other restrictions on assistance the senate committee appeared more s upportive of the army future combat system fcs than the house committee and provided the full 37 billion requested for the program the committee did however mandate review of the program including an independent cost estimate of the program itself and of all associated army programs if the most recent army cost estimates for the fcs appear unstable congress may consider ending or subs tantially restructuring the program highlights of the committee markup includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs30 total funding the committee authorized 5177 billion for defense discretionary prog rams including 500 billion in emergency funding overseas ope rations and 4677 billion in budget including authority for dod doe and other nonemergency programs the total is 4 billion above the request and above the house authorization army and marine corps endstrength the committee authorized endstrengths of 512400 for the army 30000 above the request and of 180000 for the marine co rps 5000 above the request army national guard endstrength the committee also approved an endstrength of 350000 for th arng 17000 above the request and stipulated that if the army fails to recruit and retain enough personnel to meet the authorized level and m oney saved may be used only to procure arng equipment military pay raise the committee approved the requested pay raise of 22 rather than the 27 raise the house authorized tricare fees and copays for under65 reti rees as did the house the committee rejected increases in retiree tricare fees and copays the committee also required the government accountab ility office to carry out full audit of dod health care costs including comparisons of the administrations proposed fee increases with increases in federal civilian health insurance fees flexibility for dod to support foreign nations for counterterrorism operations the senate committee agreed to number dods proposals to allow regional combatant commanders flexibility to use dod funds to train and equip foreign militaries and to provide humanitarian and rec onstruction assistance to foreign governments in support of counter terrorism operations though with some amendments in particular the committee agreed to make available 200 million per year for the next two years rather than 750 million per year indefinitely to build the capabilities of foreign militaries the committee specified that more than 50 million per year could be used by an one regional combatant commander and required detailed c onsultations with us ambassadors the committee also required the president to develop plan to better coordinate interagenc counterterrorism practices with the appropriations committees cutting foreign operations funding for the state department and aid the fense department is in effect taking on many roles that the stat department formerly carried on detainee treatment the committee required an official governmentwide coordinated gal opinion on whether specified interrogation techniques constitute cruel and inhuman

and to give uavs preference in developing new systems navy shipbuilding the committee added 15 billion to the shipbuilding request for total of 12 billion increases include accelerating lpd procurement increased advance procurement funds for the cvn21 carrier and th lhar amphibious ship the committee included 50 million in adva nce procurement funding for longlead items for three new cvn21class carriers measure that the house committee specifically rejected in vote in the full committee markup permitting reduction from 12 to 11 deployable aircraft carriers the committee bill includes provision repealing last years requirement that the navy maintain 12 deployable carriers if approved this would allow retirement of the uss kennedy continued c17 production as in the house bill the committee bill rejects the dod proposal to terminate c17 production the senate bill authorizes funds for 2 aircraft in fy2007 and advance procurement for tinued production later army future combat system fcs funding as opposed to the house the senate committee authorized the full 37 billion requested for fcs development the committee also however required review of the program including an independent cost estimate though not with view to gono go decision as the house mandated readiness the committee used the 50 billion emergency bridge fund as means of adding funds to regular service accounts to correct some readinessrelated shortfalls the committee added 515 million in the emergency f unds for ex ample for navy operations 231 million for army operations and 106 million for marine corps operations so in effect the committee is ameliorating constraints on the regular service budgets by adding funds for regular military opera tions to the emergency fund acquisition reform the committee approved several measures to reform defense acquisition proce dures though none nearly so far reaching as the house committee m easure to recompete projects with excessive cost growth one senate committee measure is to align the tenure of program manage rs with the progress of theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs32 programs and another to require that incentive payments be more directly linked to acquisition outcomes land exchanges to build buffers around military facilities the defense department has long been concerned about the encroachment of civilian development on military facilities the senate committee approved measure to allow dod to exchange excess land for other land that would be buffer for military sites cooperative threat reduction with former soviet

details of the request but like the house shifted funds away from l ongerterm more risky programs to near term projects the committee added 200 million for groundbased midcourse defense gmd flight testing and 100 million for the navy interceptor system it cut 200 million from the 406 million requested for the boost phase kinetic energy interceptor space systems the committee expressed support for dods restructuring of the transfor mational communications satellite tsat program but trimmed 70 million from the program an 8 cut saying that it could not be executed the committee also cut 66

house appropriations committee bill the house defense appropriations subcommittee marked up its version of the fy2007 defense appropriations bill on june 7 and the full committee marked up the bill which became hr 5631 on june 13 among the committees decisions few themes stand out first in accordance with the committees 302b allocations the committee approved total 3776 billion in the bill 41 billion below the administration request the committee made about 2 billion of the cuts in general provisions of the bill of these cuts 823 million are in rescissions of prior year funds amountshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs41 20 this is also way of shifting costs that normally would be counted in the regular appropriations to emergency accounts tec hnically emergency funding is used to pay incremental costs of contingency operations ie expenses over and above the normal operating costs of the forces pay of mobilized military technicians is not an incremental expense of the operations identified by the committee in cooperati on with the defens department 949 million in revised inflation estimates and 100 million in savings from foreign currency fluctuations these are perennial sources of savings in appropriations bills they have generally been used however to offset congressional additions to the budget rather than to trim the total amount in the bill the committee also cut net of 11 billion from procurement 19 billion from operation and maintenance om and 12 billion from military personnel accounts while it added 21 billion to rd accounts of the cuts in military personnel 784 million are from projected underexecution of pproved personnel levels as reported by th government accountability office gao and 288 million from the air force to reflect shift of operation noble eagle costs which provides security at military bases and air defense overflights to the additional emergency appropriations in title ix of the bill in om 433 million of savings are from shifting operation noble eagle costs to t itle ix and substan tial additional amounts are from shifting to title ix funds for the regular pay of military technicians who are mobilized for overseas operations20 in the procurement accounts many of the committees cuts from the request are from following the authorization bill in shifting part of the requested amounts for several programs such as m1 tank upgrades to emergency war funds in title ix second the committee did not provide f unds for the 27 military pay raise approved in the housepassed authorization bill nor did it provide funds for increases in endstrength over the reque sted levels this avoided the need for any increases in the military personnel accounts compared to the request if the authorization conference report provides 27 pay rais rather than the 22 re quested the appropriators may then either agree to add funds to the bill in conference or instead require the defense department to absorb the costs and transfer funds from other accounts the committee approved an increase of general transfer authority to 475 billion in the regular bill with an add itional 25 billion in title ix to accommodate such requirements on endstrength levels the committee appears to assume that any increases will continue to be funded from emergency appropriations for war costs in fy2007 as they have been in the past on major weapons programs as is us ually the case the house appropriators generally followed the house authorizati on bill as in the authorization the appropriations cut 326 million from army

some procurement funds that were requested in the regular appropriations accounts to be funded with emergency funds for the war in contrast to the authoriza tion the house appropriators did not add

and instead shifted funds to add 12 fa18ef aircraft fy2007 defense appropriations highlights of house floor action traditionally house floor debate on the defense appropriations bill is very brief and although the bill generally comes to the floor with an open rule very few amendments are proposed this year however number of controversial amendments were considered on the floor including several proposals to strip specific congressional earmarks of funds from the bill the house considered the bill on the floor on june 20 2006 number of less controversial amendments were approved by voice vote including amendments by representative murtha to re store funding for the perpetually available and secure info rmation systems program by representative granger to delete provision in the committee bill that would prevent foreign sales of the fa22 fighter by representative castle to prohi bit award fees for performance that does not meet contract requirements by representative markey to prohi

app eals procedures andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs43 by representative holmes to prohib it the use of funds to privatize base operation support services at walter reed army medical hospital the house also debated and rejected several amendments on matters of us national security policy including meas ure to prohibit national security agency surveillance activities not authorized through the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa measure to prohibit military action against iran without advance congressional approval and measure to delete provision in the committee bill to prohibit the establishment of permanent ba sing rights agreement in iraq the measures that the house rejected include amendments by representative steve king to strike section 9012 of the committee bill which prohibits funds from being used to enter into basing rights agreement with iraq failed 50 376 by representative chocola to prohi bit the use of funds from being available for the development ployment

with the white house on budget priorities and to degree on the use of emergency appropriations to fund progra ms requested in the regu lar nonemergency defense budget the white house statement of administration policy sap on the house reported version of the defense appropriations bill21 issued on june 20 complained that the house bill cut 4 billion from the request and shifted about 2 billion fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs45 the regular base dod budget to the emergenc spending accounts in title ix of the house measure base funding requireme nts the white house said should not be shifted to supplemental bills as way to increase nonsecurity related discretionary funding moreover the sap warned very strongly in text th at was underlined in the official letter that the president would veto defense bill that cut spending too deeply if the president is presented with final dod appropriations bill that significantly underfunds the department of defense to shift funds to nonsecurity spending his senior advisors would recommend that he veto that bill emphasis in the original fy2007 defense appropriations highlights of the senate appropriations committee bill the senate committee version of the defense appropriations bill would make available 4535 billion for the defense prog rams in covers including 50 billion in funding for overseas operations an additional 113 billion is available as permanent appropriation for retiree medi cal benefits increasing the total appropriation for fy2007 to 4648 billion see table 2 funding cuts and caps on discr etionary spending and on emergency spending perhaps the most controversial issue in the senate bill is that the total amount is 91 billion below the administration request house cut of 41 billion in its version of the bill prom pted the white house to threaten veto if the final bill underfunds defense in or der to shift funds to nondefense programs the senate 302b allocati ons straightforwardly shift 95 billion from defense and military construction appropr iations to nondefense appropriations bills though usually remaining unspoken the premise of the senate and house 302b cuts in defense is that the cuts can be made up from funding provided as additional money for overseas ope rations so directly related issue is the extent to which the senate bill shifts funding from the regular fense appropriations accounts to title ix of the bill that provides additi onal funding for iraq and afghanistan the white house statement of administration policy sap on the house version of the appropriations bill also comp lained about this practice the white house estimated that the house bill shifts about 2 billion of funding from the regular defense bill to the amounts provided as additional appropr iations that are exempted from the 8728 billion cap on total discretionary funding in fy2007 the senate bill provides funds for many of the same programs as the house bill as additional appropriations including funds for m1 tank and bradley fi ghting vehicle upgrades to continue c 17 production and for v22 tilt rotor aircraft there is further complication in the nate section 402 of the senatepassed budget resolution sconres 83 1 establishes the 8728 billion cap on fy2007 discretionary funding 2 exempts fundi ng that is designated as emergency appropriations from the cap but also 3 sets cap of 863 billion on emergency funding in fy2007 the total was reduced from 90 billion in floor amendment the fy2006 supplemental appropriations b ill hr 4939 deems all of these requirements to apply in the senate in the absence of conference agreement on the budget resolutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs46 this presents problem for the appropriators however because costs of later emergency fy2007 supplemental request for iraq and afghanistan expected next february together with costs of katrinar ecovery and other disaster relief bird flu preparations border security agricultural disaster relief nd other purposes will almost surely exceed the cap by substan tial amount it will still be possible to go ahead with emergency funding for these pur poses but only with offsetting rescissions of funds for costs that exceed the cap as result the senate appropriations committee took step to reduce the potential need for offsets by declaring only part of the funding for iraq and afghanistan in the bill as fy2007 emergency funding within title ix of the bill only funds in chapter 1 military pers onnel and chapter 2 operation and maintenance are designated as emer gency funding exempt from the fy2007 caps these chapters provide 421 billion of the 50 billion in title ix funds in chapter 3 procurement chapter 4 rdte chap ter 5 revolving and management funds and chapter 6 related agencies whic h provide 79 billion are simply made available on enactment of the bill the effect is to have these amounts scored as fy2006 rather than fy2007 money this is the key point the additional 79 billion in fy2006 funds will not trigger point of order for exceeding fy2006 discretionary spending levels since room remains under the fy2006 budget caps due to the 8 billion acrosstheboard cut in appropriations that congress made at the end of last year other issues in the senate defense appropriations bill aside from the overall budget issues the senate appropr iations com mittee version of the defense appropriations bill addresses number of other key policy matters the 91 billion of cuts in spending come mainly in operati on and maintenance om 38 billion and in general provisions of the bill 26 billion see table 2 above within om the major cuts include 332 million in army depot mainte nance because of reduced peacetime requirement cut of about 13 in the 974 million requested title ix of the b ill provides 25 billion for army depot maintenance and another 25 billion for army reset which involves some similar maintenance at the unit level 245 million for an army p eacetime training

proportionately to amounts for proc urement rd and some other titles of the bill on personnelrelated policy the committee provided funds for pay raise of 22 though the authorization conference agreement may agree to 27 raise as in the house bill agreed to an increase of 30000 in army and 5000 in marine corps active duty endstrength though with funds provided in title ix the report does not explicitly make that point but the funding totals in title ix reflect amounts the ad ministrations estimates would be need for what it calls overstrength and provided 164 million to support an army

details on selected major weapons programs see table a5 fy2007 defense appropriations highlights of senate floor action the senate began floor action on the defense appropriations bill on the evening of august 1 and both the majority and nority leaders expressed the hope that the senate could complete acti on before adjourning for the august recess on friday august 3 on august 3 however senator re id said that as many as 50 democratic amendments remained to be addressed althoug h senator stevens argued that the senate should stay through the night in the end the leadership agreed to resume consideration of the fill when the senate returned on september 5 the senate took up the bill on september 5 and completed action on september 7 the most high profile debate when th senate returned was on an amendment by senator reid and other mocrats expressing the sense of the senate on the need for new direction in iraq policy and in the civilian leadership of the department of defense direct rebuke to secretary of defense rumsfel d the senate debated the measure for much of the day on september 6 though it was finally ruled out of order by the chair as not germane the largest substantive change in the bill on the senate floor was an amendment by senator stevens and senator inouye th chairman and ranking member of the defense subcommittee respectively to dd 131 billion in emergency funds to repair and replace equipment being used by army nd marine units in iraq and afghanistan between the time the bill was reported on july 20 and the time the it came up on the floor an ongoing debate about army and marine corps readiness became increasingly heated in june army nd marine corps officials testified to congressional committees about the estimated costs of res etting units to repair upgrade and replace equipment either worn out or lost in overseas operations or lefthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs49 22 technically the amendment designates the additional funding as

theater by units returning to hom the army estimated as yet unfunded long term reset costs of 17 billion and the ma rine corp estimated costs of 1213 billion in addition in july leaders of the army national guard have sa id that it would take 21 billion over the next few years to reset ground forces and to reequip the force to meet official requirement s for new modular units in response senators reed and dayt on announced that they would propose an amendment to the appropriations bill to add 10 billion to reset army and marine corps units returning from operations abroad this led senator stevens to work with dod and the white house on an alterna tive which ultimately became his and senator inouyes surprise 131 billion amendment the second largest addition of emergency funding was an amendment by senators sessions and kyl to add 18 billion for border security this was to fund fences and vehicle borders that the senate authorized in action on the immigration reform act s 2611 in may but that was not funded in the homeland security appropriations act hr 5441 now that the senate has pproved the funding as part of the defense bill the issue is 1 whether the defense bill rather than the homeland security appropriations bill is the proper vehicle for it and 2 whether and how to find offsets for the increased funding third debate on the senate floor did not involve large amount of money but nonetheless became quite contentious on august 2 senator durbin proposed an amendment earmarking 2 million in army rd funds for program to improve imaging of brain injuries senator steven s opposed the amendment arguing that the senate needed to limit the amount of mone it perennially adds to the defense appropriation bill for medical rd programs many of which such as breast cancer and prostate cancer research are at best only indirectly related to military requirements senator inouy supported senator stevens nd the senate tabled the amendment by largely partyline vote of 5443 subsequently number of veterans organizations complained that requested fy2007 funding for an armyfunded center for treating brain injuries was lower than the fy2006 level when the senate returned in september nator allen offered an am endment to add 19 million for brain injury programs between the time it began debate on august 1 and the time it passed the appropriations bill on september 7 the senate disposed of almost 90 amendments as is usually the case most of the ame ndments were noncontr oversial measures to add relatively small amounts for specific proj ects in action

of the conference agreement conferees announced an agreement on the defense appropriations bill on september 21 and issued conferen ce report on september 25 hrept 109676 perhaps the most contentious issue resolved in the conference agreement was the total amount of spending in the bill bo th the house and the senate appropriations committees provided less money for defense than the administration requested as means of freeing up funds for nondefense appropriations bills while still remaining under the cap of 8728 billion on total discre tionary spending in the house and senate versions of the fy2007 budget resolution the house trimmed 41 billion from the request while th senate cut 91 billion most of the reductions were made up indirectly with funding provided as emergency appropriations or technically in the house as funding for overseas contingency operations but the white hous objected to the process of in effect using emergency funds to offset defens cuts which in turn left room under discretionary spending caps to increase nondefense spending so in the formal omb statement of administration policy on the housepassed defense appropriations bill the white house threaten ed to veto the measure if it cut funding by more than 4 billion as means of allo wing increased nonsecurity spending the white house stuck to this position when house and senate ppropriators proposed compromise that would trim defense by about 6 billion in the end the appropriations conference agreement cut defe nse by 4 billion it remains to be seen how this will play out when congress resumes considera tion of nondefense appropriations bills after it returns in november another key issue resolved in the conference agreement was how to address complaints from the army and marine corps about shortfalls in funding to reset their forces that is to repair upgrade and replace equipment used in operations in iraq and afghanistan the services insisted that even the additional funding provided for reset in the 50 billion bridge fund for overseas operations in the early months of fy2007 was inadequate to meet their establis hed requirements in response in floor action on the appropriations bill the senate added 131 b illion in emergency funding to meet army and marine corps re set goals the conference agreement goes still further it increases the total in the bridge fund to 70 billion and according to figures in house appropriations co mmittee press release on the conference agreement it provides 171 billion for army and 58 billion for marine corps reset total of 229 billion the senate also added some other emer gency funding to the bill during floor action including 18 billion for fences nd vehicle barriers on the mexican border 700 million for counterdrug measures in afghanistan 200 million for intelligence programs to help capture qaeda leaders 65 million for predator uavs 20 million for help to peacekeepers in suda n and 275 million for wildfire suppression the

any fiscal year under this section unle ss the contract is specifically authorized by law in an act other than an appropriations actin addition the conference agreement re solved number of disagreements both between congress and the administration and between the house and the senate over funding for major weapons systems on some of the key weapons issues the conference agreement

provides 34 billion for army future combat system rd about 300 million below the request slows f35 joint strike fighter pr ocurement with funds to buy 2 rather than the requested 5 ai rcraft but does not eliminate fy2007 aircraft procurement funds as the senate bill did and also adds 340 million to maintain development of an alternative engine provides full funding for f22 pr ocurement in fy2007 rather than partial funding as the air force requested and so approves the requested multiyear procurement of f22s although the multiyear contract must also be approved in the defense authorization

an agreement on the defense authorization bill on the evening of ptember 28 the agreement was officially reported on september 29 nd approved by the house on september 29 and the senate on september 30 in the course of conference ne gotiations it was periodically reported that disputes over va rious measures were holding up final agreement one of the last issues to be resolve was reportedly whether to accept house provision that permitted military chaplains to offer pr ayers according to the dictates of their conscience conferees reso lved the issue by dropping the house provision but by including language in the report on the bill that requires the army and navy to rescind recent directives on prayer and return to earlier practices the defense authorization conference agreement

merit bit more comment tricare for reservists the conference agreement allows non deployed as well as mobilized reservists with the exception of federal employees eligible for the federal health benefits plan to sign up for health insurance through the dodrun tricare program with premium of 28 of the cost equal to the cost share federal employees pay for their insurance over the past few years congress has been inching toward this kind of measure progressively making tricare available to certain reservists the administration opposed full expans ion of access to tricare on the grounds that it was an unnecessary cost covering reservists who have access to private health insu rance congress has decided to go ahead with expansion of tricare eligibility anyway army and marine corps endst rength for fy2007 congress has for the third year in row appr oved higher army and marine corps endstrength than the administration wants this has not yet had any great budgetary impact first b ecause the cost of additional end strength has been paid with em ergency supplemental funding rather than within the regular defe nse budget and s econd because dod has not been able to recruit up to the full target level in any event it remains however harbinger of disputes in the future that could have major budget implications both the services clearly want additional personnel the issue is whether congress will agree to permanent increase in the defense budget tp pay for it or whetherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33405crs60 costs will have to be absorbed this year congress has also set targets for further increases in endstrength in fy2008 and fy2009 amendments to the insurrection act the conference agreement accepted substantial senate ame ndment to chapter 15 of title 10 us code
