eligibles are more likely than other medicare beneficiaries to be in fair or poor health cognitively and or functionally impai red and have more chronic ailments and conditions the medi caid and medicare programs that provide services to dual eligibles are administered by different units of government guided by different laws and regula tions and cover different set of services for these individuals these differences can lead to fragmentation and inefficiencies some federal and state polic ymakers have tried to address these challenges and develop coordinated andor integrated approach to delivering medicare and medicaid services through managed care th program of allinclusive care for the elderly pace as well as state progra ms in arizona mass achusetts minnesota new york texas and wisconsin are some of the managed care programs discussed in this report recently the medicare modernization act pl 108173 established the medicare special needs plan snp option which was intended to improve care coordination and service delivery for cer tain groups of medicare beneficiaries under the snp option medicare managed care plans are allowed to limit enrollment to certain types of beneficiaries such as dual eligibles snp plans may choose to better coordinate the care of dual eligible s by contracting with the state medicaid agency to also provide medicaid services but snp plans are not required to do so it is too soon to tell the extent to wh ich the new snp option will actually increase participation in integrated medicaremedicaid managed care plans there are variety of challenges in developing enacting and implementing integrated medicare and medicaid programs the specific circumstances will vary by state but some of the challenges have included reconciling conflicting operational requirements between medicaid and medicare ensuring sufficient experience of managed care plans with the needs of dual eligibles and addr essing provider and beneficiary resistance to managed care th and other challenges are discussed in this report finally this report describes policy consid erations and legisla tion that have been introduced in this area during the last several sessions of congress recent interest in integrated managed care suggests that the 110th congress may consider expanding these plans to promote more efficient and costeffective delivery of health care for dual eligibles this re port will be updated to refl ect significant policy or programmatic changes at the national levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33495contents introduction 1 r t i n l

introduction this report discusses effort s to improve the delivery of health and longterm care services for nearly 7 million indivi duals nationwide who are enrolled in both medicare and medicaid know n as dual eligibles1 there are several subcategories of dual eligibles although all duals receive medicarecovered services some receive full medicaid benefits and others receive only assistance with medicare cost sharing this report is focused on thos dual eligibles who receive both medicare benefits and the full range of medicaid benefits offered in their state dual eligible beneficiaries are generally elderly or have significant disabilities and are more likely than other medicare bene ficiaries to be in fair or poor health cognitively andor functionally impaired and have more chronic ailments and conditions dual eligibles also use disproportionate share of medicare and medicaid services in 2002 the most recen t data available dual eligibles accounted for 16 of medicare beneficiaries and 22 of medicare spending2 for medicaid based on fy2003 data dua l eligibles comprised 13 of medicaid beneficiaries and 41 of medicaid expenditures3 the medicare and medicaid programs ar administered by different units of government guided by different laws nd regulations and cover different set of services which can lead to fragmentati on confusion and inefficiencies in the delivery of services for dual eligibles medicare is federally administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms medicare generally covers primary and acute care services eg physician hospital and limited set of long term care services eg postacute shortterm stays in skilled nursing facilities and postacute home health care services starting january 1 2006 medicare also began offering voluntary prescription drug cove rage under new part d benefit dual eligibles were required to switch from medicaid to the new part d benefit to receive their prescription

medicaid primer by elicia j herzmedicaid is meanstested program administered by each state within broad federal guidelines medicai d benefits include primary and acute medical services as well as longterm care service within broad federal guidelines each state may define its own package of covered medical services resulting in considerable variation in the types of services covere d across states in addition to choosing whether service is covere d states may also limit the amount duration or scope of service meaning that they can limit the num ber of hours days or type of coverage for particular service for example state may specify that payment for inpatient hospital services cannot exceed 40 days of coverage in 12month period5 for dual eligibles if service is c overed by medicare and medicaid medicare is the primary payer medicaid pays for services above and beyond what medicare covers referred to as wraparound cove rage medicaid may also cover some beneficiary costsharing associated with particular medicare services for medicaid benefits that are not covered by medicare such as certain longterm care services medicaid covers the cost of these benefits unless there is

at httpwwwkfforg medicaidbenefitsindexjspcfid5623668cftoken81000927 some federal and state polic ymakers have tried to addr ess the challenges of the fragmentation in medicare and medicaid servi ces by developing coordinated andor integrated approach to delivering both medicare and medicaid services through managed care this report 1 explains the rationale for integrated managed care programs and describes the va rious approaches to integration 2 reviews existing medicaremedicaid integration projects 3 outlines common challenges faced in developing these projects and 4 provi des policy considerations for congress rationale for integration through managed care as described above the medicare and dicaid services that dual eligibles receive do not blend seamlessly with one anot her the programs almost always have different eligibility requirements and scope of coverage for the same or similar services as shown in table 1 above in some cases there are incentives for providers and payers to shift costs from one program to another eg moving an individual from medicaidfunded nursing home to medicarefunded hospital stay when an individual could have remained in nursing facility for treatment or unnecessarily placing an individual enrolle d in medicare managed care plan in ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33495crs5 medicaidfunded nursing fac ility which may save do llars for one program but generate higher total expe nditures on an individual than without the costshifting possible results of this fragmentation can include providers lacking information about the full range of services someone receives which could compromise health care decisionmaking and health outcomes fragmentation can also lead to cost inefficiencies in dicare and medicaid as well as be neficiary confusion about what is covered and by whom to improve coordination between medicare and medicaid one approach has been to integrate these two programs th rough managed care under managed care single entity managed care organization mco receives two fixed predetermined monthly payments ie th capitation rates these payments include one made by cms on behalf of the medicare progra m and the other made by the medicaid agency on behalf of the medicaid program there are different types of integration plans some plans veloped by federal and state policymakers cover the full ra nge of medicaid bene fits others have excluded certain medicaid benefits from ma naged care eg longterm stays in nursing facility the managed care plans may also establish various clinical care coordination efforts to further integrate rvices and address an individuals health care needs such as developing an interdis ciplinary care team examples of federal and state projects that integrate medicai d and medicare are provided later in this report the advantages cited by policymakers for integrating medicare and medicaid under managed care program are provi ded below readers should note that medicaremedicaid integrati on projects are not the only method of achieving these program improvements reducing fragmentation and impr oving service coordination removing the incentive to costshi ft from one program to another and increasing care accountability enhancing the quality of care and improving health outcomes increasing flexibility in the types of services that can be provided to beneficiaries focusing on prevention and care coordination activities in deliveringhealth care services reducing hospitalization and nursing home use with more emphasis placed on home and communitybased supports and creating budget predictability fo r state medicai d agencies particularly in preparation for demographic changes with the aging of the population though supporters of integrated medi caremedicaid project s have cited many advantages managed care is not without opposition as discussed in more detail later in this report provide rs may have concerns about the additional requirements or financial impact of opera ting under managed care environment beneficiaries may be concerned that their ability to select provider will be restricted or they may have to change providers that cost c onsiderations by the managed care plan willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33495crs6 6 in this report the discussion of managed care plans includes pace programs because they operate under capitated payment

ledownloadsstateguidepdfreduce the quality and availability of services and that the contracted managed care plans and available providers may lack knowledge and experience with the needs of dual eligibles many of whom have chronic health care conditions types of integration and federal authority the integration of medicare and medicaid can occur through various contractual arrangements between the federal and state governments and the mco6 in some cases the state will initiate an integrated medicare and medicaid program require that medicaid managed care plans also become medicareapproved plans and develop contractual rela tionship or agreement with cms to coordinate both medicare and medicaid requirements eg memorandum of agreement between the state and cms in other cases the managed care plan initiates an integrated medicare and medicaid program without c oordinated effort by cms and the state to streamline the requirements of medicaid and medicare operations7 in cases where the managed care plan is initiating the integration project the state and cms must still be willing to contract with and work with the plan to successfully implement the project most managed care programs in medicaid and medicare including medicaremedicaid integration projects requi re some form of federal approval under one of several possible authorities certain types of federal approval will occur more quickly than others brief discussion of each managed care authority is provided below as well as the program options for managed care for dual eligibles under medicaid managed care programs are available using the following program authorities prepaid health plans these are generally used if state wants to include only few services in managed care plan enrollment in the

accepted service delivery system for many medicaid beneficiaries in june 2004 only three states alaska new hamp shire and wyoming did not enroll beneficiaries in some form of medi caid managed care in june 2004 61 of medicaid beneficiaries were enrolled in some form of managed care many states 23 in june 2004 however continue to exclude dual eligibles from managed care enrollment11 nationwide about 35 of dual ligibles in fy2003 the most recent data available were enrolled in some form of medicaid managed care program12 see figure 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33495crs9 13 p saucier et the past present and future of managed long term care medstat and the muskie school of public service submitted to the department of health and human services apr 2005 hereafter cited as p saucier et managed long term caregenerally states have limited the covered benefits under medicaid managed care to acute and primary care services eg physicians hospital few states however also deliver longterm care rvices through managed care in 2004 an estimated 23 of individuals receiving long term care were recei ving these services through managed care including both dual eligibles and nondual eligibles13 because nearly 70 of medicaid expenditure s for dual eligibles is spent on longterm care services states developing integr ated medicaremedicaid programs have significant financial incentive to include longterm care services in the scope of covered benefits unde r managed care where their exposure to expenditures is limited to monthly capitation payment however as discussed in more detail later in this report most managed health care companies have limited experience in managing longterm care services under medicare though managed care op tions have been available under the program since the early 1980s the percentage of medicare benefi ciaries enrolled has been much lower than that of medicaid since enrollment in managed care must be voluntary to encourage enrollment some

and the methodology to set the capitation payment rate vary widely by state most states issue request for proposal rfp that outlines the featur of the proposed managed care program eg covered

the state selects the managed care organizations and awards it medicai d managed care contract to provide the medicaid services specified in the rfp often states enter into multiyear contracts with these organizations some states allow for public comment period while developing an rfp others do not the process for establishing the capitati on rates for medicaid also varies widely by state federal law and regulation require that the capitation payments meet an actuarial soundness requirement and are approved by cms so long as the capitation payment meets these two requireme nts the state has significant amount of flexibility in how it establishes and negotiates the payment rates for specific year for example states may use different data sources to establish baseline medical costs or different factors to account fo r medical inflation among providers some states adjust the payment rates to account for disability or ins titutional status or pregnancy others only consid er

eligibles were moved from the medicare fee forservice system into medicare snp starting on january 1 2006 individuals could opt out of passive enrollment and switch to another prescription drug plan and back to the medicare feeforservice system for other medicare services the passive enrollment process significantly increased the level of beneficiary participation in single plan with both medicare and medicaid contract some of these plans are making concerted effort to integrate medicare and medicaid services18 the snp market is in the early stages of development in 2006 276 snps participated with plans available in some areas of 41 states and puerto rico most of the snp plans in 2006 focused on dual eligibles19 however it is unclear how many of the snp plans are contracting with both cms and state medicaid agency or intend to do so in the future and to what extent the medicare and medicaid services are delivered in an integrated manner summary of medicaremedicaid

specific site that is also an adult day cen ter but may also be supplemented by in home services or referrals22 the medicare capitation payment methodology for pace differs from the methodology used for other medicare adva ntage organizations discussed earlier in this report the medicare capitation payment for pace is based on combination of two formulas 1 county rate multiplied by uniform demographic pace frailty adjuster to account for functional limita tions such as eating or walking and 2 riskadjusted payment methodology us ed by the general medicare advantage program23 the medicare capitation payment for pace along with three state integration projects discussed later in this report is in the process of transitioning to the methodology of the overall medi care advantage program based on 100 risk adjustment cms is still determining whether an additional frailty factor will be applied to all medicare advantage plans in the future under the medicaid program the monthly capitation rate is negotiated between the pace provider and the state medicaid agency and is specified in the contract between them24 because pace enrollees regularly attend adult day centers where pace services are provided and because of the interdisciplinary staffing model most pace sites are generally implemented in urban areas and enrollment is limited to few hundred individuals at each

different organizational units of the plan the scope of services may also differ plans in the states discussed earlier are providing and integrating both acute and some longterm care services however plans in other states may be solely focused on integrating acute care services with longterm care services still provided through the medicaid feeforservice system finally private nonprofit

and medicaid programs have been somewhat limited in the length of the evaluation period but have generally evaluated broad range of topics eg cost utiliza tion consumer satisfac tion this report focuses on the available outco mes related to service utiliz ation cost and mortality generally evaluations of medicareme dicaid integration projects have shown decreased utilization of highcost services such as emergency room hospital and nursing facility services and increased access to home and communitybased long term care services evaluations of the fiscal impact of these programs have been inconclusive in some cases expenditures were higher than feeforservice comparison group in other cases the net co st was comparable there were savings to medicare that were offset by higher medicaid expenditures42 in the area of mortality results were mixed in evaluations of pace and the wpp program the mortality rates for pa ce enrollees and younger adults with disabilities in wpp were

medicaid programs though specific ci rcumstances will vary by state and by program46 the description of challenges is not intended to presuppose that managed care is preferable to the traditional feeforservice approach while reducing fragmentation of services and increasing care coordination seem to be worthy policy goals other factors eg freedom of choice in ones provider must also be evaluated47 level of state investment and expected returns on investment though states may see benefit from the greater budget predictability and accountability through managed care the availa ble studies indicate that cost savings for dual eligibles will likely be realized by medicare andor the managed care plan because of the lower u tilization of primarily medicarefunded services eg emergency room inpatient hospital and s hortterm nursing facility stays and the increased utilization of medicaidfunded home and communitybased long term care services eg personal care and dicaid home and communitybased waiver services48 depending upon the structure of the program states may see some medicaid savings if there ar reductions in longterm nursing facility stays under these integrated programs or if the medicare capitation payment results in coverage of supplemental services that otherwis would have been covered by medicaid in addition to issues related to the impact of these programs on the medicaid budget developing medicaremedicaid inte gration projects takes substantial investment in state time and resources for the existing state projects that required federal waivers for medicaid under s ection 1115 or medicare under section 222httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33495crs20 the federal approval pr ocess took several years with the availability of the medicare snp option federal approva l for the medicare manage d care program may happen significantly faster than in the past for medicaid in states that are interested in pursuing integration projects in which medicaid enrollment would be mandatory or would have other features that require federal waiver the investment of time and resources may still be considerable for integration projects with voluntary enrollment federal approva l may happen more quickly because of the various medicaid managed care opti ons under the state plan beyond the time it takes to receive federal approval fo r integrated programs state may also need to become familiar with the medicare managed care rules and regulations and may have to determine how to structure the delivery of longterm care services in managed care environment eg service requirements quality assurance mechanisms availability of qualified plans rate setting and compatibility with states existing home and community based waiver programs under section 1915c of the social security act though many states are familiar with the delivery of acute care services via managed care fewer states have experience with managed longterm care services which has different infrastructure set of providers and constituencies than the acute care system conflicting medicare and medicaid requirements other significant challenges include the conflicting requirements between medicare and medicaid law and the di ffering requirements for program administration such as enrollment and dise nrollment policies be neficiary marketing grievance and appeal processes payment schedules quality requirements oversight and data collection these conflicts in some cases pose barriers to operating integrated medicaremedicaid programs recently cms states and other technical assistance providers have been working to address these conflicts by identifying specific areas of conflict and posing administrative solutions some areas can be addressed by cms through its administrative or regulatory authority and other areas may require legislation to resolve the issues for example integrated medicaremedicaid managed care plans are subject to separate auditing require ments under medicare s conducted by cms or cms contractors and medicaid as conducted by the state medicaid agency andor the state health department cms and the state could consider streamlining or coordinating the audits to make the process more efficient once these issues are addressed second step will be to ensure that there is consistent application across cms regional offices since some of the d ecisionmaking authority for these types of programs resides in each regional office some of these issues have been addressed in administrative guidance issued by cms in july 2006 cms released several how to guides for states and managed care plans that are implementing medicaremedicaid integration projects the guides address the areas of enrollment marketing and quality and are intended to clarifyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33495crs21 49 see httpwwwcmshhsgovdualeligible04_integratedmedicareandmedicaidmodels asp 50 see httpwwwcmshhsgovmedicareadvtgspecratestatsdownloadsannouncement 2007pdf

separate administrative review process and have separate statutory and regulatory guidance managed care payment rates the ratesetting process for integrated medicare and medicaid projects may be difficult for some states to develop th state may not know the details of the medicare contract eg what the plan submitted as bid and what supplemental benefits the plan might offer states may have difficulty determining how the plans medicare managed care bid fits with what th state would be paying the plan for its medicaid services this is complicated by the fact that the current medicare advantage payment methodology is changing starting in 2004 ma payments began including riskadjustment factor calculated by the cms hierarchical condition category or hcc model the cms hcc model continues to be updated and refined50 another challenge is that while many states are familiar with setting managed care rates for acute care services they may not have experience in ratesetting that includes longterm care services which has different utilization pattern and different set of providers some questions may include the following how should the state account for individual differences in health status through risk adjustment for the elderly and those with disabilities how can available data sources be used to inform the ratesetting process for longterm care51 in addition states may want to build certain policy incentives into the rates for example to serve individuals in the community instead of in an institution addressing these issues may pose challenge for some states federal waiver approval if the states proposed program requires waiver of medicaid law primarily for those programs with mandatory enrollment one of the challenges states face is how proposed medicaremedicaid integration pr oject can meet any budgetneutrality or costeffectiveness requireme nts associated with waiver generally budget neutrality or costeffectiveness requirements do not consider savings to medicare as offsetting any increases in medicaid expenditures the fiscal impacts of the programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33495crs22 to medicaid and medicare are evaluated sepa rately as described earlier it is not clear that medicaid costs decrease under medicaremedi caid integration projects willingness of medicare advantage plan to contract with the state medicaid agency some medicare advantage plans includi ng snps may not be interested in participating in riskbased contract for medicaid services such as longterm care these plans may focus efforts on solely delivering medicare services and rely on medicaid feeforservice to provide wraparound benefits the specific reasons will vary but some of the concerns in c ontracting with the state could include limited experience with covering longterm care which has different financial risks providers serv ice requirements and beneficiary concerns than acute care services limited familiarity or experience with medicaid contracting

managed care have received waivers from cms under section 1115 of the social security act which has allowed them to preserve upl funding 55 if the medicaid managed care program also includes nondual eligibles savings would accrue to medicaid since the services normally covered by medicare for dual eligibles eg hospital stays would be covered by medicaida certain amount of available capital in the organization and meeting minimum enrollment thresholds52 provider issues upper payment limit polic ies and managed care under the medicaid program states have broad flexibility in determining the payment rates for medicaid providers however the total payments to hospitals and nur sing facilities cannot exceed an upper payment limit upl which is the rate that medicare would have paid federal regulations outline the methodology states must use to report expenditures to ensure that medicaid expenditures do not exceed the upl limits some states have also used these upl provisions to draw dow n additional federal medicaid funding53 under current federal guidelines states are not permitted to collect this additional funding by applying the upl to medicaid managed care rates under managed care program states andor provi ders would be required to forego the additional federal medicaid dollars generated through upl funding arrangements this loss of federal funding could provide significant disincentive to states and providers to develop or participate in ma naged care programs54 alternatively lower inpatient hospital and emergency room utilization have been sources of savings for medicareme dicaid integration projects though these savings largely accrue to medicare for dual eligibles55 in considering these integration projects state will have to consider the following how much if any additional federal up l funding would be lost by implementing medicaremedicaid integration project what if any impact would there be on public hospitals what would be the expected cost or savings to the state budget in texas which was considering statewide expansion of its integrated managed care program the loss of federa l revenue generated through upl payments would have decreased funding to hospitals by approximately 75 million per yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33495crs24 56 httpwwwhhscstatet xuspubs022305_fippmcehtml 57

state agency or legislature to managed care plan58 or impose more requirements for payment than existed under the feeforservice system some of these concerns were expressed by the texas medical association tma in the recent proposed expansion of texas starplus excerpted below while physicians support elements of st arplus such as better integration and management of the continuum of care for eligible patients tma and local medical societies do not believe that another medicaid managed care model can be integrated into the system without causing it to collapse in areas with medicaid managed care already physician s and health care providers are already at their breaking points the expans ion of starplus or other medicaid managed care pilots will exacerbate existing medicaid provider shortages for example if expanded physicians in dallas would have to contend with star the physical health medicaid managed care program northstar the medicaid behavioral health pilot ch ip

certain medicaid be nefits eg vision dental maintained in the medicaremedicaid integrated senior care options program were cut from the feeforservice program making the integrated medicaremedicaid

devel oping integrated medicaid and medicare programs there may be opportunities for fu rther policy exploration it should be noted that action in any of these areas would need to be weighed against prevailing fiscal constraints effort s to ensure fiscal accountab ility since servicespecific utilization information may be less ava ilable under managed care and possible conflicts with other
