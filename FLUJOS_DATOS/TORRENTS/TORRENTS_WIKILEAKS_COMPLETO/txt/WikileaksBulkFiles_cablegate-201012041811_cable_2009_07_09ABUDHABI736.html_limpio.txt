alarm on iran classified by ambassador richard olson reasons 14 b d 1 u this cable contains an action request in 12 2 snf summary on july 15 treasury secretary timothy geithner joined abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammed bin zayed nahyan mbz and foreign minister sheikh abdullah bin zayed nahyan abz for dinner covering range of regional issues mbz expressed serious concern over irans regional intentions and pleaded for the us to shorten its decisionmaking timeline and develop plan b he encouraged the us to clearly communicate red lines to the iranian government on nuclear and regional stability issues with direct consequences for transgressions he painted to nuclear iran as an existential threat to the uae and invoked the well being of his grandchildren while urging the us to act quickly mbz asked for close coordination between the us and uae to deal with the iranian threat end summary 3 snf secretary geithner asked the crown prince for his views on the situation in the region particularly in iran geithner described the us strategy on iran including our intention to move forward with multilateral financial sanctions while waiting for iran to decide on its engagement with the us he also conveyed appreciation for the important support that uae provides to other regional trouble spots 4 snf mbz described nuclear armed iran as absolutely untenable he pointed to irans relentless ambitions to restore regional hegemony as evidenced by destabilizing interference in iraq lebanon afghanistan and palestine he believes that all hell will break loose if iran attains the bomb with egypt saudi arabia syria and turkey developing their own nuclear weapons capability and iran instigating sunni shia conflict throughout the world he said iran is surrounding israel driven by ideological conviction and will threaten israels existence should it go nuclear at the same time he described irans ambitions as reflecting desire to restore persias greatpower status rather than driven by religious convictions 5 snf mbz differentiated the long term threat posed by iran from other menacing states like north korea or syria where these other regimes were ruled by small cadres of corrupt old guard officials the iranian regime has raised its next generation to carry out its designs for hegemony as such the world will be dealing with irans destabilizing ambitions for decades mbz assesses that the iranian regime has emerged from the recent election strife stronger and more resolute 6 snf while careful not to suqyjqoworth iran mbz described near term conventional war with iran as clearly preferable to the long term consequences of nuclear armed iran without timely and decisive action by the united states mbz believes that israel will strike iran causing iran to launch missile attacks including hits on the uae and to unleash terror attacks worldwide in his view the map of the middle east would change he expects widespread civilian conflict to erupt as iran sparks sunni shia violence worldwide including the eastern province of saudi arabia which he sees as the greatest vulnerability along with iraq in the arab world he speculated that such an event could unfold within six months time and resolved that the uae is prepared to defend itself he believes that an israeli strike will not be successful in stopping irans nuclear program and therefore we need to plan 7 snf regarding the recent election in iran mbz cautioned that mir hossein musavi is different than ahmedinejad when it comes to their nuclear ambitions same goal different tactic in this respect he regards musavi as more dangerous than his competitor as at least ahmedinejad was an open book he reminded secretary geithner that musavi and his advisors are part of the same group that took the us embassy in 1979 8 snf mbz questioned europes basic understanding of the threat posed by iran and wrote off their resolve to deal with the situation he was appalled by top european diplomats that were unconcerned by the possibility of iran acquiring nuclear weapon he shared his theory that russia was trying to instigate conflict between the us and iran as means to weaken the us and drive up oil prices he suggested we could use russias narrow views to help persuade russia to join international actions against iran 9 snf mbz stated that financial sanctions would never be sufficient to stop iran but allowed that the us should continue with such measures to demonstrate to the arab world that we tried everything he pledged continued cooperation and support for international sanctions and encouraged further action in the and eu as well as the us 10 snf mbz suggested that the key to containing iran revolves around progress in the israelpalestine issue he argued that it will be essential to bring arab public opinion on board in any conflict with iran and roughly 80 of the public is amenable to persuasion to win them over the us should quickly bring about two state solution over the objections of the netanyahu government he suggested working with moderate palestinians that support the road map and forget about the others as there is time to waste 11 snf foreign minister abz urged the us to make better use of its allies in the region and engage russia and china in productive way on this issue wherever possible he urged clear and forceful messaging to iran and more regional gatherings ie p51 and gcc3 to increase pressure and isolation 12 snf action request mbz would like to visit washington in late july to discuss iran with president obama and other senior officials treasury and embassy recommend continuing the dialogue with mbz as soon as possible 13 sbu this cable has been cleared by andy baukol department of treasury acting assistant secretary for
