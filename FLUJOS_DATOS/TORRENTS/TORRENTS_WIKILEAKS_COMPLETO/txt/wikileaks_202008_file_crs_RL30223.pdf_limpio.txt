as selected since the met hod of review could have misse d some relevant instances but the proffered results are thought to be relatively comprehensive some of the votes are on procedural issues as indicated in the table rather than on the proposal itself the votes occurred from the 98th to the 108th congresses covering the period since the enactment of the impoundment control act during the 22year review period 1983 2004 at least 36 floor votes occurred on selected measures to provide the pr esident with expanded impoundment authority see table 1 the majority of these votes 23 out of 36

enrollment procedures the mattingly bills in the 98th and 99th congresses providing early examples of this approach required that each item of an appropriations measure ie any numbered section or unnumbered paragraph be enrolled as separate bill with this version of separate enrollment which again becam central to the impoundment reform debate in the 104th congress an appropriation bill is

expanded rescission proposal occurred before the 102nd congress adjourned in early october 1992 hr 2164 the expedited consideration of proposed rescissions act was viewed as compromise measure with
