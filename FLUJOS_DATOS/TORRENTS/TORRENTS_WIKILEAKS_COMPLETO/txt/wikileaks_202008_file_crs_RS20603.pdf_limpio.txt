cation objections were raised by parties opposing the transfer that the nce station would not be used prima rily to meet the educational needs of the community as cornerstones proposed programming for the st ation was primarily religious in nature in addressing this issue the fcc examined previous precedent in which it concluded that some religious programs could be characterized as general educational for purposes of its rules with respect to cornerstone the commission concluded that the broadcaster had made sufficient showing and deferred to its judgement that its programming although pr imarily religiously or iented would serve the educational needs of the community the additional guidance attached as part of the wqed application was issued according to the fcc as an attempt to clarify the requirements applicable to the programming of nce television stations set out in its rules under the guidance statement the commission noted that the requirement that the nce station be used primarily to serve the educational needs of the community was twofold with respect to licensees overall weekly program sc hedule more than half of the hours of programming aired must primarily serve an educational instruc tional or cultural purpose in the stations community of license to qualify as program which is educational instructional or cultural the program must have as its primary

nature5 the commission acknowledged that the discussion of religious matters during program that has as its primary purpose service to the educational instructional or cultural needs of the broa der community could be considered general educational programming for purposes of its rules6 however the commission noted that programming primarily devoted to religious exhortation proselytizing or statements of personally held religious views and beliefs would not qua lify as general educational programs7 accordingly while church services would not qualify as general educational programming under the rules such services which are part of an historic event such as funeral of national lead er would so qualify if the primary purpose is to serve the educational instructional and cultural needs of the entire community amid numerous complaints from religious broadcasters and members of the public the fcc issued subsequent order vacating its additional guidance statement8 the commission conceded that its attempt to clarify nce programming obligations and to apply the guidance to specifi c cases involving religious programming had created less certainty rather than more despite the revocation of its guidance statement there remains continuing concern over the administrative process by which th fcc set out the policy and the underlying premise apparently held by the agency that certain types of religious programming does not qualify as educational given the characterization of its order as clarification of its existing policy the possibility remains that the agency could apply these principles in subsequent proceedings involving the licensing of nce stations to religious organizations in addition the fccs ttempted imposition of quantitative programming standards the categorization of programming and the exclusion of certain types of religious programmers from eligibility for nce licensing raises constitutional concerns related to the free speech and free exercise of religion clauses of the first amendment9 hr 4201 the noncommercial broadcasting freedom of expression act of 2000 introduced by representative pickering on april 6 2000 hr 4201 seeks to clarify the

4201 would prohibit th fcc from imposing additional content based requirements on nce licensees namely quantitative standards based on the number of hours of progra mming that serve educational

provisions of the childrens television act and the requirements of the public broadcasting act12 moreover the bill exempts nce stations from provisions under section 312a7 of the act requiring broadcasters to allow reasonable access to the broadcast station by legally qualified candidates for federal electiv office also included are provisions to require public broadcast stati ons to be
