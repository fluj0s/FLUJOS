resources governor janet napolitano of arizona for example nt the dod request for federal funding to support the states deployment of national guard troops to the border after reportedly exhausting available state resources for combating illegal immigration and drug trafficking2 others view the increased presen ce of military support along the borders as undiplomatic potentially dangerous3 and further strain on already overextended military resources4 nonetheless the concerns over aliens and smugglers exploiting the porous southern border continue to grow and some now argue that the military should play much larger and more direct role in border security on may 15 2006 president bush announced that up to 6000 national guard troops would be sent to the southern border to s upport the border patrol according to the president the guard will assist the border patrol by operating surveillance systems analyzing intelligence installing fences and vehicle barriers building roads and providing training5 guard units will not be involved in direct lawenforcement activities and will be under the control of the governors the administration has indicated that the vast majority of the

drawn from the active and reserve forces of the military and from the national guard restrictions the primary restriction on military participation in civilian law enforcement activities is the posse comitatus act pca9 the pca prohibits the use of the army and air force to execute the domes tic laws of the united states except where expressly authorized by the constitution or c ongress the pca has been further applied to the navy and marine corps by legisl ative and administrative supplements for example 10 usc 375 directs the secretar of defense to promulgate regulations forbidding the direct participation by member of the army navy air force or marines in search seizure arrest or other similar ac tivity during support activities to civilian law enforcement agencies dod issued directive 55255 which outlines its policies and procedures for s upporting federal state and local leas according to the directive the following forms of direct assistance are prohibited 1 interdiction of vehicle vessel aircraft or other similar activity 2 search or seizure 3 an arrest apprehension stop and frisk or similar activity and 4 use of military personnel in the pursuit of individuals or as undercover agents informants investigators or interrogators it is generally accepted that the pca does not apply to the actions of the national guard when not in federal service10 as matter of policy how ever national guard regulations stipulate that its personnel are not except for exigent circumstances or as otherwise authorized to directly participate in the arre st or search of suspects or the

exception includes instances where the president is acting under implied or inherent constitutiona l powers is one the courts have yet to answer dod regulations nonetheless do assert two constitutionally based exceptions sudden emergencies and protection of federal property13 the pca also does not apply where congress has expressly authorized use of the military to execute the law

purposes including aerial reconnaissance and the detection monitoring and communication of air and sea traffic and of surface traffic outside the united states or within 25 miles of us borders if first detected outside the border congress placed several stipulations on chapter 18 assistance eg leas must re imburse dod for the support it provides unless the support is provided in the normal course of military training or operations or if it results in benefitsubstan tially equivalent to that whic h would otherwise be obtained from military operations or training15 pursuant to 376 dod can only provide such assistance if it does not adversely affect the military preparedness of the united states congress incorporated posse comitatus rest rictions into chapter 18 activities in 375 in 1989 congress began to expand the militarys support role for example congress directed dod to the maximum exte nt practicable to conduct military training exercises in druginterdiction areas and ma the dod the lead federal agency for the detection and monitoring of aerial and mar itime transit of illegal drugs into the united states16 congress later provided additional authorities for military

restrictions of chapter 1819 unlike chapter 18 however this w does allow support which could affect military readiness in the shortterm provided the secretary of defense believes the support outweighs such shor tterm adverse effect the national guard the national guard is military force that is shared by the states and the federal government and often ssists in counterdrug and counterrro rism efforts after september 11 for example president bush deployed roughly 1600 national guard troops for six months under title 10 authority to support federal border officials and provide heightened security presence20 under title 10 duty status national guard personnel operate under the control of the president r eceive federal pay and be nefits and are subject to the pca21 typically however the national guar d operates under the control of state and territorial governors in state active duty nationa l guard personnel operate under the control of their governor are paid according to state law can perform activ ities authorized by state law and are not subject to the restrictions of the pca because border security is primarily fe deral concern some st ates have looked to the federal government for funding to s upport some of their na tional guard activities under title 32 of the us code national guard personnel generally serve federal purpose and receive federal pay and benefits but command and control remains with the governor this type of service is commonly referred to as title 32 duty status and examples are discussed below according to the administration the deployment of the 6000 guardsmen derives its authority fro m 32 usc 502a which allows the secretary of the army and air force to prescribe regulations for national guard drill and training and 502f described below22 state drug plan federal funding may be provided to state for the implementation of drug in terdiction program in accordance with 32 usc 112 under this section the secretary of defense may

functions that overlap with drug interdiction activities arizonas drug interdiction plan for example recognizes related border issues created by human smuggling and terrain vulnerabilities with respect to the illegal entry of aliens into the united states23 by approving the state of arizonas drug interdiction plan the secret ary of defense has enabled the arizona national guard to engage in some border security measures other duty section 502f of title 32 has been used to expand the operational scope of the national guard beyond its specifi ed duties this provision provides that member of the national guar d may without his consent but with the pay and allowances provided by law be ordered to perform training or other duty in addition to those he is already prescribed to perform emphasis added this is the provision of law that was used to provide federal pay and be nefits to the nati onal guard personnel who provided security at many of the na tions airports after september 11 and who participated in katrina and ritarelated disaster relief operations states such as arizona have argued that the other duty language should be liberally pplied like it was for hurricane katrina and rita to include activities associated with border security efforts24 some question however whether domestic operations in genera l are proper use of this title 32 authority25 homeland defense activity in 2004 congress passed another law that could arguably provide federal funding for nati onal guard personnel c onducting border security operations under title 3226 chapter 9 of title 32 of the us code authorizes the secretary of defense to provide federal fundi ng at his discretion to state under the authority of the governor of that state for the use of their national guard forces if there is necessary and appropriat homeland defense activity27 homeland defense activity is statutorily defined as an activity undertaken for the military protection of the territory or domestic population of the united states from threat or aggression against the united states although deployment of national guard troops for border security purposes could arguably be an activity undertaken for the military protection of domestic population it is unc lear whether the porous natu re of the border or illegal entry of aliens is the type of threat or aggression that would be necessary and appropriate for national guard troops the state of arizona requested federal funds for its national guard under chapter 9 for th performance of homeland defenseborder security activities
