reports include crs issue brief ib95024 armenia azerbaijan and georgia by jim nichol background since becoming independent in 1991 azerbaijan has made limited progress toward democratization according to many international observers1 these observers have viewed azerbaijans previous legislative election in 2000 and presidential election in 2003 as not free and fair and have criticized human rights abuses that were committed after the latter race when the government forcibly broke up demonstrations and arrested many opposition party leaders these observers including international organizations such as the council of europe coe and the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce and countries such as the united states have cautioned the azerbaijani government that the conduct of the november 2005 legislative election would be taken into account in future relations2 under constitutional amendments approved in 2002 future deputies of 125 member milli mejlis legislature would be elected by single member districts for five year terms corresponding changes to the election law were approved by the azerbaijani legislature in june 2005 some in line with proposals from the venice commission of the coe these included making it easier for people to become candidates however the sitting deputies rejected some of the most significant proposals including more 1 us state department

marking hands to reduce multiple voting and allowing the many ngos that receive foreign funding to monitor elections the venice commission warned that without these proposed changes public confidence in the electoral legislation and practice would remain insufficient3 the campaign the more equitable and efficient process for registering as candidate resulted in some 2062 people being permitted to run of which about 17 were opposition party members 21 were members of the ruling yeni azerbaijan party nap and over 50 were independents or undeclared4 many independent candidates stated during campaigning that they were progovernment if not pronap the major opposition parties formed two blocs to try to avoid competing among themselves in individual districts these were the new policy bloc yeni siyasat or yes composed mainly of the national independence party and the freedom bloc azadliq composed mainly of the musavat popular front and democratic parties the opposition liberal party alp also fielded candidates in over 60 constituencies president ilham aliyev issued decrees in may and october 2005 directing central and local officials to obey the electoral laws httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22340 or face prosecution or dismissal the october decree also called for implementing some procedures advocated by the venice commission such as inking voters fingers permitting ngos that receive some foreign funding to monitor the race and investigating and resolving electoral irregularities quickly following president aliyevs may 2005 decree opposition candidates were less subject to harassment and sometimes were given permission to hold public rallies after twoyear ban some access to media was provided by law but beyond that public and ostensibly private media generally were biased against opposition candidates according to the osce opposition campaign materials sometimes were confiscated by local police although several large opposition rallies were permitted in baku and some other cities unauthorized rallies were suppressed 5 the most sensational event of the campaign was the failed attempt by rasul guliyev the head of the democratic party who had been residing in the united states for several years to return to baku on october 17 he had been permitted by the central electoral commission cec to register as candidate but the prosecutor generals office immediately stated that he would not enjoy immunity from arrest if he returned since embezzlement charges were pending against him three days after his failed return his plane reportedly was refused landing rights the government announced that it had arrested several officials on charges of conspiracy with guliyev to create confrontation stage riots and seize power by force weapons ammunition and explosive devices and substances were found and seized in different 3 coe european commission for democracy through law venice commission final opinion on the amendments to the

capital6 among the dozens of arrests or detentions were economic development minister farhad aliyev health minister ali insanov and presidential advisor akif muradverdiyev results the central electoral commission cec reported on the night of the election that there were few voting irregularities and the next day announced that the nap had won slim majority of seats in the 125seat legislature while opposition parties had garnered six seats with the rest won by independent candidates turnout was reported at 468 of 46 million voters about 40 of incumbents were reelected while arguing that the election was free and democratic president aliyev early on november 7 ordered the investigation of the few reported irregularities much harsher preliminary assessment was provided later that day by the international election observation mission ieom7 it reported that the progressive aspects of the race such as candidate registration had been undermined by government interference in campaigning media bias favoring pro government candidates and deficiencies in tabulating results8 an exit poll funded by the us agency for international development added to concerns when it seemed to indicate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22340 discrepancies between official election tallies and exit poll results in some constituencies perhaps in response to international and opposition party concerns and aliyevs november 7 order the cec appeared to reconsider its earlier stance and announced over the next few days that new elections would be held in four districts and that some recounts would take place in other districts on november 23 the cec submitted election results to the constitutional court for certification the four opposition members of the 15 person cec voted not to accept the final vote tally the court ruled on november 30 that new elections would be held in ten districts and president aliyev convened the new legislature two days later implications for azerbaijan some observers argue that president aliyev is committed to democratization as evidenced by his may and october decrees and his postelection dismissals of several regional and district leaders on charges of interfering in the race they view aliyevs pre election purge of his administration as increasing his appeal among the electorate that he backs reforms and as boosting votes for the ruling and other progovernment parties at the same time these observers assert that the small number of seats the opposition parties won demonstrates that these parties have failed to gain peoples trust because the 6 foreign broadcast information service daily report central eurasia oct 20 2005 doc cep27190 oct 21 2005 doc cep27213 oct 29 2005 doc cep30083 7 the ieom included representatives from the osce coe the european parliament and natos parliamentary assembly 8 although the observers assessed voting as proceeding smoothly in 87 percent of polling stations they visited they viewed

opposition lacks charismatic leader who could mobilize discontent opposition forces will not be able to mount revolution to overturn the government as such forces did in georgia ukraine and kyrgyzstan following elections viewed by many in those countries as fraudulent some of these analysts also argue that regardless of the governments or oppositions popular appeal the police and other security agencies are strongly committed to support the existing leadership9 aliyevs october purge alternatively might also be viewed as eliminating many of his political opponents some of whom may have been guliyevs supporters in this view the purge and the alleged electoral irregularities mark the governments efforts to suppress political opposition rather than to advance democratization10 other observers argue that the opposition parties may become stronger and more unified the cooperation of the opposition parties in holding nonstop protests in coming days could convince more people that the government is illegitimate and sooner or later contribute to defections from security agencies and successful revolution they suggest11 the main opposition parties continue to pledge to remain within the law in protesting the election and officials in baku have given approval for several opposition httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22340 rallies along with honest efforts to address electoral regularities such cooperation could nurture civil society and greater respect for the sitting government and the rule of law violent police crackdown on peaceful demonstrators on november 24 has raised concerns among many observers that political instability may increase while raising concerns about the election most international organizations and countries have not endorsed calls by some azerbaijani oppositionists for new election but rather have urged investigating irregularities and possibly holding some new constituency contests and punishing guilty officials they also have indicated that they seek continued engagement with azerbaijan to encourage it to democratize rather than economic or other sanctions against the government this approach was adopted by natos special representative for the caucasus and central asia robert simmons who visited azerbaijan in midnovember and urged it to increase its cooperation with the alliance statement issued by turkey on november 9 reflected another common international concern by urging azerbaijans government to rectify electoral irregularities so that democracy and stability are strengthened in the country possible sanctions had been mentioned by the coe in june 2005 when it warned azerbaijan that its membership status might come under review if the then upcoming election was deeply flawed members of pace who took part in the ieom were critical of the election process and some alleged that several districts where the constitutional court ordered new elections were those where opposition candidates had won the final

azerbaijani election as it waits to see how electoral irregularities are addressed indicating the importance the united states places on democratization in azerbaijan under secretary of state paula dobriansky stressed during her july 2005 visit there that free and fair elections would contribute to genuine usazerbaijan partnership based on shared values as well as common interests state department newsletter likewise stressed democratization in azerbaijan as core us interest13 this interest in democratization has been balanced by other important us interests including strong bilateral security and counterterrorism cooperation the advancement of us energy security progress in freemarket and democratic reforms and mediation of the nagorno karabakh conflict also the participation of us firms in developing azerbaijans energy sector is key to our objectives of diversifying world oil supplies and helping the country improve its economy azerbaijan has supported the global war on terrorism by sending troops to iraq and by offering crucial law enforcement and intelligence cooperation blanket overflight rights and the possible use of bases14 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22340 us officials and observers differed somewhat in their assessments of the outcome of the election with some viewing it as seriously flawed and others as partially or substantially progressive and in their policy prescriptions for bilateral ties state department spokesman adam ereli on november 7 2005 endorsed the preliminary conclusions reached by the ieom that there were major irregularities and fraud during the election that are of serious concern at the same time however he also appeared to reassure the azerbaijani government that the united states would not at this point make any specific linkages to what happened in this election to apparently higher us strategic concerns about issues that we need to deal with azerbaijan on energy security and counterterrorism and other economic political regional and multilateral issues he also stressed that us criticism was not wholesale indictment but call to investigate specific allegations the next day he stated that the united states was pleased that such investigations were underway on november 28 ereli strongly condemned harsh police crackdown on peaceful demonstrators four days earlier but also praised the governments actions to redress electoral irregularities on december 2 the state department praised the decision of the constitutional court to rerun elections in ten districts urged the government to further address electoral irregularities and reassured it that the united states would continue to cooperate with 12 continued report ad hoc committee to observe the parliamentary

crs6 it on democratization issues15 the administration generally has argued that even when governments falter in democratizing aid to support local ngos and other civil society initiatives should continue different policy response was suggested by the washington post which welcomed president aliyevs modest efforts to rectify electoral irregularities and suggested that the united states should continue engagement with azerbaijan on number of strategic issues it also argued however that the us administration should not reward azerbaijan for the flawed race with closer ties analyst vladimir socor provided more upbeat assessment that the election marked substantial commitment by the azerbaijani government to democratization and justified closer usazerbaijani ties taking more negative view of the election the international crisis group in late november urged the administration to ban visits by azerbaijani officials to the united states if they failed to redress election violations the ngo stressed that the administration should not subordinate its interests in democratization in azerbaijan to other strategic goals some observers warned that many azerbaijani opposition party members and supporters were upset that the united states had not more strongly criticized the electoral irregularities which could harm us ties in the future if more reformist httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22340 government comes to power16 congressional concerns many in congress have raised concerns about the status of democratization and respect for human rights in azerbaijan these members have argued that more democratic azerbaijan would be more supportive of us policy and would help to stabilize the south caucasus region including by reaching peaceful settlement of the nagorno karabakh conflict reflecting these concerns the house approved hres 326 gallegly on july 20 2005 which called for free and fair legislative race in azerbaijan similar legislation sres 260 biden was introduced on september 29 2005 an earlier version sres 226 had been introduced on july 29 and was approved in the senate on october 20 2005 also reflecting member concern representative alcee hastings who currently chairs the osce parliamentary assembly served as the coordinator of the ieom on november 30 2005 the congressional commission on security and cooperation in europe stated that the election and its aftermath resemble previous azerbaijani elections rather than signaling significant opening toward greater democratization17 congressional assessments of the results may influence the
