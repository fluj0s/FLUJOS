behavior of pc lecture given on 10 august 1961 thank you okay this is the 10th of august 1961 if pc dopes consistently throughout the goals assessment not getting lot together but running list by repeater technique does one keep on bringing him up to present time i should say not or does one go on repeating goals because one is addressing the reactive rather than the analytical mind very interesting probably requires an orientation on the what youre doing i probably ought to sit somebody down and take piece of his goals list and show you how you run it i mean that would be about the most satisfactory answer to this runs like this pcs audit whether theyre asleep or awake and youd expect response from pc of any kind whatsoever while you were doing goals assessment on the pc after youve gotten the goals he doesnt have to say anything nothing in the auditors code that says he has to say anything there is pcs code you can tear that out of book one i didnt write it in the first place written by john w astounding campbell jr who the older he gets the more astonishing he is and so on there is pc code the pc doesnt have to behave there is behavior factor involved and you ask this pc for some goals well hes supposed to come up with some goals and if he doesnt come up with some goals you hit him or kick him or do something with him and make him come up with some goals you understand pc has responsibility for the conduct of session thats it and dont expect that pc does have any responsibility for the conduct of session because he doesnt youre the auditor youre supposed to know what youre doing youre supposed to know what hes doing so you get the session going and you get him to run some goals and as soon as you get the goals on list you null them well he doesnt have to say thing he just doesnt have to say thing i read them over about three times and they look like theyre dying out and so forth i read them about two more times and theyre dead another goal i read it about three times it looks like its getting tougher i just skip it put it in as still there got the idea dont try to do anything else with that goal it looks like its going to stay so i just let it stay and i wont read goal more than about five six times anyhow if it doesnt null in that long period or that short period and so forth leave it youre in rush there is anxiety about getting these goals erased actually its quite invalidative to the pc for you to be in an anxiety about it and i think basically probably what youre trying to do in running goals is youre probably trying to get rid of the goal rather than just inspect the goal you expect the pc possibly to answer up or think about the goal or pay some attention to the goal while you are reading it any one of these things could be part of this same situation you see or youre running the goals assessment with the rudiments out which is highly probable or you dont pick up the arc breaks during the session you know theres something called interim rudiments you know pcs can get present time problems and things of that character while session is in progress and you see an arc break come up with pc well lets not fool around because i can tell you absolutely guarantee that small flub on an auditors part will blow up to become an arc break within half to one and onehalf hours you may not see it at the time it happens you may not see it explode but it will come up later oh you didnt know that huh haha i can see an arc break in session coming oh my god ages before the pc blows up ive listened to them over speaker systems and things like that you know and i look at my watch and i say well onehalf hour to an explosion well the explosions actually arent necessary you get an arc break and you dont handle it or the pc gives you an origin or you dont handle it or something goes wrong with your trs and then its not handled by some rudiments process you see and you can count on an explosion of some kind or another occurring sometime later but its the most interesting thing i mean it will be half an hour to an hour and half and there it goes well see there goes tr or there goes rudiment of some kind or another and then we say well it didnt affect him and nothing happened to him see so we dont pay much attention to it and then half an hour to an hour and half later all of sudden we get an explosion on some entirely disrelated and apparently quite different thing worth knowing isnt it now the safe way to audit is to patch up the pcs arc breaks whether they exist or not got that lets just make rule patch them up whether they exist or not and you all of sudden wont have pc going this far out when you think that the pc looks restive because you have flubbed an acknowledgement or something like that well just go ahead and insist that you have you see and take the thing up get it thats you then taking responsibility otherwise the pc is forced into taking responsibility for the session and of course the moment he takes responsibility for the session he goes out of session so that if you insist on your rudiments being in you can make frightful bore out of yourself and still be quite right you know the direction to err on the trs is to insist that they are out and the direction to err on the rudiments is to insist that theyve got to be patched up thats the direction to err if youre going to make mistakes make mistakes in that direction you can become pitifully boring as an auditor apparently somebody else listening to the session would say oh my god you know how horrible you know its like this the pc says well uh i did have goal uh yeah i had goal like that once uh goal to sell curtain rods and you say okay and he looks at you little bit oddly and you say well now do you know i acknowledged that and he says well i uh uh and you say well all right now what was that about curtain rods again and he says well i think i had goal once im not quite sure to have curtain rods to sell curtain rods i think it was and so forth and you say well all right sell curtain rods all right sell curtain rods thats good all right good and he says what was that all about you know but he wont cause an upset now this will cause an upset he says well i had goal once to sell curtain rods and you say good and he looks at you kind of odd and you say all right whats another goal taking goals list actually you dont know and sometimes he doesnt know whether hes had an upset or not but he might have thought that you didnt adequately acknowledge this goal to have curtain rods you see all right well this is going to build up and this is going to build up theres possibility that this will build up through the minutes through the tens of minutes and another little one hits you see and another little one hits all of sudden on some disrelated subject he suddenly has present time problem about his car parking or something you see this has flown in and before you have chance to handle it he insists that you didnt well the whole argument is based on this oddity about the mind the things that go wrong are not things that are known the known things dont go wrong its the unknowns and if youre looking for the source of an arc break you must look for an unknown area if youre looking for breakdown of session you must look for something that both you and the pc have overlooked you got that if you want to waste time take up those things you already know about all right ill show you very fast way here to patch up an arc break of some kind or another the pc says well i had goal to sell curtain rods and you say mmhm and the pc says did you get that you say mmmm and the pc says well sell curtain rods you know sell curtain rods all right now on the face of it now on the face of this situation it appears that your lack of acknowledgement at that point upset the pc this is the way it appears and remember this is universe of appearances and if all the appearances werent somewhat fallacious the universe wouldnt be here see theres little curves on these lines so you assume at once that it wasnt that acknowledgement yourself privately you can pay token to the fact that well you didnt acknowledge and werent terribly enthused about this horrendous goal that was going to wreck the whole universe about selling curtain rods but you plunge at once on the basis of was there an earlier goal i didnt acknowledge was there an earlier one i didnt acknowledge and he says mmmmmmm hell always find one you get what im talking about you give cheery ayeaye to what he just said and you think thats okay and you do acknowledge and you do handle that situation and then you go back and handle the underpinning which might have caused this later upset you assume that any time pc is upset theres been an earlier upset he hasnt demonstrated you got that its an unreasonable assumption perhaps but you will always find that he will find it it is an amazing mechanism the pc has an arc break about the fact that the window dropped by all means listen to the arc break about the window dropping but find the arc break that happened earlier and youll always find the earlier one and for some reason or other itll always blow out the window dropping and that makes for awfully fast auditing terribly fast auditing an auditor who is continuously involved in patching up arc breaks and patching up present time problems has just not been alert earlier in the session you see that just hasnt been alert thats all the auditor is the dopedoff one he hasnt been alert the auditor whos continuously involved and having to rerun rudiments and patch up those arc breaks and patch up those present time problems that occur during the session and that sort of thing there were lots of them that went by that he didnt notice and they finally culminated into an upset which interrupted the session you see what the mechanism really is here its those little first unknown upsets the notrecognized the notseen upsets which then build up into the visual ones the hidden upset is what youre really looking for so if you go and spend threequarters of an hour now on running the arc break about the window dropping or the lack of an acknowledgement or something like that youre being utterly foolish because it hasnt anything to do with it that was merely the one where it got so bad that the pc went out of session well where did he start out of session pcs never go at right angles out of session it would have to be really horrendous to get pc to go right angles out of session they drift off at about an angle of about twenty degrees to the session line you got the idea theyre little bit out and then little time goes on and theyre little bit out and theres little bit more out and then little bit more out and little bit more out and little bit more out and all of sudden it becomes noticeable but theyve been drifting out at twenty degree divergence from the course of the session here for maybe half an hour to an hour and half before they really went out you got it now if this happens early in the session you just start the session the pc goes out at right angles apparently oh well it was your session yesterday and you didnt pick it up got the idea this actually puts you in rather comfortable frame of mind it puts you as cause over the actual situation because youre not now in bad condition of thinking that you consistently do things that are bad as an auditor that causes the pc to get this upset and you can get yourself pretty upset as an auditor as matter of fact if you think that these things are actually what is upsetting the pc you see because you are going along the line of attributing the cause of your upset as an auditor to the wrong target see youre saying well my auditing incompetence is demonstrated by the fact that i didnt prevent the window from dropping suddenly you know i didnt protect this pc one way or the other well the actuality is is that the pc suddenly was that nervy and went out that suddenly and so forth your incompetence as an auditor is actually demonstrated by not picking up the little ones those little ones those little twenty degree departures from the course of session way back you see its quite interesting to take pc and you should actually run pc this way once severely to get the point very well subjectively but pc has an arc break pc dopes off pc goes any which direction but being interested in own case and in the session you know pc does anything instantly assume there was something happened an hour and half to half an hour ago or in the former session you see the second you see this out of sessionness you just make the assumption true or not that something went wrong yesterday or earlier in the session today you got it and you just go ahead and look for it and take them all up you see one right after the other go down the line exhaustively find out which tr and which rudiment and which where and when i was auditing you yesterday did you have present time problem see running rudiments for yesterday did you have present time problem while i was auditing you yesterday well not really did you have an arc break with yesterday oh oh i had arc break with you the needle drops you say well what was the arc break that you had with yesterday well i thought actually that you began the session rather abruptly well boy that is session and half ago dont you see now if you just as an exercise and to give yourself good reality on this thing if you start picking up out of sessionness which includes dopeoff see dopeoff is just another variety of going out of session flying out of the chair throwing down the cans or walking out of the room or doping off these are all methods of retreat arent they see theyre methods of get out of here so if this situation existed as it went along the line certainly something must have steered it there now the pc did want auditing and actually it takes considerable volume of reasons why he shouldnt have it it takes lot to push him out got the idea just as an exercise go back and track it arduously painfully painstakingly lose all the auditing time you want to lose doing it cause another upset with the pc as far as youre concerned youre doing it but if its causing an auditing upset with the pc ill clue you its there there is an earlier one there are several earlier ones if the pc is now upset that you are looking for them it is simply the fact that he is being restimulated by your looking for them and his restimulation is what youre getting the argument over got it so if you want to be real smooth auditor and have your pc always in session and always winning and always gaining stop concentrating on trying to be so alert and so much on the qui vive and so interested in the pcs case stop worrying about that worry about your mechanics make those things real good and assume that every time your pc departs from session either subjectively by doping off boiling off going unconscious retreating in that direction or attacking you as the auditor or actually blowing the session or starting to blow session just assume immediately that you are looking at chain of things that have foundation in the incident which seemed to bring them out you got that now just assume that and then go look for the chain and maybe it makes it very explicable to you here if i say dont fixate on the effect end of the line you see the pcs going out of session retreating subjectively or objectively either way if you treat that as cause of the upset of course youre going to lose because you are looking at the effect of something well what is it the effect of it is actually the effect of concatenation and the least youll get off the thing is lot of unkind thoughts on the part of the pc you see your pcs been doing something you know pcs had some disagreements here and there are some backflashes as you slide back down the line and look for this give you very example pc throws down the cans this is pretty extreme see pc throws down the cans and says well theres just sense in telling you one more time because you just arent listening to well now theres reason why you should at this point assume that this is factual the pc said it yes the pc has become aware of it yes but your assumption at this moment should be that theres chain and that is the golden datum that you are looking at chain and if you try to treat it as anything but chain you are not at cause crude sort of an approach which is factual and not usable but very crude would be what was the first time you tried to you thought you had better get out of this session that isnt usable statement but it is summation of what youre trying to do and you say whats the first time you tried to get out of this session in the first place its too accusative in the first place its too this its too that but thats what youre really trying to do pc throws down the cans you say what was the first time you tried to get out of this session have you tried to get out of any earlier session have you thought you should not be in any earlier session with thats what youre actually trying to do you see and boy that needle will start wiggling youll just be amazed you say well now you were sitting here everything was running along fine and lookahere all these arc breaks were occurring and i didnt even notice it and then thatll learn you that when the pc suddenly goes you know at you something like that pick it up you know pick it up right now and you say well was something wrong with that acknowledgement was something wrong with that situation there just now and the pc says oh you notice your needle drop right away same rule applies you noticed it so there must be hidden one and you say well is there any earlier time you disagreed with one of my acknowledgements oh yes except uh got the idea so if you always treat it as chain on any rudiment or tr breakdown for instance id be if about the fifth time that pc or the third time pc came into session with and had present time problem i would ask this pc some sort of questioning like this you know you say do you have present time problem and this is about the fifth time that this pc has had fall on this rudiment every time the pc comes into session here lately it apparently has pt problem well now the pt problem is this that the pc is having pt problems now theres several things that can be adjudicated theoretically and casewise you could adjudicate lot of things from this and you could actually trace the type of problem you could actually scout down his chain you could scout down his terminal you could scout down his goal just by what kind of present time problem do you have dont you see i mean theres lot of technical nonsense and foofaraw that you could go into like this you could make this very significant were not talking about that type of significance now were just talking about the fact that this is the fifth time ive noticed this pc have pt problem so i assume immediately that this pc has consistently been audited with pt problems in restimulation pretty good huh i just assume well all right this is the fifth time hes had one with how often has he had one with auditors have you ever been audited then i will say when you had pt problem doesnt make any sense to him so i say well have you ever been audited and you didnt think you ought to be having an auditing session boom well when was that good when was that good when was that good when was that one all right good when was that one good when was that one oh oh yes that one yeah that one that one there are only eight thousand times so the pc has gotten up to point of actually being audited when he shouldnt be audited and he gets present time problems theres curious mechanism i ought to talk to you about do you know that you can make somebody think they have done something by punishing them you know that mechanism well you can make reverses on all mechanisms work if there are any mental mechanisms you can pull the effect of pcs action on the pc and make him wonder if he hadnt caused you got the idea because its truth you know that he is at such cause over these things that those causes usually exist but supposing we took somebody and we shook him suddenly surprised him half out of his wits you see schoolboy and said well were giving you note to your parents for not having been in school yesterday and then would say dont answer back arguments on your part now and dont give him any chance to asis it you see and within half an hour hell wonder where he was yesterday you got the idea the other one is so grooved the cause effect of the person is so grooved that when you do something to him he thinks the cause existed in other words you can just give him the effect and the cause is apparent so you can override this asking for yesterdays pt problem to point of where hes absolutely convinced you see that he must have been causing things in yesterdays session that he doesnt remember now and itll cause mystery you get the idea so you have to kind of play it in between you dont want this other phenomenon occurring too thoroughly so be reasonable about it and dont overwhelm him dont do this in an overwhelming fashion do it in rather quiet fashion dont jump him too hard about this sort of thing for instance oh haw he says something like this and you say well didnt you think i got that acknowledgement and he said i dont think you did andor dont you think i got that origin i dont think you did and you say well now what did you say again and he tells you and you say well good and now if you leveled long bony finger at him and you said you realize that you have not originated once and had it arrive with the wrong thing to do you see the pc actually would kind of have sneaking notion that this was true so you have to approach it with the other angle and you say now as unlikely as it may seem have you originated anything else that i mightnt have gotten yes yes oh uh yes hell be just racing over these things one right after the other and hell finally pick one out now you say well is there an earlier one than that well and all of sudden we will usually run into one that is nicely deeply buried and its not now mystery you see you can kind of insist too hard that one existed and get him to actually believe that one might have existed but then not be able to find it you see and hed be left in the mystery that there probably was one there but he couldnt find it you know so you mustnt be too forthright you mustnt be too harsh i dont mean forthright go ahead be forthright but dont be harsh about existing you see now there certainly was one you know yes there was one there was one yesterday i know there must have been one because today you see you are arc breaky and there so there must have been one yesterday and ron says so you see and that kind of an attitude and the guy says was there one yesterday well there probably wasnt one yesterday i dont know whether there was one yesterday or not huhuhuhuhu if he says so it must be true and so forth and therefore there must have been one yesterday so it takes rather clever attitude on the auditors part it takes mild attitude you have to play this thing in the middle of the path you see could there have been one yesterday you know its that type of approach which you want could there have been an earlier one is there any possibility that this might have been the case huh oh except uh you see and one will turn up get how you do this all right down go the cans you say whats the matter pc says i shouldnt be here you handle that why shouldnt you be here handle it very briefly and have you had an earlier feeling that you shouldnt have been here in this session that i shouldnt have been here thats an odd thing i always feel like that you know and the pc starts tracing it back and he gets interested in this and so forth and may hit the first time he was ever audited and just before the session he said well maybe i shouldnt let somebody fool with my mind or something like that and always since that time his auditing has all been balling up on this one little early point his distrust in auditors this sort of thing will tend to come up one way or the other and you have actually then handled the situation and so your auditing will now be much faster so the answer to this didnt mean to go on like this at this length but the answer to this question is if pc is doping off you might be expecting too much of the pc or you might be expecting the pc to answer or you might be expecting something or other to happen but factually the pc has had some impulse to leave session so you better find it out and you better trace it back and look for chain dont look for an incident until you get way way back and you find out the first time goals assessment came up that he was very leery of telling anybody any of his goals and you get back to what i was talking to you yesterday there are lots of reasons why people dont want to give you goals because people just step on goals and you know all kinds of things and people insist you have goals so unless you clear up that sort of thing youre bound and determined to have somebody boil off out of session long goals lists you know these various other manifestations all occur from the same thing pc person has some feeling like he shouldnt be there and of course thats out of sessionness shouldnt be there out of sessionness interested in own case willing to talk to the auditor thats your technical observation of the person being in session so the person is insession he is interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor the person is not insession then theres feeling he shouldnt be there there isnt feeling that he shouldnt be interested in own case and shouldnt talk to the auditor you know these are not two sides of coin on one side of the coin is interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor on the other side of the coin is this entirely different thing which is shouldnt be there you get boiloff dopeoff everything else something has happened to convince him hes in the wrong place only it might have been in earlier auditing sessions it might have been with other auditors it might go way on back dont you see its good thing to run them down i dont care how much time you spend straightening out somebody or orienting somebody on the subject of auditing because its all gain so youve asked question here its unsigned but youve asked question here which had an answer which you probably didnt suspect which is that all boiloff and all dopeoff is blood brother to walk out the door throw down the cans arc break with the auditor its all blood brother and its shouldnt be here which is the reverse side of the coin of interested in own case willing to talk to the auditor come to think about it weve never defined out of sessionness and that is the definition of out of session we define insession but define out of session and it might make your auditing much easier the definition of course is unwilling to be there simple as that okay any other questions here today yes male voice could you give us some hints about dealing with stuck and sticky needles in rudiments and elsewhere dealing with stuck and sticky needles rudiments and elsewhere sticky needle means games condition person is in state of denial and so forth needle stuck persons stuck on the track always in condition of should be there shouldnt be there if we want to carry on the same thing we were talking about before only stuck on the track is should be thereshouldnt be there all in the same breath why is he keeping it mocked up if he shouldnt be there but nevertheless he shouldnt be there and hes keeping it mocked up because he should be there you could drive somebody stark staring mad you know if there were real honesttogoodness observable emergency going on such as building being bombed and telling him he ought to be inside rescuing the people at the same time convince him that he had better be outside to take care of them when theyre brought out well you could go worse than this and you should tell him the safest place is inside as long as he stays outside and person would go kind of mad so sticky needle is sort of shouldnt be theremust be there sort of situation and sticky needles are difficult to cure only to the degree that they betoken certain amount of outofsessionness just to that degree that the person is out of present time its not very serious out of sessionness its just that the person is out of present time hes listening to the arrows whistling on the walls of acre you see and he should be listening to the auditor giving the next auditing command and he gets distracted from what the auditor is doing and saying and to this degree which goes on continuously in cases there isnt anything you can do about that except audit them thats why youre auditing them so you get situation where the fellows needle is badly stuck he for sure would recover more slowly than if he were fully insession dont you get the idea so the more time you spend effectively in getting this individual insession the faster sticky needle will loosen interesting actually your effort to get him insession gets him out of where hes in on the track you see and it works very neatly theres worry about sticky needle so needles stick so they loosen its when needle is sticky and continues to be sticky and never loosens that you start worrying you never get change of setting and so forth because it means there isnt much case gain going on here notknow type of goals assessment you see i mean forgotten goals goals that shouldnt be known and if you ask somebody do you have any goals that shouldnt be generally known cowcowcowcow you get brandnew response on the thing type of goal of where would you like to be following this thing out have you ever had any goals of being places have you ever had any goals of not being places and you can loosen up somebodys needle wham wham wham wham wham see just run to be there not to be there off as part and parcel of the goals assessment and youll get into some very interesting responses on sticky needle of course if hes in place he shouldnt be in then he doesnt have any havingness is that right and if he has havingness why then of course hes got sticky needle and hes got lots of ridges and so on if persons needle was sticky on if i had person whose needle was consistently sticky on in an auditing session and i didnt seem to be able to do too much about it im afraid id start plowing it to them on the subject of withholds long duration present time problems find those hidden standards and put them in the security check and in doing goals assessment i would find goals that had better not be known you see its whole class of goals that couldnt be accomplished if they were known do you realize that in the banking world what do you think about the banking world supposing everybody knew the various goals of various financiers with regard to the swap and exchange of currencies contracts negotiable securities between here and switzerland game would blow up in time ill tell you symptom of that by the way that you might find quite amusing did you know that twentyfour hours before there is change in the bank rate that you cannot get call through to switzerland and that the telephone company always knows when theres going to be change in the bank rate and the exchequer is going to make an announcement because twentyfour hours before they cant have line to switzerland its all jammed its jammed totally straight across and they say well theres going to be change in the bank rate somebodys pals have been let in on it you know here we go interesting huh so heres whole bunch of hidden goals you see that would be knowingly hidden goals you know which these very fellows would tell you well its the most practical thing in the world you know what do you mean that isnt reprehensible in any way we wouldnt make any money if these werent hidden the goal is to sell so many securities before the thing falls and if we let it out that we were going to sell the securities before we sold the securities cow well of course this would wreck the whole lot and our goal would be ruined so therefore we must be very secretive about this whole object and our objectives and so forth well you i imagine find very many governmenthired slaves i mean scientists the slave brains they call them these days i imagine those boys are very difficult to audit its not whether or not theyve got withholds of secret materials its what goals are they withholding that the government has you see what goals of the government are they part and parcel of that must not be known and you take such case and itll go bang bang bang bang you ask them what goals shouldnt be known oh man they are legion well naturally pc not in that dramatic atmosphere is going to have similar difficulty goals that shouldnt be known and then goals not to be there and goals to be there yeah what kind of goals are those lets shake them down and you will find i think that needle start loosening up like mad very rapidly theyve had goal to be in school theyve had goal not to be in school theyll usually be flipflops you see theyve had goal to go to southern france and theyve had goal to stay in england and theyve had goal to live in big house and theyve had goal to continue to live in the house theyre in and theyve had goal not to live in big house and theyve had goal not to live in the house theyre in and you watch these things and theyll just be on both sides of the card its deck of playing cards with kings and queens and aces and so forth printed on both sides you cant turn these cards over without finding the same card on the other side you see you say have you had goal to do anything well yes theyve had goal to do that and theyve also had the goal not to do that and it is just repetitive you say have you ever had goal to own boat yes ive had goal to own boat and they have also had goal not to own boat and they will almost invariably add gratuitously the negative goal it occurs to them immediately afterwards you see so your plus and minus goals and of course your plus and minus locations goals with regard to locations are particularly pregnant with susceptibility and you could move that sticky needle routine 3 as you might have suspected is your beefiest process it is the strongest of all these processes and the only thing that gets in the road of routine 3 is person isnt enough insession to be assessed thats the only thing that gets in the road of that weve been trying to solve that one way or the other but that is sort of selfdefeating mechanism because this other thing is true this other thing is gruesomely true that the pc is in valence which is denying help and everything else to the pc and to whom the pc is denying help and the computation is if the pc gets well the valence will be helped and of course the pc is going to stay as sick as he can get to make the valence sick you got the idea so anything that is not directed immediately to the goal and the valence connected with this situation is to marked degree lost time the isolation of that terminal isolates the biggest games condition the pc has and up to that time you are to marked degree only auditing terminal alien to the pcs better being you see that until that terminal is isolated nothing much is going to happen now i know how to scare such terminals into view more rapidly i know how to do faster goals assessments but your first law on that would be progress and progress is measured by the change of meter and if youre not getting any change of meter as you do an assessment you must assume there is something real weird going on here which inhibits this thing from changing and that theres something very wrong with being assessed for goals goals must be notknown you must assume that theres great deal of mystery of location and whereabouts and other things of this character on this case and youll just go to the root of these things because as i say it is self defeating because these things only are useful to the degree that they advance goals assessment for the location of the eventual terminal of the pc you follow that so you do anything in your power to get goals assessment running well and smoothly and theres couple of mechanisms ive already given you one of them which is notknown goals goals that are not known goals that theyve forgotten what goals have you forgotten what goals shouldnt be known any notknow postulates one and three in order of line first not native state notknow know forget remember postulates one and three you work those things over one way or the other on the subject of goals backwards and forwards on the subject of terminals backwards and forwards and let give you the other one here which is i just said terminals notknown terminals when you finally get up to persons terminal assessment and so on you can run unknown people notknown people who would you care not to know interesting question isnt it you could probably use variations of that to do different type of clearing which is to say you theoretically could blow all the valences the case was mixed up with by running nothing but generalities on beingnesses and terminals dont you see but thats only theoretical and its never been done and the other is successful so well let the other one ride until it gets up into an area of good practice where we know where it is who would you rather not know what sort of being shouldnt be known by anyone is there any being on the track that you regret you knew this type of interrogation would of course shake up the valence in which the pc was locked up so remember theres that type of approach completely aside from this assessment type of approach two different ways to go about the same breed of cat what youre trying to do is get the persons valence out into view because the person is at war with this valence and this valence is the solution to problem that the pc has never been able to confront right so anyway any which any way you work it out youll win as long as you can get the pc to sit still the best way to keep pc sitting still is to pick up all of his arc breaks and so forth and dont keep courting disaster on the thing anytime by the way you have tumultuous pc dont keep blaming it on the pc because its arc breaks rudiments out earlier than the time theyre occurring if you wanted to really set pc up for auditing lets say you were in san diego and the pc came walking in and theyd been audited by this one or that one down through the years and so on and they came in and the case didnt appear to be in very bad shape and everything was going along fine and you actually wanted to do the best possible thing for this pc it would be to cover rudiments of all sessions the pc has ever had including the time period before they decided to have their first session just in other words just set it up and go about it arduously on down the line now what gets in the road is the pc isnt going to sit still for all this theyre going to consider it waste of time it is slow freight theres all sorts of arguments of it and your own impatience and anxiety to get the show on the road doesnt get you to set the case up so that it can be audited and so mistakes can be made and you very often in the largest majority of cases you get away with it so you can keep on doing it but if you were just arduously to take the case and set it up on every rudiment for every session and every auditor and every session they have given have you ever given session while you had present time problem you know you get the idea when was that you know and just take all the rudiments and set them all up on the subject of auditing from the first instance and spend fifty hours at it clearing would be hundred hours earlier you see what i mean you could speed it up by apparently taking lot of time and anybody who was making gain or progress who had had auditing before i would suspect there was something wrong with the auditing and try to trace all this back and find out if there wasnt hangfire or failed help or find something else you know just look over this auditing lets set up this case lets look over the whole zone and area and dont keep auditing at one little target when youve got all of life for target as far as this pc is concerned of course we know the fast way to get about it the fast way to do it is set the pc up so the pc will stay insession so that you can do good assessment on the pc for goals get the goals find the one goal that hangs up or lucky you would be goal hangs up they just go clear you see thats possible too you know if they just went clear on goals youve had it you never get chance to do terminal assessment but get the goal and then get terminals for that particular goal and then give it some runs and flatten that and do another assessment lets check over that goal and find out if its flat maybe get another terminal for the same goal or get new goal and they just keep on running and they will go clear thats it that is the way to clear them there is other known operation at this time which auditors can and will do to clear people that one will but setting person up for that and straightening them out and making them handle great many things getting all kinds of things out of the road in order to set person up for the assessment of course is of interest too but the pc isnt much interested in it and thats what gets in your road the pc is sort of hauled away from his central goal of getting goals assessment done youve all had that happen to you already youd much rather be assessed for goals much rather find your goal not necessarily be assessed for goals would much rather find your goal and find your terminal and thats it and any preliminary step to that finds you very impatient oh you havent got fall on present time problem again oh good heavens that means youre going to burn up here half an hour or so handling this present oh for heavens sakes you know the guys got present time problem right now in having to handle present time problem dont you see good way to handle it however if the pc will sit still is lets just trace all the times they were audited while they had present time problems present present time problem will probably blow up did they ever have this particular type of present time problem before is the best entrance point for that kind of search well thats an interesting question the fellow says well i have terrible present time problem ive just received letter from my solicitor and i have to come up with eight billion pounds or drachma or something by two oclock yesterday you know an interesting way to handle it has probably never been mentioned to you before but an interesting way to handle it is say well have you ever had this type of problem before oh well now that you mention it come to think about it i never have any other type of problem oh is that so and it goes insensitive as far as the session is concerned cognition of this as continuous state of being all of sudden well lets get down to this see why why do i always have this kind of present time why you know how come you see and the immediate existence of that specific present time problem has now broadened out and youve actually cut the props from underneath the present time problem and even though it took you half an hour or fortyfive minutes or an hour to bring about that cognition you are not then going to have to handle present time problems afterwards to amount to anything when they come up you just refer to the same modus operandi they know that worked earlier they rip it all up again and there goes the present time problem see you can get around it that way arc break do you have an arc break with oh yes all right is this the same type of arc break you had this same type of arc break before brrrrrroot see rip them up otherwise youre just going to keep getting arc breaks see arc breaks add to the chain arc breaks add to the chain arc breaks add to the chain you get the idea so youre going to handle late engram youre going to be running late engrams all the time huh hey you cant erase them so your pc of course is making progress in assessment there is substitute for setting pc up to be audited substitute for it there is fast road for it either beyond some of the tips i could give you about the fact that arc breaks go in chains pt problems go in chains the difficulties with auditing rooms go in chains and you can handle them as chain and then you are saving time and you are doing better job of it any rudiment can be handled as chain and if you handle it expertly as chain particularly if you find basicbasic on that chain the whole chain will tear up see arc breaks are basically resting on overts and if arc breaks are resting on overts then an unkind thought regarding book one scientology may very well be something that sat at the basis of the chain the person hadnt even read it see had never even seen it we had case that was always getting arc breaky in sessions and so forth and they actually traced back on the basicbasic of the thing of having made an unkind remark to his father about well they picked it up they read chapter too carelessly they gave each other fiveminute auditing session and then they agreed it didnt work and you know that postulate hung fire with that same person for about seven years it wasnt picked up until about 58 and all of sudden the case just started to make very good gains in processing and so forth but up until that time i was having hell of time with it because they arc broke all the time in sessions see they had an overt against the thing that was now supposed to help them interesting so handle your rudiments in chains and youll get along lot faster handle all of these things and if the case is hanging up why suspect that theres great deal of notknow about it its just as if it would take you long time to clear up rudiment suspect that there is notknow about this rudiment the basic notknow about rudiment is that it happened before and the arc break that exists is not the arc break you are trying to handle but an earlier arc break you see thats notknow so theres notknow hanging back there on the chain the chain wont therefore pull up and the later incident wont erase so the pc remains slightly out of session even though you have handled the quote unquote the arc break and then with the generality of case not making progress under goals assessment or not giving their goals properly again assume that notknowingness exists someplace in that zone you dont know what the pcs responses to goals is you dont know what the pcs response is and you keep asking him for goals well whats his response based on does he say to himself privately oh for christs sakes each time before he gives you goal does he see you wouldnt be making progress but you wouldnt know what it was and the thing would not be running and it would be hidden so you say well do you have another goal or did you have another childhood goal and he says to himself privately oh for christs sakes and he says aloud to you well to be railroad engineer you see well how far do you think this number of overts can continue without suddenly blowing up one into storm or at least stalling the case just to dead stop so any time youre not making progress with case for any reason at all this is just auditing in general assume the case is out of session definition of out of session is dont want to be there why not must have overts if theyre trying to leave all these various other laws apply dont you see so trace them down and when youre handling rudiments and you keep finding rudiments out find the chain and if the pc is getting upset in session or restive or something of that sort assume that something happened much earlier and find it and blow it and all of sudden your auditing will become very very smooth activity wont have many bumps to it be delight youre in for surprise before i end this off youre in for surprise if pc has number of arc breaks scattered up and down the auditing chain of sessions you see and arc breaks unhandled exist broadly on this chain then youre going to find out that pc in the session you are running is getting an arc break about every third auditing command youre just going to be staggered at the number of actual arc breaks that you can find on this pc in the session you are running you see thats something you want to notice on pc thats getting lots of arc breaks so pick them all up pick them all up all the way back take up the whole history of auditing on this pc if its getting that rampant but youre going to be utterly amazed youre going to find out the more arc breaks there have been on the auditing track the more arc breaks occur on the auditing track its sort of like the more you eat the more you got you know and its unreasonable but factual the more pt problems you find on pc the more pt problems have existed on this pc and if this pc is also an auditor youre also going to run into the auditing chain of auditing while having pt problem you know got an appointment at three oclock and the pc is now getting at quarter of three and that last fifteen minutes is audited with pt problem well its not very destructive and it doesnt do very much but these things will come off as you run the thing okay well ill probably give you lecture tomorrow female voice good okay audience thank you as far as your goals assessment is concerned i hope youre having little better luck did goals assessing speed up on you using some of this material or didnt it hm or is it going the same speed as before female voice well as pc it certainly speeded up hm females voice as pc it certainly speeded up for hm have you noticed any difference as an auditor using notknow on goals have you female voice mmhm all right but not too much difference now you notice this then notice this then how fast it speeds up if you really handle these outrudiments in chains then you just find out how rapidly this thing goes and the only other hint i would give you is dont be so anxious to erase them just establish whether or not theyre going to stay or going to go and if theyre going to go throw them away you know just run them down if theyre going to go you can tell and if theyre going to stay why find out in about three questions you say thats still alive ask three times its gone dont expect the pc to say thing back dont expect the pc to contribute one blasted thing to the actual rundown and erasure of goals the pc can sit there like stump on the log and the emeter will still react the pc doesnt have to say aye yes or or spit nothing and itll still react its very amazing the pc doesnt even have to have his quote attention unquote on the goal you just read to have it react if its still alive did you know that quite amazing isnt it and dont be so anxious to rub them out you know leave them there for while let him have them for little while you know youll find they disappear faster because youre not spending so much time on one goal its actually faster way to get rid of goals okay all right thank you audience thank you thank you
