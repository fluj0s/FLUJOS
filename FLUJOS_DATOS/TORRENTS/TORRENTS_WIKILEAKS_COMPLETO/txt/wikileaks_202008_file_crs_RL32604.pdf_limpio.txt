however if he determines that national security interests or humanitarian reasons justify waiver the waiver under humanitarian reasons is somewhat limited and the waiver authority may not be used on either basis to provide assistance that is so restricted under section 40 of the aeca the trade sanctions reform and ex port enhancement act of 2000 114 stat 1549a67 through 1549a72 restricts the

such exports are allowed licenses to export are limited to oneyear issuances and government financing or underwriting of such exports is substantially denied section 908a of that act however

section 2b1b of the exportimport bank act of 1945 12 usc 635b1b provides that only where the president after consultation with congress determines that exim financing would be in the national interest where such action would clearly and importantly advance united states policy in such areas as international terrorism and nucl ear proliferation should the exportimport bank deny applications for credit for nonfinancial or noncommercial considerations considering that the president found on september 10 2004 that it is in the national interest for the exportimport bank to guarantee insure or
