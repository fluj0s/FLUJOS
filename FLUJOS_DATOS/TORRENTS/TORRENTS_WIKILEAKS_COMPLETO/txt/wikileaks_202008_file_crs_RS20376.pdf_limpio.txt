report 96950 rico brief sketch httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20376crs2 closer look at the elements any person any person may violate rico the person need not be mobster or even human being any individual or entity capable of holding legal or beneficial interest in property will do although the p erson and the enterpri must be distinct in the case of subsection 1962c violation conducting an enterprise s activities through racketeering activity corporate entity and its sole shareholder are sufficiently distinct to satisfy the enterprise and person elemen ts of subsection c violation and the person and enterprise need not be di stinct for purposes of subsection 1962a investing the racketeering activity pro ceeds in an enterprise or subsection 1962b acquiring or maintaining an enterprise through racketeering activity violations on the other hand even though governmental entities may constitute or participate in rico enterprise and may bring rico cause of ac tion they are not considered capable of rico violation misconduct rico addresses four forms of illicit commercial activity reflected in the four subsections of section 1962 ac quiring or operating an enterprise using racketeering proceeds b c ontrolling an enterprise usin g racketeering activities c conducting the affairs of an terprise using racketeering ac tivities and d conspiring to so acquire control or conduct the first 18 usc 1962a was design ed as something of money laundering provision it introduces several features of its own and has been described as the most difficult to prove under its provisions it is unlawful for 1 any person 2 who is liable as principal in the collection of an unlawful debt or b in pattern of predicate offenses 3 to use or invest 4 the income from such misconduct 5 to acquire establish or operate 6 commercial enterprise the person the pattern of predicate ffense and the enterprise elements are common to all of the subsections for pur poses of 1962a however legal entity that benefits from the offense may be both the per and the enterprise the person must have committed usury or pattern of predicate offenses or aided and abetted in their commission and have received income that w ould not otherwise have been received as result some courts have also held th at in civil rico case 1962a only applies to legitimate enterprises and does not include instances wher the proceeds of racketeering activity are simply plowed back into corrupt enterprise the second proscription 18 usc 1962b is much the same except that it forbids acquisition or control of an enterprise through the predicates themselves rather than through the income derived from the pr edicates it makes it unlawful for 1 any person 2 to acquire or maintain an interest in or control of 3 commercial enterprisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20376crs3 4 through the collection of an unlawful debt or b pattern of predicate offenses as in the case of subsection 1962a the person and the enterprise may be one and the same there must be nexus between the predicate offenses and the acquisition of control exactly what constitutes interest or control is case by case determination the defe ndant must be shown to have play ed some significant role in the management of the enterprise but showin g of complete control is not necessary subsection 1962c makes it unlawful for 1 any person 2 employed by or associated with 3 commercial enterprise 4 to conduct or participate in the conduct of the enterprises affairs 5 through the collection of an unlawful debt or b pattern of predicate offenses although subsection 1962c might appear f acially less demanding than subsections 1962a and b the courts have not always read it broadly thus in any charge of breach of its provisions the person and the enterprise must ordinarily be distinct the requirement cannot be avoided by charging corporate entity as the person and the officers and employees through whom it must act as an association in fact enterprise corporate entity and its sole shareholder however are sufficiently distinct for purposes of subsection 1962c moreover the supreme court has identified an entrepreneurial st ripe in the conduct or participate in the conduct element of 1962c under whic h only those who participate in the operation or management of the enterprise itself meet the definition nevertheless conviction requires neither an economic predicate offens nor predicate offense committed with an economic motive racketeering activity the heart of most rico violations is pattern of racketeering activities ie the patterned commission of two or more designated state or federal crimes the list of state and federal crimes upon wh ich rico violation may be predicated includes murder kidnaping gamb ling robbery arson bribery extortion dealing in drugs or obscene material ma il fraud wire fraud nd federal crimes of terrorism to name few to constitute racketeering activity the predicate offense need only be committed there is requirement that the defe ndant or anyone else have been convicted of predicate offense before ri co prosecution or action may be brought conviction of predicate offense on the other hand does not preclude subsequent rico prosecution nor is either conviction or acquittal bar to subse quent rico civil action pattern the pattern of racketeering activities element of rico requires 1 the commission of two or more predicate offenses 2 that the predicate offenses be relatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20376crs4 and not simply isolated events and 3 th at they are committed under such circumstances that suggest either continuity of criminal activity or the threat of such continuity i predicates the first element is explic it in section 19615 pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity the two remaining elements relationship and continuity flow from the legislative history of rico that history shows that congress indeed had fairly flexible concept of pattern in mind pattern is not formed by sporadic activity person cannot be subjected to the sanctions of rico simply for committing two widely separate and isolated criminal offenses instead the term pattern itself requires the showing of relationship between the predicates and of the threat of continuing activity it is this factor of continuity plus relationship which combines to produce pattern ii related predicates the commission of predicate offenses forms the requisite related pattern if the criminal acts have the same or similar purposes results participants victims or methods of commission or ot herwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events iii continuity continuity is question of time party alleging rico violation may demonstrate continuity by proving series of related pred icates extending over substantial period of time predicate acts extending over few weeks or months and threatening future criminal conduct do not sa tisfy this requirement but this does not mean that rico violation has occurred in the absence of continuity often rico action will be brought before continuity can be established in such cases liability depends on whether the threat of continuity is demonstrat ed the court characterized pattern extending over period of time but which posed threat of reoccurrence as pattern with closedend tinuity and pattern marked by threat of reoccurrence as pattern with ope nended continuity in the case of closedended pattern the lower courts have been reluctant to find predicate activity extending over less than year sufficient for the substantial periods of time required to demonstrate continuity whether the threat of future predicate activity is sufficient to recognize an open end pattern of tinuity depends upon the nature of the predicate offenses and the na ture of the enterprise though the number of related predicates involved ma be small and they may occur close together in time the racketeering acts themselves include specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future and thus supply the requisite continuity in other cases the threat of continuity may be established by showing that the predicate acts or offenses are part of an ongoing entitys regular way of doing business collection of an unlawful debt collection of an unlawful debt may be the only instance in which the commission of sing predicate offense will support rico prosecution or cause of action proof of pa ttern seems to be necessary the predicate covers both usury and the co llection of gambling debts enterprise the statute defines enterprise to include any individual partnership corporation associa tion or other legal entity and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not legal entity the enterprise may be devoted to entirely legitimate ends or to tally corrupt objectives and rico reaches efforts involving bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20376crs5 governmental and nongovernmental enterprises finally as noted earlier corporation or other legal entity may be both the defe ndant and the required enterprise under some circumstances to satisfy ricos jurisdictional element the corrupt or corrupted enterprise must either engage in interstate or foreign commerce or engage in activities that affect interstate or foreign commerce an enterprise that or ders supplies and transports its employees and products in interstate commerce is engage d in interstate commerce for purposes of rico as general rule the impact of the enterprise on interstate or foreign commerce need only be minimal to satisfy rico requirements where the predicate offenses associated with an enterprise have an aff ect on interstate commerce the enterprise is likely to have an affect on interstate commerce however where the enterprise itself does not engage in economic activity minimal effect on commerce will not do conspiracy conspiracy under subsection 1962d is 1 the agreement of 2 two or more 3 to invest in acquire or conduct the affairs of 4 commercial enterprise 5 in manner which violates 18 usc 1962a b or c the heart of the crime lies in the agreement rather than any completed concerted violation of the other three rico subsecti ons in fact unlike the general conspiracy statute rico conspiracy is complete upon th agreement even if none of the conspirators ever commit an overt act towards the accomplis hment of its criminal purpose moreover contrary to the view once held by some of the lower courts there is requirement that defendant commit or agree to commit two or more predicate offenses himself it is enough that the defendant in agreement with another intended to further an endeavor which if completed would satisfy all of the elements of rico violation consequences the commission of rico viola tion exposes offenders to wide range of criminal and civil consequences imprisonment fines restitution forfeiture treble damages attorneys fees and wide range of equitable restrictions i criminal liability rico violations are punishable by fine or by imprisonment for life in cases where the predicate offense carri life sentence and by imprisonment for not more than 20 years in all other cases although an offender may be sentenced to either fine or term of imprisonment under the strict terms of the statute the operation of the applicable sentencing guidelines ma kes it highly likely that offenders will face both fine and imprisonment the maximum amount of the fine for rico violation is the greater of twice the amount of the gain or loss associated with the crime or 250000 for an individual 500000 for an organization offenders sentenced to prison are also sentenced to term of supervised release of not more than 3 years to be served following their release from incarceration most rico violations also trigger mandatory federal restitution provisions ie the rico offense will involve crime of violence drug trafficking or crime with respect to which victim suffers physical injury or pecuniary loss moreover property re lated to rico violation is subject to confiscationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20376crs6 ii civil liability rico violations may result in civil as well as criminal liability any person injured in his business or prope rty by reason of rico violation has cause of action for treble da mages and attorneys fees prior criminal conviction is required although the united states is appa rently not person that may sue for damages under rico the term does include local governme nts state agencies and foreign governments on the other hand pr ivate parties may not bring rico suit for damages against the united states or other governmental entities in order to recover the plaintiff must tablish an injury to his or her business or property directly or proximately caused by the defendants rico violation the injury must involve concrete financ ial loss mere injury to valuable intangible property interest such as right to pursue employme nt will not do the courts agreed generally that section 1964c does not pe rmit recovery for personal injuries since they are not injuries to business or property but sometimes disagree on what constitutes an unqualified injury if the underlying viola tion involves subsection 1962a it is the use or investment of the income rather than the predicate offenses that must have caused the injury if the underlying violation involve s subsection 1962b it is the access or control of the rico enterprise rather than the predi cate offenses that must have caused the injury while criminal prosecution requires ove rt act the courts demand that rico plaintiffs whose claim is based on cons piracy under subsection 1962d prove an overt act since mere agreement cannot be the di rect or proximate cause of an injury moreover the overt act itself must constitute predicate offense notwithstanding the apparent inability of the united states to sue for damages under rico the attorney general may seek to prev ent and restrain rico violations under the broad equitable powers vested in the courts to order disgorgement divestiture restitution or the creation of receiverships or trusteeships this aut hority has been invoked relatively infrequently primarily to rid various unions of organized crime and other forms of corruption there is some question whether pr ivate plaintiffs in addition to the attorney general may seek injunctive and other forms of equitable relief on the procedural side the supreme court has held that 1 state trial courts of general jurisdiction have concurrent jurisdiction over fede ral civil rico claims 2 under the appropriate circumstances parties may agree to make potential civil rico claims subject to arbitration 3 the clayton acts four year period of limitation applies to civil rico claims as well and the period begins when the victim discovers or should have discovered the injury and 4 in the absence of an impediment to state regulation mccarranferguson act does not bar civil rico claims based on insurance fraud allegations
