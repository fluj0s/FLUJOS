misleading date fri 04 feb 2005 155253 0500 to andy revkin anrevknytimescom from michael mann mannvirginiaedu subject re fw hockey stock methodology misleading hi andy the mcintyre and mckitrick paper is pure scientific fraud i think youll find this reinforced by just about any legitimate scientist in our field you discuss this with please see the realclimate response 1httpwwwrealclimateorgindexphpp111 and also 2httpwwwrealclimateorgindexphpp114 the moberg et paper is at least real science but there are some real problems with it youll want to followup w people like phil jones for 2nd opinion while the paper actually reinforces the main conclusion of previous studies it also finds the late 20th century to be the warmest period of the past two millennia it challenges various reconstructions using treering information which includes us but several others such as jones et crowley etc im pretty sure by the way that very similar version of the paper was rejected previously by science number of us are therefore very surprised that nature is publishing it given number of serious problems their method for combining frequencies is problematic and untested they only use handful of records so there is potentially large sampling bias b worse they use different records for highfrequencies and lowfrequencies so the bias isnt even the samethe reconstruction is apples and oranges c the wavelet method is problematic we have found in our own work that you cannot simply combine the content in different at like frequencies because different proxies have different signal vs noise characteristics at different frequenciesfor some records there centuryscale variability is likely to be pure noise they end up therfore weighting noise as much as signal for some of the records used there are real age model problems the timescale isnt known to better than couple hundred years in several cases so when they average these records together the centuryscale variability is likely to be nonsense d they didnt do statistical verification this is absolutely essential for such reconstructions see eg the recent cook et and luterbacher et papers in science they should have validated their reconstruction against longinstrumental records as we and many others have without having done so there is reason to believe the reconstruction has any reliability this is major problem w the paper it is complicated by the fact that they dont produce pattern but just hemispheric meanthat makes it difficult to do longterm verification but they dont attempt any sort of verification at all there are some decades known to be warm from the available instrumental records 1730s some in the 16th century which the moberg reconstruction completely missesthe reconstruction gives the impression that all years are cold between 1500 and 1750 the reconstruction would almost certainly fail crossvalidation against long instrumental records if so it is an unreliable estimate of past changes were surprised the nature reviewers didnt catch this they also didnt validate their method against model where i believe it would likely fail we have done so w our own hybrid frequencydomain method that combines information separately at low and highfrequencies but taking into account the problem mentioned above this is described in rutherford s mann osborn tj bradley rs briffa kr hughes mk jones pd 3proxybased northern hemisphere surface temperature reconstructions sensitivity to methodology predictor network target season and target domain journal of climate in press 2005 in work that is provisionally accepted in journal of climate draft attached we show that our method gives the correct history using noisy pseudoproxy records derived from climate model simulation with large past changes in radiative forcing moberg et have not tested their method in such manner f they argue selectively for favorable comparison w other work 1 esper et when authors rescaled the reconstruction using the full instrumental record cook et 2004 they found it to be far more similar to mann et crowley and lowery jones et and the roughly dozen or so other empirical and model estimates consistent w it several studies moreover see eg shindell dt schmidt ga mann faluvegi g 4dynamic winter climate response to large tropical volcanic eruptions since 1600 journal of geophysical research 109 d05104 doi 1010292003jd004151 2004 show that extratropical landonly summer temperatures which esper et emphasises are likely to biased towards greater variabilityso its an apples and oranges comparison anyway 2 von storch et there are some well known problems here their forcing is way too large foukal at in science couple months back indicates maybe 5 times too large dkmi uses same model more conventional forcings and get half the amplitude and another paper submitted recently by the belgium modeling group suggests that some severe spinupinitialization problems give the large centuryscale swings in the modelthese are not reproducible 3 boreholes they argue that boreholes are physical measurements but many papers in the published literature have detailed the various biases in using continental ground surface temperature to estimate past surface air temperature changeschanging snow cover gives rise to potentially huge bias see eg mann schmidt ga 5ground vs surface air temperature trends implications for borehole surface temperature reconstructionsgeophysical research letters 30 12 1607 doi 1010292003gl017170 2003 methods that try to correct for this give smaller amplitude changes from borehole temperatures mann rutherford s bradley rs hughes mk keimig ft 6optimal surface temperature reconstructions using terrestrial borehole data journal of geophysical research 108 d7 4203 doi 1010292002jd002532 2003 7correctionrutherford and mann 2004 most reconstructions and model estimates still sandwich the mann et reconstruction see eg figure 5 in jones pd mann 8climate over past millennia reviews of geophysics 42 rg2002 doi 1010292003rg000143 2004 ironically mm say our 15th century is too cold while moberg et say its too warm hmmm to recap i hope you dont mention mm at all it really doesnt deserve any additional publicity moberg et is more deserving of discussion but as outlined above there are some real problems w it i have reason to believe that natures own commentary by schiermeier will actually be somewhat critical of it im travelling and largely unavailable until monday if you need to talk you can possibly reach at 4342276969 over the weekend i hope this is of some help literally got to run now mike at 0214 pm 242005 andy revkin wrote hi all there is fascinating paper coming in nature next week moberg of stockholm univ et that uses mix of sediment and tree ring data to get new view of last 2000 years very warped hockeystick shaft centuriesscale variability very large but still pronounced unusual 1990s blade id like your reactionthoughts for story ill write for next thursdays times also is there anything about the grl paper forthcoming from mc mc that warrants response i can send you the nature paper as pdf if you agree not to redistribute it you know the embargo rules that ok thanks for getting in touch andy ______________________________________________________________ professor michael
