perhaps 2500 years ago the bantu people began to expand from west african base gradually spreading complex agricultural system over much of the continent africanists generally agree that loyalties to large ethnic groups key factor in african politics today were largely absent in precolonial africa the atlantic slave trade which began about 1450 and lasted 400 years removed millions of people in their most productive years from africa and left the continent ill prepared to cope with the european scramble for africa from the 1870s through the early twentieth century nearly the entire subsaharan region was divided among the european powers the europeans built basic economic infrastructure but imposed bureaucratic system of government and strengthened traditional chiefs and other big men to help them rule these patterns deepened divisions in african societies and strengthened antidemocratic patterns of government after world war ii african nationalists organized political parties and began to demand independence by the early 1960s independence had come to most of eastern and western africa but white minority rule persisted in southern africa ending only in 1994 when universalsuffrage elections were held in south africa in the first years of the 1960s there were high hopes that the end of colonialism would bring rapid economic growth instead africa confronted number of problems including inefficient statecentered economic systems frequent military coups ethnic strife and corruption the cold war contributed to africas difficulties flooding the continent with arms and strengthening number of repressive regimes that had superpower backing french policy also tended to bolster authoritarian governments in former french colonies in the early 1990s hope s for africas future revived following widespread political and economic reforms and the end of the cold war later in the decade however the pace of reforms slowed and central africa fell into an era of violent conflict afropessimists believe that these developments have gravely damaged africas prospects but others argue that they are temporary problems masking an underlying african renaissance the

50000 to 100000 years ago according to most current scientific thinking small bands of these fully modern humans crossed out of africa into the middle east and became the ancestors of all human populations elsewhere2 an internal african migration of great significance was launched perhaps 2500 5000 years ago as the bantu people of west africa began to expand their area of settlement from base that was probably in the northeast of presentday nigeria or possibly cameroon the bantu eventually became the predominant people over most of subsaharan africa although people speaking socalled nilosaha ran languages are widely found in the sahel grasslands on the southern border of the sahara and parts of eastern africa the nilosaharan languages may have had their origins in the nile valley but the term nilotic to describe peoples existing today has fallen out of favor with scholars because of the extensive intermingling of bantu and nilo saharan speakers over the centuries bantu tropical agriculture was not suited to the mediterranean climate of extreme southern africa and this region continued to be inhabited by people known as khoisan or san experts are uncertain about the origins of iron use in africa3 but by about 500 bc it appears that the bantu had become skilled in smelting iron and making the iron tools that created highly successful agriculture and accelerated their expansion when europeans began to explore the african coast after 1450 ad they found that farmers were growing wide variet of crops including grains as well foods unfamiliar to europeans such as bananas some of these had come into africa through contacts with the indian ocean region and southeast asia4 many african farmers also had cattle although the tsetse fly kept cattle out of the wetter central part of the continent after the discovery of america farmers quickly adopted new world crops such as maize and peanuts by 1500 an estimated 47 million africans were living in thousands of

parasites and other diseasecausing organisms that had evolved with homo sapiens in africa7 human populations outside africa by contrast had largely escaped these diseases and hence could more easily build cities precolonial society there is wide agreement among africanists that loyalties to large ethnic groups such as the yoruba in presentday nigeria or the tutsi of east africa were largely absent in precolonial africa even though they are dominant feature of african politics today8 broadly similar languages were spoken over wide areas and these language areas may have correlated with similar cultural practices and religious beliefs as well but historians believe that africans did not perceive that they had common interests with other members of these large amorphous groups instead african loyalties were embedded in extended families clans and patronclient relationships which offered protection and economic support some areas saw the emergence of powerful individuals or chiefs sometimes termed big men by scholars who exercised influence over wide areas through marriage ties and other means such as control over critical trade route9 number of african kingdoms developed as the more successful chiefs consolidated their authority through conquest and alliance to the south of the congo river estuary for example european explorers encounte red the kongo kingdom where powerful king ruled several provinces through royal relatives10 great artistic achievements also characterized many of these precolonial kingdoms as evidenced by the naturalistic bronze castings of heads in the kingdom of benin in todays nigeria and the stylized congolese masks and carvings that inspired picasso and other modern artists the slave trade the atlantic slave trade is said to have

americas annual totals reached 100000 in some years late in the century13 at time when 30004000 were also being taken from east africa in the lesserknown indian ocean slave trade14 in 1807 the british parliament voted to end the slave trade and over the next 60 years the royal navy intercepted more than 1600 ships off africas coasts and freed over 160000 captives sending most to sierra leone15 but many ships evaded the british patrols and large numbers of slaves continued to be exported until slavery was abolished throughout the americas in the 1850s and 1860s us participation in the slave trade was banned by legislation passed in 1807 and strengthened in 1819 for number of years us navy ships were stationed off the african coast to participate in efforts to halt the trade but with limited success16 the atlantic slave trade was conducted by european traders based on the west african coast they purchased slaves from african owners by trading guns alcohol cloth or other europeanmanufactured goods as well as cowrie shells which had monetary value in precolonial africa slavery had long been practiced in africa where it was customary to enslave people captured during wars together with condemned criminals and in some societies convicted adulterers and enemies of the king17 in addition some of those sold into the atlantic slave trade were kidnap victims18 according to historians slaves in traditional african societies were typically absorbed into families or local armies and their treatment was generally less harsh than in the plantations of the new world moreover the children of slaves in africa often could not be sold19 effects scholars debate the effects of the slave trade on the politics and economies of african societies20 but the era was clearly

the history of continent 165outbreaks of war affecting much of west africa the guns that flooded africa in exchange for slaves helped fuel this instability and the quest for european arms gave warring parties powerful incentive to constantly seek new captives21 it seems certain that warfare related to the slave trade the loss of millions of people in their most productive years and the psychological damage to individuals resulting from political instability and fear of capture weakened africa and left it illprepared to cope with the onset of direct european colonization the colonial era as late as 1870 there was little indication that the european powers were about to leave their isolated positions on the coast and partition africa among themselves instead it seemed more likely that indigenous political entities would consolidate their authority and eventually develop into nationstates in west africa for example the kingdom of ashanti asante had profited from its wealth in gold and the slave trade and had acquired strong central government an advanced system of roads well defined boundaries and national language22 it seemed destined to grow stronger buganda in east africa to take another example had become the chief naval power on lake victoria and was known for its powerful king the kabaka its strong army and its growing trade23 meanwhile number of secondary empires secondary in the sense that they relied on imported european military technology were emerging24 many of these were based in muslim societies and their gains did much to promote the spread of islam in subsaharan africa in earlier centuries islam had been spreading slowly in west africa as result of transsahara trade contacts and had made larger gains in northeastern africa through trade and arab immigration africans who wanted to associate themselves with the wider islamic world often converted willingly and koranic schools had begun to introduce literacy in arabic across the sahel but in the nineteenth century series of holy wars or jihads created vast west african islamic empire centered on soko to in modern nigeria in east africa the sultans of the island of zanzibar were extending their power on the mainland and egypt was expanding its control in northeastern africa with troops on lake victoria by 187625 it seemed headed for an empire reaching into central africa

secondary empire descended from dutch huguenot and german settlers who had arrived at the cape of good hope in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries thousands of boers trekked deep into the african interior to escape the cultural influences of the british britain had taken control of the cape during the napoleonic wars with modern rifles and cavalry tactics the boers defeated the powerful zulu in key battles and established farms in grasslands areas recently depopulated by series of african wars sparked by zulu expansionism the zulu were acquiring modern arms themselves and remained major force in the region under king ruling through an aristocracy the scramble the development of africas indigenous political entities was halted by the european scramble for africa which began in competition over the niger and congo river basins in the 1870s the scramble concluded in 1920 when british forces making use of combat airplanes developed during world war i ended the last resistance in somalia by this time all of subsaharan africa except for ethiopia and liberia was under european control ethiopia had thwarted italian ambitions to make it colony by inflicting humiliating defeat on italian troops at adowa in 1896 however menelik ii the ethiopian emperor was unable to oust the italians from the colony of eritrea which they had established along the red sea coast italy invaded ethiopia again in 1935 in what some historians regard as an opening phase of world war ii the italians were driven from the region by british troops in 1941194226 the scramble was made possible in part by advances in medicine which for the first time gave europeans measure of protection against tropical diseases gains in military technology particularly the development of machine guns and modern artillery gave europeans tremendous advantages over even very large african forces in 1898 for example an army of british and egyptian troops killed 10800 sudanese in one day of fighting while losing 48 officers and men themselves27 as result of europes military advantages many africans chose not to resist the colonial invasion although the ashanti the zulu the boers the herero of german southwest africa namibia and peoples in french west africa did launch armed struggles against the colonizers many european leaders were initially reluctant to seize territory in africa because they doubted that potential financial gains would balance the likely cost however in britain france and germany there were imperia lists and nationalists both in and out of government who brought popular and political pressure to bear in support of expansion antislavery activists felt that direct rule would end the slavery that continued to exist in africa itself and missionaries saw that their

johannesburg in 1885 it was not until 1902 however that british troops finally subdued the afrikaners in the second of the boer wars the new colonial powers also valued africas agricultural potential germany for example sough t to create reliable source of raw cotton in its east african colony of tanganyika28 the profit motive was perhaps strongest with king leopold ii of belgium but he successfully hid his real interests for many years amid show of humanitarian concerns working closely with henry m stanley the britishamerican explorer and journalist leopold built vast empire under his personal control by funding the exploration of the congo river basin and persuading local chiefs to sign treaties which they little understood recognizing his authority at the berlin west africa conference in 18841885 leopold won recognit ion of the sovereignty of his international association of the congo iac which controlled congo and has been described as leopolds oneman enterprise29 britain and germany had come to favor recognition of leopolds iac as means of thwarting the growth of french influence in west and central africa30 leopold had also succeeded in winning the endorsement of us president chester arthur for his plans which were supported by senate resolution as well31 the berlin conference set rules for the future acquisition of colonies in africa requiring that countries exercise effective control of an area before claiming it this had the effect of limiting most further colonization to the strongest powers britain france and germany although portugal secured territories in angola and mozambique where portuguese settlers had long been present germany lost its colonie s in the first world war and by that time it was clear that britain was the dominant power in africa with colonies stretching from southern africa through eastern africa and sudan to egypt and holding the gold coast including the former ashanti as well as nigeria in west africa france however also held large territories in west and in central africa the united states did not have colonies in africa but the us navy assisted the american colonization society as it began to settle former slaves on the west african coast in 1820 the first permanent settlement was achieved in 1822 after arduous struggles and neardefeat by disease and unfriendly local warriors the

development in order to generate the necessary revenue the colonial state was heavily involved in the economy influe ncing decisions on what crops should be planted and regulating prices as well as investment many statist systems based on the colonial model persisted after independence retarding the evolution of market economies colonial economic policies also made africa dependent on the export

38for recent statement of this view see berman ethnicity patronage and the african statecolonial governments had interest in promoting democracy or developing democratic traditions which would have complicated their efforts to rule africa with minimum of expenditure in the words of one expert the colonial state in africa was an authoritarian bureaucratic apparatus of control and not intended to be school of democr acy36 as pressure for political rights and independence mounted after world war ii colonial regimes often imprisoned their critics and took other authoritarian measures that set unfortunate precedents for postcolonial rulers most africans had opportunity for political participation until the very end of the colonial period when elections began to be held while britain and france discouraged popular participation for most of the colonial era they did work closely with local chiefs and other big men because the cooperation of these traditional authorities was essential in obtaining the labor and tax revenues the colonial regimes required some contend that in strengthening big men whose influence rested on kinship ties the granting of favors and the suppression of dissent the colonial authorities contributed significantly to the problems independent africa has suffered with respect to corruption nepotism and authoritarianism colonial practice many scholars believe shaped africas presentday ethnic divisions by intensifying language and cultural differences among african peoples in their view this came about in part because europeans of the colonial era tended to view the world in terms of tribes and nations and encouraged africans to do likewise moreover the colonial authorities particularly the british found it administratively convenient to group peoples together as tribes and rule indirectly through tribal chiefs whom they strengthened and in some instances created37 africans found that they could most effectively advance their interests in the colonial era if they worked through tribal organizations and sought the patronage of tribal leaders and this tended to strengthen tribal loyalties today these ethnic divisions are the source of much of africas violent politics even where civil war does not occur ethnic divisions typically weaken political institutions and undermine economies38 the colonial partition of africa often had the effect of imposing artificial boundary divisions on africa separating peoples that had been linked by culture and trade after the partition roads and railroads were built to link the capitals of the new colonial states to their hinterlands rather than to one another creating difficulties in transport between african countries that remain to this day moreover by imposing the bureaucratic colonial state on african societ ies the europeans suppressed the diverse indigenous political arrangements that had governed africa before the partition whether some of africas precolonial political entities could have continued to develop in ways that avoided or minimized the problems that confront the african state today is one of the unknowns of history the fact that they

mounted in nigeria as result of the coup and when the ibo people of eastern nigeria attempted to secede civil war broke out that lasted until 1970 subsaharan africas annual rate of per capita economic growth fell to 8 in the 1970s and plunged to negative 22 per year in the 1980s more than wiping out all previous gains44 in these decades most african countries were governed by authoritarian regimes and few such as idi amins government in uganda 1971 1979 were quite violent civil wars broke out not only uganda but also in ethiopia sudan somalia and chad as well as in angola and mozambique where long civil wars followed the wars for independence when drought struck wide areas of the continent in 19821984 the highest death tolls occurred in the wartorn countries particularly ethiopia and sudan where international relief agencies could not reach the hungry the unde rlying causes of africas problems in the postindependence era have been the subject of much discussion and analysis the impact

arms came into africa during the cold war fueling african conflicts most of these arms came from the soviet union and its allies and went to self proclaimed marxist regimes in ethiopia angola and mozambique in reaction the united states provided far lesser quantities of weapons but focused much of its economic assistance on authoritarian regimes in zaire sudan liberia and elsewhere that were perceived as antisoviet this competitive cold war involvement critics maintain tended to strengthen governments on both sides that were antidemocratic and following inefficient stateoriented economic policies often marked by considerable corruption46 effects of french policy the degree to which french policy may have contributed to africas problems is matter of debate france had remained actively engaged in africa because french policy makers believed that major african role would help give france great power status at time when the two superpowers were dominant elsewhere by overt and covert means they cultivated special relationship with the elites of their former colonies which they regarded as frances chasse gardée or exclus ive hunting ground47 in addition france capitalized on the tie of language to forge close relations with the francophone regimes in zaire and rwanda former belgian colonies these special relationships with france usually brought both military and economic assistance as well as promise of french intervention to protect friendly regimes from violent unrest several thousand french troops were stationed at african bases french businesses meanwhile gained privileged access to trade and investment opportunities critics maintained that french policy was perpetuating corrupt and authoritarian regimes in many countries but defenders argued that france was contributing to stability and as result facilitating development france began to reduce its military and financial commitments in africa after the socialist party won legislative elections in may 1997

and early 1990s as the colonial era fell farther into the past and the cold war waned scholars began to focus on characteristics of the african state and african societies to explain the continents difficulties this line of analysis led to number of discouraging conclusions about the continent some scholars concluded that african states were too weak to promote societal change and economic developmen t largely because the institutions of the state had been corrupted the personal ambitions of leaders ethnic favoritism and pathological patrimonialism49 were blamed by some for diverting state resources to the personal fortunes of ruling cliques and to the police and military officials who kept them in power there was much academic discussion of the failed state in africa amid extensive media coverage of famine and conflict in somalia sudan and other countries50 economic difficulties continued as well despite growth spurt in mid decade overall gdp growth for the years 1990 through 1998 was 20 per year less than the population growth rate of 2651 at the same time there were several positive developments affecting africa in the early 1990s that gave rise to hopes for better future with the end of the cold war some noted africas authoritarian rulers would longer be able to play the superpowers against one another to perpetuate their hold on power the momentous changes in south africa were also highly encouraging because they averted widely expected and potentially very violent revolution many anticipated that stable south africa would soon become an engine of growth for the economies of much of the subsaharan region several african countries were already welladvanced in free market economic reforms that they had undertaken at the behest of western aid donors consequently by the mid1990s despite slow growth in the region as whole gdp growth rates in several countries were exceeding population growth rates and some were achieving annual gdp increases of 5 or better political reforms were also beginning in many of africas authoritarian states because of mounting demands for democratization from opposition movements and donors in some countries national political conferences convened and diverse interests in africas growing civil society were represented including human rights organizations nascent political parties and churches multiple political parties were permitted in countries that had been oneparty states for years and elections that seemed generally free and fair began to be held these developments brought favorable reactions

half of the 1990s have faded in part as result of disappointment over the course of african democratization some of africas authoritarian leaders learned to manipulate the electoral process and divide the opposition creating what one authority larry diamond calls pseudo democracies diamond argues that the governments of kenya gabon and cameroon have played catandmouse game with international donors liberalizing politically in response to pressure while repressing as much as they can get away with in order to hang on to power53 disappointed richard joseph wrote in 1998 that africas democratic opening at the beginning of the decade had resulted with few exceptions in virtual democracies these may have the surface characteristics of liberal democracy such as regularly scheduled elections but their governments systematically stifle opposition behind mask of legitimacy54 more recently events in zimbabwe and côte divoire two countries with significant econo mic potential if political

administrations subsaharan africa became distinct item on the foreign policy agenda in 1958 when president eisenhower authorized the creation of bureau of african affairs in the department of state82 over the years africa policy has often been the subject of controversy with debate typically centering on whether particular administration was doing too much or too little with respect to an issue such as apartheid in south africa african development or the sovietcuban role these controversies cannot be reviewed in any detail here but the principal issues faced by successive administrations can be briefly noted the eisenhower administration confronted its first african crisis in 1960 with the congo rebellion which it feared would be exploited by the soviet union the administration supported the deployment of peacekeeping force which the soviets initially agreed to but then turned against the kennedy administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30029crs21 83richard d mahoney jfk ordeal in

the united states gave extensive covert aid to suppress rebellions thought to be communistinspired or of potential benefit to the soviet union84 it was during this period that mobutu seseseko with us

over the emergence of another vietnam prevented deeper involvement in the nixon and ford admini strations 19691977 the africa policy focus shifted to southern africa and the violent upheavals affecting angola mozambique and rhodesia political controversy over africa policy sharpened considerably in these years as critics came to believe that policymakers were too sympathetic to the white minority regimes however henry kissinger the most influential policymaker of the period believed that the soviet union was following policy of ruthless opportunism and adventurism in africa and elsewhere and this view goes far toward explaining africa policy during the period85 when congress banned further involvement in angola in 1975 kissinger claimed that it was unwilling to confront soviet expansionism86 president jimmy carters administration 19771981 brought new emphasis on human rights to us foreign policy resulting in strong push for majority rule in zimbabwe advocacy of independence for namibia and heavy criticism of apartheid in south africa mobutu was also pressed for economic and political reforms but zaire policy like africa policy generally continued to be constrained by cold war considerations the administration did not react to the liberia coup in 1980 perhaps because reports of human rights violations and corruption had discredited the
