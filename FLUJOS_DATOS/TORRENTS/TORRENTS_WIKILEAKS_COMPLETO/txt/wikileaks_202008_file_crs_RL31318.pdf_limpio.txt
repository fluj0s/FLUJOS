finance government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31318business investment and repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax summary with the us economy either stuck in recession or entering what some analysts anticipate will be protracted period of sluggish recovery congress is considering various proposals to stimulate the economy one such proposal hr 3090 which the house narrowly passed on october 24 2001 contains variety of individual and business tax cuts including repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax camt this report assesses the likely stimulative effect of repealing the camt central aim of the camt is to prevent corporations that report substantial profits to shareholders from paying little or federal income tax current tax law requires corporations to compute their tax liabilities under the regular income tax and camt and pay whichever is greater though it adheres to many of the rules of the regular tax the camt applies lower and fixed statutory rate to broader definition of taxable income and less generous set of deductions differences in the timing of certain deductions especially for depreciation allowances account for much of the increase in tax liability under the camt firms paying the camt are granted credit for those payments which may be used only to offset future regular taxes it appears that both the absolute and relative importance of the camt as source of federal revenue shrank in the 1990s in 1998 the most recent year for which data are available camt payments totaled 33 billion their lowest level since 1987 the first year of the tax similarly the camts share of total corporate income tax revenue was 18 in 1998 down from peak of 84 in 1990 these declines are thought to stem from three significant modifications to the tax enacted in the 1990s and the procyclical nature of the tax income taxes affect business investment mainly through their impact on the cost of capital increases in taxation raise this cost decreasing the number of investment projects that are undertaken and vice versa owing to its design the camt may or may not increase firms cost of capital relative to the regular income tax key determinants of its effect on this cost include firms initial tax status the duration of its exposure to the camt the assets being purchased and financing method because the camt appears to have an ambiguous effect on the cost of capital its repeal would be likely to affect business investment primarily through increasing the cash flow of firms affected by the camt although increased cash flow often is associated with rising business investment current economic conditions make it unlikely that an increase in the cash flow of the corporations paying the camt would lead to substantial shortterm increase in this investment many economists contend the adoption of temporary investment tax incentives eg oneyear 30 expensing allowance for purchases of equipment would be likely to impart bigger stimulus to shortterm business investment at lower budgetary cost repeal of the camt and immediate rebate of unused camt credits could improve the economys longterm growth prospects but it would do little to spur growth in the short run this report provides background information and will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31318contents structure of the corporate

corporate alternative minimum tax reacting to signs that the us economy has sunk into recession that may have been exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the 107th congress is considering various proposals for stimulating shortterm economic growth in the aftermath of the attacks the federal reserve has lowered the federal funds interest rate in stages from 35 to 175 and congress and the bush administration have agreed on measures to provide 40 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for national security and rescue and rebuilding efforts and 20 billion in grants and loan guarantees for us air carriers at the moment two key issues facing lawmakers are whether addition stimulus measures should be adopted and if so what form they should take it appears that the longest peacetime expansion of the us economy in history has ended during the first three quarters of 2001 gdp grew at an anemic annual rate of 04 and the latest estimate by the commerce department indicates that gdp contracted at an annual rate of 11 in the third quarter of 20011 principal factor in the sharp decline in us economic growth since mid2000 has been contraction in business investment from the third quarter of 2000 to the third quarter of 2001 real fixed nonresidential investment fell 60 while real gdp expanded 06 similarly the unemplo yment rate which reached an expansion low of 39 in september 2000 rose to 58 in december 2001 moreover the national bureau of economic researchs business cycle dating committee the unofficial arbiter of shifts in the us business cycle recently announced that recession began in march 2001 precisely 10 years to the month that the previous recession ended2 there is however some evidence that the recession may prove mild and short lived the commerce department reports that gdp rose by revised 14 annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the unemployment rate dipped to 56 in january 2002 as the number of jobs lost was much less than expected some analysts contend that these and other recent economic data undermine the argument that further fiscal stimulus is needed to spark an economic expansion in 20023httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31318crs2 4for more details on economic stimulus legislation in the 107th congress see crs issue brief ib10068 major tax issues in the 107th congress by david l brumbaugh 5the projected revenue loss from repeal shrinks between fy2002 and fy2011 because camt credits that would be claimed over that period under current law would be refunded in one lump sum in fy2002 under hr 3090 as passed by the housea central focus of the congressional debate over the need for added economic stimulus has been the desirability of variety of proposed tax cuts on top of those already enacted through the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 on october 24 2001 the house narrowly passed an economic stimulus package hr 3090 the economic security and recovery act of 20014 the measure contained variety of individual and business income tax cuts including threeyear 30 expensing allowance for business purchases of certain assets and repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax camt coupled with an immediate refund of unused or accumulated camt credits on the whole it would reduce taxes by an estimated 995 billion in fy2002 and by an estimated 1594 billion from fy2002 to fy2011 the estimated revenue loss from the repeal of the camt is 254 billion in fy2002 and 241 billion from fy2002 to 20115 following partisan debate over the best approach to reviving the economy the senate finance committee approved along party lines an amended version of hr 3090 on november 8 2001 that would result in smaller reduction in federal tax collections over 10 years 522 billion its smaller budgetary cost reflects the fact that it would provide fewer and smaller cuts in business taxes than the version passed by the house the full senate has yet to consider the measure mainly because it has failed to attract the support of 60 senators which is the minimum number of votes needed to pass legislation that would violate budget agreements the impasse over senate action on hr 3090 has spawned other efforts to enact an economic stimulus package seeking compromise that achieves his main priorities president bush proposed in middece mber 2001 an economic stimulus package that would be less costly than the housepassed version of hr 3090 the proposal included combinatio n of individual and business income tax cuts but it would not repeal the camt acting with dispatch the house passed bill incorporating many elements of the presidents plan hr 3529 the economic security and worker assistance act of 2001 on december 20 2001 the measure would among other things substantially reduce the burden of the camt by eliminating the adjustment for depreciation allowances and the 90 limitations on the use of net operating loss deductions and foreign tax credits under the camt once again though the senate has yet to consider the measure largely because of partisan disagreements over how best to revive the economy these disagreements have resurfaced in the second session of the 107th congress on february 6 2002 the senate passed by unanimous consent an amended version of hr 622 that would extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks after failing to agree on variety of individual and business tax cuts eight days later the house passed modified version of hr 622 that included many of the tax cuts contained in hr 3529 the attempt to eliminate the camt or sharply curtail its impact has rekindled longstanding debate over the economic effects of the tax on the one hand those in favor of repealing the camt argue that doing so would spur economic growth byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31318crs3 6the addon tax was equal to 15 of the excess of certain corporate tax preferences over the greater of firms regular income tax liability or 10000 it functioned like an excise tax on set of tax preferences above certain amount 7the taxpayer relief act of 1997 exempted small corporations from the amt beginning in 1998 small corporations are defined as corporations whose average annual gross receipts do not exceed 5 million in the three tax years before the exemption is first claimed they remain exempt as long as their average annual gross receipts do not exceed 75 million in each succeeding threeyear period 8the rate for the amt is 20 by contrast the regular corporate income tax has graduated continuedenabling corporations to hire more workers and invest more in plant and equipment particularly during periods of weak or declining sales on the other hand opponents of repeal maintain that getting rid of the tax would do little to boost business investment but would enable numerous large profitable corporations to avoid paying federal income tax undermining the progressivity of the federal income tax and harm the longterm outlook for the federal budget without addressing the question of whether additional fiscal stimulus is needed to pull the us economy out of recession in 2002 this report assesses the potential stimulative effect of repeal of the camt it begins with description of the structure of the tax and moves on to discuss its importance as source of federal revenue and which firms pay it the report then examines what is known about the effect of the camt on business investment incentives and concludes with an evaluation of its potential effectiveness as an economic stimulus tool structure of the corporate alternative minimum tax the camt originated with the tax reform act of 1986 which eliminated an addon minimum tax imposed on corporations under the tax reform act of 1969 and replaced it with minimum tax that has evolved into the current camt6 in general minimum taxes are intended to raise income tax paymen ts from taxpayers who are thought to pay too little tax relative to their incomes because of preferences in the regular income tax code central aim of the camt since its inception has been to prevent corporations that report substantial profits under generally accepted principles of financial accounting from paying little or federal corporate income tax under current federal tax law all corporations except those that are relatively small in revenue size are required to compute their regular income tax and camt liabilities and pay whichever is larger7 in essence the camt constitutes separate and distinct tax system in that it has its own rules for the measurement of income the determination of deductions and the treatment of such key corporate tax attributes as the basis of depreciable assets value of inventory net operating losses nols and foreign tax credits though it follows many of the rules of the regular tax the amt applies relatively low but fixed statutory rate to broader definition of taxable income and less generous set of deductions8 many business tax credits availablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31318crs4 8continued rate structure that ranges from 15 on taxable income up to 50000 to 35 on taxable income over 183 million many large corporations subject to the regular tax pay the maximum rate of 35 9for the purpose of the amt corporation is required to compute its nols on the basis of its amt taxable income in past years rather than its regular taxable income 10the exemption phases out for corporations with alternative minimum taxable incomes between 150000 and 310000under the regular tax eg the research and experimentation tax credit the investment credit and the orphan drug credit cannot be used to reduce amt tax liability nor can these credits be used to reduce regular tax liability below minimum tax liability before allowable credits calculating the amt involves some complicated steps the starting point is corporations taxable income before nol under the regular tax this amount is then modified by series of calculations known as adjustments and preferences generally these calculations entail the use of less generous methods of determinin g certain deductions and the disallowance of certain tax preferences their combined effect is to increase firms regular taxable income adjustments can either raise or lower corporate minimum taxable income whereas removing preferenc enters the equation only to the extent that such correction increases this taxable income adjustments include portion of accelerat ed depreciation on buildings and equipment amortization of pollution control facilities 75 of the difference between adjusted current earnings ace and alternative minimum taxable income amti mining exploration and development expenditures income reported under the contract method of accounting and installment sales income preferences include percentage depletio n allowances intangible drilling costs deductions for bad debt held by financial institutions and taxexempt interest on certain bonds after adding the sum of adjustments and preferences to its regular taxable income corporation is allowed to reduce that amount by up to 90 by subtracting nols carried back or forward from other years9 this step results in the corporations amti firm is then allowed maximum exemption from amti of 4000010 whatever amount remains after the exemption is multiplied by 20 to yield corporations tentative minimum tax before credits foreign tax credits calculated according to amt principles and using the amt tax rate may be taken against this tentative minimum tax but the combination of foreign tax credits and nols may offset more than 90 of the tax otherwise owed the result is the tentative alternative minimum tax tamt which is compared to the corporations regular tax liability before all business credits except the foreign tax credit if the tamt is larger then the firm pays the excess as its amt and the remainder as its regular tax but if its regular tax liability exceeds its tamt the firm may further lower its regular tax to equal its tamt by claiming allowable business credits this rule is noteworthy because it means that the camt can increase the tax liability ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31318crs5 11andrew b lyon cracking the code making sense of the corporate alternative minimum tax washington brookings institution 1997 p 25 12ibid p 25 13the sum of these two adjustments exceeds 100 because other adjustments notably the basis adjustment may be negative see curtis p carlson who pays the corporate alternative minimum tax results from corporate panel data for 19871998 washington department of the treasury nov 10 2001 table 12 p 18 14this equivalence is the result of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 for property placed in service after 1986 and before 1999 recovery periods under the amt ranged from the same as under the regular tax to over twice as longcorporations that have large amounts of business credits but pay camt by delaying the use of these credits11 differences in the timing of certain deductions account for much of the increase in firms tax liability under the camt in general these deductions are taken sooner under the regular tax however in the absence of system of credits or adjustments to the basis of depreciable assets the camt could end up collecting taxes worth more than the value of the timing advantages provided by the regular tax12 to prevent such an overpayment current tax law grants firms paying the camt tax credit for their camt payments and provides separate measure of the basis of depreciable assets under the camt the camt tax credit may be used only to offset future regular tax liability and can be carried forward indefinitely moreover the credit may not be used to reduce firms regular tax liability below its tamt which is the same floor limiting the use of most business credits under the regular tax if firm were to respond similarly over time to the camt and to the regular tax and if it were to pay the camt over five tax years and then claim all its camt credits in the next five tax years its total tax liability over the 10 years would be the same as it would be if the firm were to pay the regular tax only in that period this equivalence indicate s that the camt results in an acceleration of income tax payments it also implies that the credit is intended to keep firms moving in and out of camt status from paying double tax on income that is deferred under the regular tax but recognized earlier under the camt because of the adjustments and preferences in effect the net cost of the camt to firm is the cost of financing this prepayment of tax liability owing to the design of the camt firms with large amounts of adjustments or preferences or large amounts of nols or foreign tax credits relative to their current income are likely to be subject to the camt in given tax year most firms that pay the tax do so because of the camt depreciation adjustment and the ace adjustment in 1998 the former accounted for 80 of the combined value of adjustments and preferences and the latter for 3013 while cost recovery periods for depreciable assets under the regular tax and the camt have been identical since january 1 1999 depreciation methods for many types of equipment are more accelerated under the regular tax than the camt14 specifically property eligible for the 200 declining balance method under the regular tax must be depreciated using the slower 150 declining balance method under the camt as result the firms most likely to payhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31318crs6

minimum tax 16carlson who pays the corporate alternative minimum tax table 3 p 11 17ibid p 5the camt in given tax year are those that invest heavily in plant and equipment relative to earnings during periods of slow or negative growth in revenues importance and incidence of the corporate alternative minimum tax it appears that the absolute and relative importance of the camt as source of federal revenue shrank considerably in the 1990s15 in 1998 the most recent year for which detailed published data are available camt payments totaled 33 billion their smallest amount since 1987 the first year of the tax16 camt payments peaked at 81 billion in 1990 when the us economy was last in recession and decreased gradually through 1998 the camts share of total corporate income tax revenue has also been falling in 1998 it accounted for 18 of total federal income taxes paid by corporations its lowest share ever and down from peak of 84 in 1990 in addition 1998 marked the fourth consecutive year in which redemptions of camt credits by corporat ions exceeded camt payments the value of accumulated camt credits stood at 229 billion the lowest level since 1992 this decline in the importance of the camt as source of revenue appears to stem from several significant changes to the tax enacted in the 1990s and the pro cyclical nature of the tax the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra93 repealed the depreciatio n component of the ace adjustment for assets placed in service after 1993 and as previously noted the taxpayer relief act of 1997 removed differences in the cost recovery periods for depreciable assets under the camt and the regular tax and repealed the camt for small corporations the design of the camt makes the tax procyclical in that camt payments tend to decrease during periods of sustained economic expansion such as most of the 1990s when regular corporate tax liabilities rise relative to camt liabilities and to increase during periods of economic contraction firms are affected by the camt either by having to pay it or having their use of tax credits limited by the tentative minimum tax the number of corporations affected by the camt reached low of 30226 in 1998 or 33 fewer than the number affected in 1990 of the corporations affected in 1998 61 or 18352 made camt payments while the remaining 39 or 11847 were constrained in their use of business tax credits at any rate very few corporations are affected by the camt in given tax year in 1998 for example they accounted for 2 of all corporations filing federal income tax returns large proportion of firms paying the camt typically are in loss status for the regular corporate income tax in 1998 for example about 62 of firms paying the camt were in such status17 nevertheless the duration of camt exposure appears to be brief carlson found that about halfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31318crs7 18ibid table 14 p 19 19ibid p 5 20ibid table 8 p 15of sample of 9012 firms with assets greater than 50 million and for which continuous tax return data are available were unaffected by camt in the six years from 1993 to 1998 whereas less than 9 of the firms were affected by the camt in five or six of the years in that period18 one useful measure of the burden of business tax is the percentage of firms or industrys assets subject to it by this measure it appears that the camt imposes significant burden on the corporate sector in 1998 firms affected by the camt accounted for 27 of corporate assets but represented only 2 of the number of corporations filing federal tax returns this disparity implies that large firms pay most of the camt in fact between 1987 and 1998 firms with assets over 1 billion accounted for between 64 and 78 of camt payments19 and in 1998 only 05 of firms with assets of less than 1 million were affected by the camt whereas 26 of firms with assets over 1 billion were affected not only does the incidence of the camt vary by firm size but it also differs by industry generally differences among industries in who pays the tax are due to variations among industries over time in profits concentration of firm sizes and investment in equipment in 1998 the proportion of firms in major industries affected by the camt ranged from 07 in services to nearly 7 in utilities20 the tax seems to impose the biggest burden on firms in four industries manufacturing mining transportation and warehousing and utilities in 1998 51 of assets in manufacturing were held by firms affected by the camt in mining the share was 47 in transportation and warehousing 37 and in utilities 32 impact of the corporate alternative minimum tax on business investment incentives business executives weigh numerous factors in making investme nt decisions among the important ones are the cost of capital expected returns on alternative investment projects current and expected future operating profits future demand for their firms output the location of investment the best production technology to employ likely actions of competitors local state and federal government regulations and future changes in them and taxes in such complex environment executives assess these factors and then decide whether the expected aftertax return on proposed investment project justifies its risk and cost in theory income taxes affect business investment mainly through their impact on the cost of capital this cost which includes the opportunity cost of funds can be thought of as the return an investment project must earn in order to break even rational investors would want to undertake projects whose expected rates of return exceed the cost of capital and to abandon projects whose expected rates of return fallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31318crs8 below this cost all other things being equal taxation of the returns to new investments raises the cost of capital and as this cost rises fewer investment projects are undertaken of course taxation of the income generated by new investments can be made more or less favorable to the owners of firm by altering the rules governing this taxation the more favorable the tax treatment the lower the cost of capital for new investment in addition income taxes can influence business investment by increasing or decreasing the cash flow of firms that rely heavily on internal funds to finance investments for such firms access to debt or equity markets is extremely limited or nonexistent how does the camt affect firms incentive to invest because the camt constitutes parallel income tax system the question should be answered in the context of the investment incentives of firms under the regular tax at first glance it appears that the net effect of the camt is inescapably ambiguous on the one hand the cost of an investment is recovered slower under the camt than under the regular tax which implies that firm paying the camt has higher cost of capital than it would if it were to pay the regular tax on the other hand income from new investment is taxed at flat 20 rate under the camt as opposed to top marginal rate of 35 under the regular tax this difference implies that the cost of capital for firm paying the camt typically is lower than that of firm subject to the regular tax it may seem paradoxical that the camt has the potential to lower firms cost of capital for new investment when firms subject to the camt by definitio n have higher tax liabilities than firms subject to the regular tax in particular tax year but just because the camt increases firms average tax rate which of course is the rate that applies to the returns on past investments does not mean that in theory the tax cannot also give firm subject to it lower cost of capital for new investment projects than firm subject to the regular tax the incentive to pursue new investment projects is significantly affected by the tax treatment of their expected returns further analysis appears to confirm that the camt ultimately has an indeterminate effect on the corporate investment incentives relative to the regular tax this uncertain ty arises mainly from the mix of factors that determines how the tax affects the cost of capital for new investment their multitud of possible combinations and the great difficulty firms face in accurately predicting shifts from camt status to regular tax status and vice versa and the duration of exposure to each tax the primary factors are firms initial tax status the method of financing the type of asset purchased and the duration and timing of camt exposure few examples can illustrate the ambiguous impact of the camt on business investment in analyzing the relative effects of the camt and regular tax on the cost of capital for new investment three scenarios are relevant 1 firm that is permanently subject to the camt 2 firm that undertakes an investment project when it is subject to the camt and switches to the regular tax while the project continues to generate earnings and 3 firm that undertakes an investment project when it is subject to the regular tax and switches to the camt while the project continues to generate earnings large firm permanently subject to the camt has lower cost of capital for new investments than large firm that permanently pays the regular tax because the rate of the camt is 43 lower than the maximum rate of the regular tax 20 versus 35 but if the same firm were to purchase newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31318crs9 21lyons cracking the code pp 8193 22ibid p 86 23ibid pp 9192equipment with relatively short useful life for tax purposes when it was subject to the camt and then switch to the regular tax three years later and remain on it indefinitely its cost of capital would rise relative to the camt firm in the first scenario because the initial depreciation deductions would be taken at lower rate as result of temporary exposure to the camt but significant share of the returns on the investment probably would be taxed at higher rate as result of the switch to the regular tax finally if the firm were to purchase the same equipment while subject to the regular tax and then switch to the camt three years later and remain on it indefinitely its cost of capital would fall relative to the camt firm in the first scenario because the opposite effects would prevail initial depreciation deductions would be taken at higher rate because of the regular tax but much of the income from the investment would be taxed at the lower rate of the camt 1997 study by economist andrew b lyon the present deputy assistant secretary of the treasury for tax analysis shed further light on the uncertain effects of the camt on business investment incentives among other things he estimated and compared the cost of capital net of depreciation for investment under different financing methods in major categories of assets by firm subject to the camt over varying periods and by firm permanently facing the regular tax21 he found that under preobra93 tax law the cost of capital was significantly higher for firm paying the camt over five consecutive years investing in equipment and intangible capital such as rd and financing onethird of the investment with debt but the cost of capital was the same or slightly lower for camt firm investing in structures inventory and land and financing onethird of the investment with debt22 lyon also estimated the cost of capital for investment in equipment financed solely with equity for firm paying the camt over five years and firm permanently paying the regular tax under two other scenarios 1 the changes in the camt introduced by obra93 and 2 an approximation of the changes in camt introduced by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 despite these changes in tax law which reduced the burden of the camt on corporate income the cost of capital for the camt firm was still larger but the gap was twothirds what it was under pre obra93 tax law23 in addition lyon found that durations of camt liability from five to 10 years raised the cost of capital for camt firm more than shorter durations did and that the cost of capital for debtfinanced investment was increased more by the camt than the cost of capital for equityfinanced investment how might firms respond to the reduced investment incentives associated with camt exposure at least three possibilities are likely first firms could curtail investment in equipment and intangible capital during periods of camt liability there is some evidence that such response occurs lyon estimated that from 1988 to 1992 firms that paid the amt in one year invested 5 less in the following yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31318crs10 24ibid p 123 25ibid p 124 26ibid p 126than they would have if they had paid the regular tax in both years24 second firms anticipating switch from regular tax status to camt status and vice versa may alter the timing of their investments in equipment and intangible assets so that the investments take place when they pay the regular tax such response could involve either postponement of investment by firm currently paying the camt or an acceleration of investment by firm currently paying the regular tax third firms subject to the camt for an extended period may find it more advantageous to lease assets than to purchase them through leasing firm with camt status can in theory obtain capital at cost similar to that of firms subject to the regular tax if the lessor pays the regular tax the lessee should be able to lease an asset at price that reflects the investment incentives of the regular tax assuming that the rental market for the asset is perfectly competitive25 it is unclear which response if any prevails what seems clear however is that regardless of the extent to which the camt reduces firms incentive to invest there is reason to believe that the tax causes permanent decline in the economys capital stock firms facing camt status may alter the timing of their investments so that they are made during periods when they pay the regular tax or they may expand their reliance on leasing to acquire new plant and equipment in addition as lyon has noted reductions in investment by firms paying the camt could be offset by increased investment by firms in the same or other industries that are subject to the regular income tax26 such an outcome is possible in part because for some investments the cost of capital is lower for firms facing the regular tax and firms subject to the camt are more likely to have difficulties financing new investments out of retained earnings likely stimulative effect of repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax in view of the consensus among economists that the us economy is either still in recession or entering period of weak recovery and given that key factor behind the recent downturn has been sharp drop in business investment spending since mid2000 how much economic activity is likely to be stimulated by repeal of the camt in the short run most economists agree that an effective stimulus package would consider the current state of the economy as well as the outlook for the federal budget ideally in their view it would spur substantial new economic activity in the short run without indirectly restraining this activity by driving up longterm interest rates moreover such package would expand automatically if downturn turns out to last longer and be more severe than expected but phase out automatically when the economy begins to grow again these principles imply that if stimulus package is to be built aroundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31318crs11 27in its latest assessment of the outlook for the federal budget the congressional budget office projects that the budget will run small deficits in fy2002 and fy2003 and that the cumulative surplus in fiscal years 2002 through 2011 will total 16 trillion or 4 trillion less than the surplus projected in january 2001 28according to data reported recently by the board of governors of the federal reserve system us industrial production fell by 5 between the first quarter of 2000 and the fourth quarter of 2001 the us industrial capacity utilization rate was 9 lower in the fourth quarter of 2001 than in the first quarter of 2002 and total financial assets held by us nonfinancial corporations were 317 billion greater at the end of the third quarter of 2001 than continuedtax incentives for business investme nt the incentives should be targeted at new investment projects rather than both old and new projects they also imply that the tax incentives should be in place long enough to stimulate an upturn in business investment but not so long that they put upward pressure on longterm interest rates through their effect on federal revenues in the context of the current outlook for the federal budget in the next 10 years permanent tax cut is more likely to put upward pressure on longterm interest rates than temporary tax cut tied to the level of overall economic activity27 rise in these rates in response to an economic stimulus plan would dampen its effect on total output and employment by curtailing spending that is sensitive to changes in longterm interest rates such as residential and nonresidential investment and consumer purchases of new motor vehicles how does repeal of the camt as proposed in hr 3090 measure up to these principles in word poorly there are two reasons for such poor fit first repeal of the camt would be permanent business tax reduction not temporary one as result it would exact higher budgetary cost than temporary tax cut aimed at stimulating business investmen t second an elimination of the camt accompanied by an immediate rebate of accumulated camt credits would affect the returns on both old and new investments in fact it would benefit certain corporations regardless of whether they increase investment in the short run as such it would be less effective in spurring new economic activity in the short run than tax cut targeted at new investments only these considerations suggest that repeal of the camt would be likely to stimulate relatively small increase in business investment in the short run other considerations seem to reinforce this conclusion as discussed in the previous section the camts overall effect on the user cost of capital is ambiguous thus its repeal would be likely to stimulate business investment mainly through the mechanism of increasing the cash flow of firms that are affected by it in the short run getting rid of the tax and refunding unused camt credits would decrease the average tax rate for corporate income as whole putting more funds in the hands of corporate executives to use as they see fit but under current economic conditions it is unlikely that all or most of whatever infusion of cash would result from repeal of the camt would be spent on new investment primary problem facing many firms selling in the us market today is that their customers are reducing or not increasing their purchases for the average us nonfinancial corporation pressing concern nowadays appears to be not shortage of cash and other liquid financial assets but shortage of demand for its goods and services28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31318crs12 28continued at the end of the first quarter of 2000 29see jane gravelle using business tax cuts to stimulate the

economic stimulus bills as passed by the house and pending in the senate hr 3090 washington dec 5 2001in the face of such problem significant boost in the cash flow of the corporate sector is more likely to be used to for purposes other than the purchase of new plant or equipment possible alternative uses include reduction in debt increased dividend payments acquisitions of assets held by other firms and repurchases of stock to boost its price furthermore while an increase in cash flow may boost investment by firms that are cashconstrained there is reason to question that many of the corporations that would benefit from repeal of the camt are in such position especially in current economic conditions small fledgling firms are more likely to have difficulty raising capital for new investment in debt or equity markets than large established firms for the latter group of firms the cost of external funds is significantly greater than the cost of internal funds yet large firms are much more likely to be affected by the camt than small firms in 1998 for example firms with assets valued at 500 million or more accounted for 73 of camt payments conventional economic analysis indicates that repeal of the camt would be likely to stimulate less investment in the short run than temporary tax cuts targeted at new investment such measures include temporary investment tax credit or temporary accelerated depreciation for the cost of new plant and equipment eg partial expensing of this cost as proposed in hr 3090 as passed by the house and the senate finance committee they are likely to be more effective in spurring economic growth in the short run by inducing firms to accelerate planned investment projects to take advantage of the temporary tax breaks firms that elect to build new plants or purchase new equipment now rather than in the distant future expand national output and employment by purchasing materials equipment and services from other firms in addition recent reports by the congressional budget office and crs conclude that temporary investment tax incentives are also likely to have greater bang for the buck than repeal of the camt29 according to revenue estimates prepared by the congressional joint committee on taxation repeal of the camt accompanied by an immediate refund of unused camt credits would reduce federal revenues by 241 billion from fy2002 to fy2011 whereas oneyear 10 expensing allowance for the purchase of shortlived capital assets would have revenue cost of only 22 billion in the same period30 of course there is certainty that such incentives will work as intended their impact on business investment could be limited at time when many firms have significant holdings of liquid financial assets there is excess capacity aggregate demand is falling or stagnant and many corporate managers are averse to doing anything that would make their firms current profit statements look worse than they already arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31318crs13 this is not to suggest that there would be economic benefits from repealing the camt by lowering the federal tax burden on corporate capital and lessening the uncertainty faced by firms that move on and off the tax repeal could lead to increased business investment and more efficient use of resources in the long run it would also significantly lower the cost and complexity of administering the federal tax code but these potential gains are likely to emerge over the long run and would do little to raise economic growth in the short run
