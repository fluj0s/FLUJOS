weaknesses it examines the state of usgerman cooperation including problems and prospects for future cooperation th is report may be updated as needed although somewhat overshadowed in the public view by the strong and vocal disagreements over iraq policy usgerma n cooperation in the global fight against international terrorism has been extensive german support is particularly important because several qaeda members and 911 plotters lived there and the country is key hub for the transnational flow of persons and goods domestically germany faces the challenge of having sizable population of muslims some with extremist views whom terrorists might seek to recruit german counterterrorism stra tegy shares number of elements with that of the united states although there are clear di fferences in emphasis like the united states germany now sees radical islamic terrorism as its primary national security threat and itself as potential target of attack today germany also recognizes that threats to its domestic security lie fa r beyond its own borders in places such as afghanistan germany has introduced number of polic legislative and organizational reforms since 911 to make the country less hospitable to potential terrorists despite these reforms critics point to continuing problems hampering germanys domestic efforts german law enforcement and intelligence communities face more bureaucratic hurdles stricter constraints and closer oversight than those in many other countries the german government has sent troops in to combat beyond europe for the first time since world war ii currently ge rmany has about 7800 troops based abroad of which some forty percent are directly engaged in counterterror missions in afghanistan some 2300 german so ldiers participate in the international security assistance force isaf germanys role in afghanistans stabilization and reconstruction is substantial german military efforts have been hampered to some extent by delays in implementing military reforms to make german forces more expeditionary key question for us german relations is whether differences on issues such as iraq policy shaped by different na tional interests prac tices and historical experiences will harm usgerman coope ration against terrorism some believe that understanding and accepting these differen ces agreeing to disagree may be the best approach

protection of the constitution in german httpwwwverfassungsschutzdedepublikationenallgemeine_infosabgabgpdfgermanys role in fighting terrorism implications for us policy overview historically germanys experience with terrorism has been predominantly with domestic groups since the 1970s germany has demonstrated both the willingness and capability to combat domestic sources of terrorism after the attacks of september 11 2001 however it became pparent to many within and outside germany that its traditional approaches were illsuited to dealing with the new threat of transnational radical islamic terrorism terrorists use of german territory to hatch the 911 plot served as wake up ca ll for many three of the hijackers lived and plotted in hamburg and other pa rts of germany for several years1 taking advantage of liberal asylum policies and the low levels of surveillance by authorities the german response to the 911 terrorist attacks against the united states was immediate and unprecedented in scope for that country setting aside its postworld war ii prohibition against deploying for ces outside of europe and overcoming pacifist leanings of some in the g overning coalition germany quickly offered military and other assistance to the united stat in his initial reaction to the attacks of 911 chancellor gerhard schroeder d eclared germanys unlimited solidarity with the united states on september 12 2001 the german government along with other us allies invoked nat article v paving the way for military assistance to the united states the chancellor gained approval from the german parliament to deploy troops to afghanistan with call for vote of confidence in his own government since then german efforts in the figh t against terrorism have expanded across wide spectrum germany has instituted significant policy legislative and organizational reforms bilateral coope ration with the united states has been extensive despite differences stemming from the distinct approaches and constraints in each country and frictions resulting fro m sharp disagreement over iraq policy the following sections examine the german domestic and international response to terrorism

bringing them to justice and breaking up their infrastructure at home and abroad assisting countries facing the da nger of becoming failed states addressing the social economic and cultural roots of terrorism halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction seeking multilateral legitimization for any military action through the united nations significantly germany now sees radical islamic terrorism as its primary security threat and itself as potential target of attack3 although german citizens have not been directly targeted by radical islamic terrorism to date they frequently have been its victims since september 11 2001 more ge rman citizens have died as victims of islamic terrorist attacks than in the entire history of domestic violence by the red army faction raf german terrorist group that operated for over thirty years4 germany has responded to the fact that it was center for the planning of the attacks of 911 key figures in the att acks were part of hamburg cell and the evidence suggests that terrorist cells even before 911 saw germany as one of the easier places in europe from which to operate terrorists were able to take advantage of germanys liberal asylum laws as well as strong privacy protections and rights of religious expression which shielded activities in islamic mosques from surveillance by authoritieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32710crs3 5 crs

april 26 2004in its efforts to combat terrorism germany has emphasized the need to ensure that all of its domestic and international actions are c onsistent with the countrys own laws values and historical lessons of the nazi era germany has given high priority to the protection of the civil ri ghts and liberties of all those residing in germany including noncitizens germans stress that this longstanding emphasis on civil rights should not be s een as lack of political w ill to target terrorists today5 however some observers are concerned that the german interpretation of its civil rights requirements could hinder the captu re and prosecution of important terror suspects although germany has contributed troops to internationa l operations german officials do not believe that military force can serve as the principal instrument to fight terrorism and do not even like to use the term war to describe the international response to global terrorism germany tends to stress soft power instruments such as diplom acy development assistance and addressing issues that can give rise to terrorism providing support for modernization resolving bitter regional conflicts rebuilding shattered structures is just as important as the work being done by the military the police and the secret services according to foreign minister joschka fischer6 chancellor schroeder has said that the foremost task of international politics is to prevent wars7 and that germany seeks peaceful resolution of international disputes as guiding principle some critics however see germanys stance against the use of force as unrealistic particularly when facing hard core islamic terrorist groups and rogue states germany also sees itself as limited in its ability to respond militarily to the threat of terrorism abroad both by its hist orical experience and by the fact that upon the reunification of the two germanies in 1990 germany formally pledged to use its military forces only within the framework of the charter although germany supported the unsanc tioned intervention in afghanistan to root out the taliban and qaeda th german government strongly opposed the us policy of broadening the war against terrorism to war against iraq chancellor schroeder argued that those who want to resolve the crisis with military means must have an answer to the question of whether this will help the global alliance against terrorism which include s about fifty moslem states or whether it will jeopardize this alliance or perhaps even destroy it8 from germanys perspective the war in iraq is intensifying the terrorist threat9 despite differences over iraq germany is viewed as key partner in the global war on terrorism in the wake of the 911 ttacks germany has redefined its

stability and combating terrorism are connected in german foreign policy domestic policy reform measures implemented the german government has taken extensive domestic measures against rrorism since 911 in the legal law enforcement financial and security realms the first step taken was to identify weaknesses in the laws that allowed some of the terrorists to live and plot in germany largely unnoticed after 911 germany adopted two major antiterrorism packages the first approved in november 2001 targeted l oopholes in german law that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in germany significant changes included 1 the immunity of religious groups and charities from investigation or surveillance by authorities was revoked as were their speci privileges under right of assembly allowing the government greater freedom to act against extremist groups 2 terrorists could now be prosecuted in german even if they belonged to foreign terrorist organizations acting only abroad 3 the ability of terrorists to enter and reside in germany was curt ailed and 4 border and air traffic security were strengthened the second package was aimed at improving the effectiveness and

2003 th budget for relevant security and intelligence authorities was increased by about 580 million13 the new laws provided the german intelligence and law enforcement agencies greater latitude to

was reached in june 2003 this effort is aimed at defending critical infrastructure such as power supplies and transportation and telecommuni cations grids in both the united states and germany steps are being taken to extend this cooperation to the protection of nuclear facilities58 moreover the united states and germany reached an agreement on increased legal cooperation in criminal ma tters in october 2003 bilateral cabinet level meetings are frequent germany plays an active role in the us container security initiative csi officials in washington dc and berlin si gned an agreement to improve bilateral cooperation on container security with the aim of stopping terrorists from smuggling weapons of mass destruction in seacargo containers us customs agents are stationed in germany to monitor suspici ous containers before they leave german harbors59 furthermore germany is an active member of the 14country core group of the proliferation security initiative psi this initiative is aimed at preventing the spread of materials that could be used to build weapons of mass destruction us and german intelligence cooperation led to izure of ship bound for libya in the mediterranean sea in october 2003 illicit nuc lear material aboard was confiscated60 some believe that b ilateral cooperati on is weaker in the field of information sharing for variety of reasons the ited states has security concerns about sharing sensitive information german author ities in turn fear that the united states will use sensitive shared information in ways that might conflict with germanys practices with regard to data protection and civil liberties61 also german critics claim that the us expectation of information sharing by others is not matched by us willingness to share with them recent example of the problems created by inadequate information sharing concerned two trials of suspects in the 911 attacks mounir motassadeq and abdelghani mzoudi were even tually acquitted by german federal court with the explanation that the united states had not made crucial evidence available62 after the department of justice forwarded the evidence requested by the german government the motassadeq trial was reopened on august 10 2004 what effect the information might have on the outco of the new trial is unclear httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32710crs14 63 sageman marc understanding terror

wall street journal november 282001usgerman cooperation in the area of information sharing mostly occurs on casebycase basis and is not based on formal governmental agreements some question whether this is adequate given the way that transnational terrorist networks operate some argue that it is necessary to target the entire terrorist infrastructure eg recruitment fund raising logistics and training63 shared database containing all available information regarding the most threatening persons might allow both countries to better track terrori st suspects to harmonize surveillance activities and to target travel by terrorists as was recommended by the us 911 commission apparently the only database s of such dangerous persons accessible to both governments are the lists of is lamic terrorist organizations and persons maintained by the and the eu64 sharply different perspectives on the deat h penalty have also hampered bilateral cooperation in some cases germany like all eu member count ries has abolished the death penalty german law does not allow extradition of person wanted by another country if there is possibility that the person might be executed if found guilty in previous cases germany extr adited suspects only after it had received assurances that the death penalty would not be imposed in 1998 germany arrested and extradited key suspect in the 1998 us embassy bombings in africa after us prosecutors agreed to waive the death penalty germany has interpreted its laws to forbid even provision of evidence relating to such case if that information might lead to the imposition of death sentence this became an issue when the united states sought to obtain documents from germany related to the case of zacarias moussaoui the socalled 20th hijacker the information was eventually supplied based on the understanding that the united st ates would agree not to seek the death penalty solely based on the evidence gained from germany65 still the death penalty issue remains potential impediment to cooperation in specific cases germany and the united states also di ffer on the question of the status of prisoners particularly the qaeda and taliban detainees in guantánamo bay germanys foreign minister joschka fischer and other politicians have argued that all detainees should be granted formal status as prisoners of war germans like other europeans have also criticized us plan s to use military tribunals to try at least some of the terrorist suspects such tribunals are seen as unnecessary and counterproductive by german officials some question has been raised whether terrorist suspects would be extradited by germany and other eu countries if they were likely to face military tribunal66 in the german view conduct of the fi ght against global terrorism requires multilateral coopera tion formally sanctioned by the relevant international organizations germans argue that most unilateral measures are illegitimate and ineffective

multilateralism to strengthen international support for us counterterrorism in itiatives from germanys perspective joint action on counterterrorism is also tied closely to joint decision making67 the us administration rejects any absolute commitment to multilateralism in terms of waiting for approval for an military action such policy would be seen in the united states as dangerous and unacceptable recipe for paralysis some criticize the german approach as too wedded to process over results especially when dealing with rogue states and weapons of mass destructi on while germany has declared wmd nonproliferation core element of its nati onal security strategy the german approach has been criticized by some for relying almost exclusively on positive engagement and avoiding conflict an approach that might not be very successful in influencing certain regimes or potential terrorists some observers believe that the german stan ce reflects the reality that th country presently lacks the military means or the political will to confront wmd states with anything other than soft power instruments such as diplomacy and economic levers some see complementarity in the differing us and german approaches the us has extensive military capabilities to deal with threats of terrorism while germany views its strengths in conflict prevention and recons truction this could mean for instance that germany might be better positioned to take on greater role in longterm reconstruction efforts in c ountries like afghanistan some argue that with better understanding of the potentia l complementary roles the two countries can play based on the strengths and dvantages of each new opportunities for enhanced cooperation in the global war on terrorism might be found the final report of the us 911 commission suggests that longterm success in the war against terrorism demands the use of all elements of national power including soft power instruments such as diplomacy intelligence and foreign aid key question is to what degree differences are likely to hamper usgerman cooperation against terrorism it could be argued that us and german security in the near and midterm are likely to be affected far more by what germany does to cooperate with the united stat in terms of domestic secu rity and bilaterally than by germanys stance on other internationa l issues lapses in german domestic surveillance or other shortcomings in german domestic policy could directly threaten us security for example according to statements from the bnd some dozen or so islamic militants capable of carrying out assaults may have left germany for iraq not too long ago68 therefore many question whet her the united states and germany can afford the risk of allowing international policy differences to lead to declining cooperation within th crucial arena of domestic security the united states and germany may see security threats through different lenses and responses to those threats ar shaped by different national interestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32710crs16 69 katzstein peter j same war different views germany japan and counterterrorism international

approach to enhancing future us german cooperation in the global war on terrorism close bilateral cooperation w ith the united states is important for germanys own global interests for the united states as well german cooperation against terrorism is likely to remain significant in light of germanys importance as european and world actor as key hub fo r the transnational flow of persons and
