family and medical leave act of 1993 fmla as means of helping individuals more easily balance their family and work obligations over the past few decades married mothers with young children increasingly have strived to fulfill both workplace and childrearing obligations with the enactment of welfare reform legislation greater numbers of single parents also have had to meet the challenge of caring for their children while holding down jobs further the aging of the population and lengthening life spans have made it more likely that workers will assume caregiving duties for elderly

or foster child the fmla prescribes minimum benefit employees in jurisdictions that have enacted more comprehensive family and medical leave statutes eg provide leave for reasons beyond those in pl 1033 and those who work for employers that offer more expansive family and medical leave eg provide longer period of absence are entitled to the more generous benefits this report begins with brief

the statute is 12 workweeks in 12month period employees caring for their own or an eligible relatives serious health condition can take their leave time intermittently or work reduced schedule eg fewer hours per day they must obtain their employers agreement to use their leave in this manner for the two other fmla qualifying reasons in those cases where the need for intermittent or reduced schedule leave is foreseeable employees must cooperate with their employers to schedule it to avoid disrupting business operations employers must grant and account for intermittent leave in the

employee s are to provide their employers with 30 days notice if the need for leave is unanticipated employees are to provide notice as soon as practicable which the labor department has interpreted to mean within two business days of employees realizing the need for time off employees should provide employers with enough information to allow them to determine whether the leave is for fmlaqualifying reason but employees do not have to refer to the fmla when notifying employers in those cases in which employees did not make employers aware that they were absent from work for an fmla reason and in which employees want the absence to be counted toward their entitlement employees are to give employers timely notice of their desire ie within two business days of returning to work employers must within two business days of having received an employees notice of need for leave provide them with written notice stating that the leave will count against their fmla entitlement detailing whether the employee must furnish medical certification and among other things explaining the employees right to substitute accrued paid leave for unpaid fmla leave and whether the employer is requiring such substitution the employees right to job restoration upon returning from leave and the employees obligation to make their share of premium payments for maintenance of employerprovided

and local government nd some federal employees believe their employer has violated the law eg by denying them leave under the statute or retaliating against them for having taken fmla leave they may file complaint with dols wage and hour division7 these employees also may bring private civil action without filing complaint the right of state employees to sue their employers for violations of the fmla was affirmed by the supreme court in may 2003 when it decided that state go vernments are subject to the act due to their history of sex discrimination 8 if after investigating complaint the wage and hour division cannot resolve the matter to its satisfaction the departments office of the solicitor may seek to compel compliance through the courts federal courts have considered the application of various aspects of the fmla including determination of employee eligibility and designation of leave under the act the supreme court decided in ragsdale v wolverine worldwide inc 535 us 81 2002 for example that the appropriate remedy for an employers failure to designate leave as falling under the fmla is not the automatic provision of an additional 12 weeks of time off the divided court held that employees have to prove they were harmed by the employers failure to notify them that their absence would be subtracted from their fmla entitlement in this instance the employee had taken the maximum amount of leave allowed by the company 30 weeks which is more than twice the acts mandated minimum the supreme courts decision overrides the dols regulation at 29 cfr 825700a which states that if employees take leave but the employer does not designate it as fmla leave the leave does not count against the 12week fmla entitlement the court noted that the duration of fmla leave was carefully balanced compromise which the regulation would have extended for some employees and that contrary ruling might have prompted employers with more generous leave pol icies to curtail them which would have been antithetical to the stated intent of lawmakers it is in part because of this ruling that the labor department put the fmla on its regulatory agenda

or more employerfriendly some of the proposals are examined below 7 in the case of congress and some congressional agencies eg the congressional budget office the office of compliance handles fmla enforcement some other legislative branch agencies eg the government accountability office and the library of congress handle fmla enforcement internally the office of personnel management issues the fmla regulations that cover executive branch employees they are not entitled to sue and can only obtain appellate judicial review of merit systems protection board decisions in the federal circuit 8

employees and employers about their experience with the fmla in the 1999 2000 period according to the surveys almost 90 million out of 144 million public and private sector employees worked at covered establishments and met the acts eligibility criteria in 1999 20009 that left 336 million who did not work at covered establishments and 215 million workers who although working for covered employ ers did not fulfill pl 1033s hoursofwork and lengthofservice requirements in other words almost two out of every five employees were not entitled to leave under the fmla during the survey period proponents of the fmlas approach to workfamily balance would like to extend it to additional workers to make the leave entitlement an option for more employees it has been suggested that the threshold for coverage of private sector employers be lowered from at least 50 to at least 25 employees other suggested ways to afford more employees the opportunity to take fmla leave include 1 eliminating the requirement that employees must have worked 1250 hours in the preceding 12 months 2 prorating the 12week leave entitlement based on the number of hours worked by parttime employees and 3 eliminating or reducing the requirement that employees must have been on an employers payroll for 12 months g20g142g138g156g152g151g156g561g143g152g155g561g14g142g138g159g142g561 broadening the situations for which fmla leave can be taken could well increase what some view as the laws low utilization rate according to the dol survey of employees those who took fmla leave in 19992000 accounted for 117 of all leavetakers and 19 of all employees10 the rate of leavetaking under pl 1033 according to dols survey of employers was 65 fmla leavetakers per 100 covered employees healthrelated problem was the explanation most often provided by employees in one study who took time off to care for family members nonetheless the reason accounted for minority 29 of employees absences associated with family caregiving11 another 26 of caregiving absences from work was related to the provision of transportation or other instrumental support for family members 22 to schoolchild care problems 15 to the provision of emotional or other support for family members 5 to the provision of elder care and 3 to coping with family members death thus some members of the public policy community have suggested that employees be able to use fmla leave for such reasons as attending parentteacher conferences participating in childrens educational and extracurricular activities taking children or elderly relatives to routine medical or dental appointments and participating in activities that result from domestic violence 9 us department of labor balancing the needs of families and employers family and

spouses or partners 7 for grandchildren and 24 for other family members the remaining 42 of employee absences were linked to caring for not only childs health but also for childs educational childcare and other needs12 reflecting the broad range of individuals to whom employees provide assistance it has been proposed that the care recipient groups under the statute be extended to include elderly relatives besides the employees own parents eg parentinlaw or grandparent domestic partners and nondisabled children age 18 or older employers could well oppose loosening firm coverage or employee eligibility requirements broadening the qualifying reasons or increasing the care recipient groups if these expansions were to increase utilization of the statute it would impose greater administrative and operational burden on more employers eg determining whether leave qualifies under the fmla and arranging for leavetakers duties to be accomplished while they are absent g18g138g146g141g561g14g142g138g159g142g561 about twothirds of employees who took leave for fmla reasons received some compensation during their absence principally through an employers sick leave plan according to the dol employee survey most paid leavetakers 72 received their full paychecks for the whole period but 58 of leavetakers who received or partial pay reported difficulty making ends meet lack of money was the reason offered most often by those who needed but did not take leave in 19992000 for fmla reasons three approaches have been advanced to provide employees with paid time off for all or some fmlaqualifying reasons they are briefly described below but not discussed further in this report see crs report rl34088 leave benefits in the united states by linda levine for further information one approach would amend the fair labor standards act of 1938 which requires private sector employers to pay an overtime premium to hourly employees who work more than 40 hours in week instead of giving employees their overtime in cash private employers would be allowed to offer them compensatory time off which employees could use for whatever reasons they saw fit eg for familyrelated reasons 13 another alternative would initiate demonstration grant program to assist states interested in supplementing the income of parents who take leave for such reasons as the birth or adoption of child or to care for newly born or adopted child or who leave their jobs to care for seriously ill infant see hr 1369 the family and medical leave expansion act for example the approach most recently advanced would require employers to provide leave with pay to employees caring for their own health and the health of other eligible 12 ibid note children included those of preschool and school age as well as adult children 13 for additional information see crs report rl31875 compensatory time vs cash wages amending the fair labor standards act by william g whittaker

condition that involves any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient care ie an overnight stay in hospital hospice or residential mental facility period of incapacity requiring absence of more than three consecutive days from work school or other regular daily activities that also involves continuing treatment by or under the supervision of health care provider14 any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care period of incapacity that is permanent or longterm due to chronic condition for which treatment may not be effective eg alzheimers disease severe stroke and the terminal stages of disease or any absences to receive multiple treatments including any period of recovery therefrom by or on referral by health care provider for condition that likely would result in incapacity of more than three consecutive days if left untreated eg chemotherapy and radiation for cancer physical therapy for severe arthritis and dialysis for kidney disease some have argued that the dol expanded the meaning of the term beyond the kinds of health problems envisioned by lawmakers 15 at february 15 2000 oversight hearing of the house government reform subcommittee on national economic growth natural resources and regulatory affairs it was asserted that dol non regulatory guidance opinion letter effectively said that the underlying medical condition eg cold or an earache did not matter if other requirements were met eg an absence of at least three consecutive days that involves continuing treatment from health care provider it has been claimed that as result employees are able to use their fmla entitlement for minor health problems and to thereby abuse their employers sick leave policy 16 according to survey conducted by the society for human resource management shrm almost twothirds of the human resources hr professionals 14 continuing treatment means treatment at least twice by health care provider or once if it results in

firms to retain employees who otherwise would have been terminated for poor attendance17 others have countered that not all employees work for firms that offer sick leave as part of their benefit package in recognition of the charge that employees may take fmla leave for something other than serious condition the dols employee survey asked individuals who gave healthrelated reasons for taking leave under the act excluding disability due to pregnancy whether their condition required care from doctor or an overnight stay in hospital virtually all 99 those who took leave in 19992000 to deal with their own or fam ily members illness responded that doctors care was required about twothirds reported that they or family member had to be hospitalized overnight to remedy the perceived problemwhich allegedly permits abuse of the act increases employers administrative burden and sparks litigationit has been proposed that the regulation be clarified one idea that has been advanced would explicitly state in the statute that an illness injury impairment or condition for which treatment and recovery are brief eg fewer than seven or 14 days does not constitute serious health condition it further has been suggested that the law be revised to list specific examples of serious health conditions in responding to questions posed during hearing held by the subcommittee on children and families of the senate committee on health education labor and pensions on july 14 1999 the deputy administrator of the dols wage and hour division expressed concern that such list might imply that illnesses that everyone would agree are normally not serious conditions could never warrant fmla leave he pointed out that the fluan oftenused example of non serious condition for which fmla leave currently can be taken if it lasts more than three days and requires the continuing treatment of health care providerkills tens of thousands of people each year he also mentioned that examples of serious health conditions are included in the regulations g11g151g157g142g155g150g146g157g157g142g151g157g561g14g142g138g159g142g561 as previously noted the dol regulation states at 29 cfr 825203 that employers must account for intermittent leave in the smallest incr ement that their payroll systems use to account for other absences as long as it is 1 hour or less it has been argued that keeping track of such short segments of time is burdensome particularly if the firms payroll and attendance systems are not integrated or if the system for recording leave is not automated however minority of employees take leave on an intermittent basis under the statute according to the dols employee survey about onefifth of fmla leaves were taken on an intermittent basis in 19992000 and hr professionals reported statistically significant decline between the shrms 2000 and 2003 fmla surveys in the degree of difficulty scheduling intermittent leave in minutes 18 in order to lessen the recordkeeping burden suggestion has been made to extend the minimum increment of leave under the act19 others have countered that lengthening the increment would substantially penalize leavetakers

penalty could potentially discourage some employees from taking leave intermittently one argument that has been put forth against intermittent leaveparticularly when employees provide little noticeis that it deprives employers of the ability to mitigate work disruptions and consequently can have significant negative effects on the duties and schedules of leavetakers coworkers who typically must pick up the slack this in turn could adversely affect labor productivity and the morale of leavetakers coworkers hr professionals who participated in shrm survey noted that fewer than half of fmla leavetakers scheduled it in advance 48 20 but dols employee survey found that coworkers of leavetakers generally did not think the act adversely affected them if the use of intermittent leave remains unchanged despite extension of the minimum increment and instead leavetakers were absent for four hours rather than 30 minutes for example then the acts reported burden on coworkers might worsen unscheduled intermittent leave continues to be one of its most controversial features of the law according to comments made by business and employee representatives during june 2005 roundtable discussion convened by the sena health education labor and pensions committee hospitals hr director stated that on any given day 25 people medical assistants who had obtained certifications from doctors that their chronic conditions required use of intermittent leave could call in and theres nothing you can do about it and manufacturers representative asserted that employees utilized the fmla to circumvent disciplinary procedures in their collective bargaining agreement 21 in contrast an employee described how her ability to take intermittent leave for the years during which her child was being treated for cancer also enabled her to continue working and receiving paychecks jody heymann director of harvard universitys center for society and health policy noted that with the prevalence of chronic health conditions increasing and hospitalizations decreasing access to intermittent leave allows the worker to miss as little work as possible 22 on the basis of surveys conducted by shrm in 2006 and 2007 it appears that hr professionals continue to have difficulty administering the act and report negative consequences more often when leave is taken intermittently for chronic health conditions as opposed to catastrophic health conditions or when leave is taken to care for newborn or newly placed adopted or foster child the short notice less than one week employees often give for taking time off for episodic conditionswhich reportedly makes it difficult for companies to deal with absencesmay partly be the cause of these findings 23

requirement for annual certification of chronic conditions as well30 advocates for employees opposed those parts of the proposed rule that they believed would limit rights under the act the aflcio for example asserted that requiring employees to undergo more frequent medical visits to justify fmla leave would impose unnecessary costly burdens on workers and that requiring employees to follow their employers standard callin procedures would likely have the effect of permitting minor deviations from an employers internal notice policy to result in wholesale denial or delay of fmla rights 31 the family caregiver alliance also was concerned about employees having to give advance notice or follow their employers usual callin procedures because medical emergencies often happen unexpectedly presented below is brief description of selected portions of the fmla final rule which appeared in the federal register on november 17 2008 pp 6793468133 generally dol integrated the two militaryrelated leave provisions in pl 110181 into the relevant sections of the final fmla rule only news that address militaryrelated unpaid family leave in the final rule are discussed in the 19 items below 1 the first circuit court of appeals held in rucker that the complete separation of an employee from his or her employer does not prevent the em ployee from counting earlier periods here five years toward the 12month fmla eligibility requirement in response to the court urging dol to decide whether continuous break of longer than five years is permissible the department proposed that five years be the limit with exceptions for employment breaks due to fulfillment of military obligations and existence of written agreements that state the intent of employers to rehire employees away from work for childrearing purposes for example the final rule retains the two exceptions and extends the period for breaks in service to seven years the final rule also adopts the proposed rules codification of prior guidance issued by the department because the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights ac t userra entitles returning service members to the rights and benefits they would have had if they had been continuously employed they are entitled to count the hours they would have worked for the employer but for national guard or reserve service toward their eligibility for fmla leave see section 825110 2 in light of the supreme courts ragsdale decision that invalidated section 825700a dol believes it does not have regulatory authority to deem employees who do not meet the lengthof service and hoursofwork requirements eligible for fmla leave despite an employers failing to provide an employee the required notice or correct information although the department therefore deletes the deeming provisions in section 825110 it notes in section 825300 that such failures may have the effect of interfering with restraining or denying employees the right to exercise their fmla rights and cause harm for which there are statutory remedies 3 dol basically retains the current definition of serious health condition in section 825113 however section 825115 in the

currently required two visits to providers occur within 30 days of the start of the period of incapacity absent extenuating circumstances the final rule adopts the proposed rules language with clarifications that the visits must be in person and that the first visit must occur within seven days of the first day of incapacity the definition of chronic serious health condition is changed as well to require an employee make at least two visits for treatment per year to his or her health care provider 4 in section 825126 the department addresses the new qualifying reason for leavetaking in pl 110181 which permits eligible employees to take fmla leave for qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that spouse daughter or parent is on active duty or has been notified of an impending federal call or order to active duty in support of contingency operation those on call or ordered to active duty are members of the reserve components and the national guard as well as certain retired members of the regular armed forces and reserves not members of the regular armed forces because the fmla definition of or daughter 32 would severely limit the availability of leave which contradicts the intent of congress dol developed separate definition of or daughter on active duty or ca ll to active duty status as an employees child who is of any age charged by statute to define qualifying exigency the department in the final rule does so by presenting specific and exhaustive list of reasons for which eligible employees are entitled to exigency leave the list is divided into seven general categories ie shortnotice deployment military events and related activities childcare and school activities financial and legal arrangements nonmedical counseling rest and recuperation postdeployment activities and additional activities 5 in section 825127 the department addresses pl 110181s provision of military caregiver leave to spouse child parent or next of kin of seriously injured or ill covered service member the length and frequency of such leave is equal to 26 workweeks perservice member perinjury in single 12month period dol determined the method for establishing the single 12month period is the date on which an employee begins military caregiver leave the final rule adopts pl 110181s definition of seriously ill or injured covered service member and clarifies it to include current not former members of the regular armed forces national guard and reserves and members of the regular armed forces national guard and reserves who are on the temporary not permanent disability retired list temporal proximity between the covered service members injury or illness and treatment recuperation or therapy is not required by dol which reasoned that limiting the provision of care to current service members and those on the temporary retired disability list where they can remain for more than five years was sufficient because the fmla definition of or daughter would severely limit the availability of leave which contradicts the intent of congress dol developed separate definition of or daughter of covered service member as the service members child who is of any age in keeping with the flexibility intended by congress the department defined next of kin to be the service members nearest blood relative other than the service members spouse parent or child in the following order of priority blood relatives who have been granted legal custody 32 the act defines or daughter to be less than 18 years old or at least 18 years old and incapable of selfcare due to mental or physical disability

cousins unless the service member designated in writing another blood relative as his or her nearest blood relative the department concludes that as is the case with other leave under the act it is the employers responsibility to designate whether the leave is fmlaqualifying for military caregiver leave that also qualifies as leave to care for family member with serious health condition the final rule states that an employer must designate such leave as military caregiver first the final rule also prohibits an employer from counting the leave taken under these circumstances against both the 26 workweeks of military caregiver leave and the 12 workweeks of leave for other qualifying reasons 6 dol did not increase the minimum increment of intermittent leave but did make organizational and other changes related to intermittent or reduced schedule leave although the proposed rule stated that employers must account for such leave in the smallest increments used by their payrolls systems to account for absences or other leave provided it is one hour or less the final rule states that employers must account for intermittent or reduced schedule leave using an increment greater than the shortest period of time that the employers uses to account for use of other forms of leave provided it is not greater than one hour an exception is created to count an entire shift against an employees jobprotected fmla entitlement when it is physically impossible for an employee to access work site after the start of shift because the department felt doing otherwise might expose employees to disciplinary action based on the additional hours of unprotected nonfmla leave that they must take the rule incorporates discussion from the 1995 preamble about counting against the fmla entitlement overtime hours employees would have been required to work but for use of leave under the act see sections 825202825205 7 in section 825207 dol makes clear that an employers paid leave policies must be followed by employees who want to substitute any form of accrued paid leave vacation personal sick for unpaid fmla leave to help employees understand this interpretation the department states that employers make employees aware of any requireme nts they have imposed for use of paid leave that may be used concurrently with fmla leave eg vacation days may only be taken in full day increments 8 among other things section 825215 replaces current language with the following if bonus or other payment is based on the achievement of specified goal such as hours worked products sold or perfect attendance and the employee does not meet the goal due to fmla leave then the payment may be denied unless otherwise paid to employees on an equivalent nonfmla leave status the department believes this puts employees on equal footing regardless of the kind of leave they take 9 in light of different circuit court decisions concerning waiver of rights under the fmla the department makes explicit in section 825220 th at employees and employers are allowed to voluntarily settle or release fmla claims based on past conduct by the employer and they may do so without obtaining permission of the department or court dol also clarifies that when an employee performs light duty assignment the employees rights under the act are not diminished ie employees retain their right to job reinstatement for full 12 weeks of leave rather than the right being reduced by time spent in light duty job 10 in addition to consolidating all notice requirements eg eligibility notice designation notice in one section 825300 dol extends from two business days to five business days the time within which an employer must notify an employee who has requested fmla leave that he or she

specifies the information employers must provide to employees about their eligibility status eg giving an employee reason why he or she is ineligible for leave similarly the department extends from two business days to five business days of receiving adequate information the time within which an employer must notify an employee that leave is designated as fmla leave and the amount of leave so designated to the extent this is not possible eg in the case of unforeseen intermittent leave the final rule states that employers are required to inform em ployees of the amount of leave designated as fmlaqualifying only upon the employees request and not more often than every 30 days if the employee took leave under the act during the period 11 section 825302 states that when the need for fmla leave is foreseeable the employee must give at least 30 days notice and if that is not possible then as soon as practicable if less than 30 days advance notice is provided dol requires employees to respond to requests from employers for explanation of why giving 30 days was not practicable in the final rule the department clarifies that its list of sufficient information from employees to enable employers to determine that employees are invoking their fmla rights is not exhaustive absent unusual circumstances an employee must follow an employers usual notice and procedural requirements for calling in absences and requesting leave 12 in the case of the unforeseen need for fmla leave employees continue to have to provide notice as soon as practicable see section 825303 the department had stated in the proposed rule that except in extraordinary circumstances employees must give notice of the need for leave promptly the final rule instead states that it generally should be practicable for the employee to provide notice of leave that is unforeseeable within the time prescribed by the employers usual and customary notice requirements applicable to such leave although dol applies the same meaning to sufficient information from employees to enable employers to determine that employees are invoking their fmla rights when leave is foreseeable or unforeseeable it adds that calling in sick in the case of unforeseen leave without providing more information will not trigger an employers responsibilities under the act like foreseeable leave employees must follow the employers established callin procedures for leave except under unusual circumstances 13 because the department believes that propos ed section 825304 offers useful guidance about the consequences of an employees failure to provide timely notice of the need for leave under the act eg delay of fmla protection it is retained in the final rule 14 proposed section 825305 lengthened the time fr om two to five business days within which an employer should request medical certification after receiving notice of the need for leave it also applied 15calendarday time frame for the employee to provide medical certification in light of the courts decision in urban v dolgencorp of texas the department solicited comments on whether it should add language requiring an employer to notify the employee if certification is not returned by the health care provider within 15 days and to give the employee another 7 calendar days to provide medical certification additionally dol proposed defining an incomplete and insufficient certification and setting forth procedure for rectifying same more specifically the employer would have to state in writing what additional information is necessary and give the employee seven calendar days to correct the deficiency the proposed rule also would require new medical certification annually in cases where serious health condition lasts beyond single leaveyear this language codifies 2005 opinion letter issued by the department the final rule adopts the proposed rules language

the medical certification and made clear its longstanding practice of employers not being allowed to require employees to sign medical release as condition of their taking fmla leave the final rule adopts this language it also adopts section 825307 in the nprm that employers be permitted to contact directly the employees health care provider for the purpose of authenticating and clarifying medical certification without obtaining the employees consent however before contacting the health care provider the employer must give the employee chance to remedy any deficiencies in the certification in response to medical privacy concerns expressed by employee groups the final rule makes clear that the employees direct supervisor cannot contact the health care provider 16 section 825308 addresses the right of employers to request that employees obtain recertification of medical conditions except in the case of military family leave in those instances in which certification states that the serious health condition is chronic eg lifetime indefinite and the period of incapacity expected to last longer than 30 days dol allows employers to obtain medical recertifications more often than at sixmonth intervals where the certification relates to chronic serious health condition that specifies an intermittent period of incapacity lasting less than 30 days the department does not permit employers to request recertifications until the specified period has elapsed 2004 opinion letter is incorporated into the regulations the employer as part of the recertification may give the health care provider record of the employees absence pattern and ask the provider if the serious health condition and need for leave is consistent with the pattern 17 section 825309 relates to certification for leave taken during qualifying exigency an employer may require an employee provide copy of the covered service members active duty orders or similar documentation issued by the military dol created special optional certification form for such leave where leave is requested on an intermittent or reduced leave basis the final rule requires an estimate of the frequency and duration of the qualifying exigency where leave is requested for single continuous period employees should provide the start and end dates for the absence the section describes the process by which employers are allowed to verify information in the certification 18 section 825310 relates to certification for military caregiver leave an employer may require an employee to support the request for leave with sufficient certification from dod health care provider va health care provider dod tricare network authorized private health care provider or dod nonnetwork tricare authorized health care provider an employer must accept as sufficient certification invitational travel orders or authorizations issued by dod dol created special optional certification form for such leave 19 although the final regulation at section 825312 keeps the basic fitnessforduty certification procedures it provides that to authenticate and clarify the fitnessforduty statement the employer may contact directly the employees health care provider if the employer gives the employee list of the jobs essential functions the employer can require that the fitnessforduty certification address the employees ability
