tables 1 party affiliation and primary voting 3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl304411according to l sandy maisel political parties elections in the united states an encyclopedia new york garland publishing inc 1991 p 715 an open primary is defined as follows primary election in which voters may decide at the time of the election and in the privacy of the voting booth which party primary they wish to participate in is called an open primary voters need not express allegiance to any party before the primary electionvoting in primary elections state rules on participation as with many aspects of the voting process the rules concerning who is eligible to vote in party primary elections differ considerably from one state to another some states limit participation to registered party voters only some permit any registered voter to cast ballot in either party primary and other states use system that falls somewhere in between in general state primaries can be categorized as being either open or closed depending on the specific rules that govern participation definitions of open and closed primaries vary in political science literature the information presented here is based on the definition used by the council of state governments in its book of the states which classifies primaries according to the ballot choices available to primary voter on election day primary election is called open if voter is given the ballots for all parties chooses one ballot in the voting booth and discards the unused ballots1 in closed primary elections voter must formally register with party before the election in order to vote in the partys primary or chooses one party ballot at the polls sometimes referred to as semiopen primary because voter can make the choice on election day the comment section in table 1 notes whether public record of the choice is kept according to this definition 12 states have open primaries and 38 states and the district of columbia have closed primaries the primary system used in california variant of the open primary referred to as blanket or jungle primary was recently determined to be unconstitutional by the us supreme court in june 26 2000 ruling on the case california democratic party v jones 530 us 2000 the court determined that partys first amendment right of association is violated by the blanket primary system which was instituted in california when voters approved it as ballot initiative in 1996 in blanket primaries voters receive ballot that lists all candidates running for election to each office regardless of their party affiliation the leading candidates from the democratic republican and other qualified parties are nominated and their names are certified for the general election ballot as noted previously in the standard open primary voter is given the ballots for each party and may choose only one ballot in the voting booth alaska and washington also use blanket primary system to choose party nominees these states and california will need to devise new primary system for the 2002 election cyclehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30441crs2 louisianas open primary system is unlike that used in any other state all candidates compete in the primary election regardless of party affiliation if candidate receives majority of the primary vote he or she is declared elected and general election is held if candidate wins majority however the two candidates who received the most voters are listed on the ballot in november on occasion the two candidates with the highest vote totals in the primary are from the same political party and both names appear on the general election ballot the louisiana primary system is not affected by the us supreme court ruling in california democratic party v jones because it is nonpartisan primary in which voters select candidates for the general election rather than party nominees closed primaries can be divided into three categories 1 those that register voters by party and limit primary voting to registered party members independent voters forfeit the opportunity to participate in the primary 2 those that register voters by party but allow them to choose the other partys ballot on primary day independents may participate in primaries and 3 those that do not have party registration but require voters to ask for one partys ballot at the polls on primary election day the last two categories are sometimes called semiopen primaries because the voter must make public choice of ballot which may be recorded in some cases the record is available to the parties and voter might even be challenged and required to pledge to support party candidates in the general election requirement widely considered unenforceable in any event the following table provides information on whether state holds an open or closed primary deadlines for declaring or changing party affiliation before primary and rules for participation by unaffiliated voters it also indicates
