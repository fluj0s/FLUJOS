l ramseur analyst in environmental policy resources science and industryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34502emission allowance allocation in capandtrade program options and considerations summary when designing capandtrade program one of the more controversial and challenging questions for policymakers is how to whom and for what purpose to distribute the emission allowances regarding the method of distribution to covered sources policymakers could 1 sell the allo wances through an auction process 2 allocate the allowances at cost to cove red sources 3 provide allowances to non covered sources who would in turn sell th em to covered sources or 4 use some combination of these methods lthough the emission allocation method would not affect the environmental integrity of the capandtrade program the selected allocation strategy c ould have considerab consequences using auctions as distribution method could avoid certain concerns that are likely to occur if covered sources receive all or most of the allowances at cost 1 consumers in different electricity markets may face inequitable price increases 2 weak price signal for electricity may be sent in areas with the most carbon intensive fuel portfolios and 3 nocost allowances may ove rcompensate covered sources in addition auction revenues offe r unique opportunity to reduce the overall costs of the emissions program several economic studies indicate that if used in the most efficient manner overall costs could be minimized by almost 50 greenhouse gas ghg emission capandtrade program would create valuable new commodity the ghg emi ssion allowance epa estimates that allowance value could potentially account in aggregate for tens or hundreds of billions of dollars each year when distri buting this value policymakers would face choice between minimizing the costs im posed on the entire economy minimizing the expected burden on specific parties or supporting range of climate or non climaterelated policy objectives for example congress may consider pr oviding transition assistance to carbon intensive industries studies have estimated profits could be maintained in the energy production and electricity generation sector s if approximately 20 of allowances were provided to those sectors at cost members may also consider allotting allowance value to consumers partic ularly lowincome households who are expected to bear the majority of the co mpliance costs via higher energy prices another option would involve distributin g the allowance value to support various objectives technology development energy efficiency improve ments biological sequestrati on climate change adap tation efforts or non climaterelated purposes such as deficit reduction of these objec tives technology advancement is arguably the most crucial in terms of mitigation moreover depl oyment of new technologies could potentially lower the ove rall costs of the program although many of the proposals in the 110th congress eg s 2191 s 1766 and s 3036 would employ an auction to so degree none of the bills specifies the design of the auction congress may want to consider including specific design elements in legislative text particularly auction frequency and whether or not the auction should have reserve pri ce and if so at what level httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34502contents introduction

debate over the past two decades in 1992 the united states ra tified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc arguably in recent years the primary issues under debate have sh ifted from science such as the role of greenhouse gas ghg emissions from human activ ities1 to policy for instance 2005 sense of the senate resolution on climate change2 stated it is the sense of the senate that congress should enact comprehensive and effective national program of mandatory marketbased limits and incentives on emissions of greenhouse gases that slow stop and reverse the growth of such emissions at rate and in manner that 1 will not significantly harm the us economy and 2 will encourage other action and key contributors to global emissions in the 110th congress members have introduced several bills that would establish marketbased3 mandatory ghg emission reduction program4 most of these proposals would establish some type of capandtrade system to regulate ghg emissions5

policymakers could 1 sell the allowances through an auction process 2 allocate the allowances at cost to covered sources 3 pr ovide allowances to noncovered sources who would in turn sell them to covered sources via the emissions trading market or 4 use some combination of these methods regardless of the method of distribu tion emission allowances would have monetary value in carbonconstrained reg ime such as capandtrade program if an auction is used policymakers could di stribute auction revenues to wide range of parties to support various policy objectives likewise policymakers could allot allowances at cost to noncovered entitie s eg federal or state agencies among others to promote the sa or different objectives by addressing the question of how to whom and for what purpose to distribute the emission allowances policymakers would craft an allocation strategy the strategy would not affect the environmental integrity of the emissions cap6 i n addition covered entities woul d generally face the same emission reduction decisions under either allocation strategy7 common misconception is that if covered sources receive allowances at cost the sources would behave differently from sources who purchased allowances through an auction8 economists point out free allowances9 have value and when covered entities submit an allowance for compliance purposes the entities forgo the opportunity10 to sell the unused allowance in the emissions trading market11 the first two sections of this report discuss the primary emission allowance distribution methods auctions and nocost distribu tion to covered sources thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34502crs3 12 the 10 states participating in the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi have agreed to auction at least 25 of their

considerations for congress when determining to whom and for what purpose to distribute the value of the emission allowances the allocation strate gy would have subs tantial consequences for the cost of the capandtrade prog ram and how the costs are apportioned auctions in recent years the use of auctions to allocate emission allowances has generated considerable interest12 several of the capandtrade proposals from the 110th congress including s 2191 wh ich was reported from the senate environment and public works committ ee on may 20 2008 would use auctions to allocate an increasing percentage of the caps emission allowances13 this section describes the potential benefits that auc tions may provide if used to distribute allowances to covered sources in capandtrade program in addition this section discusses auction design issu and considerations for policymakers implementation benefits in general the concept of an auction is relatively simple to understand14 auctions would allow the market to determine which entitie s receive emission allowances and at what price parties placing the highest value on the allowances would receive them with this alloca tion method policymaker s would be relieved of the responsibility to make distribution d ecisions process that might be described as picking winners and losers15 for this reason auctions are generally considered to be the most transparent mechanism for distributing allowances in addition in free allocation format parties would have strong incentives to seek increasing shares of the overall allowance allotment16 parties with resourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34502crs4 17 this cost savings estimate is based on an analysis that simulated capandtrade program with 22 emission reduction between 2000

change 2007 the hamilton continuedavailable for such efforts may have an advantage an auction system would eliminate this behavior polluter pays principle requiring emission sources to purchase emission allowances would support the polluter pays principle in general environmental policy context the polluter pays principle holds that pollution costs should be borne by the polluting facility or industry not society at large to accomplish this objective pollution costs should be included in the overall price of g ood proponents of the polluter pays notion would likely argue that if products are pri ced to reflect environmental costs air pollution land use ghg emissions dema nd for these products may decline advocates of polluter pays maintain that the environment and the services it provides are shared public good under this framework fac ilities should have to pay for the right to pollute ie emit ghgs if allowances are provided at cost to emission sources the polluter pa ys principle would be violated potential minimization of costs on society if congress decides to use an aucti on to distribute emission allowances to covered sources as opposed to providing allowances to covered sources at cost the auction revenues could be used to substantially minimize the overall costs on society of the capandtrade program economic studies have found th at if revenues are used in the most economically efficient manner the overall costs imposed by capandtrade program could be reduced by approximately 5017 economists maintain that the most economically efficient application of reve nues would be to offset reduc tions in taxes on desirable activities such as employment or personal income18 the opportunity to use allowance value in this manner and thus minimize overall costs to this extent is unique to the auction mechanism19 however many observe rs argue that applying auction revenues in this fashion is politically unlikely20 other potential

generate overall economic cost savings these options are discussed late r in this report avoidance of economic concerns from nocost distribution auctions would avoid seve ral of the undesired economic effects that are likely to occur if allowances are provided to cove red sources at cost these concerns are discussed in greater detail later in the cost distribution section in brief they include inefficient and inequitable price signals in the electricity sector potential overcompe nsation to covered sources and challenges with allotting allowances to new and retiring sources auction design issues although many of the capandtrade proposals in the 110th congress would employ an auction to some degree none of the bills specifies the design of the auction recent study that examined auction design issues for the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi found that car eful attention to auction design can be critical to an auctions success in achie ving the goals specified for the auction21 design considerations the success of an auction is typically measured by both its efficiency and revenue generation22 in an emission auction context efficiency is achieved when the parties that receive the allowances are the parties that place the most value on the allowances other attributes of an auction that may be used to measure its success include price discovery in costeffective emissions trading program the allowance price should mirror or closel follow the marginal cost of emission reduction ie the cost of reducing the last most expensive ton an effective auction should help identify the allowance price that is near to the marginal cost of reduction23 protection against market manipulation auctions should discourage or prohibit bidding behavior that would create inefficient outcomes in the market for example collusion among bidders may artificially lower the allowance price another concern is hoarding in which one party makes speculative bids above the competitive price in order to capture di sproportionately large percentage of the allowanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34502crs6 24 holt et 2008 25 more information on epas so2 emission trading auction is at httpwwwepagov airmarketstradingfactsheetauctionhtmlhow minimize transaction costs substantial administrative or transaction costs could reduce the costeffectiveness of using an auction moreover high transaction costs could place smaller firms at disadvantage transparency and fairness the rules should be readily available to all parties and should not favor cer tain participants design options certain auction designs may provide advantages or disadvantages depending on the auctions primary objective for example some auction designs in certain contexts may favor revenue genera tion others may be more efficient in terms of matching the market price policymakers may undertake further st udy before specifying the particular auction logistics although economic st udies have examined the performances of different auction formats in other contexts relatively fe w papers have examined the relative merits of each of these auc tion forms in multiunit eg emission allowances auctions24 one option for congress would be to direct an implementing agency to devise the most appropriate auction format based on the ranking of objectives provided by congress policymakers may consider va rious auction designs in general auction designs are distinguished by 1 the number of rounds for bidding generally one round often called sealed bid versus multiple rounds and 2 whether there is uniform price or individual price discriminatory price for each buyer examples of auction designs with different combinations of these two characteristics include the following discriminatory price sealedbid auction this type of auction is used in epas so2 emission trading program25 in this system parties submit sealed bid containing multiple offers to purchase set number of allowances at certain prices the implementing agency opens the bids and distributes allowances starting with the highest offer until the suppl is exhausted for example consider hypothetical auction in which the supply of allowances is 20 units and the highest bidder offered 100 per allowance for 15 allowances and the second highest bidder offered 90 per allowance for 10 allowances the highest bidder would receive 15 allowances for 100allowance the second highest bi dder would receive 5 allowances at 90allowance uniformprice sealedbid auction this type of auction is similar to the above format discriminatory price seal edbid with one major difference the price paid by all bidders is the highest rejected bid ie the secondhighest bid using the above scenario the highest bidder would receive

this approach27 uniformprice multiround english clock auction in an emission allowance auction using this format the au ctioneer would post allowance price and parties would offer the quantity they are willing to buy at the posted price the first posted price would be set at low level so that demand would exceed supply the auctioneer would continue posting higher prices at set time intervals until demand is less than or equal to the allowance s upply the posted price that produces this outcome would become the allowance pri ce for all bidders virginia used this auction type to sell nitrogen oxide emission allowances pursuant to the nox sip call28 reserve price one issue that arguably transcends auction design considerations is whether or not the aucti on should have reserve price and if so at what level in an auction reserve price is price set by the seller below which the seller refuses to part with the item for sale in large volume multiunit auction that is expected to have substantial participation ie high demand for the items for sale reserve price would all but guarantee revenue stream in capandtrade allowance emissions auction reserve pr ice would operate much like minimum tax or price floor reserve price may address certain logistical concerns such as bidder collusion that are often associated with au ctions in addition reserve price may provide assurance to parties making emission reductions that the reductions will have some value in the allowance market for example if covered source can expect reserve price to be set at certain level eg 10ton and the source makes multiple reductions each at perton cost below the expected reserve price the source can have confidence that its efforts will be costeffective the authors of the rggi auction study recommended that rggi participants set reserve price when conducting allowance auctions concluding compelling justification for reserve price can be f ound in the academic literature and from previous experience with auctions and the reserve price would help the auction achieve the criteria eg the design criteria discussed above set out in this report29httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34502crs8 30 ibid 31 ibidbecause reserve price if established could influence revenue flows from an auction congress may consider addressing this issue specifi cally in legislative text rather than leave this matter open for interpretation to an implementing agency auction frequency epas so2 emissions trading program holds annual auctions to distribute small percentage of allowances likewise s 2191 would direct the implementing agency to conduct annual auctions however policymakers may consider holding more frequent auctions eg every quarter more frequent auctions c ould provide several benef its both for covered sources and to the efficiency of the program more auctions would give covered sources more flexibility to incorporate unanticipated events eg higher electricity demand due to warmer than expected temperatures if auctions were held more frequently the allowances sold would be in smaller lots this may help facilities particularly smaller operations ma intain cash flow in terms of efficiency smaller more frequent auctions would likely reduce the potential for parties to manipulate the market eg from speculative hoarding more auctions may increase market liquidity by making allowances available for purchase in more frequent intervals the potential downside to having multiple auctions per year is that covered sources may face additional transaction cost s however the authors of the rggi auction study stated past experience suggests that signif icant proportion of the administrative cost of holding auctions is related to the in itial setup and that incremental costs of repeating particular auction type w ill be low in comparison to these initial costs30 after considering the costs risks and benefits the study authors recommended that participating rggi states use quarterly auction to allocate emission allowances31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34502crs9 32 although epa annually auctions small percentage of the allowances in its sulfur dioxide so2

phase ii allowances how and why 2006 climate policy 61 137160nocost distribution to covered sources emission trading programs in the united states32 and abroad33 have generally distributed the vast majority of allowances at cost to sources directly subject to cap in recent years however support fo r auctions has gained momentum this momentum likely reflects better understanding of the benefits of using auctions as well as increased scrutiny of the effects of distributing allowances at cost34 this section discusses the potential benefits and concerns of allotting allowances to covered sources at cost potential benefits mitigation of disp roportionate costs the primary argument in support of nocost distribution is that carbonin tensive industries are expected to face disproportional costs under carbonconstrai ned system these industries maintain they should receive compensation ie fr ee allowances for the financial losses imposed by the capandtrade program the financial losses may lead to loss of jobs in particular industries the compensation may be considered form of transition assistance for industries and industry em ployees most impacted by ghg emissions cap this argument is perhaps stronger for industries that may have more difficult time including the costs of emission reducti on in the price of their products for example certain us industries may be more vulnerable to foreign competition especially if their competitors are locat ed in nations without ghg emissions caps for these industries increasing the price of their materials to reflect the cost of emissions abatement may entail comparative disadvantage moreover if foreign competitors in these industries increase thei r market share as result of us cap andtrade program the foreign facilitie s in uncapped economies are likely to increase their ghg emissions this potentia l scenario is described as emissions leakage constant concern in climate change policy in other economic sectors particularly the electricity generation sector that do not face foreign competition facilities are ex pected to pass along the vast majority of the emission reduction costs this w ould entail higher prices for consumershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34502crs10 35 this may vary by the product sold and the level of price increase some products may display relatively inelastic pricedemand rela tionship

households however pr ice increases would likely reduce consumer demand35 potentially lowering the profits of carbonintensive industries36 political feasibility capandtrade prog rams both domestic and international have usually provided allowances to cove red sources at cost this free allocation to covered sources is ar guably means to garner support for an emissions reduction program moreover industries may pr efer to receive allowances at cost rather than compete for share of auction revenues transfer of free allowances may be more politically secure than government promises of compensation from auction revenues37 concerns undesirable effects in the electricity sector as the electricity sector accounts for the largest percentage 34 in 200638 of ghg emissions in the united states it would play major role in the effectiveness of capandtrade program there is concern that if allowances are distributed to electric utilities at cost the electricity consumers who purchase electricity under priceregulated structure would receive price signal that is weaker than the signal received by consumers in unregulated or competitive markets39 in contrast an auction distribution system would enable electricity generators in both priceregulated and competitive markets to send comparable price signal to consumers40 in the united states the price consumers pay for electricity may be determined by state regulatory body often descri bed as costofservice regulation or the price may be subject to market forces often described as deregulated or competitive in general the regulatory structure varies by the type of facility andor the state in which the electricity is gene rated in 2007 the more traditional price regulated electric utilities generated approximately 60 of

determine the price of electricity for us consumers the different impacts reflect the electric generating facilities varied abilities to pass through all types of costs to consumers in the form of high er electricity prices in an auction the costs to utilities would include both the costs of mitigation and the costs of purchasing allowances under nocost distribution system utilities would have mitigation costs and opportunity costs associated with th allowances discussed above if policymakers auction allowances to electric utilities both priceregulated and competitivemarket utilities would include the cost of purchasing emission allowances in the price of electricity however if allowances are distributed at cost to utilities only competitivemarket utilities would be able to pass along their opportunity costs because priceregulated facilities would not be ab to pass through the opportunity costs associated with free allo wances consumers in these areas would effectively receive the benefit of the free allowances in the form of stable or lower electricity bills figure 2 consumers in competitive areas would not receive the benefit of free allowances and would t hus face disproportionate price increases this consequence would erode the effectiveness of the capandtrade program because consumers would likely not receive price signal that is strong enough to encourage conservation or energy efficiency improvements the effects of this inefficient outcome may be magnified because approximately 75 of coalfired electricity was generated by priceregulated utilities in

offsets from non covered sources that have reduced avoided or questered emissions65 the combined costs of these activities are the compliance costs of the capandtrade program66 the compliance costs are different from the aggregate value of emission allowances in the early years of capandtrade program the aggregate value of allowances would likely dwarf the costs of making or finding emission

compliance purposes in the early years of the programfigure 3 depicts this contrast the area under th emissions cap curve represents the number of allowances the area between the emissions cap curve and the businessas usual curve represents the required reductions the former area will be larger as long as the emission reduction target is ss than 50 of the emissions baseline67 the compliance costs represent the sum of the costs of each ton of reduction and the cost of each reduced ton will vary for example some projects may present lowhanging fruit reduction opportunities whereas investments in extra capital eg carbon capture technology may repr esent more expensive reduction option consider simplified example68 policymakers set 7ton cap on an economy that currently emits 10 tons the 3 tons that must be reduced cost 1 5 and 10 respectively the cost of the last most expensive ton the marginal cost is 10 because the marginal cost largely establishes the market price of emission allowances in capandtrade each emission allowance has value that is approximate to the marginal cost69 therefore in this example the value of the allowances would equal 70 but the compliance costs would be only

support specific objectives policymakers may also consider distributing percentage of the allowances or aucti on revenues to support range of objectives including technology development prom otion of

promote energyrelated technologies lowcarbon energy sources carbon capture and storage ccs90 and cellulosic biofuels energy efficiency improvements in energy efficiency could make considerable contributions in achieving ghg emission reductions although energy efficiency may involve technology advancements new technologies must be used in order to realize the efficiency gains in some cases parties may need incentives beyond the efficiency gains to induce behavioral changes for example allowance value could be distribut ed to support efficiency gains at places residences commercial buildings that are unlikely to be covered by an emissions cap biological sequestration trees pl ants and soils sequester carbon removing it from the earths atmosphere allowance values could be allotted to provide financial incentives for landowners to engage in activity eg conservation tillage reforestation that would increase sequestration on their land although some of these actions may qualify as offsets if allowed in capandtrade program some activities may need additional incentives or be unable to satisfy the offset approval process91 adaptation efforts some level of global warming and associated effects will occur regardless of emission reduction efforts taken today because previous and cu rrent ghg emissions will have long term climate impacts therefore some contend that investment eg allowance value should focus on preparing communities to adapt to the effects of changing climate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34502crs24 92 however if additional funding for technolo

or auction revenue is to address budget deficit that may result from capandtrade program portion of the allowances or auction proceeds could be set aside to offset projected revenue shortfalls this option is sometimes described as making the program revenueneutral in additi on congress may consider using allowance value to offset shortfa lls beyond those that are related to the capandtrade program policy considerations the distribution of allowance value w ould present policymakers with series of tradeoffs the primary options for pplying the allowance value involve 1 minimizing the overall costs of the capandtrade program imposed on society 2 alleviating the disproportiona costs borne by subgroups in society and 3 providing funding to support other po licy objectives such as technological development intertwined among these opti ons is tradeoff between regressive or progressive impacts reduce costs alleviate burdens or promote technology economic studies indicate that using auction revenues ie reve nue recycling to offset reductions in distortionary ta xes labor income would be the most efficient use of the revenues and yield the greatest benefit to society as whole these studies show that if the revenues are used for other pur poses economic efficiency would suffer and the overall cost of the pr ogram would be higher figure 4 92 the opportunity to substantially lower ove rall costs is unique attribute of the auction allocation strategy some argue that using auction revenues to offset tax reductions is an unlikely outcome93 in general when the government obtains new revenue it tends to fund new or existing programs rather than reduce existing taxes94 indeed none of the capandtrade bills in the 110th congress has proposed to use revenues in this manner95 moreover the most efficient manner of revenue recyc ling would generally spread the cost reductions throughout th economy while certain groups would be expected to bear disproportionate

modeling results regarding technological development see crs report rl34489 climate change costs and benefits of s 2191 by larry parker and brent yacobucci 98 analogous to regressive tax policy regressive allocation strategy would disproportionately impact lower income hous eholds in contrast in progressive distribution scheme the ratio of cost to income would increase as income risescompetitive reasons or otherwise would face higher costs compared to other economic sectors ultimately consumers are expected to absorb the vast majority of the program costs as discussed bove policymakers may c onsider compensating through free allowances or aucti on revenues specific industries andor providing assistance to households that woul d face higher energy eg electricity and gasoline prices such compensation would forgo the opportunity to reduce the overall cost of the emission program using allowance value for other purpos eg technology development would impart tradeoff while such allotments would limit the allowances available for the purposes described above reduced overall costs or relief for disproportionate impacts new technolog ies in particul ar could have considerable impact on the costs of an emissions reduction program this is particularly the case if technologies can be commercialized ahead of their projected schedules96 or if unanticipated low or zero carbon alternatives can be developed the amount of funding allotted to t echnology development under s 2191 would represent substantial increase compared to current federal funding for emission reduction and lowcarbon tec hnolog ies although allocating allowance value to technological development could yield cons iderable gain the return in terms of additional investment to promote tec hnology improvements remains uncertain97 in recent study the author found while academics have extensively studied how revenues from auctions can be used to make the tax system more efficient they have not done much research on examining the impact of using such re venues for retiring debt or increasing government investment in short if allowance value is used to increase funding to existing programs or provide funding for new programs the re turn on investment is uncertain for example some programs may be operatin g at full capacity and additional funding may not provide comparable impacts moreover the marketplace already provides incentive for technological change and capandtrade program would increase the incentive to develop lowcarbon or zerocarbon energy alternatives regressive or progressive economic effects another tradeoff for policymakers is whether the emission allo cation strategy would produce regressive or progressive economic results98 the congressional budget office cbo analyzed the distributional effects of capandtrad program under four different scenarioshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34502crs26 allowances auctioned and au ction revenues distributed to

results in contrast the most regressive result occurs when allowances are provided to covered sources at cost the two other options that would cut tax rates would also produce regressive results
