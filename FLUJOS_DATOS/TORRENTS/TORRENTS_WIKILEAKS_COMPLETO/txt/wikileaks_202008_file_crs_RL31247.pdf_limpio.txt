concerned about terrorist activities since the ouster of the dictator siad barre government in 1991 somalia has been without central government the absence of central authority has created conducive

nonetheless observers note that africa has an important part to play in assisting the united states the proximity of some african countries to the persian gulf region could prove useful to the us

africa concerns some african officials are concerned that despite the strong support african governments have provided to the antiterror campaign they are not seen as valued coalition partners in the fight against terrorism some observers are critical that the bush administration did not extend invitations to african heads of state to visit washington for discussions on the crisis as has been the case with many european and other leaders the nigerian president is the only head of state who has been officially received by the bush administration since september 11 bush administration officials dismiss this concern saying what is important is the level of cooperation on the ground and not visit to washington6 african ambassadors in washington are also worried that subsaharan africa may become lower priority and that us financial support may be reduced because of the new focus on terrorism african officials assert that the united states has an obligation to assist them financially because they have suffered economically due to terrorism in october 2001 the tanzanian ambassador to the united states told congressional gathering that his countrys tourism sector has been hit hard and has not been able to recover since the us embassy attack in dar salaam the capital in 1998 kenyas tourism sector is also suffering since the terror attack against the us embassy in 1998 according to kenyan officials in october 2001 the ambassador of south africa told congressional gathering that the south african airline industry has been harmed due to flight cancellations and reductions in flights african officials maintain that they need us assistance in fighting international terrorism in their countries more specifically they would like to build african security capacity to detect and deter terrorist acts but this would require extensive training and capacity building african governments also would like us support in effectively tackling money laundering by extremist and terrorist groups in their country expanding intelligence sharing is another area where african governments would like to see some improvement us security officials were appreciative of the support they received from kenyan and tanzanian officials during and after the embassy bombings but african officials contend that they lack the resources needed to provide such support routinely some african governments are concerned that they might become the next target for us military action after afghanistan sudanese officials are reportedly concerned that the united states may target their country despite recent cooperation with us officials while us officials have said they will fight terrorism wherever it is found they have not given any indication sudan could become target the bush administration abstained in late september 2001 on security council vote permitting the lifting of sanctions against sudan in late october however the bush administration extended us bilateral sanctions against sudan citing continued terrorism concerns in letter to congress president bush stated that because the actions and policies of the government of sudan continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the united states the national emergency declared on november 3 1997 and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond november 3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31247crs4 7 kaufman marc somalis said to feel impact of us freeze of albarakaat the washington post november 30 2001

could become target because of the activities of alittihad alislamiya and its alleged relationship with alqaeda president bush added alittihad to the list of organizations that support terrorism and ordered the freezing of its assets in accordance with executive order 13224 in early november 2001 the bush administration added somali business albarakaat and froze its assets in the united states because of albarakaats alleged links with qaeda according to officials the freezing of the assets has had serious impact on somalias fragile economy because many somalis depended on the services of barakaat and it employed many somalis7 some african governmen t officials are eager to see the coalition against terrorism led by the united nations rather than the united states these officials believe that truly international coalition led by the united nations is more acceptable to african opinion than coalition consisting of mainly western powers8 they propose to strengthen the capacity of the united nations to fight terrorism partly through the establishment of new united nations agency under the general assembly dedicated to fighting and coordinating terrorism efforts some african ambassadors are concerned about pressures from the public at home concerning african citizens detained in the united states these ambassadors assert that they have not had access to their citizens in detention and have been unable to learn their identity or nationality citizens of several african countries including south africa and somalia have been detained according to african officials cooperation between the united states and africa in the fight against terrorism should include extraditing and apprehending members of african terrorist and extremist groups active in europe and the united states according to african officials african officials assert that they have not been able to get the cooperation of western officials in extraditing individuals engaged in terrorism they argue that these groups are raising funds and organizing in the west unhindered by western governments in october the algerian ambassador told congressional audience that his country lost an estimated 20000 people to terrorism but received little support from the west while some of these concerns are being expressed by handful of african officials many africans maintain that the united states must address the terrorism problem in more comprehensive way officials especially in countries with large muslim populations see the need for fair and quick resolution of the palestinian problem some observers are concerned that the antiterror campaign could change us africa relations significantly democracy and human rights advocates fear that governments with poor human rights records will be embraced by washington as long as they cooperate in the antiterrorism campaign others express concern that conflict resolution and development issues could become marginal for policy makers in washington bush administration officials have stated that while the fight against terrorism is priority other issues such as trade the fight against hivaids andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31247crs5 9the

mogadishubased transitional national government is target of attacks by other political groups arguing that the transitional national government supports terrorism in several other african countries governments are enacting new security laws allegedly to combat terrorism some analysts believe that the united states must significantly expand its intelligence presence in africa in order to effectively counter the threat of terrorism they argue that the united states should also help build the security and intelligence capabilities of african governments these observers contend that while it is desirable to secure and win the support of all african countries only handful are going to be capable and suitable to join an effective partnership with the united states experts note that washington should identify relevant african actors and establish special security relationship with these governments in dealing with terrorist threats in somalia for example kenya and ethiopia could provide key support to the united states some analysts maintain others are wary fearing that close us support for some african governments would be interpreted as reduction in pressure for

other three suspects who had been in detention since june 1995 in ethiopia were sentenced to death in september 1996 in late march 1997 ethiopias federal high court upheld the sentence the united nations security council passed three resolutions demanding the extradition of the three suspects to ethiopia in january 1996 the security council passed resolution 1044 calling on the government of

sanctions resolution 1070 banned sudan airways from flying outside sudan but called for 90 day waiting period before implementation the council postponed imposition of the ban again in december 1996 the ban did not go into effect because of disagreement in the council in late 2000 the governments of egypt and ethiopia expressed support for the lifting of sanctions but the clinton administration

its support for international terrorism the state departments 1999 patterns of global terrorism report said that sudan continued to serve as central hub for several terrorist groups including osama bin ladens alqaeda organization the sudanese government also condoned irans assistance to terrorist and radical islamist groups operating in and transiting through sudan according to the report khartoum served as meeting place safehaven and training hub for members of the lebanese hizballah egyptian islamic group the palestinian islamic jihad hamas and the abu nidal organization the departments 2000 report credited the nif government with taking positive steps in the fight against terrorism according to the report by the end of 2000 sudan had signed all 12 international conventions for combating terrorism and had taken several other positive counter terrorism steps including closing down the popular arab and islamic conference which served as forum for terrorists the same report stated however that sudan continued to be used as safehaven by members of various groups including associates of osama bin ladens alqaeda organization egyptian islamic group egyptian islamic jihad the palestinian islamic jihad and hamas the united states placed sudan on the list of states that sponsor terrorism in august 1993 after an interagency review and congressional pressure in announcing the decision the clinton administration said that sudan repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism and allows the use of its territory for terrorist groups both the first bush and clinton administrations had repeatedly warned the government of sudan about the activities of groups such as hamas hezbollah abu nidal and the palestinian islamic jihad khartoum does not deny the presence of some of these groups on its territory but rejects washingtons description of them as terrorist organizations sudan has also been safehaven for major terrorist figures particularly noteworthy example is the saudiborn osama bin laden he used sudan as base of operations until he went to afghanistan in mid 1996 where he had previously been major financier of arab volunteers in the war against the soviet occupation of afghanistan the government of sudan claims that it expelled bin laden from sudan due to pressures from the middle east and the united states15

general mohamed farah aideed and ali mahdi an ultimatum to end their factional fighting the group claimed at that time that it maintained offices in several countries including yemen pakistan kenya and sudan not much was heard subsequently from jihad alislam although group of somalis later formed the sharia implementation club sic in 1996 the groups principal objective was to establish sharia courts throughout the country some members of the transitional national government were key in the establishment of these courts very little is known about alislah although it is perceived as group dominated by hawiye clan businessmen alittihad alittihad is perhaps the most active and at one point successful of all the islamic groups indeed alittihad is an islamic fundamentalist group whose principal ideology and objective is to establish an islamic state in somalia founded in the late 1980s and early 1990s alittihad unsuccessfully sought to replace clan and warlord politics with an islamic state in the early 1990s alittihad had modest successes it administered territories under its control in the south but alittihad never emerged as major military or political force in somalia the clanbased groups and factions led by warlords in mogadishu are secular and have been at odds with alittihad even though some of these groups maintained tactical alliances from time to time with alittihad alittihads failure to maintain control over territories and spread its ideology led to shift in strategy in the mid1990s alittihad abandone d its ambition to spread its ideology through military means and began to concentrate on providing social services to communities through islamic schools and health care centers alittihads somalia social activities and religious objectives seem inconsistent with its activities in the somali region of ethiopia in ethiopia alittihad is actively engaged in military activities in support of ethnic somalis alittihad closely coordinates its activities with elements in the ogaden region that are at war with the ethiopian government several antiethiopian groups are active in the somali region and alittihad operates with these groups in carrying out attacks against ethiopian targets in 1999 the ogaden islamic union under the leadership of muhammad muallem omar abdi the somali peoples liberation front under the leadership of ahmed ali ismail and the western somali liberation front under the leadership of muhammad haji ibrahim hussein formed coalition called the united front for the liberation of western somalia their term for the

andrew associated press top us military officials links somalia to bin ladens alqaeda december 21 2001many somali watchers believe that alittihads strength is highly exaggerated and that information about its alleged links with international terrorist organizations is unreliable there is reliable information or pattern of behavior to suggest that alittihad has an international agenda as has been the case with the national islamic front government of sudan some observers note that if alittihad had clear internationallyoriented agenda its obvious ally in the region would be the nif regime in sudan or the sudanesebacked eritrean islamic jihad the sudanese regime did back regional extremist groups and international terrorist organizations but there was apparent relationship between the nif and alittihad but others accuse alittihad of being secretive group that coordinates its activities with terrorist organizations some observers contend that alittihad and alqaeda were behind the killings of the 18 us rangers in mogadishu in 199322 alittihad is also accused of receiving funds from alqaeda since president bush placed alittihad on the list of terrorismrelated entities in september 2001 see below press reports and information about this group have increased somali warlords especially those backed by ethiopia such as the somali reconciliation and restoration council srrc headquartered in baidoa and vehemently opposed to the transitional national government have been actively engaged in public relations campaign to portray their political enemies as terrorists the government of ethiopia has also been very vocal in portraying alittihad and the transitional national government as terrorist groups23 information from these sources are generally vague and lacks clear evidence moreover neither the ethiopian government nor others have been able to provide information about locations of training camps links between the transitional national government and alittihad and alqaeda the identity of members of qaeda or their activities in somalia nor have they offered clear evidence on acts of terrorism against us targets by alittihad somali observers note that alittihad does not have territories under its control and does not have the military capabilities to wrest control from any of the wellentrenched warlords in december 2001 however secretary of state colin powell stated that some bin laden followers are holed up there somalia taking advanta ge of the absence of functioning government24 moreover the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff

years alittihads principal target has been the government of ethiopia ethiopian officials have consistently accused alittihad of having links with middle eastern terrorist organizations and have portrayed alittihad as threat to regional peace and stability alittihad has carried out number of terrorist attacks against ethiopian targets and ethiopian security forces have violently retaliated against the group and its supporters the fighting with alittihad was triggered in the early 1990s when ethiopian security forces brutally cracked down on the ogaden national liberation front onlf member of the first transitional government of ethiopia the onlf joined the transitional government of ethiopia in part because the transitional charter provided nations and nationalities the right to self determination the onlf push for self determination created tension between the ruling ethiopian peoples revolutionary democratic front eprdf and the onlf in the early 1990s ethiopian security forces assassinated number of onlf leaders cracked down on the organization and moved the ethiopian somali region capital from gode to jijiga central government stronghold members of the onlf fled to somalia and joined alittihad fairly new group at that time hence some observers view alittihad as group largely concerned with domestic issues although some within the leadership might have links with outside groups ethiopias principal interest appears to be to ensure that united somalia does not pose threat to ethiopia and that the somaliinhibitedregion of ethiopia remains stable successive ethiopian governments had to deal with somali irredentism in the late 1970s somali rebels backed by the siad barre government overran ethiopian forces and captured large swath of territory ethiopian forces ejected the somali forces with the help of troops from cuba and yemen in the 1980s ethiopian dictator mengistu began to arm and train somali dissidents several somali groups were created with the help of ethiopian military and intelligence and were given training camps inside ethiopia the barre government in somalia on the other hand provided financial and political support to ethiopian opposition groups including to the current ruling party the eprdf somali rebels succeeded in 1991 in ousting the barre regime while the eprdf forces overthrew the mengistu regime in may 1991 some of the armed factions in somalia today are the same ones that were allied with the mengistu regime in the 1980s it did not take long however for the eprdfled government and some of the factions to forge new alliance ethiopia was an active participant in efforts to bring an end to the civil war in somalia in the mid1990s ethiopia organized number of peace conferences over the years but none succeeded in bringing an end to factional fighting in recent years however ethiopia has contributed to the unrest in somalia supplying warlords with arms and at times sending its troops in somalia to fight faction leaders ethiopia appears determined to establish friendly proxy government in mogadishu alittihad is seenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31247crs15 27report of the secretary general on the situation in somalia united nations security council s2001963as major obstacle in achieving that objective regional actors such as kenya and djibouti express fear that ethiopias military activities and support for warlords may cause an increase in regional instability and may lead to more refugees fleeing to neighboring countries ethiopian officials by contrast point to alittihad and the transitional national government as threat to ethiopia and regional stability since the war with eritrea in 1998 ethiopias interest in ensuring stability and eliminating potential threats coming from somalia has increased in part because of concerns of fighting two wars simultaneously if the perceived threat from somalia and the somali region is not dealt with decisively ethiopia could be forced to maintain robust forces in both the north and the southeast but friendly government in mogadishu or hargeisa could relieve ethiopia of the burden of maintaining large force along the somali border saving ethiopia scarce resources and helping concentrate its forces along the eritrea border ethiopian officials are also concerned about alliances being formed between somali groups and nonsomali ethiopian opposition groups kenya the government of president moi has been actively engaged in peace efforts in somalia since the early 1990s kenya has large somali population and is home to tens of thousands of somali refugees kenya has organized numerous peace conferences over the years and the most recent in december 2001 kenyan officials are concerned that continued instability in somalia could lead to regionwide instability in july 2001 kenyan officials closed the border with somalia because of illegal arms smuggling into kenya the presence of large numbers of somali refugees has also drained

the bush administration added alittihad to list of terrorism related entities whose assets were ordered frozen by presidential executive order bush administration officials accused alittihad of links with qaeda the administration did not offer evidence to prove its allegations but some officials asserted that links between the two organizations dated back to the us presence in somalia during operation restore hope 19921994 according to washington post article an interagency working group involving analysts from the state department pentagon cia and the national security council has been meeting for the past three weeks to discuss where and how alqaeda operates in the east africa country 28 some observers are skeptical that alittihad is an international terrorist organization or that there is strong link between alqaeda and alittihad they argue that there are credible reports that alittihad ever targeted us interests in somalia or africa some observers assert that alittihad does not have regional reach let alone global reach moreover some somalis credit ittihad for its social services and for restoring law and order in areas where it has maintained presence the focus on somalia and somali groups is expanding in washington nonetheless in early november 2001 federal authorities raided several somali owned money transfer businesses in the us operated by albarakaat companies the bush administration ordered the assets of albarakaat frozen because of its alleged links to alqaeda albarakaat was reportedly founded in 1989 by somali banker and currently has several dozen affiliates in somalia africa middle east and north america after the collapse of the central government in somalia in 1991 the banking system crumpled as result albarakaat and other small companies became key players in the money transfer business and for other financial transactions for many somalis inside somalia and overseas in early december american officials reportedly visited baidoa somalia and met with faction leaders and ethiopian military officers29 the purpose of the oneday visit was not acknowledged by washington but reporters in the region stated that these officials asked about terrorist networks in somalia bush administration officials have repeatedly stated that somalia supports terrorism and that alqaeda has used somalia as base of operations to attack us targets bush administration officials are concerned that alqaeda members may flee to somalia from afghanistan according to assistant secretary of state for africa walter kansteine r washington has three policy objectives first the united states will work with neighboring countries to make somalia inhospitable to terrorist groups second the united states will ensure that any activities in somalia would not affect its neighboring countries third the united states will work toward lasting peace and economic development in somalia httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31247crs17 us officials have not yet presented evidence linking alittihad and the transitional national government with alqaeda in the absence of central government and with numerous armed groups scattered throughout the country it would be difficult to hold anyone accountable for past deeds or current activities ittihad is the only somali group identified by the bush administration as terrorist organization but alittihad does not control single administrative area in somalia and does not have fixed assets that washington could go after nonetheless the united states has several options to consider washington could seek to apprehend individuals in somalia suspected of terrorist activities and bring them to justice another option is to infiltrate somali groups suspected of terrorist links in order to monitor disrupt and dismantle terrorist networks longterm and potentially complicated policy option in the view of some analysts is to address the root causes of the problem stable somalia under democratic authority is perhaps the only guarantee of terroristfree somalia but establishing representative government is major undertaking some observers are convinced however that after ten years of instability and bloodshed somalis might be ready to resolve their differences with the help of the international community another contributing factor to the problem in somalia has been the interference of regional actors in somalia driven largely by their own national interests the united states can play pivotal role in forging strong regional alliance that can play constructive role in bringing about an end to the instability in somalia simply monitoring events in somalia is also policy option but some see this cautious approach as one that would allow the terrorist threat to increase on the other hand heavy handed approach in the absence of clear evidence could be seen as targeting weak and defenseless country us military measures could also be seen as settling old scores some somalis believe that they will be targeted by the us not for terrorism but rather to avenge the killings of the 18 us rangers killed in battle in mogadishu in 1993 many observers contend that somalia may be safehaven for somali warlords but not for foreign terrorists somalis are notoriously independent foreign terrorist groups would have difficult time establishing strong presence in somalia because experts contend it is difficult to hide in somalia due to the nonsecretive nature of somali society somali experts further believe that even if foreign terrorist organization manages to establish presence the group is likely to be betrayed by potential allies because there are permanent loyalties in the somalia of today httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31247crs18 30section on diamonds by nicolas cook analyst in african
