international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division transatlantic regulatory cooperation background and analysis summary commercial ties between the united states and the 27member european union are substantial growing and mutually beneficial however differences in regulatory approaches limit an even more integrated marketplace from developing to deal with this situation variety of governmenttogovernment efforts have been created to dismantle existing regulatory barriers and to prevent new ones from emerging these efforts fall under the rubric of transatlantic regulatory cooperation trc and are at the heart of todays useu economic relationship this report is intended to serve as an introduction and primer on complicated broad and often highly technical set of policy issues since the mid1990s both us and european multinational companies have viewed divergent ways of regulating markets for both goods and services as the most serious barriers to transatlantic commerce the primary reason why these companies seek to achieve greater harmonization in standards and regulatory procedures is to reduce costs imposed by complying with two different sets of regulations and standards trc must deal with number of key differences between the united states and eu concerning approaches to regulation these differences involve political support for regulation and public attitudes towards risk and transparency until they converge or are realigned transatlantic gap in regulatory policies is likely to persist regulatory cooperation is an umbrella concept that incorporates broad range of activities at one end of the spectrum are information exchanges and dialogues among regulators that are designed to build trust and confidence at the other end of the spectrum are activities designed to harmonize regulatory approaches through acceptance of common principles and standards in between are activities that involve varying degrees of intrusion into the autonomy of regulators trc initiatives have made progress in reducing costs to businesses and consumers in some sectors but not in others one of the key obstacles to more extensive cooperation frequently cited is the domestic orientation of regulatory agencies involved in the process to promote more effective trc two policy options are commonly advanced 1 attracting highlevel political support and 2 increasing dramatically the involvement of legislators congress and the european parliament the transatlantic economic council which was created in april 2007 was designed in part to generate the kind of highlevel political support that previous initiatives may have lacked trc has been mostly an executive branch driven process yet through authorization and appropriations of the many different regulatory agencies involved in trc congress could play more central role if it decided to move in this direction as domestic regulation takes place in an increasingly integrated transatlantic marketplace congress will be called upon to balance the often competing demands of trade expansion and barrier reduction against domestic health and safety concerns this report will be

cooperation background and analysis introduction the united states and the 27member european union eu share huge dynamic and mutually beneficial economic partnership1 not only is the useu commercial relationship what many call the transatlantic economy the largest in the world it is also arguably the most important2 while the transatlantic market is today highly integrated due in large part to massive amount of foreign direct investment by both us and european companies in each others markets differences in regulatory approaches standards and philosophies militate against an even tighter and more integrated marketplace from developing regulatory differences are also behind some of the most politically sensitive bilateral trade disputes to deal with this situation variety of governmenttogovernment efforts and transatlantic dialogues have been created to increase understanding between policymakers and regulators on both sides of the atlantic to minimize existing regulatory barriers and to prevent the emergence of new regulatory barriers these efforts falling under the rubric of transatlantic regulatory cooperation trc are seen as being important to todays ususeueu economic relationship proponents maintain that trc undertakings can not only prevent disruptive and costly trade disputes from occurring but also spur trade and investment flows by reducing costs for producers and consumers on both sides of the atlantic since the establishment of the new transatlantic agenda nta in 1995 there have been number of new trc initiatives all aimed at removing or reducing regulatory barriers to trade3 while each of these initiatives has made some progress towards reducing regulatory burdens many us and european companies heavily engaged in the transatlantic marketplace maintain that the results have not been materially significant 1 for background on the european union see crs report rs21372 the european union questions and answers by kristin archick 2

relations implementation of the agenda is guided by joint euus action plan which is coordinated by group of senior level officials crs2 at the 2007 us eu summit leaders of the eu and us committed their governments to increasing the efficiency and transparency of transatlantic economic cooperation and to accelerating the reduction and elimination of barriers to international trade and investment with the ultimate objective of achieving barrier free transatlantic market they also agreed on framework for advancing transatlantic economic integration the framework and created new institutional structure the transatlantic economic council tec to advance the process of regulatory cooperation and barrier reduction headed on both sides by ministerial level appointees the tec is designed to oversee the efforts outlined in the framework with the goal of accelerating progress and guiding work between the summits4 whether the tec will herald new era of more effective cooperation remains to be seen much could depend upon whether the tec can exert enough political leverage to convince regulators to make reforms that will result in reduction of regulatory barriers between the eu and the united states as well as increase the role that legislators on both sides of the atlantic play in the process in this context congress might play an important and pivotal role in transatlantic regulatory cooperation through authorization and appropriations of many different independent regulatory agencies congress is in position to facilitate or impede progress in this undertaking as domestic regulation takes place in an increasingly integrated transatlantic marketplace congress must try to balance the often competing demands of trade expansion and barrier reduction against domestic health and safety concerns this report is intended to serve as an introduction and primer on complicated broad and often highly technical set of issues it is presented in seven parts the

serious barriers to transatlantic commerce redundant standards testing and certification procedures are seen by these companies as far more costly and harmful than any trade barriers imposed at the border such as tariffs or quotas while the 4 for background on the 2007 useu summit and the tec see httpwwwwhitehousegovinfocuseusummit2007 crs3 purpose of many regulations is to protect consumers and the environment divergent domestic regulations and standards can affect the competitive position of firms helping some and disadvantaging others by affecting the importation of products not produced or grown according to those requirements5 to the extent that product standards differ exporters may find their goods prohibited from certain markets or subject to expensive relabeling repackaging or retesting for example european winemakers intending to sell in the us market must label their bottles according to us requirements which are different than eu requirements similarly us exports to the eu of poultry washed with anti microbial treatments have been blocked for years by different health and safety standards different regulations add to the cost of doing business on both sides of the atlantic and serve as nontariff barriers to trade in many different economic activities and sectors these include but certainly are not limited to differences in accounting and financial reporting requirements antitrust or competition procedures consumer protection safety and health standards environmental regulations and personal data transmission each of these divergences can materialize into politically charged disputes and threaten the functioning of the transatlantic market in area has this been greater problem than in chemicals in this sector the us and eu have fundamentally different regulations on issues such as genetically modified organisms gmos hormones and the registration and restriction of chemical substances in the case of gmos these differences have translated into longer authorization times and stricter standards for approval release and marketing of gmos in the eu than in the us moreover gmos has been the subject of long and bitter trade dispute brought before the world trade organization6 pharmaceuticals is another sector where regulatory differences have been described as not only significant but also bewildering just in the area of drug approvals primary regulatory elements governing testing protocols submission of clinical data and certification of good manufacturing practices vary considerably between the us and eu moreover within the eu where public health policy is still national prerogative rules and protocols can vary greatly from member state to member state because each member state has its own rules and protocols it can 5 daniel c

countries7 another example comes from the automotive sector where american and european car makers sell similar products in the united states and europe but there are different standards and testing requirements for all kinds of parts ranging from headlights wiper blades light beams and seatbelts to crash standards which critics maintain are without measurable differences in safety benefits there are even multiple crash test dummies of the same or similar size and purpose clear example of where regulatory requirements diverge8 despite the salience of regulatory barriers in transatlantic commerce comprehensive sectorbysector study or inventory of regulatory barriers has not been undertaken proponents argue that such report could identify regulatory differences that impose substantial burdens on transatlantic commerce and possibilities for their reduction or convergence without compromising either us or eu health and safety priorities in 2003 the european commission ec proposed that such study be undertaken and jointly funded but the us government did not back the initiative both sides however note the major regulatory divergences that are considered trade barriers in their respective annual trade barrier reports in the 2008 us trade barriers report for example 12 pages are devoted specifically to eu regulatory barriers9 rationale for transatlantic regulatory cooperation efforts to enhance trc draw on both economic and political justifications and are generally supported by business interests and governments on both sides of the atlantic at the same time within the united states some interests mostly academics see greater benefits derived from regulatory competition and independence whereby each side is free to maintain its own approach to regulating consumer health and environmental issues the case for noncooperation or at least caution is also based on concerns that domestic health and safety standards may be compromised by process that is driven substantially by business interests and stakeholders and could be affected by race to the bottom regarding us and eu standards 7 keith maskus and yin he transatlantic regulatory cooperation in

httpwwwustrgov crs5 economic rationale the primary reason why many export industries seek to achieve greater harmonization in international standards is to reduce costs associated with complying with two different sets of regulations and standards to the extent that transatlantic regulatory standards and procedures differ the costs of engaging in transatlantic commerce increase10 good example comes from the auto industry according to trade association usbased producer of light trucks looked into exporting model to europe and found that its design was incompatible with european regulation on exterior edge projection the us has comparable standard the truck was never exported because it would have required major and costly redesign the same truck manufacturer then undertook to ensure that another model on the drawing boards would have maximum export potential built into its design in order to sell this product in europe the manufacturer reportedly utilized 100 unique parts incurred an additional 42 million in design and developmental costs and committed an additional 130 people to the program yet the performance of the vehicle in terms of safety was unchanged europeanbased manufacturers face the same issues in reverse when contemplating selling europeandesigned model in the united states these separate regulations in turn may cost manufactures millions of extra dollars to comply with but may result in changes in the vehicle in terms of safety or fuel economy11 2005 oecd study is often cited to illustrate how costly regulatory barriers to producers and consumers on both sides of the atlantic this study estimates that regulatory divergences between the us and europe costs the united states sum that is equivalent to 13 of gdp annually12 in addition to cost savings that might be derived from the harmonization of regulations so as to facilitate open markets it is argued that regulatory cooperation between states will help ensure that regulatory standards will not serve as obstacles to freer trade or unfair trade advantages13 just as internal regulatory divergences can 10 david vogel can it be done suggestions for better regulatory

these lines raised concerns in continued crs6 become source of competitive advantage or trade tension proponents of regulatory convergence assert that differences in emissions standards labeling requirements and attitudes towards public health risks between countries can become market access barrier for foreign products or provide domestic producers with unfair competitive advantages proponents of regulatory cooperation maintain that it could have the effect of preventing welfarereducing race to the bottom as jurisdictions seek to advance the competitiveness of its own industries through lax regulation or lower standards this rationale for regulatory cooperation served to justify large expansion of federal legislation and institutions in the united states in the areas of environmental regulation consumer protection health and safety and labor protections similar fears of trade distortions and races to the bottom led to the implementation of sweeping harmonization programs and centralized legislation in the eu14 cast in the context of the global economy some view trc as way for the us and eu to promote global regulatory standards in the absence of world standards the us and europe are often competing for acceptance of their respective regulations in third markets proponents of trc indicate that the net effect of this competition is that india and china can play the united states off against europe developing their own technical standards and financial regulations complicating world trade for everyone15 political rationale supporters of trc note that since the end of the cold war the united states and europe have been searching for various ways to bolster the foundation of the relationship absent the common enemy embodied in the threat posed by the former soviet union both sides have felt freer to pursue their own narrow economic and political interests in the process trade disputes have appeared to increase in frequency focusing often on differences in regulation rather than the traditional barriers of tariffs and subsidies to deal with the joint task of giving the relationship new rationale as well as bolstering overall ties numerous attempts have been made since the 1995 nta to enhance transatlantic economic cooperation in this context efforts to advance regulatory cooperation have been part of attempts to reinvigorate and upgrade the bilateral relationship annual summits attended by the us president the president of the european commission and the president of the european council have been the venue for bringing highlevel political attention and focus on efforts to enhance 13 continued the us business community that the new standards and regulations could be used to disadvantage us exporters and products 14

67 available at httptpnonlineorg crs7 transatlantic regulatory cooperation regulatory cooperation now entailing an expanding group of stakeholders and networks has become significant component of the useu economic relationship supporters argue that through such cooperation the partners may be able to find ways to amicably and expeditiously resolve commercial disputes as well as establish joint approaches to number of common regulatory challenges that have global importance16 because the united states and european union collectively represent over 50 percent of global production in areas where they can agree on common regulatory policy or approach they are wellpositioned to promote it globally where they disagree there is often deadlock reflecting the equal size of their economies and markets17 while there are other forums such as the world trade organization and international treaties to promote regulatory cooperation they are seen as having shortcomings the wto for example promotes regulatory cooperation by giving some international standards legal effect nudging wto members to actively participate in international standardization bodies it also puts national provisions to the test in various committees and offers its members platform to facilitate regulatory cooperation18 but the number of transatlantic regulatory differences that fall within the scope of wto rules constitute relatively small proportion of the regulatory policies and procedures that involve firms on both sides of the atlantic moreover the few regulatorybased trade disputes that the wto has decided sometimes exacerbate rather than lessen tensions between the us and eu19 for this reason it is argued that the united states and eu need to develop bilateral mechanisms for coordinating their regulatory policies20 counterarguments although there is strong support for trc among business and government leaders on both sides of the atlantic the concept and rationale have their critics this opposition is based in part on an alternative view of the benefits of regulatory competition as opposed to centrally adopted regulatory framework constructed through regulatory cooperation these

leads to the adoption of standards of varying stringency that efficiently match the needs and desires of each jurisdiction because conditions tastes and incomes tend to vary across jurisdictions this school of thought maintains that an optimal regulatory policy for one jurisdiction will not necessarily be optimal for another some consumer groups caution against the influential role that business groups play in transatlantic regulatory cooperation the concern is that safety and health concerns may be compromised if business groups play such prominent role in negotiations over testing requirements and standards for their own products rather than reducing barriers per the trans atlantic consumers dialogue maintains that the purpose of regulatory cooperation between the united states and eu should be to promote higher health and safety standards thereby improving consumer welfare on both sides of the atlantic21 opponents of trc assert from this perspective that great number of centralized regulatory programs should be dismantled and regulatory powers should be decentralized they believe that regulatory cooperation also reaches its limits where there is lack of institutional architecture to enforce decisions22 us eu differences in regulatory approaches transatlantic regulatory cooperation must deal with number of key differences between the united states and eu concerning approaches to regulation key differences bear on political cycles affecting regulation public preferences and tolerance for risk attitudes towards transparency and institutional capacities to undertake regulatory reforms these key differences whether they pertain to product safety environmental protection securities trading or customs procedures in how regulations are developed and applied in turn raise challenges about whether and how to merge harmonize or converge the varied approaches until the regulatory structures themselves become more convergent or aligned the major divergences in regulatory policies are unlikely to disappear political cycles over the last 50 years the political cycle of regulatory policy stringency and expansion in the eu and the us have not moved together in the process many important european and american regulations have diverged23 21 trans atlantic consumer dialogue position paper and resolution on horizontal regulatory initiatives in euus regulatory cooperation february 2007 available at httpwwwtacdorgcgibindbcgipageviewconfigadmindocscfgid322 22 reinhard quick op cit p 401 23 david vogel op cit p 14 crs9 beginning in the 1960s many us regulatory standards were likely more comprehensive and stringent than those adopted by the eu and most member states the us was typically first to identify new consumer and environmental risks and more likely to adopt relatively risk averse or precautionary standards for dealing with those risks for example from the early 1960s through the mid 1980s american standards for the approval of new pharmaceutical products were more stringent than in any eu member state and american automobile emission standards were consistently more stringent than those adopted in europe the united states also restricted the use of lead in gasoline more rapidly than did europe and also acted more aggressively to restrict the use of ozonedepleting chemicals24 but over the last 15 years number of european standards have become more stringent and comprehensive than us standards25 for example european standards for the approval and labeling of genetically modified gm foods and seeds are far more stringent than those adopted by the united states recently approved legislation on chemicals registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals or reach has made european standards for the approval of both existing and new chemicals much more demanding than in the us the eu has also moved more aggressively than the united states to impose restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions however in the aftermath of rising concerns about the safety of imported products and the financial crisis caused by the proliferation of subprime mortgages support for more aggressive regulatory actions are rising in the united states if the pendulum in the united states swings back towards increased regulation this may narrow some of the current transatlantic regulatory divergences26 values and public preferences some transatlantic regulatory differences reflect different public preferences and values for example many european consumers tend to prefer naturally produced foods while many american consumers are more accepting of products produced by advanced forms of agricultural production this difference helps to explain in part why europe has imposed restrictions on the use of growth hormones for both beef and dairy cows while the us has not it also explains in part the relative lack of political controversy in the us surrounding the introduction of biotechnology compared to the more negative response to this technology in europe27 the us and eu also operate two different systems of risk management as in the case of gmos the us system is relatively sciencebased and has strong support 24 ibid p 7 25 at the same time in 1980s and throughout much of the 1990s much of us policy was driven by efforts to reduce the costs of protective regulations on american companies and thus improve the performance of the american economy 26 jackie calmes both sides of the aisle see more regulation new york times october 14 2008 p 1 27 david vogel op cit p 6 crs10 of farmers industry and governments on the european side the public tends to favor more cautious approach including the establishment of specialized procedures to regulate gm foods and crops in terms of the process by which they are made the food safety scandals of the 1990s increased the resolve of eu member governments to put in place ever more strict regulation for the preapproval traceability and labeling of all gmos independent of their individual safety characteristics28 transparency and rulemaking the us and eu provide for very different degrees of public participation in rulemaking in the united states congress passes laws but generally grants broad authority to the administrative or regulatory agencies to implement those laws through regulations on occasion congress also provides specific direction to these agencies regulations proposed by us administering agencies are subject to considerable public input due in large part to the requirements of the us administrative procedures act apa the freedom of information act and the government in the sunshine act which permit public scrutiny of regulatory activity myriad of laws executive orders and bulletins ensure that transparency remains part of the regulatory process federal agencies are required to publish in the federal register not just the proposed rule but the supporting justification for the rule and the entire analytic justification behind it eu directives which serve the same function as us regulations tend to be developed by the european commission without as much input from either the public business or elected officials the european parliament however has to approve or pass the directives legislation proposed by the commission while the eu has number of better regulation procedures and guidelines it has effective equivalent to the apa that eu regulatory processes still are not always transparent is being addressed through the guidelines of useu regulatory cooperation29 recognizing that the us and eu have become each others most important stakeholder both sides may have an interest in ensuring that the other will have the opportunity method and forum for participating constructively in each others regulatory process institutional capacity to undertake reforms there also major differences in institutional capacities to undertake regulatory reforms the eus institutional framework is well suited to making regulatory changes in broad terms the eu has developed as regulatory state with the 28 gregory c shaffer and mark pollack op cit p 221 29 testimony of gerard depayre deputy head of

congress 1st session october 16 2003 p 20 crs11 european commission taking leading role in coordinating european wide regulatory policies in pursuit of building single market the commission has ample authority to coordinate cooperation on transatlantic regulatory issues the regulatory culture within the eu internal market is considered trade friendly because eu and national regulators operate with dual missions to promote free trade within the internal market while ensuring public safety but enforcement is usually left to member states which often results in different levels of enforcement and different treatment of european and us companies30 in general us regulatory agencies have the mandate and funding to focus on domestic regulatory issues and they enjoy fair amount of independence on policy and implementation matters however the us lacks clearcut institutional mechanism to coordinate cooperative efforts and neither the commerce department nor the office of us trade representative ustr the lead agencies for us undertakings in the realm of transatlantic regulatory cooperation have authority to overhaul domestic regulatory policymaking while commerce and ustr may bring the heads of us regulatory agencies to the negotiating table the regulatory agencies are not usually funded nor mandated to engage in trc activities31 an added structural complication on the us side is the role that states play in regulating activities particularly professional services insurance banking private pension fund management and professional services such as engineering and architecture are all subject to state regulation and some sectors exclusively32 forms of transatlantic regulatory cooperation regulatory cooperation is an elastic concept that subsumes broad range of activities at one end of the spectrum these activities may include simple discussions and sharing of information between regulators most often on prospective regulations at the other end of the spectrum these activities may can involve attempts at harmonizing regulatory approaches through acceptance of common principles and standards in between are activities that involve varying degrees of intrusion into the autonomy of regulators one such category is agreements that recognize each others standards or certification procedures these agreements are known as mras or mutual recognition agreements the line between each category can be arbitrary and vague and there are other activities associated with regulatory cooperation that may not fall neatly into one of the above categories33 30 kalypso nicolaidis

harmonisation silly question journal of international economic law 2000 pp 257264 crs12 to date most efforts at transatlantic regulatory cooperation have been associated with information exchanges and dialogues considerable efforts have also been made at negotiating mras for range of goods as well as other attempts to recognize the adequacy of each others standards in specific areas such as data privacy and accounting little has been undertaken in regard to harmonization of standards what follows is short elaboration of activities that apply to each of these regulatory activities information exchanges and dialogues the most basic form of regulatory cooperation involves the establishment of working group or dialogues for an exchange of information the group which may be comprised of technical experts or regulators from different jurisdictions may meet on an ad hoc and informal basis or may be more structured primary objective of these consultations may be to better understand technical differences in standards or regulations and to consult with each other prior to new regulations becoming effective making an effort to work with or consult with each other prior to new regulations becoming effective is viewed as one way to minimize unnecessary regulatory barriers the exchange of people and information is also expected to build trust and confidence with the hope of making for more informed and coordinated regulations and may eventually lead to agreement on what constitutes best regulatory practice while an exchange of views and discussion of different issues will not necessarily bring about meeting of the minds in the technical assessment of certain field of regulation it is necessary first step if convergence is to take place where there is attempt at dialogue efforts to restrain unilateral legislative actions that could create new regulatory barriers are unlikely to be successful34 in the transatlantic context number of us regulatory agencies eg the securities and exchange commission the food and drug administration the national highway traffic administration and the occupational safety and health administration have engaged in these kinds of information exchanges and non binding dialogues with their european counterparts over the past decade these exchanges were encouraged by the guidelines on regulatory cooperation and transparency which the united states and eu negotiated as part of the 1998 transatlantic economic partnership tep the guidelines were intended to enhance cooperation between eu and us regulators in the development of technical regulations and specifically referred to regular consultation exchange of data and information as well as informing one another at an early stage on planned new regulation since 2004 the annual useu summits have reinforced efforts at regulatory cooperation roadmap for regulatory cooperation provides framework of specific activities in 15 different sectors eg pharmaceuticals telecommunications 34 reinhard quick regulatory cooperation op cit p 402 crs13 equipment food safety and auto safety subsequent summits have prescribed cooperation for lighthouse projects in the fields of intellectual property rights secure trade financial markets innovation and technology as well as the elimination of obstacles to investment in addition high level regulatory cooperation forum comprised of regulators from both sides was established to find common ground on horizontal issues such as risk assessment costbenefit analysis and impact analysis when promulgating regulations mutual recognition agreements stronger form of cooperation involves mras this cooperation entails an agreement by regulators to accept products or services from another jurisdiction under specified conditions so that actors complying with the regulations of one jurisdiction will be considered to be in compliance with the rules in another jurisdiction these kind of agreements can focus on the mutual recognition of conformity assessment certifications or the alignment of relevant standards under full recognition of standards companies for example could sell pharmaceuticals in the united states after meeting european standards without first obtaining fda approval an agreement on conformity assessment procedures is smaller step requiring domestic regulators to accept the competency of their foreign counterparts to conduct product testing inspection or certification the basic premise behind this kind of mra is that products could be tested once and considered to have been tested in both markets35 in 1998 the us and eu completed an mra for testing and certification requirements covering multiple sectors including telecommunications and information technology equipment pharmaceuticals electronics electromagnetic compatibility sports boats and medical devices the mra did not provide for mutual recognition of product standards but it identified certification bodies in the exporting country that could assess the conformity of range of traded goods with standards of the destination country the mras thus introduced competition between assessors or certification bodies competition among certification entities was familiar in europe where private firms had long provided certification but was new in the united states where government agencies had dominated the process as result while some us officials believed that the mras would lead to cheaper and more rapid certification others were concerned about its implications for product safety36 the mras did not result in any kind of binding legal agreement between the united states and the eu rather they were accomplished through an exchange of 35 testimony of stuart eizenstat europeanamerican business council hearing on useu cooperation on regulatory affairs subcommittee on european affairs of the committee on foreign relations us senate 108th congress 1st session october 16 2003 p 29 36 charan devereaux robert z lawrence and michael d watkins the useu mutual recognition agreements in case studies in us trade negotiations in making the rules vol 1 institute for international economics 2006 p 304 crs14 letters between the heads of the relevant regulatory agencies to be implemented successfully mras require that regulators on both sides of the atlantic have confidence that the other side will not try to attract more business by being deliberately lax similarly regulators need to recognize that each others safety standards and inspection requirements are basically equivalent37 harmonization agreement on regulatory standards the strongest form of regulatory cooperation involves harmonization or agreement on the same standards or rules applied across jurisdictions this could extend not only to regulatory targets eg the permissible level of particular pollutant in each jurisdiction or reserve requirements among banks but also to the manner by which regulators ensure compliance with their regulations in the transatlantic context few precedents exist for acceptance or adoption of similar or identical standards while there have been numerous political declarations calling for regulatory convergence and harmonization few changes have been enacted in each sides existing laws that would move their regulatory regimes in this direction the transatlantic market of course is not single market with common institutions pushing for further economic integration but various stakeholders frustrated by the slow progress in transatlantic regulatory cooperation have made proposals that could push the two sides in the direction of adopting new institutional architecture such as binding regulatory cooperation agreement38 those who see binding treaty or regulatory cooperation agreement as necessary institutional architecture to achieve transatlantic single market point to eu integration as model in moving towards the completion of single european market the commission issued white paper that listed the pieces of legislation requiring harmonization and simultaneously identified the institutional mechanisms to achieve specified ends39 us public support for such an approach could depend on whether the goal of such treaty or legal agreement was the development of identical legislation or comparable legislation if the goal was identical legislation much resistance to this kind of deeper integration could be expected from number of quarters this is particularly true from stakeholders who view movement in this direction as leading to loss of regulatory autonomy for us authorities if the goal was the 37 stuart eisenstadt op cit p 24 38 the us chamber of commerce for example has proposed an agreement on regulatory cooperation arc legally binding regulatory cooperation agreement that would oblige both sides to operate under common set of regulatory principles and core beliefs the arc would require regulators to assess the cost impact of forthcoming regulations on transatlantic commerce adopt others best practices where possible and utilize similar methodology to assess costs and benefits of proposed regulations see chamber of commerce of the united states correspondence to us office of management and budget and to the secretariat general european commission february 8 2008 39 reinhard quick regulatory cooperation p 401 crs15 development of similar or comparable legislation that facilitates mutual recognition much less resistance perhaps could be expected40 results of past initiatives at regulatory cooperation the united states and eu have pursued variety of policy initiatives and new mechanisms over the past 15 years to reduce or eliminate regulatory barriers the results have been mixed an varied number of these initiatives have been successful in some regulatory areas while transatlantic regulatory cooperation has not made material differences for businesses or consumers in some other sectors assuming it is concluded that stronger regulatory cooperation is desirable an assessment of past efforts could be useful highlights of past initiatives beginning in 1990 with the transatlantic declaration regular useu summits were initiated to reinvigorate and upgrade the bilateral relationship attended by the us president the president of the european commission and the president of the european council the summits were intended to bring highlevel focus to cooperative activities successive summits have led to number of agreements relating to transatlantic regulatory cooperation at the 1995 summit in madrid the us and eu formally adopted the new transatlantic agenda nta in an effort to provide new foundation for the partnership the nta was accompanied by detailed action plan in addition the nta set up comprehensive and regular governmentto government dialogue as well as four dialogues between stakeholders on both sides of the atlantic these included the transatlantic business dialogue tabd the transatlantic labor dialogue tald the transatlantic environmental dialogue taed and the transatlantic consumer dialogue tacd pursuant to the nta the two sides focused particular attention on problems posed by divergent standards and certification systems in addition to promoting the convergence in regulatory systems efforts were undertaken to negotiate mras covering several sectors in 1998 mras affecting sectors such as electrical equipment pharmaceutical products telecommunications and information technology equipment were reached at the 1998 summit in london the transatlantic economic partnership tep was created to improve bilateral economic and trade relations and to help create more open world trading system 40 ibid crs16 the tep established deadlines for particular actions within the areas of regulatory cooperation mutual recognition and consumer product safety at the bonn summit in june 1999 joint statement on early warning and problem prevention mechanisms was adopted the warning system was designed to identify regulations preferably still in draft form that might contribute to nontariff barriers to trade at the 2000 useu summit in lisbon the consultative forum on biotechnology was established to improve communication and understanding on the various concerns involved in biotechnology at the may 2002 summit in washington the two sides reached agreements on guidelines for regulatory cooperation and transparency these sought to take the idea of an early warning system step further by encouraging us and eu regulatory agencies to consult on voluntary basis sharing work plans that identify areas of anticipated regulatory action for the coming year and offering opportunities for reaction before regulations are finalized41 moving towards more systematic cooperative approach roadmap for euus regulatory cooperation and transparency was developed in june 2004 it listed 10 specific projects for regulatory discussion and also expanded the approach to horizontal initiatives the 2005 euus summit produced second roadmap for euus regulatory cooperation and transparency and expanded the list to 15 sectorspecific projects it also established two new dialogues one was between the european commission and office of management and budget on transparency and methodologies for impact and risk assessment in order to improve understanding of each others regulatory systems second highlevel regulatory cooperation forum was tasked to develop joint regulatory work plan based on mutual best practices its members include senior us and european commission officials academics business executives and other officials accomplishments among the accomplishments are the following 1 most observers would agree that new mechanisms for dialogue and information exchange have improved mutual understanding and daytoday working relationships 41 the atlantic council of the united states risk and reward useu regulatory cooperation on food safety and the environment policy paper november 2002 p 7 crs17 among economic regulators in wide range of sectors arguably cooperation is now far deeper broader more decentralized and routine than it had been before in areas such as pharmaceuticals medical devices financial services and marine equipment 2 the nta process and related efforts at regulatory cooperation fostered closer relationships among many stakeholders including business people representing the major corporations investing in both europe and the united states in particular the tabd representing transatlantic coalition of big businesses on both sides of the atlantic developed into an effective framework for enhanced cooperation between the transatlantic business community and the governments of the european union and the united states42 3 the nta and subsequent summits enhanced ongoing efforts to increase the compatibility of us and eu approaches to competition policy according to one observer much convergence in substantive standards has been achieved voluntarily through the exchange of ideas and institutional learning processes43 4 mras discussed previously covering over 50 billion in trade were implemented in three sectors leading to significant cost savings for us businesses several of the agreements provided for us and eu testing facilities to recognize each others standards over time thus allowing firms to have products tested only once on either side of the atlantic the commerce department estimated that the agreement would save us industries more than 1 billion in testing and certification costs44 5 the 2002 guidelines for regulatory cooperation promoted number of procedural steps that most likely have facilitated more effective dialogue these steps included arrangements to permit sharing of nonpublic information between regulators the roadmap for regulatory cooperation now provides framework for consultations and dialogue in fifteen different sectors eg pharmaceuticals telecommunications equipment food safety and auto safety with focus on prospective regulations and reducing regulatory barriers 6 the useu safe harbor agreement was implemented in 2002 this agreement provided an innovative mechanism whereby us firms could be certified as meeting the eus more demanding data privacy requirements for exporting personal data 42 maria green cowles calming the waters the rebirth of

that ensures the comparability of regulatory reviews with an emphasis on risk assessments costbenefit analysis and trade and investment impacts unilateral legislative initiatives and the creation of new regulatory barriers can be curtailed 9 by 2006 the financial markets regulatory dialogue had reported some progress on recognizing each others financial standards in specific areas46 in particular progress has been made on gaining the mutual acceptance by 2009 of the equilevance of accounting standards that is the us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs this will make it easier for european companies to raise capital in the united states and for us companies to raise capital in europe47 disappointments specific disappointments include the following 1 enthusiasm for mutual recognition as regulatory strategy faded when three of the six agreements failed to become operational by established deadlines48 in the view of some analysts these mras were never implemented due to the us reluctance to recognize the equivalency of european certifiers in the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors for example the fda had continuing doubts about the capability of some eu member states to oversee high pharmaceutical standards in laboratories in the electrical equipment sector osha refused to cede its right to designate which laboratories in europe could evaluate and certify new electrical products for sale in the united states49 related obstacle on the european side was the eu inclination to regulate at the european level only to leave enforcement to 45 charon devereaux robert z lawrence and michael d watkins the useu mutual recognition agreements p 348 46 elliott posner market power without single

went into hibernation from 1998 to 2004 despite the many recommendations and political declarations issued during this time period there were few material accomplishments51 3 pieces of legislation adopted unilaterally by both sides in 2002 served to put break on regulatory cooperation by violating the 2002 guidelines on regulatory cooperation and the early warning system on the one side the eu imposed its views on how to regulate chemicals by adopting legislation known as reach which affected the testing and approval of chemicals without much input from us stakeholders on the other side the united states adopted legislation sarbanes oxley which reformed public accounting standards without taking into account eu views both pieces of legislation created considerable difficulties for transatlantic businesses from companies attempting to raise capital to firms that manufacture everyday goods 4 despite extensive efforts at cooperation for nearly two decades the transatlantic regulatory divide remains large in the area of chemicals the two sides still maintain fundamentally different regulations on issues such as hormones genetically modified organisms gmos cosmetics and the registration and restriction of chemical substances us and eu regulators continue to operate with starkly different regulatory philosophies and styles and the record of transatlantic regulatory cooperation in this sphere has been highly contentious prompting the us to file legal complaint with the wto52 5 there has been lack of material progress in many other sectors such as autos and pharmaceuticals moreover past trc initiatives have tended to be fragmented poorly coordinated and lacking in political accountability for success and failure53 obstacles and options for more extensive cooperation in evaluating the history of past initiatives number of observers have pointed to several key obstacles to more effective regulatory cooperation high on this list are the independence of regulatory agencies involved the lack of committed resources for transatlantic regulatory collaboration and the sheer complexity of the 50 stuart eizenstad op cit p 26 51 reinhardt quick regulatory

forth 1 attracting highlevel political support for trc 2 increasing dramatically the involvement of legislators on both sides in the process and 3 developing an institutional architecture that can prioritize the problems and challenges that need to be addressed regulatory cooperation particularly mutual recognition requires domestic regulators to accept the competency of their foreign counterparts to conduct product testing key obstacle however is that regulators remain accountable to domestic legislators for the product standards that are applied both to domestic and foreign products as result regulators on both sides of the atlantic are generally reluctant to transfer authority to foreign body and the mra negotiations demonstrated that some regulatory bodies are more reluctant than others54 based on the premise that enhanced regulatory cooperation particularly through mutual recognition will never happen if matters are left to individual regulatory agencies highlevel political pressure is commonly prescribed such pressure either from the white house the congress or both may be employed to convince regulators to adopt reforms that result in reduction of barriers between the united states and eu andor to make greater efforts to accommodate transatlantic interests when promulgating new regulations successful regulatory cooperation also requires resources for the necessary meetings and dialogues to take place at least on the us side the regulatory agencies have dedicated budgets to support these activities accordingly some stakeholders such as the us chamber of commerce have proposed that congress consider the creation of specifically funded mandates to enable us agencies better participate in these transatlantic dialogues the scope of the transatlantic regulatory agenda is also extremely broad and technical encompassing most regulatory agencies ranging from the food and drug administration fda and the consumer product safety commission cpsc to the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa and the environmental protection agency epa and diverse sectors ranging from pharmaceuticals and cosmetics to telecommunications and marine safety the status of the agenda at any one time is not easy to ascertain to move issues forward that are by their nature abstract and technical some observers have called for creation of institution that is capable of setting priorities and deciding on which issues are ripe for resolution with the help of higherlevel political intervention the transatlantic economic council predicated on the notion that past initiatives failed to make significant progress in enhancing regulatory progress the transatlantic economic council tec was established in april 2007 at the us eu summit as key component of the framework for advancing transatlantic economic integration created as new 54 kalypso nicolaidais and rebecca steffenson p 145 crs21 entity by german chancellor angela merkel european commission president barroso and president bush the tec is designed to provide ministerlevel political guidance for implementation of work program as outlined by the framework to foster regulatory cooperation and to reduce or eliminate regulatory burdens to trade the summit leaders also created an advisory group to the tec and invited the us congress along with the european parliament to accept new more substantive role in transatlantic regulatory cooperation by becoming part of an advisory group in short the tec and the framework are designed to deal with some of the suggested shortcomings described above of previous transatlantic regulatory initiatives lack of high level political leadership and not enough involvement of legislators and other stakeholders in the regulatory process the tec consists of two cochairs ministeriallevel appointees with cabinet rank from each side as well as number of eu commissioners and us cabinet members for the broad ranging policy areas covered in the framework currently the cochairs are daniel price assistant to the president for international economic affairs and guenter verheugen vice president of the european commission permanent members of the tec include the secretaries of the treasury and commerce and the us trade representative and the european commissioners for external relations for trade and internal market and services in addition other us cabinet members and european commissioners may participate when the agenda covers issues falling under their jurisdiction55 given that the two tec leaders are cabinetlevel appointees the tec was expected to have the kind of highlevel political support that previous efforts at economic integration may have lacked such clout it is argued may be needed to persuade domestic regulators to yield some of their authorities or to better cooperate with their counterparts across the atlantic in harmonizing regulatory approaches56 trcs efforts to foster cooperation and reduce regulatory barriers focus on two main types of issues 1 differences in regulatory processes and approaches and 2 sectoral or bilateral barriers and disputes the goal in the first issue area is to find ways to reduce barriers to transatlantic economic integration posed by new regulations and or prevent them from happening the primary avenue for accomplishing this objective entails efforts to reform harmonize or converge regulatory processes both through the development of comparable methodologies to 55 at the second tec meeting held may 13 2008 the us delegation included agriculture secretary ed schafer labor secretary elaine chao us trade representative susan schwab deputy treasury secretary robert kimmitt food and drug administration commissioner andrew von eschenbach securities and exchange commissioner paul atkins assistant to the president for international economic affairs daniel price administrator of the office of information and regulatory affairs susan dudley and other senior administration economic officials the eu delegation led by guenter verheugen vicepresident of the european commission included commissioners for trade the internal market kuneva and kovacs as well as other senior commission economic officials 56 for more information on the tec see section iv in the useu framework for advancing transatlantic economic integration april 2007 available at httpwwwwhitehousegovreleases200704200704304html crs22 assess risk and do costbenefit analysis and intensified interactions among regulators how regulations are developed and applied can have large impact on the how companies do business not only in the transatlantic marketplace but in third markets as well the goal in the second issue area is to reduce barriers to transatlantic integration caused by regulations in specific sectors this is to be accomplished by intensified sectorbysector cooperation including the promotion of the 2002 useu guidelines for regulatory cooperation and casebycase examination of specific projects called for by the roadmap for regulatory cooperation57 the initial meeting of the trc was held november 9 2007 in washington and second meeting was held may 13 2008 in brussels both meetings appeared to stumble over efforts to resolve disputes involving sales of poultry cosmetics and electrical equipment the us side in particular expressed displeasure and concern about the pace of changes in eu regulations that would allow the importation of poultry meat using pathogen reduction treatments as well as concerns that the implementation of the eus reach regulation not cause trade in cosmetics and personal care products to be disrupted on the other hand the eu expressed concerns that osha regulations are continuing to make it unduly difficult for eu electrical and electronic equipment producers to gain certification in the us market the scant progress made in settling these disputes highlighted the limited capacity of the trc to break new ground in the area of dispute settlement composed of cabinetlevel officials from both sides the trc is transatlantic inter governmental entity that skirts the normal channels for affecting policy changes in both the us and eu as transatlantic entity or coalition the trc may have difficulty matching the power of domestic constituencies that plead for trade protection or support regulations that tilt the playing field in one direction or another nor may the trc be wellpositioned to change the domestic dynamics of who supports any particular regulatory regime58 that is to say that domestic coalitions in both the united states and europe acting in support of regulatory competition may have more success in challenging other domestic interests that support the status quo than transatlantic coalition59 while changing existing regulations and resolving disputes is formidable challenge the tecs efforts to foster regulatory cooperation and reduce regulatory barriers may prove more fruitful as it focuses on differences in regulatory processes and approaches by focusing on the development of comparable methodologies to assess risk and do costbenefit analysis the tec can try to reduce barriers to 57 the regulatory cooperation roadmap provides framework of dialogues in 15 different sectors including pharmaceuticals telecommunications equipment food safety and auto safety 58 for example at the november 2007 tec meeting the eu side agreed to come up with definitive solution to the dispute but lacked the clout to overcome opposition in europe to lifting the ban 59 richard salt german marshall fund blog if all politics is global how should you argue for transatlantic marketplace httpbloggmfusorg20070503 crs23 transatlantic integration posed by new regulations or prevent them from happening how regulations are developed and applied whether they pertain to product safety environmental protection securities trading or customs procedures can have large impact on how companies do business in the transatlantic marketplace in some cases the tec value may be able to help resolve differences in views among agencies that are blocking regulatory progress and try to ensure that transatlantic impacts and integration are taken into account when legislation and regulations are being drafted60 to be effective the tec must also gain realistic understanding of what kinds of regulatory cooperation are politically feasible61 role of congress since it began nearly two decades ago transatlantic regulatory cooperation has been for the most part wholly run undertaking between the executive branches and independent regulatory agencies on both sides of the atlantic by and large trc exchanges and dialogues have been confined to regulators and officials of the executive branches on both sides of the atlantic the guidelines on regulatory cooperation and transparency in fact do not apply to congress or the european parliament the role of congress in transatlantic regulatory cooperation in the past has been limited mostly to oversight hearings see appendix for listing and the introduction of few resolutions62 but congress has on occasion taken actions that have both thwarted and facilitated regulatory cooperation for example on the one hand some members of congress became concerned in the late 1990s that the mras the administration was negotiating could harm consumers and undermine health and safety standards as representative henry waxman dca put it there is question that international agreements of this kind can enhance the efficiency of commerce but it is equally clear that they can potentially depress american health and safety standards according to one observer such concerns made some us regulators reluctant to participate in the mra negotiations63 60 the united states mission to the european union uss price discusses transatlantic economic councils successes future april 30 2008 httpuseuusmissiongovdossiers regulationapril30_price_tecasp 61 david vogel p 14 62 in december 2006 the senate passed resolution sres 632 calling for the completion of the transatlantic market by 2015 the resolution also called for jointly funded cooperatively led study of existing barriers to transatlantic trade and investment including sectorbysector estimates of the costs and benefits of removing such obstacles and timetable for their removal 63 congressman henry waxman hearing before the house subcommittee on oversight and investigations of the committee on commerce imported drugs useu mutual recognition agreement on drug prescriptions 105th congress 2nd session october 2 1998 p 4 crs24 on the other hand congress also passed legislation directing the fda to support efforts of the department of commerce and ustr to implement mras in the food and drug administration modernization act of 1997 pl 105115 bill to speed the fda approval process for new drugs and medical devices provision directed the fda to support the efforts of commerce and the office of the us trade representative to implement mras according to the same observer inclusion of the mra language in the legislation was an important step toward finishing the agreement64 these examples highlight larger and more pivotal role congress could play in regulatory cooperation if it chose to become more involved to the extent that an overwhelming domestic orientation of regulatory agencies is problem in moving trc initiatives forward congress has the power through both the authorization and appropriations process to mandate that us regulators cooperate congress can also ensure that the us agencies involved in regulatory cooperation have the necessary budgetary and organizational resources to get the job done conversely if congress views transatlantic initiatives as moving too far in the direction of trade expansion at the expense of safety and health concerns or other priorities congress can make it difficult for us agencies to continue on that course of action beyond providing guidance to us regulatory agencies on trc initiatives congress also could play bigger role in preventing new legislation from causing new transatlantic regulatory barriers currently taking the transatlantic impact trade and investment effects into account is not considered in any structured or formal fashion during the legislative process yet political declarations from past useu summits backed by the transatlantic business community have urged more institutionalized process for making congress more aware of the potential impact of new legislation on transatlantic trade how this could be done is the subject of considerable speculation one of the factors that has to be considered is the wide range of congressional committees that have primary jurisdiction over issues that are high on the agenda of trc as shown in appendix b many different authorizing committees have primary jurisdiction over some of the main regulatory agencies involved in trc activities on the house side the energy and commerce transportation judiciary and agriculture committees all have important oversight roles counterpart committees on the senate side include commerce science and transportation health education labor and pensions energy and natural resources environment and public works and agriculture notably absent from this list are the committees charged with overall responsibility for oversight of transatlantic relations the senate foreign relations and the house foreign affairs committees and the committees that have primary jurisdiction over trade and investment issues senate finance and the house ways and means currently the only formal institutional link between congress and transatlantic regulatory cooperation is through the transatlantic legislators dialogue tld an interparliamentary exchange between selected members of the house of 64 charan devereaux robert z lawrence and michael d watkins the useu mutual recognition agreements p 339 crs25 representatives and the european parliament the tld serves as an advisor to the tec but its membership and function have raised questions concerning how well it can carry out its role as an advisor to the tec much of this begs the question whether congress should be an advisor or participant in the trc process including the annual us eu summits while more proactive role for congress would likely enhance the political basis of support for transatlantic regulatory cooperation it is means certain that
