government counterpart agency iv audit findings and recommendations programme and project management 8 unodc country office nigeria currently manages s ix projects including one that engages unops as an associate agency over the last ten years the budget for the project portfolio increased from 17 million to 35 milli on however the political instability in nigeria impeded the flow of aid and funds from donor countries leading unodc to evaluate whether nigeria could eventually fund its own drug p rogrammes oios noted the staffs enthusiasm and commitment to the successful impleme ntation of ongoing projects and to further developing the project portfolio nonetheless to m eet the future challenges in dealing with the increasing number of projects the existing arrange ments for project planning monitoring and accounting needed improvement several other issue s in each of the ongoing projects also required attention andor corrective actions 1 planning and monitoring 9 unodc country office nigeria did not have adequa planning procedures as basis in guiding project implementation project e72 did not have plan while plans for projects f22 and g50 were mere list of activities without detailed cost plans consequently project monitoring proved to be deficient and reporting was limited to processing semiannual progress reports unodc country office nigeria prepared monitoring nd costed work plans specific for project implementation as oios recommended in addition u nodc country office nigeria planned inhouse training sessions on project monitoring in june 2004 and further frms training to be held by the end of 2004 2 implementation of project activities drug control projects project e72 drug abuse prevention for street chil dren and commercial sex workers 3 10 under an mou unodc country office nigeria provi ded an ngo 83500 for project implementation the project was considered operati onally closed when the final project report was issued in may 2003 however the three counsel ling facilities the maintenance of which was the responsibility of the ngo could not be sust ained and had been closed due to lack of funds unodc country office nigeria assessed the status of the counselling facilities and took remedial actions to ensure the project success oios also noted that the unodc country office nigeria did not regularly hand in semiannua l project reports and the ngo did not submit the required bimonthly expenditure reports and aud it certificates for annual expenditures unodc country office nigeria implementing oios rec ommendation secured the required audit certificates project f22 strengthening treatment and rehabilit ation services offered by the governments and ngos 11 this twoyear project started in january 2 002 will close shortly while the project only had around 15000 excluding staff costs left for the project activities many of them as of audit date were yet to be carried out unodc country offi ce nigeria should have strategic plan for the effective completion of the project by focusing on critical activities that enhance the sustainability of the project quarterly reporting by the lips on project activities could improve post project monitoring however the partnership agreement did not contain clause on the manner of reporting and monitoring of the lip acti vities recommendation head2right unodc country office nigeria should prepare list f activities with cost estimates to determine the critical and monit oring activities that need to be carried out under project f22 to achieve reasonable level of project sustainability rec 01 12 in response unodc country office nigeria planned f or critical activities including programme and project committee ppc meeting that would map up project sustainability by the end of june 2004 oios keeps the recommendation open awaiting the result of the ppc meeting project g50 partnership for drug abuse and hivai ds prevention in nigeria 13 this project which started in january 2003 wit h twoyear duration and budget of 800000 had insufficient oversight arrangements for example the project document did not include an allocation for evaluation although unodc policy requires mandatory evaluation of all projects with budget of at least 500000 fu rthermore too many members were involved in the project advisory committee which could affect the projects operations unodc country office nigeria in implementing oios recommendatio n planned an evaluation mission in october 2004 and adjusted accordingly the costed wo rk plan for project g50 to strengthen oversight arrangements these included project ev aluation within the framework of the tripartite review to assess nigerias demand reduct ion portfolio and thematic evaluations to 4 identify and share lessons learned with the merge r of the pac and the tripartite review meetings attendance would be reduced to 20 b crime prevention projects unicri project programme of action against traffi cking in minors and young women from nigeria to italy for the purpose of sexual exploitat ion 14 the project did not have clear legal basis s the project document was not approved according to the unodc project approval procedures unodc hq told unodc country office nigeria that documents should be signed b etween unicri and unodc country office nigeria nonetheless the latter implemented the project starting july 2003 with an 18 months duration the project funded through an allo tment advice for office operation 5100 did not reference the project number this resulted in commingling unicri funds with those for office operation and consequently in ineffective f inancial controls recommendation head2right unodc country office nigeria should prepare formal agreement with unicri have it approved by unodc hq as project and separately account for financial transactions related to the u nicri project rec 02 15 unodc country office nigeria accepted oios recomme ndation and letter of agreement between unicri and unodc is currently bein g finalized oios will close the recommendation when it receives copy of the signe d agreement project g73 upgrading of the ndlea jos academy to regional law enforcement training centre 16 the projects overall budget for the past 5¬Ω ye ars was 47 million since the beginning of phase 1 in july 2003 the projects budget total ed 15 million the project was signed on 15 august 2003 when the nigerian government deposited 2 million oios noted the following the country representative modified the project do cument in particular the optout clause that reads in the course of the first phase of t he project unodc and nigerian authorities will do their utmost to mobilize additional funding for the implementation of phases 2 and 3 the optout clause was revised without prior cleara nce from unodc hq and in contradiction of unodc rules to change substantive documents that we re originally endorsed by unodcs programme and project committee ppc and approved by the executive director the country representative explained that the revised text was introduced to convince the nigerian government to contribute 2 million to the project under cost sharing arrangement unodc hq maintained that the original optout clause was meant to protect unodc in the event that lack of funds would cause suspension or cessation f project activities and to protect the credibility of unodc oios considers the change of t he optout clause as significant this change should therefore have been submitted for cle arance by unodc hq the project concluded under the cost sharing agree ment put unodc in difficult position to match the contribution made by the nigerian gover nment oios noted strong expectation 5 from the nigerian government that unodc raise funds f or project phases 1 and 2 with total funding of 32 million consequently funding st rategy needed to be developed immediately the project had 1 million budget for purchasing equipment the current practice of unodc country office nigeria does not involve undp i n the procurement process undp only made payments and examined related supporting documents in the interest of more effective and transparent procurement process unodc should make use of the expertise of undp in this area recommendations head2right unodc country office nigeria in consultation with dc hq should develop funding strategy for the subsequen t phases of project g73 to ensure adequacy of funds under the cost shar ing arrangement with the nigerian government rec 03 head2right unodc country office nigeria should involve undp niger ia in the procurement of project equipment to enhance its tra nsparency rec 04 17 unodc country office nigeria accepted the recommend ations and would discuss the appropriate course of action during the representat ives seminar in vienna in june 2004 currently the country office is using the same busi ness procedures used by the unodc regional office south africa oios will close the recommendations upon receipt of copy of the funding strategy document and confirmation that undp is involved in the procurement for project g73 project r13 measures to combat trafficking in hum an beings in benin nigeria and togo 18 the project started in july 2003 with oneyea r duration there was clear delineation of responsibilities between unodc country office nig eria undp nigeria and unops the associated agency in carrying out different projec t activities such as organization of meetings and subcontracting on recruitment of project perso nnel it was not clear which party was responsible for preparing tors filling vacancies administering contracts and payments this could lead to confusion during project implementati on with the risk of delays and inefficiencies 19 while in the past it had been the practice to ngage unops as the administrative service provider for project r13 oios does not see the rat ionale of engaging unops in addition to undp undp nigeria could provide all the administrat ive services under an mou between undp and unodc recommendation head2right unodc country office nigeria should consult with unop s and unodc hq to clarify the details of the respective ro and responsibilities to ensure efficient and implementa tion of project r13 rec 05 6 20 the unodc country office nigeria accepted the recom mendation and added that unodc antihuman trafficking unit and the africa and middle east section partnership in development branch at the unodc hq attempted to clarif the respective roles on project execution between unodc and unops with limited resu lts oios keeps the recommendation open awaiting the result andor hq decision on the use of unops for project r13 b administration 1 financial management local accounting system 21 the arrangements for financial accounting at odc country office nigeria were not adequate oios noted the following there were separate books of accounts payment r equests to undp nigeria had not been recorded either in an electronic or manual format as result expenditure reporting by project and by output andor activity was not available the finance assistant who performed monthly review s of undp iov statements and made the necessary corrections was not able to make t horough reconciliation due to the absence of separate books of accounts unodc country office nigeria did not have an adequa system for monitoring and reporting advances made for certain project activit ies ie workshops and nationwide assessment tours that require disbursement of funds to the fie ld as result the complete schedule of advances was not available as of audit date at th time of the audit 50000 was still outstanding from ndlea since june and october 2002 and 18750 from npo since august 2002 and 2003 separate set of filing was not maintained for fin ancial transactions instead they were filed with various other documents 22 in 2002 the absence of an adequate accounting system contributed to late detection of over expenditures of 41700 against an allotment f 220000 it was only one year later in 2003 when undp reported the over expenditures to dc hq unodc country office nigeria provided unodc hq with the necessary explanat ions and justification for over expenditures unodc country office nigeria stated t hat it had introduced new measures to control spending however this could not be deter mined at the time of the audit 23 the first measure to control costs is to have n adequate accounting system that includes appropriate books of accounts separate and compl ete filing of financial documents and reconciliation with undp reports more effective accounting system would facilitate detailed monitoring of expenditures to improve the decision making process unodc hq informed oios in its response to the audit recommendation on unodc iran office that it had prepared draft guideline on local level accounting oios ex pects that once formally issued the guideline should provide the basis for developing local lev accounting system in unodc country office nigeria recommendation 7 head2right unodc country office nigeria in consultation with dc hq should develop an effective field level accounting arrangement that ensures the following recording of payment requests by project and budget line with sufficient details available budget balance and ce rtification on specific vouchers recording of obligations liquidations and advances including their regular followup complete accounting and reporting per project outpu t and activity separate and complete filing system for all finan cial transactions rec 06 24 unodc country office nigeria accepted the recommen dation and would include an in house training starting in june 2004 component n financial management monitoring and support functions new lotus notes based pencil ledger would also be implemented by the fall of 2004 oios will close the recommendation when it receives copy of the pencil ledgers system description b accounting for local contributions 25 in the absence of clear guidelines from unodc hq unodc country office nigeria did not account for locally raised funds as income but simply credited the amounts to the expenditure line for office operation 5100 this practice prevented full accountability and transparency for locally raised funds for example balance of some 10000 from contribution of 65000 for workshop on hivaids and drug funded by unaids in 2002 was still credit in the 5100 account as of audit date furthermore balance of naira 718810 5600 from the advance paid to sheraton hotel t he workshop venue did not appear in the undp iov statements unodc nigeria finance assistant explained that he had deposited it into the undp bank account recommendation head2right unodc hq financial resources management service shou ld issue policies and procedures for the receipt and account ing of locally raised funds rec 07 26 unodc country office nigeria agreed with the recomm endation and plans to issue the management instructions on locally raised fund s during the first half of 2004 oios will close the recommendation upon receipt of the releva nt 2 office relocation to abuja 27 for several years the unodc country office nige ria has been planning to move to the house in abuja the capital city of nigeria the move which was envisaged for the end of 2002 had been postponed several times the countr representative said that stronger presence of unodc country office nigeria in abuja is necessary since the project portfolio 8 requires closer cooperation and coordination with t he nigerian government agencies located in abuja furthermore undp planned to relocate its c ore staff members including its finance staff to abuja in early 2004 thus unodc country ffice nigeria secured temporary office from one of the government agencies icpc in abuja to accommodate staff until the renovations were completed in addition to establi shing an office in abuja unodc country office nigeria also expected to keep its office in lagos for certain drug related projects implementing oios recommendation unodc country offi ce nigeria developed plan of action for relocating to abuja and strategy for perating in multiple locations it also entered into formal agreement with the government agency icpc on the use of the premises in abuja 28 in anticipation of the office move unodc count ry office nigeria paid relocation package amounting to 57000 this package based on decision by the management group in nigeria was intended to help staff relocat to abuja as the move at that time was envisaged as definite however as there was still planned date for the relocation unodc country office nigeria did not have any arrangemen t for recovery of the relocation package in case staff members chose not to relocate to abuja r were separated from service before the move oios considers it as inappropriate that these payments were made before the move took place and without any provision for recovery recommendation head2right unodc country office nigeria should put in place an arrangement to ensure recovery of the relocation package of 5700 0 already paid if staff members do not relocate within reasonable timefra rec 08 29 unodc country office nigeria accepted the recommend ation and plans to implement it by the end of july 2004 oios will close the recommendation when unodc confi rms either that the three staff members have actually relocated to abuja or that the relocation payments made have been recovered 3 other administrative matters training and performance appraisal 30 practically training was provided to the sta ff training is prerequisite to improve the competencies and efficiencies of staff members spec ifically in it ununodc regulations and rules and procurement the performance apprais system pas requires identification of training for career development however unodc country office nigeria only carried out formal performance appraisals for staff members fun ded through the office budget and excluded project staff unodc country office nigeria could vail itself of training courses offered through other agencies in lagos unodc country office nigeria agreed to oios recommendation to develop and implement staff tr aining plan for all its staff members b office administration 31 below is summary of the areas in general adm inistration that needed further improvement 9 filing unodc country office nigeria compiled all d ocuments in two files an office file and project file however the project file was not detailed and there was standard documentation for each outputactivity the respect ive roles and responsibilities of the administrativefinance assistant and project office r for filing documents were not clear and there was network drive to store and share elect ronic files it plan unodc country office nigeria needed long term it plan that explores the opportunities that technology could provide to impr ove operations the plan should identify necessary it skills and system requirements host country agreement there was host country agreement established between the nigerian government and unodc country office nigeria the country representative explained that the establishment of unodc country of fice nigeria comes under an agreement between undp and the nigerian government but could n ot provide the auditor with document to that effect new agreement should be considered to reflect the official status of the office as country office of unodc and include definition of its function privileges and immunities for its operations and staff members inventory control the inventory list for office nd project equipment should include the purchase date identification number and current cation recommendation head2right unodc country office nigeria should establish an it plan and explore the use of it to improve project management and off ice administration including the filing system the inventory list fo r office and project equipment should include the purchase date identi fication number and current location rec 09 32 unodc country office nigeria agreed to implement th recommendation by the end of 2004 unodc is looking into new computerized inven tory system for yearend and accounting purposes oios will close the recommendation open awaiting an it plan for unodc country office nigeria and confirmation of the implementati on of the new inventory system c local level service agreement with undp 33 undp nigeria provided administrative services to unodc country office nigeria charging at rate it similarly applies to all the other agencies the charges for common costs maintenance of common premises and services to dc country office nigeria amounted to some 55000 from 2001 to 2003 and for support costs at around 27000 from 2001 to 2002 estimates unodc country office nigeria had not r eceived from undp nigeria baseline figures such as number of personnel actions and vo uchers etc to substantiate support costs as well as the actual charges for 2002 in addition s ince there had not been formal service agreement at the local level the respective roles and responsibilities of unodc country office nigeria and undp nigeria were not clear unclear ter ms on administrative services prevented unodc country office nigeria to effectively monitor and evaluate the quality of services of undp nigeria furthermore as operating procedures were not clear unodc country office nigeria inconsistently applied regulations and rules 10 34 in march 2004 unodc and undp signed new memo randum of understanding for undp cost recovery for services at the country prog ramme level in line with previous audit recommendations in the audit of undp service arrange ments oios expects that unodc will provide guidance to the field offices in establishi ng and assessing performance indicators for undp provided services the guidance will need to clarify the responsibilities and roles for financial and administrative management services of unodc and undp field offices and the applicable regulations rules and procedures for fi nance personnel travel and procurement to be observed by both field offices v further
