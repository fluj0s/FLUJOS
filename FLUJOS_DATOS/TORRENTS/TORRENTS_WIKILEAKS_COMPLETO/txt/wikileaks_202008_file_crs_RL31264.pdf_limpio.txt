act of 1986 pl 99662 to pay for the routine maintenance and operations costs of harbors numerous lega l challenges to the hmt raise questions about its future and the issue of possible legislative changes in march 1998 the supreme court struck down the applica tion of the hmt with respect to exports finding that it violated the constitutions ban on export taxes cases regarding the constitutionality of the hmt on imports remain in litigation the european union sees the application of the hmt to imports as discriminatory import tariff that violates the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the current harbor maintenance trust fund balance in conjunction with the revenue stream from the remaining hmt collections and interest payments are considered sufficient to cover expenditures for the foreseeable future however the results of the legal and trade challenges could reduce or halt incoming revenue harbor maintenance dredgin g requirements are expected to increase in the nearterm over recent levels due to current deepening projects at many ports larger containerships appear to be the primary driving force behind current dredging activity issues for the

projects key policy questions include should the federal g overnment return to using t he general fund to finance harbor maintenance should new user f ee be established to pay for harbor maintenance the larger issue that may need to be resolved before funding solution can be found is what should the role of the federal government be in port maintenance and dredging the water r esources development act of 2003 hr 2557 which passed the house would increase the role of the federal government by increasing its share of the cost in harbor deepening and maintenance projects this report

deepening of federal waterway channels5funding for dredging harbor berths the waterside area along the wharf where vessel is docked is the responsibility of state or local port authorities second useful point of clarification is t he distinction between shipper and carrier in everyday usage the term shipper can refer to both the cargo owner and the transporter of goods in the trans portation industry the term shipper is used to identify the owner of the cargo in motion eg the party that pays the freight bill the term carrier is defined as the p arty providing the transportation service in maritime context the carrier would be the shipowner or operator under the current hmt scheme the shipper is liable f or payment of the tax resultant from cargo vessel movements for pa ssenger vessels the carrier is liable for the tax legislative history prior to 1986 us treasury general funds were used to pay the federal share for operation and maintenance om of harbors and for the deepening of channels6in 1986 congress enacted costshare requi rements for harbor deepening and maintenance as shown in the table 1 be low the hmt was devised to provide stable federal funding for this purpose the tax was originally applied on an ad valorem7basis on commercial cargo for any use f federallymaintained ports eg the loading of exports and unloading of im ports domestic as well as international cargo in 1986 the hmt was established at 004 of the cargo value this revenue was intended to pay for 40 of om costs incurred by the army corps of engineers and 100 of om costs of the st lawrence

legal and trade challenges could reduce or halt incoming revenue should that occur the fund could quickly be depleted at which point policymakers would have to decide whether the federal g overnment would continue to fund harbor maintenance and if affirmative would have to develop mechanism to do so there are number of significant channe l deepening or widening projects nearing completion under way or in the planning stage11an obvious concern is the effect these deepening projects will have on future harbor maintenance costs the dot expects maintenance costs will likely increase at least in the near term overall however the nations future dre dging requirements can be expected to grow above recent highs following the completion of current and future deepening projects and the ongoing maintenance requirements associated with these deeper channels upon completion of justified deepening work an initial increase in maintenance dredging requirements can be expected until the hydrodynamics of the deeper channels begin to stabilize to the new dimensions the longterm impacts of deeper channels on annual maintenance dredging is somewhat more uncertain with dredging needs highly specific to each project location and subject to complex set of variables involving the natural coastal and river processes that affect sediment movement12 in addition to the total amount of materi dredged total expenditures may increase due to an increase in the per unit cost of dredged material the port industry cites us army corps of engineers figu res which show that over the last 30 years the total cost of dredging has increased while the volume of material dredged has actually decreased13a review of the corps om budget on dredging for fiscal years 1990 to 1999 shows steady increase in total expenditures from 370 million in 1990 to 684 million in 1999 the yearly amount of material dredged for maintenance over this same period fluct uates around an average of 236 million cubic yards14complicating the dredging process is the fact that ports are often located in or near environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands estuaries and fisheries growing concern is shortage of disposal sites and lack of disposal options the volume of sediments classified as contamin ated has increased but this may be due to new testing requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31264crs5

rounding the impact of containerships on dredging needs in the early 1980s deep draft colliers coa l ships fueled debate over us port dredging needs today however everlarge r containerships are the primary driving force behind current dredging activity lthough oil tankers are among the largest vessels in the world fleet their size p eaked in the 1970s and 1980s supertanker often transfers its cargo at sea rather than i n port typically supertanker stays at sea for extended periods loading at offshor platforms or singlepoint moorings and discharging at designated lightering z ones offshore where supertanker transfers part of its cargo to smaller shuttle tanker the shuttle tanker delivers the crude oil to the refinery on shore dry bulk vessels ships that carry grain soybean ore or coal have also grown in size since world war ii but at present there does not appear to be trend towards larger vessels in this category in the container ship category however the 1990s ushered in wave of vessel size increases that seems to have limit15as the volume of containerized cargo increases the liner industry is replacing sm aller vessels with dr afts of 3840 feet with larger ships requiring drafts of 4550 feet the larger ships can carry 2000 to 3000 additional containers saving the carrier an estimated 25 per container on voyage costs the economic advantage of these megaships derives

in international marine t rade is being moved in containers by 2010 it is expected that containerized market share will increase to 9017 differences in service patterns between container and liquid or drybulk carriers also account for the greater need of contai ner ships for deeper access channels bulk tankers are usually chartered per voyage and therefore have more flexibility in waiting for tidal action to ease their passage in port container ships however operate in more timesensitive environment calling various ports on rigid and advertized schedule tidal restrictions would severely disrupt their service performance alternative funding options that have been considered carrierbased user fee in its decision the us supreme court sta ted that user fee based on the value of service provided to marine carrier would not violate the constitution in august 1998 the clinton administration proposed new revenue generating system using harbor services user fee 106thcongress hr 1947 the payment of the harbor services user fee hsuf would be placed on the carrier rather than the shipper who pays the current hmt the hsuf was based on vessels capacity as measured by vessel capacity units which are volumetric measurement of ship size based on net tonnage or gross tonnage as ppropriate and its fre quency of port use per voyage revenues from the fee would b deposited into the harbor services fund which would fund both routine mainten ance and harbordeepening projects the proposal was aimed at satisfying the supreme court ruling by establishing close link between the revenue collection and the service provided while being consistent with trade obligations industry observers have noted that sh ifting the tax burden from shippers to shipowners concentrates the tax burden with the hmt large number of shippers pay relatively small fee but with hsuf because there are many more shippers than there are shipowners few shipowners would pay relatively large fee this reality has political implications ports and carriers opposed having the federal contribution for deepening projects tak from an industrysupported fund ratherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31264crs7 18us general accounting

return to funding maintenance and dredging from general revenues hr 1260 supporters of hr 1260 claimed that general revenues were the only option because userfee system could equitably raise revenues

billion annua lly in assessments on the commercial maritime industry most of which are import duties the revenues that us customs generates are deposited directlyinto the general fund of the us treasury some have proposed designating portion of these revenues to fund harbor main tenance opponents of this plan assert that since most customs duties are collected from importe rs exporters would not be contributing their share for harbor maintenance in its decision the supreme court stated this does not mean that exporters are exempt from any and all user fees designed to defray the cost of harbor maintenance it does mean however that such fee must fairly match the exporters use of port services and facilities19 issues for congress there are number of policy questions that are intertwined with the question of how to finance harbor maintenance in manner that is both constitutional and not in violation of trade agreements the f undamental ques tion is who should pay for dredging port users or taxpayers if it is decided that port users should pay which users in particular shippers or carriers whether the federal government or local port authorities should administer the fee nd whether nationally uniform fee or portspecific fee is more equitable and efficient are also key questions in addition to these issues policymakers may revisit the cost sharing arrangement

january 2002 and shashi n kumar user charges for port cost recovery the us harbor maintenance tax controversy international journal of maritime economics v 4 2 june 2002evaluating financing options the answer to each of these questions is inherently political choice as one study on dredging explains the conflict over funding is conflict of values and goals conflict about who pays and who benefits those conflicts can only be resolved in the political process with political compromises20 the status quo one option is to maintain the status quo that is to continue funding harbor dredging through cargovaluebased ta x some observers view the present system as at least one step more fficient than funding from general revenues if port users are required to pay at least part of the cost of dredging they argue it promotes more efficient use of resources because the users are not likely to pay more in fees than they hope to save in shipping costs also if port users are required to pay for dredging they are likely to require that th government spend their resources on the most worthwhile projects conversely t hey argue if general taxpayer revenue is used to pay the full cost of dredging funds will more likely be wasted on unjustified or marginally useful projects others contend that the present funding system is broken and must be overhauled because the original intent of congress was to have both exporters and importers paying the tax they argue that it is unfair that importers are essentially paying for the dredging needs of exporters some also contend that the legal and trade challenges to the hmt make it an unstable funding source some economists believe user fee system could be restructured in such way as to promote better use of the nations marin transportation system economic efficiency advocates of portspecific carrierbased fee argue that from an economic efficiency point of view the user fee m odel would be superior to other funding models21they argue that 1 the shipowners rather than the shippers should pay the fee and 2 the fee be portspecific rat her than nationally uniform this funding scheme would theyclaim optimize transpor tation efficiencybecause it would allow market forces to allocate cargo to the most efficient ports the rationale for their argument is as follows they argue that the present hmt funding scheme inflates the supply of larger ships although larger ships save money on the ocean leg they increase costs at port because among other things they require deeper channels and berths however shipowners do not fully calculate these costs in their decision to build larger ships because dredging costs are borne by others namely port authorities shippers andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31264crs9 22transportation

investment will be biased in favor of larger ships on the other hand if these costs were internalized by the shipowners through payment of dredging fee based on ship size ship investment decisions would more accurately reflect the true cos t of bigger ships supporters of carrier based fee ask why us taxpayers should finance deeper channels only to help mostly foreign container carriers realize marginal cost efficiencies on the ocean leg of their voyages they also argue that the present schem which creates national pool of funds for channel dredging results in naturally d eep harbors subsidizing shallower ports naturally deep harbors they argue should be allowed to reflect their lower dredging costs in the rate structure they offer ocean carriers carriers would be attracted to those ports that require the least amount of dredging b ecause the user fees at those ports would be less the present system t hey say levels the playing field among ports with different dredging requirements it draws traffi c away from more efficient ports to less efficient ports thereby raising the nation s overall cost of moving goods through the marine transportation system in general east coast and gulf coast ports are shallower and require more dredgi ng than west coast ports which tend to have naturally deeper channels in addition since exporters currently are not paying the hmt ports with traffic profiles heavily skewed toward imports contribute more to the fund than do ports that primarily rely on export cargo crosssubsidies among ports would be eliminated if funds generated t particular port were reserved solely for that ports local dredging needs rather than becoming part of systemwide fund some observers defend crosssubsidie s among ports asserting that the hmt facilitates the development of maritime network that is national in scope they note that the highway trust fund also re distributes gas tax monies from heavily populated states to sparsely popul ated states this redistribution is justified on the grounds that populated states share an inter est with rural states in developing and maintaining an interstate highway system that provides national interconnectivity other observers argue that while the trust fund mechanism may be suitable for developing national highway system it is not suitable for seaport development transportation research board re port presents the following view arguments for crosssubsidies based on scale economies whatever their validity for highways do not apply to ports us seaports do not constitute network that is analogous to the highway system since the value of port does not depend on the existence of other ports in the same way that the value of road increases if its connectivity to other roads increases therefore the highway program cannot be used as model for justifying the use of revenues generated at highvolume ports to subsidize maintenance and improvements at lowvolume ports22 supporters of carrierbased portspeci fic user fee believe there is sufficient competition among ports to allow for market solution to the problem since ports compete with one another on their popula tion base

much of the country has generated competition not only between nearby rival ports but even ports on opposite coasts24the term discretionary cargo refers to freight that can be routed economically through more than one port typically cargo originating or destined for the interior of the country or the far coast port rationalization by the liner carriers which consolidates cargo at fewer ports has also intensified competition between ports based on the competitive climate ports face today some believe the market provides enough incentive for ports to invest in dredging without federal involvement advocates of portspecifi c carrierbased fee argue that this replacement fee is the most appropriate sche for ensuring adequate harbor depths while at the same time preventing excess dredging economic development while the replacement fee described bove may be an economic prescription for financing port dredging it does raise distributional issues harbor communities generally view their ports as engines f economic development for the city and surrounding region25while containerization has reduced the number of jobs onsite ports still generate jobs offsite with the many businesses that serve the ports such as freight forwarders custom house brokers warehouses trucking firms etc in addition there are the importers and exporters that choose to locate near port to save on shipping costs however port specific funding system is likely to favor large ports over small ports with more ship traffic large ports would not have to charge as much per ship or shipment to rec over dredging costs as smaller ports some small ports might either have to close or service only small ships economic development is significan t public policy goal with respect to ports and in fact was rationale for the crea tion of port authorities in the late 1800s and early 1900s at that time marine terminal s were largely owned and controlled by private railroads as ra ilroads merged each railroa d acquired additional port terminals as nodes in their tr ack network rather than develop infrastructure at each port railroads found it advantageous to consolidate t heir investment at only selected ports not unexpectedly port communities with neglected harbor facilities were dissatisfied with railroad control over l ocal port development therefore they created central public authority to ensure that port development would be more in line with the public interest the railroads strategy of concentrating cargo flow through fewer ports is not unlike the strategy container carriers hav adopted today as carriers deploy larger ships to achieve economies of scale on the high seas these ships are calling fewerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31264crs11 26us dot maritime administration usexports

emergence f hub and spoke system consisting of load center ports where the largest ships call and system of feeder ports serviced either by smaller coastal ships or more likely in the united states by railroads if the maritime industry is moving towards mark etoriented selection process of large ports and feeder ports portspecific fundi ng scheme is likely to compliment or even accelerate this trend while system wide fee is likely to impede it to the extent that it levels the playing field among ports t he issue of harbor maintenance funding therefore appears to involve tradeoff between national interest in economic efficiency and the local interests of some harbor communities not to be relegated to feeder port status cargo diversion as can be gleaned from the above discussion much of the debate regarding harbor maintenance funding revolves around the issue of how it would affect the geography of us maritime commerce in addition to interport competition among us ports however there is also the issue of competition with ports in canada mexico or in the carribean with regard to the present funding mechanism the hmt us ports near the canadian and mexican borders claim that it diverts cargo to nearby ports across the border wrda 1986 which established the hmt required the dot to submit an annual repor t quantifying the amount of us cargo transhipped through canada26the report shows that since the late 1980s when the report was first published 4 to 6 of us liner trade has been transhipped through canadian ports on yearly basis the re port also notes that canadian cargo is transhipped through us ports however cargo diversion may be attributable to other factors that outweigh any influe nce of the hmt regions in northern new england may determine that routing cargo through montreal which is closer than new york or boston is the most economic choice carriers and exporters may prefer to route european bound cargo from par ticular us origins through halifax because it offers later sa iling date and cargo cut off time than new york or boston in addition to these considerations rail rates trucking costs or port throughput rates may be cheaper via canad for particular us cities or towns some observers argue that while diversion of cargo through ports of an adjacent country may be lost business for particul ar us port the nation as whole and us shippers in particular may bene fit from routing cargo in this manner if importers and exporters in the upper midwest for instance can move cargo more economically to and from europe through the ports of montreal or halifax one could argue that they have benefitted from importing the transportation services of canada as with cargovaluebased tax policymakers might consider what effect carrierbased fee

misunderstanding the harbor tax journal of commerce may 26 1999 p5acargo flow than tax based on cargo value27a fee that is based on vessel size might induce carriers to avoid the tax by divertin g their largest ships to nearby foreign port such as vancouver halifax or freepor t in the bahamas by transhipping us bound cargo from large ships to smaller feeder vessels at these foreign ports carriers could save substantial amount in harbor us er fees transhipment at these foreign ports would not necessarily mean less cargo for us ports the same amount of cargo might arrive but on smaller coastal f eeder ships paradoxically if the fee reduced the size of ships calling at us ports there would be less need for deeper channels carriers contend that carrierbased fee could be roughly equivalent to container ships daily operating cost and w ould thus significantly influence their port rotation decisions however there are additional cost considerations that may limit transshipments the cost of load and disc harge handling at an additional port is significant transhipment could also i ncrease transit time due to missed connections or increase the risk of cargo damage due to additional handling ports with large local population base such as new york w ould presumably still attract vessel calls with or without user fee stakeholder perspectives matter which party dredging fee is l evied upon carriers or shippers and regardless of how it is administered at the port level or federal level the ultimate payers of the fee or tax are import consum ers and export producers however how the tax is levied and administered does make difference politically with regard to shipper groups one can say that shippers of highvalue low volume commodities are likely to prefer tax based on cargo tonna ge rather than cargo value conversely highvolume lowvalue shippers are likel to prefer tax based on cargo value rather than cargo tonnage it is also worth noting t hat shifting the user fee from shippers to shipowners would concentrate the tax because there are many more shippers and shipments than there are shipowners and ve ssel port calls concentrating the tax may influence the decision making process because as some observers maintain small group that has more to lose may have more incentive to organize and make themselves felt politically than larger more diverse group that has less at stake individually according to some this political dynamic partly explains the failure of the hsuf proposed during the clinton ad ministration with regard to ports one

intermodal facilities an overview of key issues transportation quarterly v 54 4 fall 2000of commodities making imported inputs less expensive and making exports more price competitive the maritime industry als does not like the fact that the hmt is running surplus that more money is collected by the tax than is used to pay for dredging some economists argue that while federal aid may be justified in the early stage of an industrys development shipping is now mature industry and therefore should be selfsupporting they argue that returning financing of harbor dredging to general revenues amounts to corporate subsidy nd leads to overcapacity in port facilities28 the strong demand for channel deepening has been characterized by critics as race to the bottom they argue that ove rcapacity puts downward pressure on port revenues leading to unhealthy port facilitie s requiring more public assistance some analysts contend that not every port needs to become superport it is less likely that us taxpayers will squander money n unnecessary dredging they argue if greater market discipline is brought to the process of examining investment risk in port infrastructure29 some believe that the costshare re quirements of wrda 1986 are out of date due to the growing prevalence of larger c ontainerships they believe the federal government should increase its investme nt in harbor dredging by eliminating the 45 foot threshold essentially revising the threetier cost share formula to twotier formula in other words the nonfedera l costshare would decrease from 60 to 35 for deepening projects and from 50 to 0 for maintenance projects with harbor depths between 45 feet and 53 feet the water resources development act of 2003 hr 2557 sec 2003 which passed the house would authorize this change in cost share arrangements in 1986 when the cost sharing formula was established vessels requiring more than 45foot draft were considered highly specialized ships while container ships were increasing in size during the 1980s as we ll it was believed t hat the dimensions of the panama canal would limit the draft requirements of most of the container fleet to under 40 feet the emergence of double stack container trains in the mid1980s made transcontinental transport by rail more competitive as compared with the all water route through the pana ma canal the size restrictions of the panama canal therefore became less f limiting factor and carriers began deploying post panamax ships ships too big t fit through the panama canal opponents of reducing the local cost share argue that it is only at the first in or last out port of call that container s hips are likely to be fully loaded when container ships call at ports in between the first and last ports of call they are usually not fully loaded and therefore do not require their full draft they caution thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31264crs14 lowering the local cost share requirement will level the competitive field between ports impeding the markets natural selection process of allocating cargo to the most efficient ports dredging fees and shortsea shipping coastal shipping interests also seek to return financing of harbor dredging to general funds they believe more containe rized cargo could be taken off congested highways such as i95 along the eastern s eaboard and moved by barges or fastspeed ferries along the coast they believe fee system whether paid by carriers or shippers is an impediment to coastal shipping because it raises the price of coastal shipping relative to truck and rail alternatives others disagree noting that trucks contribute to the cost of their infrastruct ure by paying fuel and other taxes into the highway trust fund and railroads pay f or their infrastructure primarily by themselves some believe charging port users for harbor infrastructure promotes equity among competing modes and redu ces price distortions in modal choice
