divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755federal income tax treatment of the family summary individual income tax provisions have shifted over time first in increasing the burden on larger families and then in decreasing it these shifts were caused by changing tax code features personal exem ptions standard nd itemized deductions rates the earned income credit the child credit and other standard structural aspects of the tax the distribution of tax bur den across income cl asses has however changed relatively little although burdens at the top and bottom have decreased in recent years recent proposal by chai rman rangel of the ways and means committee hr 3780 proposes some importa nt changes in family tax treatment including an expansion in the earned in come credit for families without children while several standards may be considered in determining equitable treatment of families over family type and size standard approach is based on ability to pay so that large families with the same income as small ones pay less tax based on this standard the analysis of equity across families suggests that families with children are paying lower rates of tax or receiving larger negative tax rates than single individuals and married couples at lowe r and middle incomes however families with children are being taxed more heavily at higher income levels at the lowest income levels the eic provides the largest tax subsidies to families with two or three children the smallest subsidies go to ch ildless couples at middle income levels families with many children will have the most favorable treatment due to the effect of the child credit which has very large effect relative to tax liability at higher income levels large families are penalized because the adjustments for children such as personal exemptions and child credits are too small or are phased out while graduated rates cause larger families that need more income to maintain given living standard to pay higher taxes tax rates are more variable at lower income levels at all but the lowest and very highest income levels singles pay higher taxes than married couples the analysis of the marriage penalty indicates that marriage penalties have largely been eliminated for those with out children throughout the middle income range but this change has inevitably expanded marriage bonuses marriage penalties remain at the high and low income levels and could also apply to those with children where the penalty or bonus is not very well defined but by and large the current system is likely to encourage rather than discourage marriage and favors married couples over singles the analysis of equity across families suggests that increases in earned income tax credits for those without children woul d lead to more equa l treatment based on the ability to pay approach while full refundability of the child credit would exacerbate inequalities at the higher end of the scale eliminating phaseouts of provisions that differentiate across families would probably lead to more equitable treatment and containing the effect of the alternative minimum tax is important to both reducing the high burden of taxes on families with children at upper middle income levels as well as preventing an increasing level of marriage penalties this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755contents development of current tax treatment of the family 1 p r s n l x m p t i n s c h i l d c r d i t s 2 s t n d r d d d u c t i n r f l t x c l u s i n i t m

by jane g gravelle for an overview of the provisions of hr 3970federal income tax treatment of the family recent years have been times of signifi cant changes in the income tax treatment of the family for lower income families the most important of these have been the expansion of the earned income credit eic in 1990 and 1993 for middle income families the introduction of the child cr edit in 1997 and its expansion in 20012003 along with the expansion of rate bracket s and standard deductions to address the marriage penalty have been important features for higher income families the lowering of tax rates in general and the increasing scope of the alternative minimum tax amt are important changes chairman rangel of the ways and means committee has proposed reform proposal hr 3970 that would make number of changes affecting families differently including repeal of the alternative minimum tax surcharge on high income families and expansion of the earned income credit for families without children1 while an array of issues might be considered in discussing tax rules and their effects this paper considers two questions what is an equitable treatment of families of different sizes and what are the effects of marriage penalties and bonuses the first section summarizes the major features of the tax law affecting families and family choices and how th ey developed over time incl uding the relatively recent introduction of large benefits for children at low and m oderate income levels reversal of trend in the pa st that tended to reduce these benefits through the erosion of the real value of the personal exemptions it also summarizes the origin of the marriage penalty and marriage bonus the following two sections first discuss general equity issues and then apply the abilitytopay standard to examine how tax burdens vary by family size across the income spectrum the final section examines the marriage penalties and bonuses development of current tax treatment of the family current federal income tax law differentiates among families by type and structure in several ways this differe ntiation has changed considerably over the years and includes personal exemptions st andard deductions ra schedules and various other features such as child car credits age exemptions and earnedincome creditshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs2 2 the ratio of prices in 2005 to those in 1948 using the gdp deflator is 703 while personal exemptions have increased from 600 to 3200 ratio of 533 personal exemptions child credits personal exemptions allow certain am ount per person to be exempt from tax combined with standard deductions which vary by family type they exclude minimum level of income from tax in 1986 these combined amounts were roughly set at the poverty level pe rsonal exemptions can also pl ay part in marriage bonuses when only one spouse works single individual cannot claim an unmarried companion as dependent while husba nd can claim wife and vice versa the tax laws have always allowed some relief for family size through exemptions although the orig inal 1913 act allowe d deductions only for the individual taxpayer 3000 and spouse 1000 these amounts were very large relative to incomes but the initial income tax was not intended to reach broad group of individuals even when dependent exemp tions were allowed in 1917 they were only 200 small relative to the basic exemptions the practice of allowing an equal exemption for each family member began in the early 1940s personal exemptions were reduced in the initial years of the tax then increased then reduced again they were last reduced in the early 1940s the real value of the exemptions was also affected by infla tion for example the personal exemption remained constant at 600 from 1948 throug h 1969 while its real value was heavily eroded through inflation it was gradua lly increased over the next ten years to 1000 where it again remained constant until 1985 from 1948 through 1984 the personal exemption lost 63 of its purchasing power in large part due to diminution of the real value of personal exemptions the tax burden had shifted over time to fall more heavily on larger families in 1986 personal exemptions were increas ed and indexed so that today the personal exemption has lost only bout 24 of its purchasing power2 this shift of burden to families with childre n was changed dramatically by the adoption of the 500 child credits in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 and by the increase in that credit to 1000 in the economic growth an d recovery act of 2001 in the cases where these credits apply for children unde r 17 they caused the personal exemption plus the deduction equivalent of the credit to be 55 larger than its 1948 value with the 500 credit and 133 larger with th 1000 credit for families in the 15 rate bracket they are 23 and 70 larger respectively for families in the 25 bracket the credit is not however indexed for infl ation and absent inde xation its value will diminish the 500 increase in the credit is to sunset in 2010 as well although it may be extended or made permanent not all taxpayers received the credit it was phased out for higher incomes the credit was not generally re fundable and therefore familie s with tax liability or insufficient liability to use the full credit would not receive the full benefit an exception was made for families with three or more children where the credit could offset payroll tax in excess of the earned income tax credithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs3 3 in general floors and ceilings for standard deductions for joint returns were halved for married couples filing separate returnswhen the child credit was doubled under the temporary provisions of the 2001 tax an additional refundab ility provision was allowed fo r all families for income in excess of 10000 beginning at 10 and rising to 15 indexed for inflation the additional child credit was pha sed in initially but accelerated in legislation adopted in 2003 and 2004 the personal exemption is also phased out for higher incomes although that phaseout is scheduled to expire standard deduction or flat xclusion itemized deductions standard deductions which va ry across the types of returns single joint and head of household also affect tax burde ns across families prior to the 2001 tax revision the standard deductions for sing and heads of household were 60 and 80 respectively of the size of the deduction for joint returns the standard deduction can contribute to marriage penalty if it is larger than half the deduction for married couples two singles who bot h work and marry will have smaller combined deduction it can also contribut to marriage bonus if there is only one earner in the couple since the joint deducti on is larger than the single deduction in 2001 joint standard deductions were increased so as to eliminate the marriage penalty relative to singles without ch ildren and reduce it relative to heads of household where the deduction is 73 as large these changes increased the marriage bonus virtually from its inception the tax law llowed deductions for taxes interest charitable contributions and certain other personal expenses in 1944 standard deduction of 10 of adjusted gross income with ceiling of 500 was allowed as substitute for these itemized deductions3 major reason for this exemption was to reduce the number of itemizer s and make tax filing less complex in 1964 minimum standard deduction of 200 plus 100 for each exemption with 1000 ceiling was added beginning in 1969 th standard deductions were increased substantially the percenta ge standard deduction was gradually increased to 16 and the ceiling increased to 2000 lowincome allowance of 1100 to be reduced by 50 in each of the next tw years was substituted for the minimum standard deduction these reductions were included because of the rise in the personal exemption that was increasing total exempt amounts the lowincome allowance was increased to 1300 in 1972 in 1975 the lowincome allowance was once again differentiated but based on family type joint head of household single rather than size joint returns received 2100 allowance by 1976 the ceiling on th percentage standard deduction was also differentiated by family type and was raised to 2800 for joint returns by 1976 in 1977 the lowincome allowance and th percentage standard deduction were consolidated into single flat allowan ce called the zerobracket amount which was set at 3200 in 1977 and at 3400 in 1978 this zerobracket amount was indexed in 1981 so that it would rise with inflati on the tax reform act of 1986 raised thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs4 4 in 2005 the personal exemption was 3200 and the standard deduction 10000 for total of 22800 the exempt allowance in 1948 was 2667 600 times 4 divided by 09 if the 1948 levels had kept pace with the gdp deflator the total amount would be 20177 flat deduction amount but continued to diffe rentiate it with resp ect to family status but not family size the 2001 act increased the standard deduction for joint returns to twice that of single returns in comparing the relative benefits over time it is important to consider the changes in all flat allowances as well not just the personal exemption for example while the real value of the personal ex emption has declined about 24 since 1948 the exempt amount for family of four joi nt return was very close to the exempt amount had 1948 values been indexed for infl ation using the gdp deflator prior to the 2001 tax changes current levels are about 21 larger than those which would have occurred had the exempt level in 1948 been indexed4 ignoring the child credit smaller families have more generous exempt levels today while larger ones have less generous levels for example again ig noring the child credit exempt allowances are larger in real terms today for singles 75 larger for heads of households with one child or two children 46 and 20 rger respectively and for joint returns with one to four children 39 31 11 and 4 larger respectively real levels are about the same as 1948 for heads of household with four family members and smaller for those with more family members 1 for fiveperson family 6 for sixperson family they are also smaller for jointreturn families with five and six family members 2 and 5 respectively heads of household and joint returns with children eligible for the child credit however have greater exempt levels fo r joint returns assuming that additional members are eligible children the credit causes all of them to have increased exempt amount equivalents between 87 and 117 higher than in 1948 with the larger increases for heads of households and larg families with joint returns whose values have tended to more than double note however that changes in benef its compared to past levels do not necessarily have implications for the appropriate treatment of different families if past family differentiation was not due to theory bout equitable treatment of differing families there is economic r eason that current tax treatment should conform to any past standards most taxpayers take the standard deduc tion but about third itemize largely at the higher income levels itemized deductions tend to keep pace with income levels they are technically subject to phaseout but the effect of the phaseout is to increase marginal tax rates since it is triggered by income and not deductions rate structure two important aspects of the rate structure are the unit of taxation and the progressivity of the rate structure that is how tax rates rise as increments of income increase current tax rates are impos ed at 10 15 25 28 33 and 35 under the provisions of the 2001 tax change if those provisions expire the 10 rate will returnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs5 5 kyle mudry and michael parisi individua l income tax rates and shares internal revenue service

varies by type of return but begins at about 145950 for sing the top rate of 35 begins at 326450 of taxable income child credits begin to phase out at about 75000 for head of household returns and 110000 for joint returns 8 internal revenue service statistics of income posted at httpwwwirsustreasgov taxstatsindtaxstatsar ticle0id9698100html_grp1to 15 and the top four rates will increase to 28 31 36 and 396 taxes are imposed on family units married c ouples cannot use the single rate schedules although they can file separa tely with rate structure that offers advantage over joint filing most taxpayers have income that taxes them at more than 10 23 of returns more than 15 41 of returns and more than 25 15 of returns5 the width of the brackets is greatest for joint returns and smallest for singles although all types of returns reach the top 35 rate at the same point for single returns the 10 and 15 brackets are half th width of joint returns the 25 bracket is 70 as large and the next two bracket s are about 124 as large longer brackets at the top being necessary to get to the same income for the top bracket for heads of household the 10 and 15 brackets ar 72 and 66 as wide the next two about the same length and th final bracket 111 as wide6 there are also phaseouts of itemized deductions persona l exemptions and child credits at very high income levels7 however the higher rates and the phaseouts apply to only small fraction of taxpayers less than 10 of taxp ayers had adjusted gross income over 100000 in 2003 and less than 2 had incomes over 2000008 in the original 1913 tax law single rate structure was applied to all taxpayers as individuals in 1948 joint returns were allowed that effec tively permitted income splitting this change had little to do with any theory regarding the tax treatment of the family rather it occurred because marri ed couples in community property states were successfully claiming the right to divide their income evenly for tax purposes under graduated rate structure this incomesplitting reduces the total tax burden by reducing the amount of income subject to higher rates incomesplitting was adopted to equalize treatment across the states and to forestall major taxinduced disruption in state property laws this move created the familiar joint and single returns both the community property treatment and the legislated incomesplitting resulted in tax subsidy for marriage individuals who married would experience lower tax liabilities due to the rate structure as long as their incomes were unequal shortly after in 1951 headofhousehol d schedule for unmarried taxpayers with dependents was introduced which allowed half the benefits from income splitting ie wider tax brackets this treatment could in theory create marriage penalty for families with children although this point received virtually attention httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs6 9 although there were two statutory rate br ackets after 1986 15 and 28 there was also surcharge that was designed to phase out the benefits of the 15 rate and the personal exemptions for high income taxpayers this surcharge effectively increased the tax rate by 5 percentage points to 33 and created bubble rates were 15 then 28 then 33 and then fell back to 28 criticism from singles arguing that thei r taxes were too high led in 1969 to singles rate schedule with wi der brackets this differenc in rate schedules however also created marriage penalty for certain types of families including those without children if both spouses worked tax bills could increase with marriage many people were uncomfortable with tax pr ovision which encouraged couples to live together without benefit of matrimony coupled with in creasing female labor force participation and changing social structure the marriage penalty created considerable concern for this reason capped deduction for the secondary earner in family was adopt ed in 1981 the provision allowed 10 of income to be deducted subject to cap of 3000 this deduction was an imperfect device which partly alleviated the problem of the marri age penalty and for individuals below the cap reduced the marginal tax rate on the s econdary worker it was repealed in 1986 when the flatter rate structure caused the marriage penalty to be less severe the marriage penalty was increased for very hi gh income individuals in 1993 with the addition of higher tax rates these changes affected however only very small fraction of the population the degree of progression in the rate structure interacts to affect the tax burden that applies to taxpayers in different circumstances the rate structure has varied significantly over time but major revisi on in the 1986 act reduced the brackets to two 15 and 28 as well as lowering the t op bracket certain be nefits were phased out in 1990 the bubble due to these phase outs was eliminated in exchange for adding new tax rate of 31 9 capital gains were held to 28 rate however personal exemptions were still phased out itemized deductions were also phased out on temporary basis reduced by 3 of adjusted gross income agi above limit since itemized deductions tend to rise with income faster than the reductions due to the phaseout this pha seout is the equivalent of increasing taxable income by 3 and an additional percentage point or so in tax each dollar of adjusted gross income taxed leads to reduc tion in deductions of 003 nd if the marginal tax rate is around third then the additional tax per dollar of income is around 001 in 1993 two marginal tax rates were added at the upper in come levels 36 and 396 this legislation made the itemized duction and personal ex emption phaseouts permanent the 2001 tax cut in addition to lowering the top tax rates and introducing new 10 rate eliminated the marriage penalty for most taxpayers by increasing the standard deduction new 10 ra bracket and the 15 rate bracket to make these values twice as large as for singles returning to the pre1969 treatment for most taxpayers that tax cut also prospectively eliminated the personal exemption phase out to begin in 2006 and be complete in 2010 and the itemized deduction phaseout in 2010 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs7 earned income t ax credit eic the earned income tax credit eic is refundable credit or negative tax that provides wage subsidy for lowincome working individuals the credit is percentage of earned income which reach maximum fixed amount and then is eventually phased out the credit rate s are currently 765 for families without children 34 for families with one child and 40 for families with two children the phaseout levels are higher for fa milies with children than for those without children in 2005 the credit reached its maximum value of 399 for families with children at an income of 5220 the credit is phased out at incomes between 6530 and 11750 for singles and betw een 8530 and 13750 for joint returns for families with one child the maximum credit of 2662 is reached at 7830 the credit is phased out betw een 14370 and 3 1030 for single heads and between 16370 and 33030 for married couples for families with two or more children the maximum credit of 4400 is reached at 11000 and is phased out between 14370 and 35363 for single heads and between 163790 and 37263 for married couples these values are indexed for inflation unlike some other provisions there is differentiation by family type rather the differences depend on the presence of one two or children the eic plays role in creating marriage penalty for lower income families if individuals with low earnings marry the couples higher combin ed income may phase out more of the earned income tax credit at the same time marriage can reduce taxes if single individual marries someone w ith children but with little or income because he or she becomes eligible for the larger credit for families with children the earned income tax credit eic was first enacted in 1975 this provision provided refundable tax credit for 10 of earned income phased out at rate of 10 of income over 4000 because the cr edit was refundable individuals who paid income tax were nevertheless eligible for benefit there were variety of rationales for the eic to provide work incentive to offset the social security tax burden and to provide relief for recent price increases in food and fuel the credit was however only allowed to indivi duals who maintained household for dependent children thus like the major welfare program of the time afdc aid to families with dependent children the eic as originally enacted was not extended to singles nd childless couples the eic has been revised in various ways and in 1990 was differentiated with respect to number of children in 1993 the credits were increased substantially and small credit was added fo r families without children the 2001 tax cut expanded the phaseout range for married couples wh ich slightly reduced the marriage penalty in the eic child or dependent care credit another provision allows for credits for paid child care expenses for children under 13 and disabled dependent s deduction for these costs was first allowed in 1954 and converted to credit in 1976 the credit is 30 of eligible expenses but is phased down to 20 as income ri ses from 15000 to 43000 eligible expenseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs8 10 for more detailed discussion and history see crs report rl30149 the alternative minimum tax fo r individuals by gregg esenweinare limited to 3000 for one child and 6000 fo r two or more children the credit is available only to single parents or married couples where both parents work and is limited to the smaller earned income it is not indexed alternative minimum tax the alternative minimum tax calculates tax on broader income base with large flat exemption in 2005 58000 for married couples and 40250 for singles and at rates of 26 and 28 if this tax is higher than the regular tax the difference in tax is added to the taxpayers liability currently the amt does not affect very many taxpayers but its effects will grow over time unless legislative changes are made including an increase in the exemption and indexing of the exemptions thus far temporary revisions to limit the scope of the amt have been enacted the alternative minimum tax originated in 1969 as an addon tax on tax preferences and the most important preference was capital gains at that time there was an exclusion for share of capital ga ins and the excluded share was taxed under the addon tax the addon tax was eventually paired with and then displaced by the alternative minimum tax in 1986 the cap ital gains preference was ended and the number of individuals affected by the tax already small fell further over time however the coverage of the amt began to grow as rates increased and because the exemption was not indexed while exemptions in the regular tax were the potential coverage was also increased with the 2001 tax cut which cut regular rates but not amt rates the focus of preferences has also changed the preference for capital gains enacted in 1997 and extended in 2003 and for dividends enacted in 2003 was not included in the amt increasingly the major preference items are personal exemptions and certain itemized deductions the child credit was allowed against the amt after it became clear that failure to do so would push many families onto the tax in the middle income classes large families will increasingly be affected by the amt absent change10 other provisions in addition to these basic provisions rate structures personal exemptions standard allowances and credits several other provisions related to family structure are summarized here first there are specific provisions that relate to family structure or characteristics there are additional standard deductions for elderly and blind taxpayers provisions that give little benefit to high income individuals who tend to itemize deductions in addition there is 15 tax credit for the elderly and disabled that is phased out since the base for the credit is offset by social security it tends to benefit elderly and disabled individuals who do not receive social security another explic it family tax provision adopted in 1986 is the kiddie tax which taxes unearned income of children under 14 now 19 at the parents tax rate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs9 11 this concept be may unfamiliar particularly to readers who think of spouses working at home as making monetary sacrifice perhaps to stay with their children while their income is smaller they save the taxes th at would have been pa id on outside earnings however these spouses do not give up all of th eir income since there are cost savings as in lower child care payments or not having to pay for other services eg dry cleaning household help it is this value that provides benefit to oneearner families and is the imputed income not subject to tax one might add variety of exclusions s ome social security benefits welfare payments inkind benefits employer provi ded child care and deductions or credits medical expenses educational expenses which benefit families of certain income levels and characteristics moreover si nce the tax law does not apply to certain imputed income families who prefer owneroccupied homes or inhome provision of goods and services or the consumpti on of leisure over other goods have greater tax benefits these benefits are in some cases associated with family characteristics for example families with higher incomes and at certain ages are more likely to live in owneroccupied homes oneearner marri ed couples benefit from the services provided in the home by the nonworking spouse which are not subject to tax11 finally the payroll tax can alter the relative net tax burden between different types of families with consequences that could matter for concerns of equity and efficiency such as work choice the soci security system may confer marriage bonus that can increase the implicit tax on wo rk effort for sec ond earners spouses receive benefit without n ecessarily paying any payroll taxes of their own second earner spouse pays additional social security taxes but his or he r benefit is only the net of benefit base d on the individual earnings record and the benefit for spouses and this amount may not be positive that is the spouses benefit based on the partners earning record may be better than the benefit spouse receives on his or her own earnings record and there is therefore return to payroll taxes paid thus the net tax on second earner spouse is eff ectively larger than it would be in the absence of benefit for spouses since little or additional benefits occur as result of those payments there are also implicit taxes that affect behavior in the transfer system where increases in income through work or marriage may cause reduction in benefits thereby disc ouraging these behaviors equity and distributional issues tax proposals can be evaluated on many grounds but one issue is that of fairness this issue of fairness can involve two elements vertical equity or the equity of changes in tax burdens as income rises for an otherwise identical family and horizontal equity or how taxes should be fairly differen tiated between families of different sizes and structures this analysis focuses primarily on the issue of horizontal equity since this is an issue which can be addressed in more analytical framework we first however briefly discuss the issue of vertical equityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs10 12 progressivity in the tax system is typically based on an equal sacrifice notion and the notion that dollar to poor person is much more valuable than dollar to the wealthy person these theories do not easily pin down the desired degree of progressivity however for more extensive discussion of distributiona l issues and of the distribution of the income tax see crs report rl32693 distribution of the tax burd across individuals an overview by jane g gravelle and maxim shvedov 13 see congressional budget office historical effective federal tax rates 1979 to 200 3 december 2005 http wwwcbogovft pdoccfmindex7000type1 vertical equity the individual income tax is progressive in rate structure and in actual outcomes higher income taxpayers pay larger shares of their income than do lower income taxpayers and at the lowest income levels taxpayers received overall subsidies through the eic because the desired degree of redistribution cannot be easily established issues of vertical equity involve valu judgments to considerable degree12 by and large the overall distributi on of the tax system has not changed great deal in the last twentythree years all tax rates have fallen and the largest reduction is for the very highest 1 of taxpayers followed by the middle quintile at the lower end the earned income tax cr edits have more than offset growth in payroll taxes13 how different tax revisions affect the progressivity of the income tax depends on several factors first significant fraction of taxpayers do not have income tax liability positive income taxes do not apply in mo st cases until individuals are above the poverty line in the tax reform act of 1986 the combination of standard deductions and personal exemptions were set to r oughly approximate the poverty line the income levels above which families of different sizes ar not considered poor the allowances for single individuals are below the poverty line and cause some poor single individuals to be taxed the addition of the child credit means that taxpayers with qualifying children we ll above the poverty line would not be subject to tax these taxpayers would not be affected by tax cut an exception is when tax cuts are refunda ble an expansion of the eic which is refundable credit or negative tax w ould affect lowincome individuals the child credit is also refundabl in some circumstances certain types of revisions tend to be nefit higher income individuals while others tend to provide little be nefit to that group for example while lowering the top rates clearly bene fitted higher income individuals in 2001 it is also clear that widening the 15 rate bracket for joint returns also benefitted higher income individuals in 2000 prior to the tax cut according to the internal revenue services statistical data of 129 million returns appr oximately 69 million returns paid tax at the 15 rate and anothe r 25 million had tax liability thus the widening of the 15 bracket which helped only those paying tax above that rate benefitted approximately the top 25 of taxpayers higher income individuals are also more likely to itemize deductions and changes which increase the standardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs11 deduction will tend to focus more benefits to moderate income taxpayers than high income ones similarly expansions of benefits that are phased out such as the child credits would not benefit high income in dividuals the 10 bracket also favored lower income families horizontal equity horizontal equity has to do with equal treatment of equals and is an important focus of this analysis for the income tax this standard might mean that families of the same size with the same income should pay the same tax but it could also be taken to mean that two individuals with the same income shoul d pay the same tax in progressive tax system these two sta ndards can be incompatible and indeed this incompatibility causes marriage penalties nd bonuses in system where the family is the tax unit thus the basic challenge of assessing standard s of horizontal equity is to determine how to treat different taxpayers equitably first we review the economic principles which could be used in that assessment second we consider in further detail the abilitytopay concept which seems most consistent with the equalsacrifice principles of horizontal equity as the recent history of the tax law suggests and the following discussion reveals tax policy has not generally been gu ided by consistent theory of fairness or equity across different types of families indeed it is clear that many of the structural changes in the treatment of the family were haphazard income splitting perhaps one of the most important aspects of family ta x differentials was dopted in reaction to legal situation other changes were cont emporary reactions to set of complaints or concerns about behavioral response suc h as the singles rate schedule or attempts to fix the marriage penalty theories of equitable taxation for taxation purposes there are two fundamental attributes of fa milies the type of head married couple or single individual and the size families can be composed of single persons single parents with children childless couples and married couples with children and in turn there are two important features of the tax system that relate to these differences first should the unit of taxation be the individual or the family the us tax system imposes taxes on families and differentiates in its rate structure between singles head of households single pare nts with children and married couples however an alternative would be to appl single rate schedule to each individual on his or her own earnings while some preference for this view of individual taxation may have to do with philosophical matters one argument for treating the individual rather than the family as taxpaying unit has to do with marriage neutrality and efficiency discussed subsequently that is if individuals could be taxed solely on their own earnings there would be tax consequences of being married and the married state would not affect incentives to work via tax differentials the second issue is how one should adju st for family size or in the case of individual taxation for the number of depe ndents despite the thrust of recent legislation that added substantial tax credits for children some of the debate over differentiating by taxpayer characteristics has been over whether personal exemptions for dependents should be allowed at all under some theories of how the familyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs12 14 see harvey brazer income tax treatment of the family and alicia munnell the couple vs the individual under the federal personal income tax both in the economics of taxation ed henry j aaron and michael j boskin washington dc brookings institution 1980 15 the notion of children as consumpti on can be traced to henry simons personal income taxation chicago university of chicago press 1938 should be taxed differentiation should be allowed for dependents indeed arguments are made that individuals shoul d be taxed on their income without regard to their family arrangements for that matter individual taxation does not preclude allowances for number of depe ndents rather its focus is on treating working adults even though married as separate entities14 in practice such tax system must always deal with the possibility of income splitting of capital income by transfers of assets within the family as well as the allocation of deductions clearly the family involves social and economic unit which differs from unrelated groupings although taxation of the family has recei ved limited attention in the economics literature vari ous principles have been advanced about how to treat family characteris tics three such approaches are outlined here treating living arrangements and children as personal choi ces that should not be addressed by the tax law equating posttax standards of living for families with the same pretax standard of living and family assistance this analysis does not consider anothe r alternative principle of taxation the benefit principle which woul d set taxes to reflect the am ount of government services received one could argue that large familie s particularly familie s with children are greater beneficiaries of public spending such as educa tion while some taxes are explicitly formulated as benefit taxes eg the gasoline tax which is used to build roads the individual income tax has gene rally been based on other principles such as the ones described here family arrangements as personal choices people are relatively free to choose whether to marry and have child ren and an argument can be made that such choices should not lead to tax relief from this perspective if they choose to have children they are not worse off since the enjoyment they receive from their children outweighs any cost thus one c ould think of children as part of the consumption of the parents15 at minimum this approach suggests that allowance be made for the additional cost of supporting children treating the choice to have children as consumption item different from the decision to consume food or clothing similarly the choice of spouse could be seen as consumption or investment choice which should not alte r the tax paid by the individual or the combined tax of the two spouses in this case the individual should be the tax unit while the argument that children constitute consumption to their parents may be defensible one using this view as guide to making tax policy is problematic even if the adults have made choice troublesome aspect of this treatment of children as consumption is that it considers only the wellbeing of the parent orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs13 parents parents tastes for children asid the material level of consumption for children as well as for adults is affected by the number of others in the family some theories have suggested that child ren could be seen as an investment perhaps for support in old age there is some justification for this theory of parental motivation although it must rely be less than universal since many parents leave bequests to their children rather than be ing supported by them in old age if investment were the objective of havi ng children then there would be some justification for tax relief since the cost of such an investment should in theory be recovered at the same time re turns such as help in old age should be taxed to the parents our tax system is not design ed along these lines and in any case the childrenasinvestment theory also suffers from lack of focus on the wellbeing of the children ability to pay approaches another approach is simply that of ability to pay which is the cornerstone of progre ssive taxation applying this abilitytopay standard of taxation is stra ightforward in theory if one begins with the proposition that families with equal sta ndards of living before tax should have equal standards of living after tax if all family members were more or less identical in their needs and if all goods consumed we re purely private in nature this standard would suggest full income splitting of total family income among all members of the family one could merely divide all fa mily income evenly and then subject each share to an identical rate structure in progressive tax system larger families would pay smaller taxes than smaller families with the same total income one difficulty with this straightforward prescription is the existence of club goods within the family some goods are more or less purely private goods such as food if one person consumes food it is not available to anyone else other goods have elements of club nature one pe rson can consume the good without interfering with anothers consumption such club goods include housing and some furnishings reading materials and the family car none of these goods are pure shared goods since tastes may not be iden tical and congestion may occur but they do provide scale advantages in consumption within family these scale advantages in family consumption are recognized in construction of the poverty line which varies with family size yet does not increase in full proportion to it another problem is that adults and child ren may differ in the amount of private goods they need or desire if we knew how to scale ability to pay by family size and characteristics design of the income tax would be theoretically straightforw ard the method would be as follows choose representative family eg family of two devise the tax rate schedule to achieve the desired degree of progression setting the exempt level at the poverty level or whatever othe r level is desired the solu tion to horizontal equity is then simply an averaging approach for example consider larger family which needs 50 more income than the basic reference family this means that larger family that has 75000 of income should have the same aver age tax rate as smaller reference family with 50000 of income we simply apply the basic tax rate schedule to two thirds of the larger familys income and multiply the resulting tax liability by 15 this approach will produce th same effective tax rate for the largerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs14 family as for the reference family the larger family which has more income will still pay more taxes but the fraction paid will be the same as the smaller family the two families will have the same although smaller sta ndard of living after tax just as they had the same sta ndard of living before tax when exempt levels of tax are set roug hly at the poverty rate as was the intent of the 1986 tax reform act families whose income falls w ithin the first rate bracket the 15 tax bracket at that point tend to have equal effective tax rates if the relative poverty measures across families are correct ignoring the earned income tax credit these effects will not hold however when higher income families are considered or when other provisions such as the child credit and the earned income credit are considered or with new small bracket such as the 10 bracket introduced in 2001 moreover families with one earner are better off than families with two earners at the same income because of the expenses of working including child care and the benefits of home pr oduction of the nonworking spouse thus credits for child care expenses or allowa nces for working spouses can move the system towards more equita ble treatment at least vi savis oneearner couples targeted family assistance at the opposite end of the spectrum is the notion of targeted family assistance especially for lower income families and often targeted towards children to accomplish th is targeting allowances for family size differentials eg personal llowances are often made refundable they take the form of credit rather than an exemption and benefits are often pha sed out as incomes rise several of these features including the eic and the child credit have made their way into current law this view of family allowances differs from the philosophy that personal exemptions along with other exclusions should be used to exempt minimum subsistence am ount from the income base the philosophy underlying the 1986 revisions and one which is more in line with the ability to pay standard similarly benefit for child care would be more appropriately made through deduction if child care was viewed as one of the costs of working under an abilitytopay approach proposals that are driven by this philo sophy are often simultaneously addressing differentiation across family types and vertical distribution objective this objective is not necessarily inconsistent with the abilitytopay objective addressed previously even though it often appears to be because of the mechanisms chosen such as credits that are phased out for given family size any degree of vertical equity can be obtained through either exemp tions or credits or by arranging the tax rate schedule appropriately but the differentiation across families at the same income level or abilitytopay can be achieved only by selecting the sizes of personal exemptions for different family members an abilitytopay approach would include differentiation of families of different sizes at either high or low income levels when vanishing exemption or credit is chosen in the interest ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs15 16 one argument along these lines is that prog ressive taxation could be justified by the need to maintain human resources at the bottom of the scale which justifies some minimum exclusion and curb the accumulation of power at the top since the accumulation of power is undiminished by family size there should be little differentiation at the top of the scale see harold m groves federal tax treatment of the family washington dc the brookings institution 1963 17 jane gravelle and jennifer gravelle horizontal equity and family tax treatment the orphan child of tax policy national tax journal vol 59 september 2006 pp 631649 this study calculated stylized effective tax rates reflecting personal exemptions itemized or standard deductions the child credit and the earned income credit the equivalency formula used was a07k07 based on constance f citro and robert t michael measuring poverty new approach washington dc national academy press 1995 using this formula single person would n eed 62 of the income of married couple without children to achieve the same standard of income married couple with one child would need 23 more and married couple w ith two children would need 45 more vertical equity the actual result is to allow differentiation for family size at higher income levels16 finally it is important to recognize that the income tax system exists side by side with welfare system and many conclude that targeted family assistance might better be addressed thr ough the welfare system applying the abilitytopay horizontal equity standard to current law the ability to pay approach seems the mo st consistent and to many appealing of the three approaches to dealing with tax differentiation based on family size this method considers the welfare of all in society rather than focusing exclusively on adults or children recent study used this approach to estimate effective tax rates in 2005 and how various provisions of the tax law affected these rates using an equivalency scale similar to the va riations in poverty lines across fa mily types17 because the tax system has been indexed the findings of this study remain applicable in 2008 although income leve ls refer to 2005 values the remainder of this section reports th results of that study in defining families that have the same ability to pay an adjustment based on research study similar to that adjusting for official povert levels for different family sizes was used which has smaller adjustment for children than for adults under this standard single person requires about 62 of the income of married couple couple with four kids requires about th ree times the income thus for married couple with children with 20000 of income an equivale nt single person would need slightly over 12000 and married couple with four children would need 60000 table 1 reports the 2005 effective tax ra tes for low and middleincome

the earned income tax credit the child credit and graduated rate s including phaseout effects moreover the variation across families which have the same ability to pay is substantial at low incomes families with children whether headed by married couple or single parent are favored because of the earned income tax credit the largest negative tax rates tend to accrue to returns with two children

amounts refer to the income for married couple with children larger families in each column would have more income and singles and heads of household with 2 family members one child would have less income as incomes rise fa milies with children are still favored but it is the largest families that have the largest subsidies or the smallest tax rates because of the combination of the personal exemptions and the child credit lower taxes so much for these families eventually large families be gan to be penalized because the value of the child credit and personal exemptions relative to income declines and larger families that require more income are pushed up through the rate brackets that effect is increased because more families with children are subjected to the amt at higher income levels credits and exemp tions begin to be phased out as incomes reach very high levels however the rate s converge as the tax becomes large flathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs18 tax note that itemized deductions assumed to be constant fraction of income and so is proportional exclusion overall these calculations suggest 1 that singles are taxed more heavily than childless couples in the middle income ranges but less heavily at very high and very low income levels 2 when the child credit and eic are available families with children tend to be favored over families without child ren at low and moderate income levels 3 the number of ch ildren in family so metimes causes more beneficial treatment and sometimes less depending on how the eic and child credit are being phased out and 4 the graduated rate structure causes large families at higher income levels to be taxed significantly more an effect exacerbated by the amt these results can be char acterized as resulting from the fundamental structural flaws of phaseout provisions and rate brackets phase out points and rate brackets should be based on family size if the ab ility to pay criterion is being used to determine the tax structure the flat amount of the child credit and personal exemption also causes them to have little effect on relative tax liabilities at high income levels phasing them out increases the overtaxation of large families relative to small ones at higher inco levels at low income levels however the family comparisons are affected by the earnedincome tax credit and differences in tax burdens by family size can be striking if there were earnedincome tax credit effective tax rates would be relatively uniform at the lower income levels at zero or small positive percentage amount the eic introduces disparities first the eic rate is much lower for single taxpayers or twomember joint returns where there are qualifying children than it is for families with children second if one accepts the abilitytopay standard the eic has an inappropriate adjustment for family size there is reason to vary the rate of the eic by family size but the base or maximum creditable wage and the phaseout levels shoul d be varied according to the ab ilitytopay standard that is both dollar amounts the amount on which the eic applies and the income at which the phaseout begins should be tied to family size according to the ability to pay standard while th eic rate should be the same for all families to make the eic neutral across families using the abilitytopay standard would require in addition to allowing it at common rate for all families changing the base levels and the phaseout levels for family size changing the rate as was done in 1990 and retained when the ei c was expanded in 1993 does not accomplish equal treatment across families of different sizes providing too much adjustment for some families and not enough for others the analysis also considered the effects of other aspects of the tax system one is the availability of the child care credit the analysis in that paper indicated that including the child credit at the maximum does not have very important effects the dependent care credit is not effectively available to low income families who do not have sufficient tax liability to use the credit and is capped and unimportant in relative sense for high income taxpayers in the middle income levels it lowers the tax rate for families with children httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs19 another issue has to do with the trea tment of married couples where only one individual works outside the home thes families are better off because the spouse not employed outside the home can perform services at home which result in cost savings perform household ta sks which increase leisure time for the rest of the family or enjoy leisure the value of this time which is not counted in the measured transactions of the economy is referred to as imputed income this imputed income is not taxed and it w ould probably be impractical to tax it nevertheless the tax burden as percent of cash plus imputed income is lower for such family imputed income is not easily valued and this issue is explored in the study by limiting the imputed income to the value of child care using the cap for the expenses eligible for child care credit and excl uding this amount from income for low income families this change actually increased taxes by reducing earned income credits at moderate and middle inco mes it benefitted ma rried couples with children who already tend to be favored the authors also considered some of the potential changes and whether those would increase horizontal equity or exacerbate it in the interest of increased horizontal equity the analysis would suppor t an increase in the earned income credit for those without children reduction or containment of the amt which will grow in importance absent change and elimination of phaseouts for child credits personal exemptions and itemized deductions 2001 tax law changes proposed to eliminate the phaseout of the latter two beginning in 2007 making the child credit fully refundable would increase disparities in ta x rates at the lower income levels these calculations should be considered with caution as they depend on the precision of the family equivalency scal which do not take into account the heterogeneity of the cost of rearing children and are aimed at measuring cash needs to attain given standard of living lower income families with younger children who need child care may find their standard of living in material matters lower than other types of families because of the high er cost of that care relative to their income in that case the lower rates due to child care credits or exclusion of imputed income may be appropr iate at higher income levels child care costs are probably much smaller relative to income even if more is spent on care the child care credit however has little effect on effective tax rates at these income levels marriage penalties and marriage bonuses concerns about the marriage penalty reflect reluctance to penalize marriage in society that upholds such traditions as the tax law shifts to reduce the marriage penalty as it did in 2001 it also expands marriage bonuses these choices have consequences not only for incentives but for equitable treatme nt of singles and married couples as shown above in tables 1 and 2 in the middle income brackets where the marriage penalty was largely eliminated singles with the same ability to pay are subject to higher taxes than married couples singles be nefit at lower income levels because their lower required incomes do not phase them out of

dimension by assuming that singles live together and share the same economies of scale that married couples do these individuals could be room mates but they could also be partners who differ from married couples only in that they are not legally married18 single individuals who live together in the same fashion as married couples have the same ability to pay with the same income however remaining single can alter their tax liability remaining single can cause tax liability either to rise or fall depending on the split of income between the two spouses if one individual earns most of the income tax burdens will be higher for two individuals who are not married than fo r married couple with the same total income because the standard deductions ar smaller and the rate brackets narrower if income is evenly split between the two individuals there can be benefit from remaining single married individuals have to combine their income and the rate brackets for joint returns at the higher income brackets while wider than those for single individuals are not twi ce as wide at all levels th ey are not wider than those for heads of household the marriage penalty or bonus might in the context of the measures of household abilitytopay also be described as singles bonus or penalty in any case in considering both the incentive and equity dimension to this issue the tax rates of these families should be compared to the tax rates of other households tables 3 and 4 show the effective tax rate s for married couples and for unmarried couples with the same combin ed income both where income is evenly split and where all income is received by one person in one case there is child and in the other single child these income splits represent the extremes of the marriage penalty and the marriage bonus the same reference income classes and equivalency scales in tables 1 and 2 are used note that uneven income splits in the case of family with child can yield different results depending on whether the individual with the income can claim the child and therefore receive the benefits of the head of household rate structure the higher earned income credit the dependency exemption and the child credit if not that individual files as single the tables indicate that bot h marriage penalties and bonuses persist in the case of families without children however penalties do not exist in the middle incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs21 ranges only bonuses in this case single s who live together and who have uneven incomes would see their tax ra tes fall if they got marrie d both bonuses and penalties exist at the lower income levels because of the earned income tax credit if income is evenly split the phase out ranges are not reached as quickly for singles because each of the partners has only half the income if all of the income is earned by one of the singles in the single partnership phase out of the credit still occurs and the individual also has smaller standard deduction and thus pays higher tax the smaller deductions and narrower rate brackets also cause the higher tax rates through the middle income brackets at very high income levels marriage penalties can also occur some of the penalty is due to not doubling the rate brackets after the 15 bracket but more of it is due to the marriage penalties in the amt if there were amt tax rates for joint returns w ould be 171 and 228 for the 250000 and 500000 incomes the regular tax is st ill res ponsible for most of the penalty for singles with one partner earning income the regular

williams and david weiner of cbo dated september 18 1998with one parent live with their mother19 in that case the comparisons in tables 1 and 2 would be appropriate if the couple divorce but live together presumably the higher income spouse would claim the child however if couple never married and the child is only related to one parent that person more likely the mother and more likely to have low income would claim the child if such couple married and had low incomes they could obtain the earned income credit and study of low income families indicates that this latter effect th bonus is the most common effect of the eic20 which circumstances are more characteristic of the economy note first that although people refer to the marriage penalty for particular family situation or the aggregate size of the marriage penalty it is really not possible in many cases to determine the size of the penalty or bonus the effect of assignment of child is demonstrated in tables 3 and 4 but other features matter only when married couple has only earned inco dependent children and itemized deductions or other special characteristics and only if it is assumed that their behavior would not have been different if their marital status had b een different can one actually measure the size of the marriage penalty or bonus there is way to know who would have custody of the children and th erefore which of the partners might be eligible for head of household status nd for the accompanying personal exemptions and child credits there is reason to expect that unmarried individuals are penalized in the aggregate prior to the 2001 tax cut wh ich increased bonuses and reduced penalties using an allocation that reflects typical be havior of married couples with respect to child custody the congressional budget office cbo estimated that 37 of married couples had penalties 24 b illion 3 were unaffecte d and 60 had bonuses 73 billion itemized deductions and earned income were assigned in pr oportion to earnings the ne t bonus was 49 billion21 however in most of its analysis the cbo study relied on measure of marriag penalties and bonuses that assumed child custody would be based on taxminimizing strategy for example if parents of two children had similar individual earnings each would be assumed to have custody of one of the children so that both would be eligible for headofhousehold status even using that standard net bonuses occurred 43 of married couples had penalties amounting to 32 billion and 52 had bonuses of 43 billion for net bonuses of 11 billion nevertheless significant proportion of married taxpayers between 37 and 43 paid marriage penaltieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs24 22 nicholas bull janet holtzblatt james r nunns and robert

and other assumptions produced different measures of the marriage bonus or penalty22 using an assumption that divorced parents occupied the same residence and thus only one could qualify for head of household status the authors found that 48 had penalty 283 billion and 41 had bonus 267 billion for net pena lty of 16 b illion this study also provided several other ways of measuring penalties nd bonuses including estimating 302 billion in singles penalties because these indivi duals could not use joint return rate schedules some of the pe nalty applied to families with children because of the benefits of head of household status w ithout headofhousehold status the treasury found that 46 of couples have bonuses 366 b illion 43 d penalties 208 billion and the net effect was bonus of 158 billion treasury researchers did subsequent st udy using the standard assumption for the effects of the 2001 tax cu t and for 2004 income levels23 as before they essentially found penalty of 37 billion without the 2001 tax cut but found 30 billion bonus with 2004 tax law which in cluded explicit marriage relief provisions and other provisions such as rate reductions about 60 of couples have bonuses and 23 have penalties while some have effect the study also warns that penalties will grow substantially if the amt continues to grow as projected given the shift away from penalties nd towards bonuses in 2001 it seems clear that the current situation is characterized by bonuses rather than penalties however if the amt is allowed to grow and begins to cover many taxpayers more significant penalties will return an alternative measurement is the bonus and penalties of single individuals who are cohabitating much sm aller group of people in 2005 according to the census bureau there were 58 million married households but only 5 million unmarried couple households with partners of the opposite sex24 there were 77 million households altogether thus assu ming that these households were similar to married households the single pena lties and bonuses measured by looking at unmarried cohabitating households would be about 9 of the size of marriage bonuses and penalties measured by looking at married households study has been made of penalties and bonuses for existing cohabiting couples with children which assign the children to the biological parent or if both partnershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs25 25 elaine maag taxes and marriage for cohabiting parents tax notes may 23 2005 p 1031are biological parents to the higher earner25 this study found that under 2003 law 42 of these couples would experience bonus averaging 1893 while 507 would experience penalty of 1497 u nder 2003 law 485 receive an average bonus of 2236 and 441 receive penalty of 1513 bonuses are actually more prevalent in low income households becau marriage often increases the earned income credit in general therefore the rules tend to indicate that singles who are living together are on average being penalized relative to married couples but this pattern does not hold for all circumstances the marriage penalty cannot be eas ily addressed because we cannot simultaneously achieve three apparently desired income tax objectives progressive tax marriage neutral tax and equal treatment of c ouples with the same total incomes but with different income shares moreover even if one were to chose horizontal equity the achievement of that system would require information on living arrangements of unmarried individuals that is not available to the tax authorities the current system however appears to lean towards benefitting marriage as long as the amt is contained conclusion the analysis of equity across families suggests that based on an ability to pay standard families with child ren are paying lower rates of tax or receiving larger negative tax rates than sing individuals and married couples at lower and middle incomes while families with children are being taxed more heavily at higher income levels at the lowest income levels the eic provides the largest tax subsidies to single parents with two child ren followed by single pare nts with three children and married couples with two children the sm allest subsidies go to childless couples but all families with children ve much larger subsidies than either childless couples or single individuals at middle income levels families with many children will have the most favorable treatment due to the effect of the child credit which has very large effect relative to tax liability at higher income levels large families are penalized because the adjustments for children such as personal exemptions and child credits are too small or are phased out while graduated rates cause larger families that need more income to maintain given living standard to pay higher taxes tax rates are more variable at lower income levels at all but the lowest and very highest income levels singles pay high er taxes than married couples after the 2001 tax cut the vast majority of taxpayers without children receive marriage bonus rather than penalty w ith penalties occurring only at the bottom and at the top the latter due largely to the amt the comparison of families with children is less easily defined overall ma rriage appears to be rewarded but if the amt continues to increase its scope as it will absent legislation penalties will begin to reach back in the middle income classes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33755crs26 hr 3970 introduced by chairman rangel of the ways and means committee includes number of changes that would have effects on relative tax treatment of family types it would double the size of the earned income tax credit for single individuals without children which woul d narrow the differences between family types at the lower income levels it woul d also increase the refundability of the child credit benefitting lower in come families with children although the cost of that change is smaller it would also s lightly increase the standard deduction with relative increases designed not to increase the marriage penalty but which would based on ability to pay favor married couples at the higher end of the scale it would restore phaseouts of itemized deductions which would maintain some uneveness across family types but also would repeal the amt which penalizes families with children at higher income levels
