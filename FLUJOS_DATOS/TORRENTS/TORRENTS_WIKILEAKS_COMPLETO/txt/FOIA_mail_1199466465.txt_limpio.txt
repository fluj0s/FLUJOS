sexton davidsextonmetofficegovuk cgkilsbynewcastleacuk jenkins geoff geoffjenkinsmetofficegovuk kathryn i did talk to the metro yesterday idea what they used maybe few will have read it before copies are tossed around on the tube added geoff on this email ag has answered the second question i may come back to that after trying to answer the first part there are two aspects to the wg work were doing the first which ive mentioned on number of occasions is to prove that the perturbation process used with the wg works colin harpham sent around load of plots to chrisagdavidgeoff just before christmas i have rough draft of paper on this which i sent to chris yesterday this involves the ukcip08 wg but is totally independent of the change factors david is developing for ukcip08 this uses some earlier hadrm3 model runs the wg is fit to 10 grid box series across the uk and then perturbed according to the differences between the future model integrations and the control runs we then generate future weather and show that its characteristics are similar to what hadrm3 got directly this has used the same change factors same variables but from different set of rcm runs the whole purpose of this exercise is to show that the perturbation process works the only way we can test this is to use rcm model runs because they have future runs with big climate change we cant use past weather data as it doesnt have enough of climate change this is validation of the perturbation process we can additionally validate the wg using observational data which weve done earlier return to q2 ag has said how the model variants get chosen the model variants used have variety of ways of being chosen lets say we start with the 50th percentile for rainfall we select all model variants between 45 and 55 then we want temperature at the 90th percentile we then do second selection of the variants already selected that have temperature changes between 85 and 95 as we had initially 10000 variants the first selection reduced this to 1000 as we chose 10 of them the second selection reduced this to 100 as weve again chosen only 10 of them now with these 100 variants most users will average the change factors from david across these 100 these average change factors which will approximately be at the 50 and 90 value for precipitation and temperature respectively get passed to the wg the wg then simulates 100 runs of 30 years for the already preselected location small area and future period there are obviously loads of permutations as we will be allowing users to select all percentile levels singly for temperature or precipitation or jointly for both from 5 to 95 in steps of 5 the percentile levels can be chosen based on seasons 4 and years 1 if you select summer say users will also get the rest of the year using the change factors that go along with those for the selected model variants another possibility is to select one model variant within the chosen percentile bands and pass these change factors to the wg there are other possibilities but i think weve limited the choices to these two the other possibility was variant cant think of better word here but not related to the model variants to the first as you have 100 chosen model variants in this example you could chose one at random or allow each of the 100 wg integrations to be based on different one of the model variants these generated sequences will likely have greater variability than that based on the average of the 100 or that based on the single model variant i think this may open up can of worms with ag when he reads it whichever of these are chosen the use should still run the wg for 100 30year sequences i think ive made the last bit on model variant selection complicated and havent gone back to look at what ag has written in the user guidance it ought to tell you how the change factors that the wg needs will get selected cheers phil at 1007 04012008 humphrey kathryn ceosa wrote hi ag yes that makes perfect sense in terms of selecting oneseveral model variants thanks im still bit confused about the utility of random sampling though as this wont give you results for particular probability level will it i think phil was going to get back to on this as well as the change factors question phil i liked your quote in the metro this morning kathryn

sexton cgkilsbynewcastleacuk subject re questions on the weather generator hi kathryn i can comment on your second question here is my understanding firstly users must run minimum of 100 wg runs regardless of which ones they run this is to enforce the use of probabilistic approach selection by model variant will only make sense once user has produced some runs after any run they will have access to the model variant ids that were used the use case that gave rise to us including selection by model variant id was as follows 1 person x does some wg runs sampling by whatever method she chooses 2 she usesanalyses set of runs to produce some interesting results 3 she is keen to do moredifferent analyses using the model variants that represented that part of parameter space 4 she has the list of model variant ids so she can publish these so that others can use them or she can reuse them herself in other experiments 5 person can read about what person x did and reproduce exactly her results or use the same set of interesting model variants for some other experiments does that make sense cheers ag

questions on the weather generator ______________________________________________ from humphrey kathryn ceosa sent 03 january 2008 1655 to phil jones chris kilsby stephens ag subject questions on the weather generator philchrisag im putting together quick and easy presentation on the ukcip08 methodology for defra officials to give them some idea of how its all done so they can better appreciate whats its potential uses may and may not be however im getting stuck still on some of the wg methodology can you help im not planning on telling them this level of detail about the wg but am just bothered by the issues below im firstly confused about the rcm change factors are you using these to validate the wg runs which i do understand or to generate them which i dont as i thought they were being generated using the data in final pdfs themselves and im still confused about the reasons for allowing users to select runs by model variant i think by model variant you mean each perturbed version of hadcm3 or other single model run or emulator result that creates point in parameter space is this right if so then i understand why you cant run your wg on all model variants too many so selecting random sample is representation of parameter space but my initial understand of how the wg works is that you pick point on the pdf say 50th percentile with given probability and run the wg for that point but this doesnt make sense if you are allowing users to select random single model variants seasons etc because these wont reflect particular percentile maybe its the case that you dont need particular percentile for whatever use the wg data is for but if you dont know how do you know how likely your wg output is and therefore what to do with the result in terms of planning apologies
