6301c08 shspec227 case repair if you did the pure form of listing and opposing described in the last lecture you get less mass as result if you start seeing more rock slams than before and there is more mass on the pc you have been goofing the best visual indicator is the pcs skin tone if mass is increasing the pcs skin goes green or yellow or grey or black the eyes are also an indicator although they are somewhat less reliable because going through period of sen will make the eyes look seny but do note the pcs skin tone at the start of the session so that you can compare this with its later appearance age is another symptom the pc should look younger half way through the session even hair color will change it will get grayer or less gray weight will also change over the course of two to three sessions in the direction of optimum weight the meter should also behave better it should be more responsive there should be cleaner needle routine 2 doesnt do much for the ta position the needle is more indicative the pcs ta can sit at five with the pc getting better and better if the ta remains motionless throughout listing thats fine after awhile there should be some change it is not in the course of one session but after several eventually there should be improvement in high or low ta or the mass hasnt been cleaned up persistent low ta is worrisome seeing change in ta look for 1 wrong source or 2 list that should be completed you should be especially concerned if the pc was at 15 and didnt change after couple of packages had been found listing wrong way to makes the needle stiff and jerky on right list the needle should free up get clean and stay clean list can go clean needle before the item is on it so avoid short lists superlong list say twentyfive pages is from wrong source or wrong way to five to six pages should do the wronger you are the longer it takes the right way goes fast when nulling list dont tell the pc that an item rockslammed until you have finished nulling then watch his indicators to be sure that it is his item dont shift his attention after telling him the item if he arc breaks when you have given him the item it is wrong and you had better get him to go on he wont mind if it was the wrong item if he knows it is his item and you try to make him go on he will arc break when do you repair case when it wont run right the commonest error in routine 2 is wrong source and the commonest source of that is an item taken from an incomplete list any item is viewed as coming from list even if it was never before listed the three areas that you have available to get items from are 1 the pcs pt session environment 2 his pt nonsession life and livingness environment 3 the parts of existence so if the pc has several rock slams on list one you know at once that list one is an incomplete list this gives you the problem of regress you are always starting from list that hasnt been written the auditors responsibility is to make sure that the list source question doesnt rockslam since if it does it is obviously part of list so he cant use it for represent or consist of list all lists start with represent list just because something slams you dont necessarily oppose it you might try to find out what the item is from by asking what list question would _______ be an answer to if you have been listing from something which when you check it now slams it is wrong source it is not that it is getting unsuppressed so what you want to do is to find nonrockslamming list question that produces rock slams there must be rock slam anywhere in the list question if you list from nonrockslamming source and dont get rock slams you can always use the negative version what doesnt _______ consist of if you dont get anything on parts of existence try what isnt part of existence you can also do this with list one if pc has his interest stuck on an item find what list that item was on and complete the list once you have got rockslamming item from complete list you can go ahead and oppose it what about case that has been run long time on wrong sources wrong way to and has lots of wrong items this is pretty sad but the case will still have been improved just repair it by finding the first incomplete list on the case even suppositional one or list one or whatever get list question of some sort that doesnt rockslam add to the list and try to tiger drill alive what originally rockslammed if you get rock slam while extending watch to see whether you keep getting them if you do it shows wrong source or wrong way to try it the other way around if it still wont clean up it is wrong source complete all such incomplete lists where you get ris oppose them and the bricabrac will blow off when repairing lists just examine the genus of the list and see if it needs completing get it completed to its proper item oppose it and package it up before this is done the pc will be interested in the item afterwards he will have interest in the item it erases he will cognite on it the pc may have trouble remembering right items wrong ones will be memorable because the pcs attention is still stuck there the purpose of routine 2 is to clear away chronic ptps and hidden standards so you can find and run the pcs goal having found his goal you may still need to use routine 2 to wipe out restimulated terminals when the pc caves in while running the goal you can use what does pt consist ofnot consist of or what does auditing consist ofnot consist of everything said here about lists also applies to goals clearing lists routine 321 for more data about r321 see pp 332 and 356 above more data is also available in confidential hcobs 7nov62ii routine 321 the twentyone steps finding goals and 17nov62 routine 321 one of the hardest things you will use to get rockslamming item from is goals list goals lists almost never run out of slams when they do though they behave like any other list remember that rocket read is senior to rock slam and that in other respects you trust it the same if you find rocket reading items on therefore incomplete list complete it to one rocketreading item the frequency of rock slam test is senior to the stickier needle test on wrongwayto having found an ri pcs needle may be fine but the wrongwaytoness of it will beef it up do it the other way if it still doesnt clean up and give one rock slam on nulling the source item must have been from an incomplete list so complete it be prepared to be wrong and straighten it out straighten up routine 2 thoroughly fix up auditing briefly you could also find one rockslamming item that never got opposed so oppose it you could take list one and ask what question would complete list one and complete it this would handle most problems
