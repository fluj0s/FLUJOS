state laws congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congressreceived through the crs weborder code rs20772 january 8 2001 superfund and natural resource damages mark reisch analyst in environmental policy resources science and industry division summary the superfund law gives government agencies that serve as natural resource trustees the authority to require responsible parties to make good the environmental harm they caused by restoring or replacing the injured natural resources and by paying damages for the lost use of publicly owned resources this is in addition to epas authority to require the cleanup of spills and contamination from hazardous substance releases natural resource damages nrd has become an issue because of very large claims that have been filed and because of the prospect of more of them key questions are 1 what costs should be included and how they should be measured 2 who should bear the burden of proof in nrd cases the rebuttable presumption question and 3 when nrd cases go to court should review be based solely on the compiled administrative record or should the parties be permitted to introduce new evidence this report will be updated as events warrant amending the natural resource damages nrd provisions of the superf und law has been one of the most intractable issues in the reauthorization debate while best known as the nations principal law for cleaning up spills and contamination from hazardous waste sites superfund formally known as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla1 also obliges potentially responsible parties to make good the environmental harm they have caused on government lands and waters by restoring or replacing the injured natural resources and by paying damages2 for the lost use of publicly owned resources3 see page 2 for examples of natural resource injuries background cercla at 42 usc 960116 defines natural resources broadly to include land

the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa list 86 nrd cases review of 46 of them for which information was electronically available found the following 15 sites where decades of industrial activities were accompanied by releases of variety of hazardous substances into rivers harbors marshlands and other wetlands as well as one case of disposal to the ocean 11 sites where mines and associated waste piles contaminated surface waters and groundwater with acid drainage and leachate containing heavy metals 9 cases where vessels ran aground in three of them oil was the cargo that spilled in three others the ships own fuel spilled and in the other three incidents the ships ran onto coral reefs causing damage to the reef 4 oil pipeline ruptures 2 cases where retaining walls ruptured allowing gypsum slurry to be released into bayou in one case and sewage into river in the other 2 incidents where train derailments resulted in spill of diesel fuel and spill of chemicals 2 oil well accidents that released oil and other liquids into bayous 1 case where containers of toxic chemical were lost overboard in rough seas except for the coral reef groundings these incidents all involve spills of oil or releases of hazardous substances into bodies of water in addition to surface and ground water contamination the harm incurred includes injuries to and death of

damages are residual to cleanup that is they can only be sought for injuries remaining after the response action is complete or the likely effects of the remedy have been taken into account residual injuries occur when 1 cleanup leaves significant contamination of the environment or 2 animal populations have been reduced or wildlife habitat has been destroyed and cannot recover quickly without human intervention5 there are three basic cost components of an nrd claim 1 the cost of performing the damage assessment 2 the restoration costs of bringing the resource back to the condition that otherwise would exist today taking into account the effects of time and natural and human activities and 3 the costs associated with the loss of the resources and the benefits they provide the damages recovered may be used only to restore replace or acquire the equivalent of the subject natural resources 42 usc 9607f1 recovered funds may not go into the general revenues of the federal or state government for example they are compensatory and remedial with punitive element the issue was brought to the fore by some very large nrd claims in the multihundred million dollar range that were filed in the 1990s see page 4 for examples the companies that were sued felt that the nrd provisions were being applied unfairly and contrary to congresss original intent in an effort to achieve the bipartisan support that experience has shown is needed to move cercla reauthorization bill the bills introduced in the 106th congre ss by the chairmen of the committ ees and subcommittees with superfund jurisdiction hr 1300 hr 2580 and s 1090 did not contain nrd provisions however the absence of nrd language and the inability to find an acceptable compromise was one of the reasons the senate environment and public works committee finally ended its deliberations without reporting bill one news source quoted senator mike crapo of idaho who said my problem is not so much what is in as whats out of the bill crapo explained that his main concern is that natural resource damages are not addressed in the bill but he also mentioned his disappointment that the bill lacks remedy reforms and contains insufficien t liability rewrites6 two different purposes are expressed in the cleanup and nrd provisions of cercla first the superfund cleanup or remedial action is intended to protect human health and the environment from furthe r harm and second the natural resource damage measures are intended to restore injured resources andor provide substitute resources most nrd actions are implemented concurrently with or shortly after the remedial action and the majority of nrd claims are settled in the context of the remedial action as part of the cleanup agreement negotiated with the environmental protection agency epa 1996 general accounting office gao report found that in almost half the settlements where nrd was an issue nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20772crs4 7 gao report p 5 8 gao report p 5separate payment was made because either the negotiated cleanup would rectify the injury to the natural resource or such injuries were found the department of justice reported that through april 1995 of 98 cases settled 48 involved payment and in the other 50 monetary recoveries ranged from about 4000 to 24 million7 nevertheless industry groups have expressed concern because some very large natural resource damage claims have been filed and they would like to clarify what costs are covered by the law and to have limits placed on what they see as potentially openended liability they are also concerned about the procedural aspects of nrd litigation the gao study noted above reported that the department of the interior and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa estimated that 60 sites might result in claims of 5 million or more each and as many as 20 of these sites might exceed 50 million each8 since then there have been some very large suits filed epa and the coeur dalene tribe are suing four mining companies for 970 million to restore injuries from mining wastes in the coeur dalene river basin idaho the trial is set to begin in january 2001 the montrose chemical corp and other defendants agreed in october 2000 to settle with the department of justice for disposal of ddt and pcbs on the ocean floor near angeles terms of the settlement called for payme nts of 43 million for cleanup activities and 30 million in natural resource damages 73 million total but federal and state agencies sought 150 million at the start of the trial to cap the 17squaremile area with sand partial settlement of 260 million was reached by the department of justice and atlantic richfield corp in november 1998 for contamination from mining activities in the clark fork river basin montana the suit was for 767 million when trial commenced and roughly 200 million in claims remain issues the controversy over natural resource damages has to do with 1 assessing and valuing the injuries to the natural resource also referred to as the measure of damages 2 the rebuttable presumption issue who should bear the burden of proof and 3 the related question of record review vs new trial measure of damages cercla does not require trustees to use particular standard or method for assessing natural resource monetary damages it does however call for standard procedures to be developed for all trustees to consider when assessing and valuing the injuries to natural resources the department of the interior promulgated the regulations for land in 1986 and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration issued the rules for coastal and marine areas in 1996 as the law directed 42 usc 9651c they issued type rule with standard procedures for simplified assessments that require minimal field investigation and type b rule with protocols for conducting assessments in more complic ated individual cases the type b rule is extensive and contains several valuationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20772crs5 9 crs report rl30242 natural resources assessing nonmarket values through contingent valuation p 9 10 ibid p i for discussions of these

moral satisfaction journal of environmental economics and management v 22 1922 5770methodologies including contingent valuation controversial economic technique to provide monetary values for goods services and public programs for which market data do not exist in contingent valuation survey respondents typically are asked how much they would be willing to pay in higher prices or in taxes for particular good or service for example epa used contingent valuation survey to estimate the annual benefits of improving visibility at the grand canyon by requiring an electric utility to install scrubbers at cost of about 100 million annually epas survey estimated total annual benefits of 130250 million the utility responded with contingent valuation survey of its own that showed benefits of only 50 million in another case to determine the lost values caused by the exxon valdez oil spill the state of alaska used contingent valuation survey that asked how much respondents would be willing to pay in additional taxes to ensure that such an oil spill would not recur within the next 10 years the states survey arrived at median value of 31 per household or 28 billion 31 times an adjusted number of us households all three of these studies were subject to criticism by other reviewers9 some experts assert that the results of such surveys can always be questioned because of the array of possible measurement errors and biases because of empirical evidence challenging their reliability and validity and because of incompatibility with marketbased use values10 proponents of the technique contend that the methodology is theoretically valid and that ignoring nonuse values would understate total damages opponents argue that because the data collected by contingent valuation surveys are not comparable to traditional measures of price and volume and because the methodology itself is suspect the results will always be open to charges of being arbitrary they also argue that lost use and nonuse damages should not be compensated becau the purpose of nrd is only to restore the environment and the payments should go to government entities not to individuals who experienced the loss this issue has proven particularly challenging in the cercla reauthorization debate after the senate environment and public works committee ended its extensive deliberations of s 1090 in the first session of the 106th congress senators john chafee and bob smith the past and current chairmen introduced s 1537 which incorporated changes to the laws nrd provisions however the committee did not return to its consideration of superfund the measure of damages under s 1537 included the reasonable costs of 1 restoring replacing or acquiring the equivalent of the injured or lost natural resource to reinstate its human uses and environmental functio ns 2 providing substantially equivalent resource during the period of any interim lost use to the extent that substitute resource is not reasonably available and 3 assessing the damages the bill language eliminated recovery of damages for nonuse values instead it stated that where unique resource has beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20772crs6 11

costs of expediting or enhancing the restoration of appropriate substitute resources sec 403 these changes and others were based on amendments filed for the markup of s 1090 and in response to negotiations but they were insufficient to bring the committee back to formal consideration of superfund rebuttable presumption the natural resource trustees the federal state and tribal agencies with responsibility for the resources in question are not required to use noaas and interiors damage assessment rules but if they do cercla gives them presumption of correctness rebuttable presumption if the case goes to administrative hearing or court 42 usc 9607f2c the rebuttable presumption moves the burden of proof to the defendants those against whom claim is made to show that the trustees and the damage assessment they performed is somehow in error or otherwise lacking this differs from typical court proceedings and industry groups feel it imposes an unfair handicap on them the other side of the argument is that the presumption can be used to promote fairness or to pursue policy goals such as to correct the imbalance resulting from one partys superior access to the evidence to facilit ate the prompt resolution of claims and to favor certain claims for social and economic reasons11 speeding matters up also conserves financial resources which could be used to repair the injured resources12 record review versus novo review an issue related to the rebuttable presumption question and one that has been litigated inconclusively is whether the defendants challenging the trustees case in court are limited to arguing the record that the trustees have assembled or whether the case should be argued novo industry groups feel record review is prejudicial against them and denies them chance to present their evidence in their own way they argue it thus denies them fair judicial hearing they want to be able to start fresh in the court proceeding and present their own evidence in their defense the trustees perspective however is that the defendants have ample opportunity to present their arguments during comment periods provided by the doi and noaa rules to start over from the beginning in court they argue is burden that is both time consuming and expensive conclusion changing cerclas nrd language has become priority for industry groups but the likelihood of nearterm amendment is not high trustee agencies who serve as stewards on behalf of the public argue that those responsible for injuries to natural resources should bear the cost of restorin g or replacing them and that the costs should incorporate those values which do not have market price the rebuttable presumption and record review are part of the nrd structure that congress created in enacting cercla they say the advocates of change argue that the current system is unfair and places them at great financial risk the nature of the issue makes it difficult to find middle ground and rewrite might have to be in the context of full superfund reauthorization bill where there could be opportunities for negotiation and compromise
