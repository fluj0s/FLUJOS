divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32783fy2005 supplemental appropriations for iraq and afghanistan tsunami relief and other activities summary on february 14 2005 president bush submitted an 819 billion supplemental appropriation request for fy2005 subsequently amende d to total 8204 billion to provide funds for ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan the global war on terror reconstruction in afghan istan tsunami relief nd rehabilitation and other activities as the fifth supplemental of the bush administration to focus on the global war on terrorism and homeland s ecurity these supplemental funds for fy2005 would be in addition to the 257 b illion received in august 2004 as part of the fy2005 dod appropriations act to c over warrelated costs for the initial months of the fiscal year pl 108287 the administrations request include d 7496 billion for the department of defense 56 billion for reconstruction and other foreign aid 950 million for tsunami relief and 770 million for other activities if enacted as an emergency appropriation as reque sted the funds would not be subject to limits in annual budget resolutions but would add to the size of th us budget deficit taking into account the funds already provided dods re quest would bring its fy2005 total appropriation to about 100 billion which is over 45 higher than the amount provided in the fy2004 supplemental pl 108106 while omb director joshua bolten argued that the request was an emergency for known and urgent requirements that could not be met with existing funds some members questioned whether this characterization fit some elements in the request some questioned whether the 5 billion requested by the defense department for the armys initiative to reorganize army units was an unanticipated emergency since it was announced in the fall of 2003 others argued that the initiative was warrelated expense because it was ex pected to relieve warinduced stress on army forces for foreign aid and iraq diplomatic facilities the issue was whether the requests represented true em ergencies or could wait for later consideration if not dealt with in the fy2005 supplemental unde r an emergency designation however these foreign policy items c ould be added to the pending fy2006 international affairs appropriation bills and would place additi onal pressure on the administration to defend an already sizable foreign po licy increase proposed for next year another controversial issue was the ad ministrations proposal to place policy authority and control of funding with the defense department ra ther than the state department to train and equip afghan and iraqi security forces the administration also requested 400 million for contingency funds related to the war on terror and 200 million in aid to the palestinian aut hority both of which raised concerns the conference agreement on hr 1268 passed the house on may 5 36858 and the senate on may 10 providing 82 b

incle account and would remain under the stat departments jurisdiction under the supplemental proposal the supplemental however seeks to shift the source of ana training and equipping from fmf pko accounts to dod resources and to place authority of the program under the s ecretary of defense rather than the secretary of state during early review of the supplemen tal proposal number of concerns were raised about this shift from the stat department to dod for funding and management of iraqi and afghanistan security forces assistance some noted that this diverges from longstanding historical practice of state department and country ambassador control of key foreign policy tool in us relations with allies and other partner nations while defe nse personnel may implement the programs some argued that it was important to maintain civilian authority over the program especially over foreign police assistance in response to these cerns secretary of state rice defended the proposal by noting that iraq in particular is unique war zone situation where the united states needs to maintain coherent strategy for training and equipping iraqi security police and border forces she said that often these personnel operate along side american military forces and that it made sense to have the defense department in charge of training she also remarked that the situation in afghanistan was different and that police training would remain under the jurisd iction of the state department but she added afghanistan also remains war zone and it is important for afghan security forces to be fully integrated in their operational efforts secretary rice further pledged that the administration had estab lished the tightest possible coordination mechanisms placing the chief of mission in charge of ensuring close collaboration between the agencies13 congressional action the conference version provides the full amount requested for iraq and afghan security fo rces as did the hous epassed and senate reported versions but requi res additional cong ressional oversight and involvement of the secretary of state the conference bill requires that the secretary of defense notify congressional defense committees at least five days in advance of any transfers made from this appropriation and report to the same committees on quarterly basis regarding the details of all tr ansfers the bills further require that these funds are available with the concurrence of the secretary of state the conference version includes report language calling for extensive reporting on

defense budget request march 1 see comments by senator conrad on p 3 and senator allard on p 28 supplemental requests that may fail to meet the emergency test appropriations that are designated as emergency requirements do not count against congressionallyset di scretionary budget ceilings fo rmally or informally but add to costs incurred by the government nd cause the current budget deficit to grow several members of congress including key appropriation committee leaders put the administration on notice that they will look closely at the supplemental proposal especially for items that do not represent true emergencies that is requirements that did not exist or were unforseen durin g consideration of the regular fy2005 appropriations or that could wait and be debated during fy2006 appropriation deliberations the fy2006 administration request include s proposals to tighten the definition of emergency requirements that exempt items from enforcement mechanisms in the budget enforcement act the administration is proposing that emergency requirements be defined as necessary expenditure that is sudden urgent unforeseen and not permanent14 the administration also proposes that this definition encompass continge ncy operations that are nati onal security related and specifically says that military operations and foreign aid with costs that are incurred regularly should be part of base fundi ng and as such are not covered under this emergency definition15 this issue came up in recent hearings he ld by the senate budget committee and the senate appropriations committees in the senate budget committee hearing of march 1 2005 some members questioned administration witnesses about whether all elements in the fy2005 supplemental were appropriately classi fied as emergency spending such as 5 billion for army modularity and 300 million for recruiting and retention and other members argued that the definition of emergency spending should be onetime expenditures16 within the foreign policy portion of the request members questioned the emergency nature of veral proposals for some time the state department recognized the need for construction of new embassy in baghdad but did not propose funds in the regular fy2005 budget instead the department sought 658 million in the supplemental likewise it was widely recognized in 2004 that insufficient peacekeeping funds had been requested in the regular appropriation proposal yet the administration did not ame nd its pending request to cover what it now calls 780 million gap in peacekeeping requirements httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32783crs12 additional assistance for jordan pakist an and ukraine was also questioned by some as to whether the needs represent true emergency or could be addressed during consideration of fy2006 funds po rtions of the afghan reconstruction supplemental request were so scrutinized especially since the 2 billion proposal follows about 1 billion appropriati on for fy2005 and similar request for fy2006 further the 400 million providing support for coalition members with troops deployed in iraq and afghanistan nd for other partner countries in the war on terrorism was also challenged as new initiatives that would be more appropriately considered as part of the regular fy2006 appropriation process some argued that longerterm tsunami related r econstruction assistance should be debated later in the regular fy2006 foreign operations bill if not dealt with in the fy2005 supplemental under an emergency designation however these foreign policy items could be added to pending fy2006 international affairs appropriation re quests that seek 13 higher spending compared with enacted levels for fy2005 this would place add itional pressure on the administration to defend an already sizable foreign policy increase that some believe will be closely scrutinized by congress within the defense request some memb ers questioned whether funds for the armys modularity initiative launched in the fall of 2003 to create 10 additional brigades that would be more deployable individually fits the emergency criteria others questioned whether the funds for 30000 additional army personnel is appropriately considered mporary emergency request rather than longerterm need funding for modularity and dditional military pers onnel was approved however by the conferees and both houses other members questioned whether the cost of dods military operations in iraq nd afghanistan is in fact unanticipated or unpredictable since those operations ar entering their third and fourth year respectively and monthly ope rational costs have averaged about 5 billion for some time congressional action while the president won approval for most of his supplemental request with an emergency designation few areas are not funded due to the nonemergency nature of the program in partic ular pl 10913 trims funds for afghanistan reconstruction by about 222 million economic programs for southern sudan by 63 million and peacekeeping contributions by 100 million conferees like both the house and senate offset portions of the foreign policy supplemental spending by resci nding 1 billion in fy2003 economic aid for turkey that has not been obligated during earlier debate on hr 1268 the house appropriations com mittee determined that assistance for jordan pakistan ukraine the palestinians portions of afghanistan reconstructi on and usaid operating expenses in iraq did not fit the criteria for an emergency designation nevertheless the committee believed they warranted support and offset these nonem ergency items with the turkey aid rescission the committees report noted th at emergency assi gnments were limited to funds responding to

reorganizing initiative major issue raised was the funding requested for the armys modularity initiative that was originally announced by chief of staff ge neral schoomaker in august 2003 as part of the armys transformation some members questioned whether this expense passes the test of emergency supplementals where funding is requested for urgent and unanticipated re quirements the army appears to have accelerated its conversion plans announced last february intending now to reorganize not only three active brigades but also convert five rather than one brigade and three national guard brigades this ma explain part of the increase in funding from the 28 billion in the february 2004 plan to the 50 billion in the newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32783crs31 52 for discussion of these construction issues see crs memo military construction in support of afghanistan and iraq by amy belasco april 11 2005 available from authorsupplemental dod announced that it plans to fund the armys modularity initiative in supplementals in both fy2005 and fy2006 nd then transfer that funding to the armys regular budget starting in fy2007 critics suggested that modularity expens are more appropriately considered regular expenditure because they are predictable organizational change announced over year and half ago th erefore these costs according to some analysts should be included in dods re gular appropriations where they would compete with other programs the army argued that the modularity initiative is intended not only to transform army units to be more lethal and more transportable but that the additional units will decrease the stress on army forces by providing more units to deploy the army also requested many procur ement items that would be used to upgrade equipment or provi additional equipment for both deploying units and returning units who are leaving their equipm ent behind this type of expense is not normally considered an incremental cost of contingencies as defined in dods financial regulations dod in its justification material argued that the additional capabilities are necessary to deal with the dangers posed by the ongoing insurgency some 27 billion of the procurement was fo r additional force protection equipment including not only additional armored humv ees and addon kits for other tactical vehicles but also wide vari ety of other equipment for so ldiers such as night vision goggles and other devices intended to improve the militarys capability to deal with improvised explosive devices ieds military construction request the new request also included 13 billion for military construction about 1 billion overseas and about 03 billion associated with the armys modularity in itiative eg providing additional barracks for newlyformed units some of the military construction in and around iraq and afghanistan was controversial because it was perceived to signal longterm us presence for example replacing temporary tents with concrete barracks facilities may also be constructed at time when the us has not negotiated bilateral agreements with permanent iraqi gove rnment as is customarily the case for overseas us military construction projects the justification for some projects for example constructing supply road in iraq to link to new kuwaiti route that avoids urban areas was also less convincing than other projects such as concrete billets which were ju stified on safety grounds or force protection52 congressional action approach to procurement differs the conference bill includes over 1 billion of the 20 billion in additional funding added by the house to dods request procurement totaled 174 billion much of the additional funds would accelerate army purchases of trucks upgrades to abrams tanks

army modularity request the conferees like both houses fully fund the armys 5 billion request for modularity accepting the house rationale that the funds are needed to mitigate stress on the current active duty combat force by creating at least 10 additional combat brigades and that supplemental f unds woul d ensure that equipment would be available prior to deployment for units that will deploy to either iraq or afghanistan in the next two troop rotations scheduled for later this year and in 200655 congressional action military construction concerns t h conferees mirrored the concerns of the h ouse and senate about the administrations 10 billion request for overseas military cons truction whether the projects fit the emergency criteria and whether the projects signaled longterm presence prematurely rather than being projects of temporary and expeditionary nature is appropriate56 the conference bill cuts ove rseas military construction by 300 million and adds 32 million to meet marine corps restructuring needs the sac noted that it was more difficult for construction projects to meet the emergency test of supplemental because of the duration of the global war on terror and the long lead times typical for construction the expeditionary nature of the us presence suggests that temporary facilities should be the rule rather than the exceptionin the committees view57 in those cases where there may be case for an enduring presence in the region that should be part of longterm plan emergency appropriations would make emergency funding less appr opriate the co mmittee argues the panel concluded that projects which have that character should be re quested in the normal budget process in which both authorization and appropriations committees have an opportunity to carefully

remaining funds would be sufficient for the co mpound to be constr ucted within the administrations twoyear schedule du ring floor debate however the house adopted 258170 an amendment by repr esentative upton prohibiting the use of any funds in the bill for embassy security construction or main tenance supporters of the amendment argued that since planning for new baghdad facility had been underway for at least year this should not be funded as an emergency requirement instead the administration should have sub mitted proposal for consideration in the regular fy2005 appropriation or requested funds in the regular fy2006 spending measure before adoption of the upton amendment the white house had expressed concern over the committees 66 million cut fo r embassy construction officials argued that full funding of the 658 million request was important for secure work and living environment for americans serving in baghdad and that construction postponement would delay the movement of us staff in to more safe secure and functional facilities71 the senate supported stat department constructi on plans for graduated design that could be scaled back as requirements in baghdad change the 592 million provided 66 million less than the request was in the committees view sufficient given reduced mission staffi ng levels during floor debate the senate tabled 5445 an

previously expended disaster relief funds and meeting new emergency shelter clean water and medical requirements in the region and 150 million in food aid the food aid re quest was intended to relieve some of the current pressure on the enacted fy 2005 food assistance budget in meeting not only the needs in darfur but in numbe r of crisis situations around the world congressional action conferees approved at least 238 million for darfur related support roughly the vel requested although this total could climb if the administration decides to allocate additi onal food aid to the region or

additional amount coul d be used in darfur if the situation warrants the senate b ill had added more 320 million in food assistance amounts that also could be used worldwide including darfur conferees

securing their borders from terrorist infiltration to ta ke pressure off us forces79 these proposals to support coalition partne rs have raised number of concerns among members of congress some ques tion whether circumstances have changed to justify additional aid to jordan and pakistan especially given the large aid packages approved for both countries in the regular fy2005 appropriation and congressional approva l of transfer authority to accommodate 150 million in military aid for pakistan others also as k why financial support for countries with troops on the ground in iraq and

approval of flexible contingency fund that could be drawn on to respond to complex foreign emergencies congress has rejected these types of requests four times in the past three years the

perhaps as many as 200000 people in 12 southeast asia n south asian and east african nations has elicited over 12 billion in aid pl edges and commitments from governments multilatera l institutions and private individuals the united states made an early pledge of 350 million for immediate relief fforts but the administration increased this amount by seeking 600 million in its request for 950 million fy2005 supplemental of this total 120 milli on would replenish usaid emergency aid accounts that had been drawn in support of the initial american government response likewise the supplemental

rate among teachers previously tsunami relief issues were pa rticular focus of debate during house floor consideration of hr 1268 the h ouse defeated voice vote an amendment by representative tancredo th at would have barred the use of any funds in the bill for tsunami relief the amendments author believed that the more than 1 billion in private donations for victims of the tsunami represent significant outpouring of american support for relief and recovery efforts and that given existing budget constraints and disaster needs in the us further american taxpayer funds were not warranted opponents noted that portion of the request would repay foreign aid accounts from which immediate tsunami relief assistance d been drawn and would disrupt these other aid activities if funds we re not restored moreover they argued the enormity of the tsunami destructi on extensive loss of life and the longterm reconstruction requirement s justified the full us government pledge in further debate the house adopted voice vote an amendment offered by representative maloney that increased the tsunami fund by 3 million although not directly stated in the text of the am endment the intent of its supporters was to provide 3 million for us contribution to the population fund unfpa related to organizations work in tsunamiaffected countries in order to cover the additional costs of responding to unan ticipated tsunami disaster needs unfpa issued 28 million flash appeal to whic h supporters of the amendment hope the united states would respond with 3 milli on contribution other members noted however that the text of the amendment did not direct the administration to use the 3 million as unfpa contribution but onl to supplement the tsunami recoveryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32783crs61 82 the maloney amendment offset the additional tsunami funds by reducing the appropriation for programs funded under the economic support fund esf account by 3 million the effect of this reduction would have been to cut funds for either afghanistan reconstruction activities economic aid to jord an or sudan peace implementation programs each that would receive assistance from th supplementals esf account aid to the palestinians which was also provided through the esf account would not have been effected because hr 1268 included specific earmark for the palestinians 83 for more information regarding

to respond to the tsunami disaster and to the situation in darfur the conference agreement also provides higher level 90 million more for food aid that like the senate bill is available to replenish
