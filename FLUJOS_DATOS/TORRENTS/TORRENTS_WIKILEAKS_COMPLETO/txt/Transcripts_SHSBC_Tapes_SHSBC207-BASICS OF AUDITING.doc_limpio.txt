basics of auditing lecture given on 21 august 1962 all right this is lecture number two 21 august ad 12 the basics of auditing the basics of auditing auditors keep asking for rules and they ask for more rules and they ask for more rules and they ask for more rules and they ask for more rules and they ask for more rules and then they goof in session and they ask for more rules and then they goof in sessions and dont apply those rules and ask for more rules i think its about time i gave you lecture on the subject of the basics of auditing this is very fundamental material im about to give you it is probably more fundamental than hpa but its very strange thing that fundamentals usually come at high ranges of training in other words the fundamental auditing can be understood only after one has audited perhaps by rule for quite while and he runs into what the fundamentals are now that im giving you this lecture makes fundamental change in training training from class on up remains completely the same you see but training of the w and x units are shifted by this that is your very low basic training and hpahca training is shifted by this let tell you what an auditor should be able to do and thereby you will understand it far far far far better an auditor should be able to get another being to be interested in his own case and to talk to him that is the way that is thats what he should be able to do now rules and tricks and all kinds of things of that particular type rudiments auditing positions various types of upset preventersall of those things are contributive to getting this fact to occur but remember theyre only contributive to getting this fact to occur your emeter is only contributive so far as it applies to rudiments in body of session your emeter is only contributive to this fact as far as it applies to rudiments of course the emeter has an entirely different function which is assessment but where youre using the emeter to get somebody into session and to audit him you continuously go astray and become completely unstuck because you try to do with the meter what you cant do naturally if you ever have trouble with sessions youre trying to make the rules and the meter do something that you cant do now there would be some reason why you couldnt do this that is to say you didnt want pcs to talk to you or you were trying to make them sane because they were so crazy or someones basic purposes get in his road on this but some auditors all they got to do is sit down in the auditing chair and the pc arc breaks well do you realize that this is getting worse it is more apparent in sessions these days than it ever was before it is more apparent why why are arc breaks very often these days so much more catastrophic and explosive than they were perhaps five or six years ago its only been in the last two or three years that you could really make an explosive arc break and thats the period weve been using meters well thats because the auditor can do this interesting fact the difficulties that an auditor encounters are his own difficulties and the mechanics he is using force the pc into session with an auditor who doesnt want the pc insession or who doesnt understand the pc should be in session or why the pc should be insession you follow and these rules have made auditing so powerfulthe rudiments themselves have made auditing so powerfulthat where the auditor is actually incapable of getting somebody interested in his own case and to talk to him and yet is using all these rules to put person in state of mindsee to be interested in his own case to talk to himbut the auditor doesnt want the pc to be interested in his own case and talk to him he thinks auditing is for something else see the rules drive the pc into session and the auditor drives him out and it kind of drives the pc around the bend you see how this could work do you see how this could work audience yeah yeah yep yeah this is very very vital this is very very vital how could this work you have the auditor sitting there looking like an auditor the rules trick the pc into being into session the pc suddenly finds out hes made mistake the auditor does not want to hear what the pc is saying the auditor doesnt understand the basics of auditing the auditors just auditing by some kind of set of rules in fact there is auditor but the technology is sufficiently powerful to create pc the technology with the auditor busy auditingunderstand thisthe auditor busy auditing you see with all these rules but not auditing then leaves pc without an auditor do you see how this is and this can be the most maddening thing and pc really doesnt know whats wrong hes actuallya lot of tricks have been used on the pc to get him into session and now hes insession and interested in talking to somebody about his own case see and interested in general and theres auditor now lookahere weve been blaming meter reading missing meter reads cleaning cleans and that sort of thing this is just another technical rule now man who is auditing or girl who is auditing by the basics of auditingunderstood the basics of auditing and could audit by themcould actually miss reads and clean cleans on rudiments and session material and still have the pc perfectly happy and insession audience yes yes do you see that but person who is cleaning cleans and missing reads must also be committing this other error of not auditing by basic auditing but auditing by rules which force the pc into session now the pc is only facing rules and meter the rules may be right but the meter is wrong theres nothing else holding the pc in session and as result you get very very upset condition on the part of the pc therefore its very necessary to know what basic auditing is and im going to tell you the gruesome fate of the ws and the xs at the saint hill course including those who are present at this moment in those two courses the others who have graduated above those courses are fortunate unless they have been peculiarly unluckyits always unlucky see its never any reason for itin not being able to handle pcs and then they will be graded back into this w x type training the first moment somebody appears hereweve got some more auditing space coming up shortly so we can do thistheyre going to start auditing see if they appear here theyre going to start auditing im going to take the meter away from them theyre not going to have any meter and theyre under orders to put all of their rudiments in and move on up the linenot with havingness seemove on up the line with some salient prepcheck questions and they can get out of that unit when they can have all of those rudiments in checked by meter after the session were going to make some auditors were going to make some auditors its horrible thing to do to some people perhaps think of it youre sitting there and you got meter and you say willing to talk to about your difficulties and theres the pc and the pc is in particularly 11 frame of mind that day says yes talk to you about anything you know the frankeyed stare of the criminal just after they robbed the first national you know i wasnt even there umi wasnt even near the place greenbacks in their pockets you know and be able to go through all of those rudiments do some prepcheck questions get those all clean miss withholds of any kind catch all the missed withholds bring them out the other end with the end rudiments and missed withholds and an instructor can check that all on meter and find every single one of them in see well they can do this because theyre going to learn the basics of auditing beginning with this tape basics of auditing in rapid fire are very easy to statevery very easy to state why does auditing exist at all in the last two issues of certainty magazine published in i think july and august in london you find critique of psychoanalysis its an old article1956but is possessed of several terrible and unavoidable truths of what psychoanalysis did wrong its pats on the back in there for old papa freud im not kicking freuds head in particularly but we had to know what psychoanalysis was doing wrong what did psychoanalysis do wrong frankly auditing ever existed in psychoanalysis nobody in psychoanalysis was ever permitted to be insessionnever permitted to bebut went into session accidentally and its accidentnow this is figure that youits something like all jewelersjewelers never go anywhere you know its one of those horrible broad generalities thirtythree percent of people going to psychoanalysts according to the records in the united states based on the 40s and these records you see are not very public in the first three months this sounds incredible wind up in spinbins or commit suicide that isnt given in that pair of articles but thats the truth but the data of why this is occurs in those articles and any interested auditors attention is directed to that because it was rather careful breakdown based on old technology as far as were concernednot particularly uptodate in scientology but nevertheless that told you why psychoanalysis didnt work the guy could accidentally go into session and he never had an auditor there he was down the track and all of sudden and my mother did this to motivator motivator motivator you know my mother did this to and my mother did that to and my mother did something else to and awhamljus erooorowrr and ii was so abused when i was little child and oh yes everybody interfered with sexually yes everything was terrible and so forth and hes way down the track someplace and the analyst says well its five oclock now thats the end of your period thank you very much i hope you do well now mrs jones and goodbye just look at that man this could happen to dog you know nobody ever brought them up to present time and squared them around or anything like that hypnotists even have rules on the subject for gods sakes wake your patient up and slap him in the face and pour cold water on him dont let him walk out of the door and out onto busy public street because they very often do and get themselves killed or run over or injured because theyre still hypnotized when they leave the session you see well thats hypnotist see even hypnotist knew psychoanalysts didnt know im not jumping on papa freud papa freud perhaps had all kinds of rules about auditing that well never hear of see because hes not wellrecorded man if you recognize that he has fantastic numbers of interpreters and he himself didnt write enough or put out enough dope and he was not really scientifically oriented he was more mystically oriented all right well that just gives you an example see they made lot of mistakes well now do you realize that we could walk forward into lot of mistakes unless we examine the basics of auditing what why is auditingand these basics are very few theres the mechanics of blowing something why auditing works ask yourself that question that burning question why does auditing work see theres such things as asking an auditing question getting it answered now theres just that fundamental you see theres make the pc feel better an interesting thing that gets overlookedjust that thats quite incidental to auditing but is ais an underlying factor in auditing 1 wont say that i have never given session that made anybody feel worse but in recent years i give somebody session trying to get something done see thats fine im very happy that they feel better but the point is that god almighty they could fall through the bottom of the chair and break their arm and it wouldnt stop from getting done what im trying to do let us say werelets say were trying to check out some prepcheck questions and make this perselfthis person is going to stay in session dont you see while we do goals assessment see thats what were trying to do see well i just get in there and pitch and hammer and pound and do everything else and they go to the end of the session and they feel betterwasnt even intentional i dont care whether they felt better or not it isnt that i dont care whether people feel better or not i do but in that particular session see they could haveas far as i was concernedcould have wound up at the end of the session feeling like hell and they would have been better off because we were now up along the line to do our next step and get closer to clearing this guy you see its quite incidental but nevertheless the pc felt better you do security check on pc the pc feels better at the end see this is an underlying thread this is the golden thread that goes through all good auditing is the pc always feels better youve really missed the boat if the pc feels worse lets say were doing goals assessment its one of those horrible sessions where we have not found the pcs goal and it lies somewhere behind us and we havent found it out yet and the pc is just blowing his stack and is upset and we can expect everything going to hell in balloon good auditor should be able to bring that session off with the pc feeling better at the end goal missed everything missed everything gone to hell you see as far as the pc is concerned the pc feels better at the end now man thats asking something because the most fruitful source of screaming arc break is missed goal thats missed withhold with magnitude do you realize thats why human beings are so inhuman to humans just because every one of them has missed the basic purpose of every other one of them this is what makes your torquemadas possibly the basic goal of torquemada was to make people happy but nobody ever found that out so he knew how to make them happy you know most of them could be happy if you tortured few hahaha you see how wildly astray the man could have gone why its missed withhold nobody believes this torquemada nobody believes this fact he actually hadnt hidden itjust nobody ever finds it out he could even have told somebody someplace on the track that he was trying to make people happy nobody ever believed him he never got off the withhold in other words and eventually it got to be more and more withhold and more and more withhold and more and more withhold and we find book that dear old torquemada bound with his own little paws which is in the carmel library by the way off at pacific groves california its bound in human skin this was the great boy who made spain safe for christianity or something actually there is copy of that book bound in human skin interesting that was our boy see maybe his basic goal was to make people happy you see and he turns into complete beast because everybody has missed this withhold so you sayoriginally the pc is sitting across from you you got missed withhold on him to begin with you havent got his goal or any of his goals plus you havent got any of his overts plus you havent straightened out anything that people have missed on him in this lifetime hahu whats that make hahahahahaha it makes cabinet minister or something you know this makes boy haha there he sits we all know how it feels to be like that because before we got into scientology we felt like that we knew what life was all about rowrr now the earliest part of auditing is the roughest part of auditing therefore and an auditor who can handle new cases has to be far better than an auditor who is handling case who has gone along the way for while now this is fashionable in scientology to believe that scientologists are harder cases than raw meat and thats only because you mainly get scientologists to audit see you really dont collide with raw meat haa aa lets go out to one of the johannesburg mines and just tap black boy on the shoulder just at random lets not get somebody who has reached for scientology hethat already tells him that hes accessible for auditing hes reached all right we just tap this boy on the shoulder and we sit him down and we say we is gonna audit you hahahaha and he says wus dat well that would be an interesting test of an auditor wouldnt it yet an auditor ought to be able to do that ive put cops newspaper reporters all sorts of weird characters into session while being interviewed and occasionally have them come around and ask for auditing occasionally audit them get their rudiments in you know that kind of thing and let tell you when i havent done it ive usually been sorry but i very often think that the guy is too rough or something like that or hes too this and that you see hes too far gone hes unauditable and its very hard to get him into this type of session and i let him go so you see that type of fellow who is dead set against it and so forth he could be very rough he could be very rough to handle but you would be surprised at who will go into session and who can be audited the detroit police one time came down with crash on center in detroit and they did the incredible thing which has never been repeated anyplace of seizing whole bunch of tapes and they had fourteen cops i think listening to these tapes in relays down at the police station and twelve of them resigned from the force thats record isnt it thats truthful its factual ive had the reports from it now and that shows you that there arepeople are auditable if you approach them right an auditor has got to handle the pcs problems an auditor should be able to get clean needle so pc can be assessed and made to feel better i dont care how he does it whether he even does it by dynamic assessment he should be able to do it you see an auditor should be able to get things done in an auditing session and not audit for the purpose of auditing dont audit to audit get things done in an auditing session thats an interesting fundamental that is interestingly enough missed people all will sit down sometime and they will audit and they audit and they audit and they audit and they audit and they audit and they audit and they audit and they audit and they audit and they never get anything done get the idea we had somebodya team going here i mean wont mention any names i had team going here for week i was saying via the auditing sectioni was saying get this one little thing done on this auditon this pc because this pc is having rough time this pc has continued to have rough time and checkback shows that in one whole week of threehour sessions this auditor was unable to get done this one little thing there wasnt anything else to do for the case its just clear up couple of questions see something like that had to get it done or the auditor couldnt have gone on and yet for somehow or another went jockeying back and forth and just auditing on and on and on and on and on and on for gods sakes fifteen hours and never got this one little thing done you see so busy putting in rudiments and making out the reports and handling the emeter and starting sessions and ending sessions and giving breaks and doing this and doing that doing this doing that and they substitute looking like theyre doing something for getting something done see they look awful busy but you check up at the end of period of time and you say well all right thats fine but what have you got done and the individual says well weweve got the pcs goals list in his folder yeah well did you do any part of that well we didnt do anything that wasthat was completed before wewe started in there well all right fine now have youhave you set the pc up the pc got clean needle here in order to be well the pcs needle is pretty dirty weweit gets dirtier almost every day i think and you say well have you prepchecked out the subject of clearing or you got something accomplished that way well we were going to start on that here next week and you look at this long span of auditing time and nothing happened in it see nothing got done they did other things in order to get something done you get the idea other things they did lot of other things but they never got anything done seems like whenever theyd start to do anything they would hit some sort of via that led them into some other type of action which led them into some other type of action but somehow or another they never did get around in the session to asking the girl if she had missed withhold on her husband in order to cure up these pt problems which have been coming up for the last twenty sessions see never did get around to that see now auditing actually consists of little accomplishments its series of small accomplishments its getting something done it is not going through motions now you should be able to get somebody into session without meter or anything you should be able to get somebody into session you dont need bunch ofyou dont even need rules or anything you get somebody in session how do you do that lot of people have this as sort of gift they call it they make terrific auditors theyve already crossed this little bridge so they can get somebody interested in their own case and willing to talk to them thats all it takes see and thats without any artificial aids of any kind whatsoever and they can get somebody in session now an auditor should be able to allow pc to blow something that means an auditor must permit the pc to talk to him and youd be surprised how rare this is you would really be surprised how rare this is that the auditor will let the pc talk to him large trouble in auditing is differentiating between q and and tr 4and this is another thing an auditor must be able to differentiate between q and and tr 4 and an auditor must be able to handle the session and do things the pc wants done without qing and aing and auditors who have trouble with this are just having trouble its almost willful i mean you have to practically sit up all night to have trouble with this you have to work at this trouble ill tell you the basic differences between q and and doing something q and is very simple thing its just not accepting the pcs answer thats all q and is you question the answer of the pc i mean how simple can it get isnt anything more simple than that dont question his answers and everybody comes around and they want to know rules how youre not supposed to question their answers oh please i cant substitute for somebodys lack of understanding of anything oh i can do lot man but thats prettythats asking it you know in other words let the pc talk to you and youll never have any difficulties with q and see people who qanda do not want the pc to talk to them thats all so they use q and to keep the pc from talking to them you can just see them sitting there with an oar in the auditing session and they use remarkan evaluation you see or comment or request for more information orperfectly occasionally to ask the pc for more informayou dont think he answered the auditing question you better ask him for more information but usually this doesnt apply to this see or the pc is asked another question without any acknowledgment of what he just asked you see or hes asked question which is wildly off what the auditor was trying to do in the first place you see its all defensive mechanism or the auditor does something every time the pc says something you know that will break down pc quicker than anything else tr 4 be damned once in while pc gets so hot so smoking ruddy hot in the room he cant stand it he cant stay in session and he says to the auditor he says please open window and the auditor says well i mustnt qanda hohohohohahaha haha let him sit there and roast hoho that makes ron good and wrong isnt itdoesnt it see hells bells go open the window say you feel better now pc said yup and you go on in session an auditor who never does anything that the pc wants him to do will drive pc mad i guarantee it man and pcan auditor who always does something when the pc says something will also drive pc crazy pc says well why were you going over that goal there i had little bit of withhold there i mean i thi thought to myshaha hathought to myself thats sillyhahahohothats silly that goal is silly thats what i thought well theres variety of courses open to the very bad auditor he can say how was the goal silly see completely psychotic comment see he can say to the pc all right uh thank you thats good tr 4 isnt it haha that got the tr 4 in there iyou understood the pc thought the goal was silly and he says immediately jumping out of the middle of his tiger drill has that goal been invalidated nono theres read on there hummm wonder why not well why not the pc got it off just now see this auditor is in fog man if he does thing like that the pc said well ii think that last goal hoho the last goal up the line therei thought the last goal up the line there the one that you just went across iii actually thought that would stay in you know the pc has dared open his yap see hes dared be insession and the auditor said ill fix this hahahahaha ill fix this hahaha ill check that for you again whats this thats using session doingness to prevent communicatingness now theres two things that pcs do they ask the auditor to do things which if the auditor doesnt do them the session is just going to go round the bend let tell you and they originate and auditors who are having hard times with pcs never differentiate between these two facts they never find out when the pc wants them to do something or when the pc is originating they cant tell from the tone of voice or something of the sort you could do all sorts of weird things like make bargains with the pc and so forth you dont need to do that the pc says hehhehheh heheh thatthatthatthat goal that that hes pointing at youyour goals list upside down you know with his can sort of you know yaahehheh to cacatch catfishtotocatch catfish ii cant believe that thats out howhowhow can it be out ive always sort of thought of that as my goal and how can it be out iii think youve missed suppress or something and the auditor says knowing he mustnt qanda you know audit by the rules says all right thank you to be tiger has that goal been suppressed may find this pc hanging by rope from his neck in the barn dont you see he cant keep the pc insession he keeps wondering why hes auditing by all the rules isnt he never qanda never do anything the pc says never this never that see never never never never never well actually basically hes not doing any basic auditing so he just doesnt know his business he doesnt know his basic auditing hes auditing by some kind of bunch of silly rules trying to makeyou know hes trying to make wrong through having said rule some time or other this is rule that you can follow every time the pc says somethinga q and is challenging questioning the pcs answer see also doing what the pc tells you to do is q and well thats for sure but whats the order of magnitude here theres hell of difference between running how many times have you gone inconscious as the process which the pc demands and rechecking goal the pc thought was in theres hell of difference between these two things you see you sacrifice session control of any kind whatsoever when just being civila civil auditor and saying well cheerily oh rightlets see youre supposed to help the pc man well let tell you you dont help the pc ever by running his processes you never help pc by taking the process he knows should be run on him oh never pc doesnt know the pc knows this is his goal so the auditor says all right he knows its his goal so therefore well take it as his goal and well list it even though we cant quite check it out see well theres hell of difference between that you see and just civillythe pc says theres racket out in the hall ii just cant stay in session theres just this racket out in the hall and so forth and the auditor civilly says well it will probably be over in minute why dont you put down the cans why dont you put down the cans and have smoke and they do and the racket subsists or the auditor goes out and say what the hell is going on out here see and somebody says well were just changing the mop pails and the auditor saysshouldnt say to the person well you must never change mop pails while im auditing for this is the nuts see he should say when will you be finished well the person says well couple hours well you better find somethingdo something yourself or find somebody in charge lets get this thing squared you see lets dont keep running into this lets not demand of the pc that he stay insession under such impossible circumstances dont you see at the same time it may be situation where well its raining on the tin roof and this gets on the pcs nerves now you say all right look haha i cant do thing about it you say to him id like to help you but i cant do thing about it its just tin roof and this is the only place weve got to audit and theres the reality of the situation its going to audit on the tin roof and then say well does it remind you of anything in particular and sometimes the pc looks at this terribly reasonable attitude on the part of the auditor he says well yeah when i was little kid i used to have nightmares all the time and you know i used to have nightmares all the time and slept in room that had tin roof oh yeah what do you know ohoh okay how do you feel about it now well i guess i can get along in session and he goes on in being audited its handling the pc handling the pc isnt making him sit still and talk when hes supposed to and not talk when hes not supposed to you know that isnt handling the pc the pc as far as the auditor is concerned is rampant reactive bank that is influencing an analytical viewpoint and theres limits that you must not go beyond of course in helping out and anything serious like well in this session today were going to prepcheck and the pc says oh my god i thought we were going to this is the roughest part of auditing is why im picking up goals you see oh my god i thought we were going touhgee what the hell god damn i sat up all last night doing this list and now youre not even going to go into it and the auditor says well ive got my orders here from mary sue to prepcheck you this session gives him mary sue you see as an auditor he just backs out of the session totally you see an auditor on the ball handles that and he said all right i would be very happy to go into this id be very happy to do this however it aint reading very well and some time here in the very near future were going to find your goal and all will be straight and im not going to desert you and im going to raise hell if i get transferred off of you im going to find your goal dont worry about it from where i sit here i think we ought to have prepcheck and i think this prepcheck will straighten out lot of things and smooth the whole thing out and thats why im doing it and if you can give hand here why well get through this thing and of course the more you help get through this thing why the faster well get through it and we might even be able to get onto few goals today haha how about that zip zip zip zip see you get prepcheck all down the line in other words you use the force of the protest to get your auditing done lot of tricks you could probably learn it by the rules but actually theres substitute for an ability to understand and feeling of humanness see theres substitute for these things now why does auditing work that is the burning question why does auditing work at all well you could theorize on the subject of ventilation and you could theorize on the subject of asising but lets not theorize lets just take ourselves look at the basicbasic basics of the basicbasic this guy has been going around haunted for long time feeling that the whole nation was after him and then you find out he was benedict arnold and this somehow or another blows some charge this wouldnt be normal action you find goal will blow charge but actually just finding out the character was you know or something like that this might do an interesting thing you see for the case well all right youve gotten something done and so forth but how did this do anything for the case its because as long as only he had his attention on it and as long as he had to keep anyone else from having an attention on it it bothered him and when he puts it out where somebody else can see it too and he can see it too he all of sudden sees it too and we dont care what other mechanics occur dont you see you can find them all in the axioms and that sort of thing but look at the condition of the guy who is withholding he is not letting anybody else see it all right so he lets somebody else see it and the other person says he sees it then he knows that it has been seen by somebody else and then he waits there for moment for the roof to fall in the clouds to collapse earth to open or the devil to appear complete with forked tail what youre running into is the phenomenon of consequence axiom 10 hasnt fired he hasnt produced the effect he thought he was going to produce he was always absolutely sure if he ever told anybody about this hed of course be executed on the site he can imagine hordes of people swinging in climbing in through the windows to get at him i know what he feels like ive only hit one of these on the track and it was very funny it was one morning when suzie was doing some coffeeshopping and we were hitting back along the track someplace and i was trying to pick up something of the sort wed had session and i was trying to pick up something then all of sudden i had the feeling like everybody was after see just for moment i spotted it suddenly where it was and where it was on the track and what id been doing at the particular point of it and the feeling that they were still after was almost overwhelming it was right in present time dont you see i could practically feel the cops battering the door in there for aboutoh i dont knowit must have been over second or so that the feeling lasted see i just knew that was what was going to happen it puzzled very much afterwards exactly why it happened for about three or four minutes and then i added it up it was scarcity of dead families imagine that hadnt seen one for two or three billion years and all of sudden saw one scared half to death see i thought id done it yaw ooh horrible and i didnt tell anybody i thought i must have done it somehow or another i must have produced this action now withheld and then i didnt look at it again and it was just sensation of this and that and just the process of ventilation of the thing and nobody came in the doors nobody came in the windows the galactic empire didnt immediately send despatch and scout car to have picked up for the execution you see nothing happened its anticlimactic whatever else it is well he hasnt made an effect with that one so he drops it like hot potato and we dont care why auditingwe do carebut we dont have to go into why auditing works by what phenomena exist and asising and so forth lets not go into the actual complications of asising and all this sort of thing lets just look at this one interesting fact that when the guy has presented something to his own view and the auditors view and the roof hasnt fallen in as result of it or if the somatics turned on didnt actually kill himand they never do you know unless youre listing the wrong goalyou get sudden feeling of relief you have ventilated something theyvarious phrases have been applied to this basic phenomenon you see what youve done is his attention doesnt have to be on it anymore because he doesnt have to hold it in youve freed up his attention is what youve really done in the most common action you presented something to view the auditor hasnt knocked his head off now supposing the auditor did this the guy saysin this particular instance the guy says i think i was ohh dead family lying there in log cabin and i think i killed them uop and the auditor says you what you murdered whole family mmmmmmmm well i dont know whether i care to audit you anymore see we let the bird create an effect with this thing you see we let himwe havent ventilated it he still has to hold onto it it hasnt been presented to view i mean it doesnt fall with thud you get the idea i mean lot of things here go on and man that thing will persist like crazy lets just look at that as fundamental that something happens that is blowing something you call it colloquially blowing something the pc blew something you do it all the time you do it all the time well thats what youre describing an auditor who will not let the pc answer an auditing question will not let the pc blow anything and auditors have interesting mechanisms by which they forbid the answering of the auditing question they use the meter has anything been suppressed and the pc says w hes about to say well actually aquite few things yesterday why i was thinking about this and i suddenly said id better not think about it because i was supposed to study this bulletin see and so forth and there was yesterday and suppre i was about to say that see the pc is about to say that and you say anything been suppressed in the area and the pc is just saying w he gets about that far and the auditor said good well thats good and clean thank you all right has anything been invalidated good thats good and clean the pc had about ready to say well yes the suppression i just had was invalidated i was just about to say that see but thats clean thats good hahaha fine all right and all right is there anything on this you failed to reveal that reads that reads there what was that what was that and the pc says well wasnt able to re and hes about to say well yes well what was it and the pc says well ii was going togoing toto tell you theres atheres suppresspresspress read anduhuhuhuh well what was it and the pc says well im trtrying to tell you theres aits as spppreprea suppress read andanananand i was going to tell you about that too well what was it here something you failed to reveal right here there there there whats it where whats it whats it well all right ill ask the question again now is there anything you failed to reveal thats clean i told you it was clean well of course auditing occurs at all you can actually tiger drill with complete impunity if your intention is well understood by the pc youre just asking the meter and trying to check and that sort of thing youre not interested in getting the thing answered but theres even way to do that see you say all right on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed and to catch catfish ah well thatsuh and the pc is saying uhthats uhiiii hadhadhad an answer you know i thought of something thats suppressed andand so forth and uhi had an answer there i felt kind of suppressed in the session just early on in the session you see oh you did huh all right well ill check that on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed yeah well itsit reads now what was that the pc says well i just told you i mean i umumfgive session i felt something bzzzzz that hehheh oh well yeah all right thats fine but theres read here and whats that this is the one i want well thats the one im trying to tell you but well this is right here this read this read suppressed thats the one i want this is what im trying to tell you oh all right well what was it what was it go on well say it anyhow and then well clear this up on the goal to catch catfish anything being suppressed thats it thats the one thats the one right there well the fellow says pftft ive told you well its reading on something here pc said well its probably an arc break oh well auditor knows now he mustnt qanda so he cant ask if theres an arc break see this whole thing would go completely around the bend you see it becomes comedy of nonsensejust becomes asinine the way the mechanism works is every time the pc tells you something you do something you never qanda you could never be called guilty of qing and aing you see but still it somehow works out that the pc says well at the beginning of the session i was warm and you go open the window the pc doesnt quite know what to make out of this see he was trying to get off withhold you just asked him for withhold and he said well at the beginning of the session i was sort of warm and the auditor goes over and opens window why the pc realizes if hes going to get any auditing hed better not talk to this auditor see that the auditor never quite differentiates between these two things of the pc asking him to do something and the pc getting off something thats because the auditor doesnt understand what basic auditing isthe mechanism of blowing something thats why auditing works he never reads this difference in the pc the pc is saying oh my god i just suddenly realized something i have been withholding suppress here for the last four goals you were nulling well you got an interesting question there that suppress is pretty tricky button this pc gets this off he tells you you say well all right what is it and he tells you what it is and so forth well i dont know you got to put in an rfactor if youre going to do anything about it you say do you think it affected those next goals yes well my mind wasnt on them at all all right well do you think it might be good idea if we covered those again what do you think of that he says well yeah yeah i better well thats because he suddenly caught himself on mistake dont you see this isyouve got to have an ear for this sort of thing all right heres an entirely different situation pc said well i just suddenly realized that you asked suppress question minute ago and ive been sitting here with an answer to it well ive been holding my breath every time you said anything because i was afraid my breathing was reacting on the meter and the auditor says all right well check that suppress question again get the interesting dividing line see well the basics of auditing include the mechanism of blowing something and if the auditor always does something or qsandas and doessays something else and never buys anything from the pc nothing is ever blown and if the auditor never even on tiger drill makes any allowances for the pc to say things to him and never sets it up in the session so the pc can talk to him why of course the pc never blows anything and after while the missed withholds stack up stack up stack up and it becomes painful because auditing works because the pc blows things and the auditor is actually preventing auditing from working of course the pc will stack up and almost blow his head off like he was an active volcano its just the force and power is built up on this thing oh the pc must be permitted to blow things its as simple as that the answer to q and and tr 4 and all these other interestingly involved and technically difficult questions is whether or not the auditor is actually auditing the pc or going through drill see thats the difference and inevitably if an auditor is having trouble differentiating this way and getting into arc breaky sessions theyve got something that istheyve got bug on preventing the pc from talking to them auditing can still happen under these circumstances but its rather rough auditing can still be very successful under these circumstances but it is tough auditing the more the pc is insession the more understanding and the less antagonism the auditor has for the pc the more the pc can blow the easier it is for the pc to go over the road hes going over the more auditing occurs per unit of time these are the basics of auditing and actually an auditor ought to understand why auditing works ought to be perfectly willing for the pc to talk to him and also realize that the pcs havingness will run down and right on out the bottom if the pc talks to the auditor too much because then the auditor isnt really being talked to hes being talked at in some fashion you dont let pc go on for threequarters of an hour telling you about how his mother caved him in you cant youll kill him you see these little dividing lines an auditor has got to know these things and an auditor has got to know that when he asks an auditing question hes got to get an answer to that question not some other question and when that question is answered by god hes got to buy the answer to it and if he finds himself in the embarrassing position of the question having been answered but he didnt buy the answer but questioned it of being graceful enough and willing to admit that he is wrong and apologize to the pc and say im very sorry i didnt realize that that answered the auditing question you know bang bang everything would go back into shape and he keeps going if the auditor explains to the pc why he didnt think that was an answer to the auditing question and how he was really right in challenging the thing of course out goes the session because he hasnt let the pc blow anything and your pc feels better as he goes along now auditing is validated for him he becomes more willing to be audited less defensive if he feels worse all the time he becomes harder to audit and you try to get pc with lousy dirty scrubby needle thats going bzz bzz bzz and youre trying to read through this thing and youre trying to do this now that you got dynamic assessments that cures it you see but oddly enough if youre good prepchecker you can also cure it and oddly enough you can actually assess on old 3ga on dirty needle that you can clean and you clean that dirty needle and you should be able to do that you should be able to clean up pcs needle slick as whistle see hes right in the middle of ä rock slam you should be good enough that you just clean up his needle bang you know you ask him this you ask him that you ask him the other thing say what does that refer to bzz boong bzzz bong got perfectly even needle you understand theres excuse for trying to ask questions across dirty needle of course i will admit that i have spent as long as two hours two hours and half of persons auditing time just shopping around for what the hell is this all about and then all of sudden why strike the jackpot say oh hoho 1 get it yeah i got it now and ask the series of questions straighten the thing outpc assessable got the idea pc would be prepcheckable on the thing what turned it on you must have turned it on somehow it got turned on somewhere by something an auditor ought to be able to clean up the pcs needle just similarly an auditor without any meter at all should be able to sit there and just bleed every single one of these prepcheck questions dry as bone without another tick on them by just looking at the hunted look in the pcs eye by looking at this by looking at that just watching that pc operate and keeping that pc talking to him until the pc looks nice and comfortable and relaxed and happy about that particular zone in question you see you ought to be able to do that you cant assess goals without meter at this stage of the game you cant do it impossible period dont ever try it youll get into trouble man youll have pc so damned sick he wont know whether hes coming or going youre burying that boy you understand but you sure should be able to put whole model session together without meter within mile of yousensitivity to the pc dont get dependent on this meter to put pc insession you should be able toa good auditor should be able to put pc insession put all of his rudiments in make the pc happy as bird get lot of things done and so forth we did it for years with lots lousier technology than we got now ah whats all this dependency on meter you put the mechanics in and take the human being out and you should be able to get things done in an auditing session not just audit for the purpose of auditing and you ought to be able to allow the pc to get well the pc to get up the pc to have wins the pc to do this if rules are so much in your road according to your understanding of the game then you probably dont understand the rule it isnt the rule is wrong you just dont understand it and it must then follow immediately that youre using the rule to audit the pc and do you know rule will never acknowledge anything you could set rule down in front of the meter and it would never clean or clear anything fundamental auditing basic auditing simply consists of getting the pc in the session willing to talk to the auditor and then for gods sakes let him talk to the auditor and then be able to use the technology that you have in front of you to make himself feel better and put him in session square him up bring him up smiling at the other end you should be able to do that actually you should be able to audit pc without meter for an hour and bring him up at the other endmodel session throughoutbring him up to the other end have an instructor check the thing and findwith very sensitive meterand find every rudiment in neat as pie you understand if you could do that you can audit and today i dont mind telling you the reason im giving you this particular basic data has really nothing to do with the fact that we are making bad auditors we are not it has to do with the fact that 3ga requires superlatively good auditor its not going to get easier i dont expect it to get easier i expect it to get shorter you understand but the more you shorten it the more tension you put on the pc so the more you shorten it and the faster you do it the better youve got to be as an auditor so i have been studying basics and thats what they amount to and actually auditing consists of more than i have told you in this lecture interesting isnt it so wherever we see arc breaks flying we dont necessarily suppose weve got bad auditor on our hands but where it happens all the time then somebody is auditing by the rules but not sitting in the auditing chair something or otherthe rules are somehow being misused to keep the pc from talking to the auditor we dont care about an arc break and pc blowing his stack and going to hell in balloon his goal has been missed and everything has gone to hell and so forth but an auditor ought to be able to sweat it out one way or the other and get the job done we dont care about that were talking about persistent continuous action of the pc always feels worse the pc always feels more upset we never get anything done in session the pc is always nattering this that and the other thing you got that sort of thing were talking about that kind of thing and that auditor must be auditing by the rules man he must be auditing by the rules on sort of white mutiny basis you know he should never qanda the pc says you know theres tack in this chair and it hurts and thats what youre getting on the meter is this tack in this chair and the auditor says i mustnt qanda and never removes the tack three sessions laterthis has been going on for three sessionswhy he has dirty needle and complains to the instructor the fellow was unauditable see well i dont expect things like that to happen around here okay all right thank you very much
