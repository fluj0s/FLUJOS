worker program summary in the 109th congress the senate passe d s 2611 the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2006 which w ould have created new h2c guest worker program the 110th congress may consider similar legislation the guest worker program included in s 2611 would allow up to 200000 foreign workers into the united states annua lly an employer would have to pay an h2c worker the greater of the actual wage paid by the employer to other workers who do the same kind of work and have similar experience or the prevailing wage employers would be prevented from hiring h2c workers if the area unemployment rate for unskilled workers averaged more than 9 for the previous six months the language in s 2611 would allow employer s to hire skilled miskilled or unskilled workers but not agricultural workers or certain types of skilled workers the kinds of jobs filled under the h2c program coul d be similar to the kinds of jobs filled under an existing h2b program which is used mainly to hire lowerskilled workers initially an increased supply of lowersk illed foreig n workers could be expected to lower the relative wages of lowerskilled us workers if the h2c program were enacted an increased supply of lowerskille d foreign workers may have the greatest impact on young nativeborn minority n and on foreignborn minority men in their early working years in 2005 lowers killed us workers were mainly white nonhispanic males under the age of 45 bu t disproportionate number of these workers were young 16 to 24 minor ity black or hispanic men the unemployment rate among young nativeborn minority men tends to be higher than among similar nonminority men in 2005 almo st fifth of lowerskilled workers were foreign born and di sproportionate number of th were minority nonwhite or hispanic men in their early working years 25 to 44 foreignborn minority men in their early working years tend to earn less than similar nativeborn workers in response to an initial decline in th relative wages of lowerskilled workers employers may hire more lowerskilled workers and fewer skilled workers thus the initial widening of the wage gap may narrow over time other factors such as technological change trade saving nd investment educa tion and training demographic changes may also affect the wages of us workers the h2c program could be used by employers to meet seasonal demand to hire foreign workers at full employment or to fill jobs when there is mismatch in geographic area between the skills demanded and the skills available in each case us workers may not be available at th wages offered they may or may not be available at higher wages if employers are not able to hire qualif ied us workers in high unemployment areas ie more than 9 there may be mismatch between the skills available and the skills employers need this report will be update d as warranted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33772contents introduction 1 the proposed h2c guest worker program 1 f f c t s f n w g

persons with more than high school education under s 2611 to get an h2c visa an i ndividual would have to have job offer from us employer who meets the requireme nts of the act before hiring foreign worker an employer would first have to try to recruit us worker5 an employer would have to offer the job to any us worker who applies and is qualified and available an employer would also have to file petition with the secretary of homeland security in which the employer states that the employment of foreign worker will not adversely affect the wage s or working conditions of us workers who are similarly employed once an h2c worker is hired an employ er would have to pay the worker either 1 the actual wage paid by the employer to other workers who do the same kind of work and have similar

any time an employer could file petition on behalf of worker for an employmentbased visa8 effects of new guest worker program the 110th congress may consider new guest worker program similar to the h 2c program approved by the senate in the 109th congress if so questions will likely arise about the potential economic effects of such program this section begins with summary of estimates by the congressional budget office cbo of the effects of the h2c progra m on federal spending and th us population next the section describes some characteristics of lowerskilled us workers with whom many h2c workers would likely compete the section then describes an economic framework that is useful in understanding the potential labor market effects of new guest worker program finally the secti on considers some possible effects of the provision in s 2611 that would prevent empl oyers from hiring h2c workers if the area unemployment rate for unskilled workers averages more than 9 for the previous six months cbo estimates of the impact of the h2c program according to estimates by cbo the h2c program in s 2611 would raise direct federal spending by 41 b illion from 2007 to 2016 most of this spending 39 billion would be for medicaid benefits cbo also projects that the h2c program would increase the us population by 33 million persons from 2007 through 2016 the projection includes both workers and th eir dependents including children born to new entrants after they arrive in th united states of the 33 million increasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33772crs4 9 congressional budget office s 2611 comprehensi ve immigration reform act of 2006 aug 18 2006 pp 47 22 10 under the h2b program employers may hire temporary nonagricultural workers currently the h2b program is capped at 66000 visas annually the requirements for the proposed h2c visa would not be same as th requirements for the h2b visa for more information on the h2b program see crs report rl32044 immigration policy considerations related to guest worker programs 11 persons who are in the labor force are ither working or actively looking for work 12 in this report foreignborn persons include both citizens and noncitizens of the united states the cps does not ask noncitizens if they are legal permanent residents nonimmigrants who are in the united states mporarily eg guest workers or whether they are in the country without authorization therefore in this report the definition of foreignborn persons includes legal immigrants legal nonimmigrants and unauthorized alienscbo estimates that half million persons would have entered the united states illegally under current law9 characteristics of competing lowerskilled us workers the h2c program in s 2611 would allow up to 200000 guest workers into the united states each year these worker s would compete with us workers and eventually with previously admitted h2c workers the language in s 2611 would allow employers to hire skilled semiskille d or unskilled workers however the kinds of jobs filled under the program may be similar to th kinds of jobs filled under an existing h2b program which is used mainly to hire lowerskilled workers10 also s 2611 includes provision that w ould prevent employers from hiring h2c workers in areas with high unemployment among unskilled workers thus the rest of this report focuses on the potential bor market effects of the proposed h2c program on competing lowerskilled workers this section of the report follows s 2611 and defines lowerskilled workers as pe rsons with high school education or less the definition of unskilled workers does not include agricultural workers ie because the h2c program in s 2611 woul d not apply to agricultural workers this section compares three groups of us workers the total civilian labor force11 all lowerskilled workers and lowerskilled foreignborn workers subset of all lowerskilledworkers the description of us workers is ba sed on data from the current population survey cps the cps is monthly survey of about 55500 households conducted by the us census bureau for bls 12 in the cps persons with high school education include persons with either diploma or ged ie persons who have passed general educational development tests see appendix for more information on the cpshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33772crs5 13 in 2005 the unemployment rate among nativeborn lowerskilled minority men either black or hispanic between the ages of 16 and 24 was 85 among similar nonminority men the unemployment rate was 39 calculated by crs from the monthly current population survey cps 14 in 2005 foreignborn lowerskilled minority men either black or hispanic between the ages of 25 and 44 had median weekly ear nings of 440 similar nativeborn men had median weekly earnings of 508 calculated by crs from the monthly current population survey cps 15 when answering the question about race in the cps survey respondents are allowed to choose more than one race this report fo llows bls practice and only counts blacks and whites who selected one race category hispanic persons may be of any race the comparisons discussed in the text of this re port are significant at the 95 confidence level see appendix for discussion of confidence levels 16 one reason why new immigrants may have greater effect on the wages and employment of earlier immigrants is that many new immigrants move to areas where there are large concentrations of immigrants james p smith and barry edmonston eds the new americans economic demographic and fiscal effects of immigration washington national academy press 1997 pp 223224 17 in 2005 117 million of 626 million lowerskilled nonagricultural workers were foreign born 100 million of 857 million nonagricultural workers with more than high sc hool education were foreignborn table 1 shows that an increased supply of foreignborn lowerskilled workers may have the greatest impact on young nativeborn minority men and on foreign born minority men in their early working years the unemployment rate among young nativeborn minority n tends to be higher than among similar nonminority men13 foreignborn minority men in their early working years tend to earn less than similar nativeborn workers14 all lowerskilled workers compared to the total civilian labor force in 2005 lowerskilled us worker s were mainly white 811 non hispanic 797 males 569 under the ag of 45 627 however compared to the total civilian labor force disp roportionate number of lowerskilled workers were black or hispanic 135 and 203 re spectively between the ages of 16 and 24 197 and male 56915 foreignborn lowerskilled workers compared to all lower skilled workers some research suggests that new immigrants may compete mainly with prior immigrants16 therefore this section compares foreignborn lowerskilled workers to all lowerskilled workers disproportionate number of lowerskilled workers are foreignborn in 2005 foreignborn lowerskilled workers accounted for 186 of all lowerskilled workers by comparison foreignborn workers with more than high school ducation accounted for 116 of all workers with more than high school education17 compared to all lowerskilled workers

occupations 248 of lower skilled workers were foreign born if employers used the proposed h2c program to hire workers for these occupations the impact on foreignborn workers may be greater than if the program were used to hire workers for other occupations if s 2611 were enacted some of the workers with whom newer h2c workers may compete could be h2c workers admitted in previous years table 3 shows that according to bls employment projections from 2004 to 2014 employment will increase by 189 million jobs from 1456 million to 1645 million or 13018 in those occupations that employed foreignborn lowerskilled workers in 2005 employment is projected to increase by 177 million jobs from 1356 million to 1534 million or 131 employment is projected to increase in all occupations except produc tion reflecting projected decline in manufacturing employment but the 177 million increase in new jobs is for all jobs regardless of the educational attain ment of the person holding the job bls estimates that from 2004 to 2014 69 million jobs will be filled by persons with high school education or less an increase from 685 million to 754 million or 10119 the persons who fill these jobs may be either nativeborn or foreignborn projections of job growth do not take into account vacancies that may occur in existing jobs employers may replace workers who change occupations or who leave the labor force eg to return to school raise children or retire therefore the number of job openings by occupation consists of the sum of the number of jobs created or lost and the number of vacancies caused by workers who change occupations or leave the labor force20 according to bls projections from 2004 tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33772crs10 21 the 245 million projection accounts for 448 of all job openings during the 10year period one reason for the large number of job openings in occupations filled by persons with high school education or less is that employee turnover in lowerskilled jobs tends to be greater than in jobs requiring more education 2014 there will be 245 million job openings in occupations filled by persons with more than high school education21 the proposed h2c program could allow as many as 200000 foreign workers into th united states annually the h2c visa would be effective for an initial period of three years with one threeyear extension table 3 bls employment

supply of lowerskilled workers does not affect the relative wages of workers in different skill groups it could nevertheless change the distribution of earnings if the relative number of workers in different skill gr oups changes for example an increase in the relative number of lower paid or higher paid workers could increase earnings inequalitywithin six years there could be as many as 12 million h2c guest workers in the united states persons who receive an h2c visa could adjust to permanent status and become us citizens22 if most of the annual 200000 h2c visas were issued to lowerskilled workers they could fill up to 8 of the projected job openings in occupations requiring high school education or less earnings lowerskilled workers generally earn less than more skilled workers in 2005 foreignborn lowerskille d workers had median weekly earnings of 400 before taxes and othe r deductions this amount compares to median weekly earnings of 576 for all workers and 438 week for all lowerskilled workers these estimates include both fulltime and parttime workers23 research on the effect of immigration on earnings researchers do not agree on the effect of immigration on earnings24 according to george borjas between 1979 and 1995 immigration of unskille d workers defined as high school dropouts reduced the wages of all high school dropouts by five percentage points relative to the wages of all other workers25 david card on the other hand has concluded that an increased supply of less skilled immigrants lso defined as high school dropouts has d little impact on the wages of dropouts relative to the wages of high school graduates according to ca rd the main reason for this finding is that industries change their methods of producti on to employ the increased supply of less skilled foreign workers26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33772crs12 economic framework for understanding the potential labor market effects of new guest worker program the potential labor market effects of new guest worker program can be examined from different perspectives the initial effect of an increased supply of foreign workers on the wages and employment of competing us workers b the longrun effect of an increased supply of foreig n workers as us workers and employers adjust to the initial change in wages and employment and c the effects that take place over time as other changes social economic and demographic occur initially an increased supply of lowers killed foreign workers can be expected to lower the relative wages of lowerskilled us workers in response to the initial change in wages employers may hire mo re lowerskilled workers because they are relatively cheaper and fewer skilled workers because they are relatively more expensive some employers and workers may move to areas where there are better investment and employme nt opportunities other factors may also affect employment and wages for example changes in technology foreign trade saving and investment educa tion and training and demographic changes the effects of guest worker progra m may also depend on why us workers are not available to meet employer dema nd thus the effects of guest worker program would likely differ if employer mand is for seasonal workers for workers at full employment or for workers with skills that are not available in local labor markets employers may be able to fill jobs by offering higher wages but at full employment higher wages may cause infl ation without increasing employment if there is mismatch between the skills demanded by employers and the skills available vacancies could be filled by traini ng workers but worker training can take time qualified workers ma not be available soon enough to meet employer demand economic analysis the different perspectives for analyzing the labor market effects of guest worker progra m can be described us ing standard economic concepts shortterm and longerterm effects economists distinguish between the shortterm and the longterm effects of an increased supply of workers for an employer the common definition of the shortterm is period during which the quantity of at least one input is fixed and cannot be changed it is generally assumed that the fixed input is the stock of capita l goods ie buildings and equipment and associated technology if the stock of cap ital is fixed in the shortterm firm canhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33772crs13 27 because labor consists of both variable and fixed costs it is sometimes called quasi fixed factor of production fi xed labor costs vary with the number of workers employed and include hiring and training costs certain payroll taxes and fringe benefits variable costs vary with the number of hours worked and consist mainly of wages walter oi

and labor relations pp 9495 28 the wages of competing workers may not fall in absolute terms but they can be expected to fall relative to the wages of other workers 29 for an explanation of how an increase in labor supply may affect wages and employment see crs report 95408 immigration the effect s on nativeborn workers only change the quantity of variable factors principally labor27 in the longterm firm can change the quantity of both fixed and variable inputs scale effect for employers the stock of capital goods is generally fixed in the short run if there is change in the price of labor relative to the price of capital or change in the relative wages of workers with different skills the scale of production may change in the short run an increased supply of workers can be expected to lower the wages of competing workers28 therefore if employers used the h2c program to hire lowerskilled workers in the short run the wages of competing us workers could be expected to fall relative to the wages of other workers29 at the same time relative wages may rise for workers whose skills are complements eg supervisors to the skills of lowerskilled workers substitution effect in the long run employers can change the quantities of both fixed and variable inputs in respons to change in the relative prices of inputs employers may use relatively more of the factor that has fallen in price holding output constant employers may substitute the lowerpriced factor for other inputs therefore if the h2c prog ram increased the supply of lowerskilled workers employers may substitute lessskilled labor for both skilled labor and capital employers may hire more lowerskilled workers and fewer skilled workers therefore in the short run the wages of unskilled workers may fall relative to the wages of skilled workers the scale effect but in the long run employers may adopt more laborintensive pr oduction methods the substitution effect if so in the long run the initial ie shortrun wide ning of the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers may narrow in the long run both labor and capital are mobile an increased supply of foreign workers in one geographic area ma affect investment decisions and the behavior of other workers for instan ce employers may move their businesses to where there is greater supply of labor workers may move to where there is greater demand for labor thus an increased supply of workers in one area of the country may affect employment and wages throughout the economy social economic and demographic changes the scale and substitution effects of employer demand for labor are useful in explaining how an increased supply of lowerskilled workers may affect employment and relative wages in the short run and long run but the scale eff ect holds the stock of capital goods constanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33772crs14 30 technological change consists of improved equipment the introduction of new products and improved methods of producti on transportation and communication 31 when there is unemployment because of smatch in labor market between the skills available and the skills demanded unemployment is called structural unemploymentand the substitution effect holds output constant over time other changes may make it difficult to identify the effects of an incr eased supply of lowerskilled workers for example the size and composition of the domestic labor force may change the work force may become younger or older more us workers may finish high school or go to college savings and inve stment may cause the stock of capital employment and output to grow changes in technology consumer preferences or trade may affect the demand for workers with different skills30 some changes may be due in part to an increased supply of foreign workers for example because of an increased supply of lowerskilled foreig n workers some us workers may get more education and training others may leave the labor fo rce an increased supply of lowerskilled foreign workers may so affect the amount kind and location of investment as well as the kinds of technology adopted the availability of us workers the labor market effects of new guest worker program may also depend on why u s workers are not available to meet employer demand seasonal demand employers may need workers to meet seasonal demand an adequate supply of qualif ied us workers may be available among unemployed workers or among persons willing to enter the labor force in response to demand for temporary workers under the proposed h2c program an employer would have to pay foreign worker the actual wage pa id to other workers for the same kind of work and similar experience or the prevailing wage whichever is greater but in local labor markets an adequate supply of workers may not be available at these wages workers may be available from outside the area but they may not be willing to travel or relocate for temporary job workers with permanent jobs may not be willing to leave those jobs for temporar job thus guest worker program may help employers meet seasonal demand by providing temporary supply of workers on the other hand the availability of gu est workers may discourage employers from raising wages to recruit us workers guest worker program may also discourage employers from adopting different pr oduction methods or introducing new technologies that could reduce th demand for seasonal workers geographic mismat ch between the sk ills demanded and skills supplied in some labor markets employers may not be able to fill openings if the skills that are available locally do not match the skills that employers need31 foreign workers may help meet employer demand if qualified us workers are not available at the wages paid to other workers for the same kind of work or at the prevailing wage at higher wages employers may be able to recruit qualified workers from outside the local labor market alternatively local workers could be trained to perform the available work but training can take time depending on the kinds of skills needed training may however be longerterm solution to local labor shortages qualified us workers could also be attracted to an area by higher wageshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33772crs15 32 at full employment there are typically pers ons who are between jobs eg because they have quit or been laid off or persons who have entered the labor force and are looking for work economists call this frictional unemployment full employment is commonly defined as the lowe st rate of unemployment that is consistent with stable prices this rate may vary over time crs report rl33734 economic growth inflation and unemployment limits to economic policy by brian cashell and crs report rl32274 changing natural rate of employment policy issues by marc labonteemployers could also relocate to an ar ea where there is an adequate supply of qualified workers demand at full employment at full employment whether for seasonal or yearround work employers may only be ab to hire qualified us workers by raising wages and hiring workers away from other employers32 but higher wages may cause inflation therefore at full employment foreign workers may help meet employer demand for labor and help curb inflation because h2c visas would be effective for three years and renewable for another three years the economy may not be at full employment when the visa s expire but without the h2c program some employers could potentially relocate or outsource work to country where there is an adequate supply of labor effects of the 9 area unemployment trigger s 2611 included provision that would not allow employers to hire h2c workers if the area unemployment rate for unskilled workers averages more than 9 for the previous six months the tri gger would not affect the overall limit of 200000 h2c visas which would be availa ble to the rest of the country before hiring an h2c worker employers would first have to try to recruit and hire us workers in high unemploymen t areas the 9 trigger would restrict the supply of h2c workers thus in these areas the potential labor market effects of the h2c program may depend on whether us workers are available to meet employer demand in high unemployment areas employer s may be able to hire unemployed workers whether at the same wage paid to other workers for the same kind of work or at higher wage however if empl oyers are not able to hire qualified us workers it may be because there is match in the area between the skills some employers demand and the skills available if there is mismatch employers would not be allowed to hire h2c workers us workers could be trained to fill the demand or they could be recr uited from outside the local area employers could also alter their method of production to reduce thei r need for skills that are not available or they could move to where the skills are available and the unemployment rate is 9 or lower table c1 in appendix c shows those areas of the country that may have been affected by the 9 unemployment trigger if it had been in effect in 2005 the unemployment rates shown in the table are based on the

labor force of 632 million eight of th msas were in california 7 were in michigan 5 in texas and 4 each were in alabama colorado illinois and ohio35 conclusions if the 110th congress were to enact guest worker program like the h2c program that was approved by the senate in the 109th congress the initial labor market effects may be different from the longterm effects initially an increased supply of foreign workers could be ex pected to lower the relative wages of competing us workers if the program were used mainly to hire lowerskilled foreign workers the greatest impact may be on young nativeborn minority men and on foreignborn minority men in their early wo rking years in response to the initial change in wages employers may hire more lowerskilled workers and fewer skilled workers some employers and workers may also move to where there are better investment and employ ment opportunities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33772crs17 an increased supply of foreign work ers would likely increase total us employment and output but economists do not agree on the effect of immigration on wages other factors such as t echnological change trade saving and interment education and

why us workers are not available to meet employer mand the effects would likely differ if employer demand is for seasonal workers for more workers at full employment or for workers with skills that are not available in the local labor market employers may be able to fill jobs by offering higher wages but at full employment higher wages may cause inflation without increasin g employment if there is mismatch between the skills demanded and the skills available higher wages may not attract an adequate supply of qualified workers the 9 trigger in s 2611 may encourage em ployers to hire us
