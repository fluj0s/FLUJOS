schoep of the national socialist movement of the united states the national socialist movement is according to its website the largest and most active nazi party in the united states accordingly it refers to itself as americas nazi party and aims to instigate major change in the us wikinews was able to conduct an interview with the head of the party commander jeff schoep fresh back from march in missouri commander schoep told wikinews his views on barack obama the economy and much more read the full exclusive interview below does your party believe america will be better or worse place with obama as president commander schoep here is my answer to this why obama is good for our movement wn how will the national socialist movement react to the election of barack obama will there be cooperation or will you be opposed to him nazis at recent rally in jefferson commander schoep obongo is just another figurehead he answers to international jewry just like mccain it does not matter what color his skin is he is more of the same old same old system that has crippled our nation wn obama says he wants to close guantanamo bay what are your views on this commander schoep our position on guantanamo is that it is national disgrace and should be shut down completely the prison was set up to torture and avoid us laws of fair treatment of prisoners it should be closed furthermore many soldiers pows are being held there in violation of international pow laws instead these soldiers are classified as enemy combatants or terrorists for example the taliban was the legitimate government in afghanistan yet their soldiers are not classified as soldiers it is violation of the rules of warfare and it is criminal for those reasons the prison should be closed and the soldiers returned to their homelands wn there are fears obama may be assassinated what do you think that would mean for america and for your party commander schoep declined to answer this question an entrance to camp at guantanamo bay schoep and obama both want to see the facility closed down wn why do you think obama succeeded over mccain commander schoep mccain is an out of touch fool who openly crusaded for his beloved 3rd world invaders who did not vote for him anyways because he is white the republicans lost many votes not just due to mccains lack of charisma but mainly because the common man is sick of the republican lies and same old dog and pony show that was king george bush voters see mccain as an extension of the policies that got us into the current economic messhardship in our nation obama came across to the masses as someone who would change things whereas the voters believe he will change things and make america prosperous once again i think his idea of change will likely be similar to the change kwame kilpatrick did for detroit marion barry did for dc and robert mugabe did for zimbabwe time will tell if he rules the land honestly or if he attempts to further corrupt it perhaps installing communist like agenda to uplift the ghetto into the suburbs we will see wn if you were in power how would you deal with the current financial situation commander schoep we would institute national socialist government we would cut all foreign aid to israel and other unneeded foreign aid institute an america first policy pull back our troops from overseas zionist organized wars and put them on americas borders to defend against illegal aliens halt the 3rd world invasion that is crippling our economy we would abolish the federal reserve and ban foreign influence from all aspects of our economy and seats of government this nuclear bomb had to be recovered after it was lost into the sea after midair collision commander schoep would like to see global nuclear disarmament to prevent situations like this or misuse of such weapons wn do you feel responses so far both in the us and internationally by politicians to the financial crisis were adequate or could more have been done commander schoep more should be done see above response most american politicians are afraid to take an america first stand and bow down to the israelis instead us politicians need to throw off the shackles and stand up for the common man now before its to late only through an america first policy will we regain prosperity and refuel our economy wn do you think the economy will be sorted out in say four years time commander schoep i think it will worsen the communist party openly endorses and supports the new president if that is sign of things to come look out white america the winds of revolution may already be blowing wn is there need for some international financial cooperation or could america solve its own financial problems entirely on its own commander schoep this would be an easy fix bring all of our troops home from overseas cut off all foreign aid starting with israel institute an america first policy across the boards abolish the federal reserve and remove all foreign nationals from any govnt or banking institutions that would be start and we should concentrate solely on our own nation wn the us currently owes large amount of debt how would you go about paying this off and preventing the problem repeating itself commander schoep answer to this is above in the last question institute those solutions and revive our economy then we can pay back our debts commander schoep says the tesla electric sports car is good example of efforts to move to greener alternative fuels wn oil will eventually run out that may or may not be shortterm but what is clear is that the prices although back down from the record highs are set to rise would you commit to using alternative sources of fuel and energy to combat this or have you another energy policy in mind commander schoep we must look at alternative energy forms many valiant efforts are being made such as the tesla electric sports car can i get one of those for this endorsement kidding and hybrid cars are step in the right direction i would favour taking some of the federal slated for foreign nations and wars to be redirected at finding alternate and greener energy sources and earmark other funding for cancer research and programs to heal our own sick people here in the us wn america recently revealed that they had lost nuclear weapon off greenland forty years ago many others have gone missing do you think nuclear weapons safety is adequate does it need revamped or should america commit to nuclear disarmament commander schoep this is tricky question i think nuclear weapons are bad thing especially in the wrong hands we know the zionist terror state of israel has nukes and threatens the entire middle east with those weapons due to the israelis having them now iran wants them and they have every right to pursue them for self defence against hostile and unpredictable neighbor in perfect world i would say yes all nations should disarm them to insure that there are accidents or madmen launching them at other nations the harm to the environment and mass human life is way to great to allow any nuclear accidents if there is way to disarm all nations nuclear arsenals then i am all for that but until all nations have disarmed and destroyed them others will keep trying to build them for their own national integrety wn what issues do you think the next us election will revolve around commander schoep that remains to be seen i am not fortune teller so i will reserve my speculation for coffee table talks commander jeff schoepif you are not part of the solution you are part of the
