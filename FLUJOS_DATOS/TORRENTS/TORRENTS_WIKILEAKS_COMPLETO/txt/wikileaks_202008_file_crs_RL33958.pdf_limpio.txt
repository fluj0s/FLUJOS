animal agriculture are not eligible for the price and income supports that congress historically has written into farm bills for major row crops such as grains cotton and oilseeds however the meat and poultry industries do look to the federal government for leadership and support in promoting their exports resolving trade disputes and reassuring markets that their products are safe of high quality and diseasefree farm bills can contain policy guidance and resources to help achieve these objectives animal producers closely follow the development of farm bills because of their potential impact on production and marketing costs for example policies promoting cropbased alternative fuels like ethanol already have contributed to higher prices for corn and soybeans both important animal feedstuffs where additional biofuels policy incentives were being considered for inclusion in new farm bill cattle hog and poultry producers urged restraint andor encouraged more use of nonfeed crops like grasses and field wastes other farm bill issues of interest included proposals from some farmerrancher coalitions to address perceived anticompetitive market behavior by large meat and poultry processing companies and proposed changes in food safety laws number of animalrelated provisions some potentially quite significant for producers and agribusinesses were debated during congresss

agriculture are not eligible for the price and income support programs that congress has written into farm bills for major crops such as grains cotton and oilseeds1 nor have meat and poultry producers generally sought such assistance except ad hoc aid to recover losses caused by natural disasters such as droughts and hurricanes2 they also do not qualify for federal crop insurance which covers portion of the value of production lost to natural disasters some cattle and hog producers in limited number of states do participate in livestock revenue insurance programs being administered by usdas risk management agency rma which provides protection from revenue losses whether due to natural causes or economic conditions animal agriculture does look to the federal government to resolve trade disputes establish transparent sciencebased rules for importing and exporting animal products and reassure domestic and foreign buyers alike that these products are safe of high quality and

2008 both chambers overrode the veto making the bill law pl 110234 however the trade title was inadvertently excluded from the enrolled bill to remedy the situation both chambers repassed the farm bill conference agreement including the trade title as hr 6124 the president vetoed the measure in june 2008 and both chambers again overrode the veto which made hr 6124 law as pl 110246 and

pr oduction consumption and export of meat and poultry products one indicator of the increasing re liance of the animal sector on international trade is the share of us domestic production that is exported figure that has increased significantly over the past 35 years broiler meat exports have grown from 13 of production in 1970 to 149 of production in 2006 and nearly 162 in 2007 pork exports climbed from 13 to 143 over the same period see figure 1 beef exports also climbed from 02 of domestic production in 1970 to 96 in 2003 when world markets closed to us beef after canadianborn cow with bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse was discovered in washington state late in 2003 exports dropped precipitously to 19 of production in 2004 two more bse cases subsequently were found in usborn cattle under more intensive surveillance program but beef exports are again rebuilding gradually they reached 54 of production in 2007 the united states has long been dominant world player but increasing reliance on exports also has brought new challenges other countries are competing vigorously for the same country markets table 2 discusses the relative position of the united states in world trade of beef and veal pork broilers and turkey many years of effort to build export sales can be reversed abruptly due to an animal disease outbreak when other countries restrict us meat or

recognized safeguards another example has been the european unions eus refusal to accept us beef treated with approved growth hormones despite an international panel siding with the united states when

clear leader in delivering nutritional and convenient products to consumer s while at the same time sharply controlling costs according to barkema the hog industry has been following poultrys footsteps now typical are contract production arrangements with large integrators who may provide the genetics piglets and other inputs and contracting producer farmer who provides facilities and labor for those who raise livestock all of these changes have meant fewer cash transactions at auction barns or other open markets and more frequent often longerterm business arrangements with buyers andor processors often these arrangements take the form of agricultural contracts which usda defines as agreements between farmers and their commodity buyers that are reached before the completion of

players can view equally works to the disadvantage of the far larger number of producers trying to sell their livestock to the relatively few packers who buy them it is argued some have long argued that to resolve these concerns ban should be imposed against packers owning or controlling any livestock until they are ready for slaughter legislation to ban packer ownership was considered in the

also were introduced that would amend the afpa to address what sponsors view as inequities in contract ing between agricultural producers and those who buy their commodities proposed amendments to the

and do impose unfavorable contract terms on the producers forcing them to either accept them or go out of business in the courts small farm advocates have brought several closely watched lawsuits under the ps act and several other laws challenging the contracting and marketing practices of larger packers andor integrators these efforts generally have not been successful which added impetus to calls for including socalled competition title in new omnibus farm bill advocates called on lawmakers to strengthen existing antitrust authorities to impose more mandates on the executive branch to enforce these authorities and to provide new contract protections for farmers among other options opponents of the various afpa and ps act proposals have asserted that buyers use these and other contracting arrangements to ensure steady supply of animals as well as other agricultural commodities to keep highcapacity plants operatin g efficiently such arrangements also allow for necessary price adjustments for quality grade or other marketprescribed factors the proposals for change would hurt producers too because many of them use contracts or other marketing agreements with packers to

reporting law or packers who slaughter over 120000 head of cattle each year the ban would not have applied to ownership arrangements entered into within 14 days of slaughter of the livestock by packer or to any cooperative or entity owned by cooperative the provision would have allowed for certain transition rules for packers who already own feed or control livestock intended for slaughter on the

publicly disclosed or reported these producers had asserted that such arrangements made it difficult or impossible for them to determine fair market prices other producers and many firms who bought their animals at first had opposed mandatory law arguing that it would impose costly new reporting burdens on the industry and could cause the release of confidential company information among other concerns nonetheless they eventually accepted new consensus law and generally supported its continuation lmpr contains variety of reporting requirements for example detailed market information must be

potentially adulterated products from the marketplace what about the safety of meat and milk from cloned animals and their offspring more broadly should congress consider wholesale overhaul of the us food safety syst em and an update of its underlying legislative authorities g8g138g155g150g561g4g146g149g149g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 provisions in the farm bill address some of these questions17 among the more prominent provisions is language to permit interstate shipment of stateinspected products under certain conditions generally modeled after the language in the senatepassed farm bill new program would supplement the current federalstate coope rative inspection program with provision whereby stateinspected plants with 25 or fewe r employees could opt into new program that subjects them to federally directed but stateope rated inspection thus allowing them to ship interstate more specifically the plants would still be inspected by state employees but these employees would be under the supervision of federal employee who will oversee training inspection compliance and other activities states would receive at least 60 reimbursement of their costs compared with 50 under the existing federalstate program which could also continue the senate language is compromise package acceptable to both opponents and supporters of house farm bill language which among other things could have enabled many plants currently under federal inspection to apply for state inspection and continue to ship interstate opponents of the house option feared that many would seek to leave the federal system if they believed that could receive more lenient oversight by the states the state inspection provisions of the housepassed farm bill essentially had been adapted from language found in companion bills hr 2315s 1150 introduced earlier in 2007 by respectively representative pomeroy and senator hatch other bills hr 1760s 1149 to strike the interstate bans in the fmia

conferees modified senate bill language to provide for new usda initiatives affecting domestic catfish voluntary grading program administered through ams and mandatory safety inspection of such

seafood species eligible to petition usda for similar service in major change conferees also agreed to extend mandatory inspection to catfish processors further authorizing fsis to take into account the conditions under which catfish are raised and processed although other fish and shellfish are not covered by the final amendment conferees noted in their accompanying report that the secretary of agriculture has standing authority to add species if appropriate the conference report also states the intent of congress that catfish be subject to continuous inspection and that imported catfish inspection programs be found to be equivalent under usda regulations before foreign catfish may be imported into the united states food safety commission conferees deleted provision in the senate bill to establish congressional bipartisan food safety commission that would have been required to report within one year on recommendations for modernizing food programs the senate bill also would have required the president to review the report and send congress proposed legislation to implement its recommendations food from cloned animals fda had asked companies to refrain voluntarily from marketing meat and milk from cloned animals or their progeny until it could complete final assessment of their safety conferees deleted provision in the senate bill that would have prohibited fda from issuing final risk assessment or from lifting the voluntary moratorium until completion of newly mandated studies on the safety and market impacts of introducing products from cloned animals

requirement including raw agricultural products such as live animals meat poultry fruits and vegetables for example although their outer containers must contain such labeling title x of the 2002 farm bill was to change this by requiring retailers to provide countryof origin labeling for fresh beef pork and lamb section 10816 of subtitle i18 first adopted on the senate floor in late 2001 mandatory countryoforigin labeling cool for meat was to be in place on september 30 2004 but language in the fy2004 consolidated appropriations act pl 108199 delayed implementation for meats produce and peanuts but not seafood for two years until september 30 2006 debate over cool carried into the 109 th congress which in usdas fy2006 appropriation pl 10997 postponed implementation for an additional two years until september 30 2008 this contentious program was again on the farm bill agenda of the 110th congress19 the implementation delays had reflected the continuing divergence of opinion among lawmakers over whether federally mandated labeling program was needed some contended that mandatory cool would provide us products with competitive advantage over foreign products because us consumers if offered clear choice prefer fresh foods of domestic origin thereby strengthening demand and prices for them moreover proponentsincluding producer groups like the national farmers union and rcalf usa rancherscattlemen action legal fund united stockgrowers of america and consumer advocacy organizationsargued that us consumers have right to know the origin of their food particularly at time when us food imports are increasing and whenever particular health and safety problems arise they cited as one prominent example concerns about the safety of some foreign beef arising from the discoveries of bse in number of canadi anborn cows and two us cows since 2003 supporters of the cool law argued that it was unfair to exempt meats and produce from the longstanding country labeling already required of almost all other imported consumer products from automobiles to most other foods they also noted that many foreign countries already imposed their own countryoforigin labeling opponents of mandatory coolwhich included the american meat institute representing many in the packing industry the food marketing institute representing many retail stores and producer groups like the national cattlemens beef association and national pork producers councilcountered that studies do not provide ev idence that consumers want such labeling they asserted that cool is thinly disguised trade barrier intended to increase importers costs and to foster the unfounded perception that imports may be inherently less safe or of lower quality than us products some argued that food safety problems could as likely originate in domestic supplies as in imports as evidenced by the many dozens of recalls of us meat and poultry products announced by usda in 2006 and 2007 alone opponents pointed out that all food imports already must meet equivalent us safe ty standards enforced by us officials at the border and overseas scientific principles not geography must be the arbiter of safety industry implementation and recordkeeping costs earlier estimated by usda to be as high as 39 billion in the first year and 458 million per year after that would far outweigh any economic benefits critics added noting that the 2002 law did not cover red meats that are processed or sold in 18 the 2002 cool provision also covered seafood fruits and vegetables and peanuts 19 ams which is responsible for

resolving some of the longstanding differences between cool supporters and opponents the final law continues to direct that cool be implemented on its current schedulestarting october 1 2008 it also extends cool to goat meat and to chicken which competes with red meats in the market and which unlike red meats primarily is domestically produced along with ginseng pecans and macadamia nuts furthermore the 2008 farm law creates several new types of label categories intended to facilitate and simplify compliance for the meat and poultry industries and for others for example cool continues to limit use of the usa country of origin for covered meats only to items from animals that were exclusively born raised or slaughtered in the united states with narrow exception for those animals present here before july 15 2008 for multiple countries of origin retailers may designate such meat products as being from all of the countries in which the animals may have been born raised or slaughtered for meat from animals imported for immediate slaughter the retailer must cite both the exporting country and the united states products from animals not born raised or slaughtered in the unit ed states must designate the country of origin ground meat products shall include list of all co untries of origin or all reasonably possible countries of origin other key provisions are to ease industry recordkeeping requirements for audit verification purposes and to lower the pena lties for failure to comply with cool but extend their application to suppliers as well as retailers for example usda could not require persons to maintain cool records that are in ad dition to records kept during the normal course of business 21

national production in creasing from 18 billion gallons in 2001 to 65 billion gallons in 2007 corn accounts for about 98 of the feedstocks currently used in ethanol production in the united states usda estimated in may 2008 that more than 21 billion bushels of corn or 20 of the 2006 corn crop were used to produce ethanol during the september 2006 to august 2007 corn marketing year this percentage was expected to rise to 23 in the thencurrent marketing year and again to 33 in the next year 28 corn has traditionally represented about 57 of feed concentrates and processed feedstuffs fed to animals in the united states29 as cornbased ethanol production increases so do total corn demand and corn prices dedicating an increasing share of the us corn harvest to ethanol production could lead to higher prices for all grains and oilseeds that compete for the same land resulting in higher feed costs for cattle hog and poultry producers in february 2008 usda projected us livestock feed costs for 2008 at record 45 billion up nearly 7 billion or over 18 from the previous years record meanwhile usda projected that wholesale prices for nearly all livestock product categories with

programs assist biofuels research and infrastructure development supply distortions could develop in proteinmeal markets related to expanding production of the ethanol processing byproduct distillers dried gr ains ddg which averages about 30 protein content and can substitute in certain feed and meal markets while ddg use would substitute for some of the lost feed value of corn used in ethanol processing about 66 of the original weight of corn is consumed in producing ethanol and is longer available for feed further not all livestock species are well adapted to dramatically increased consumption of ddg in their rationsdairy cattle appear to be best suited to expanding ddgs share in feed rations poultry and pork are much less able to adapt ddg must be dried before it can be transported long distances adding to feed costs there may be some potential for largescale livestock producers to relocate near new feed sources but such relocations would likely have important regional economic effects tufts university study has offered another perspective on feed prices noting any discussion of todays high prices should take into account the extent to which these same firms ie leading us meat companies have benefitted from many years of feed that was priced well below what it cost to produce in the nine years that followed the passage of the 1996 farm bill including the first several years of the 2002 farm bill 19972005 corn was priced 23 below average production costs while soybean prices were 15 below farmers costs the authors of the study concluded this resulted in substantial savings to the poultry and hog industries and an implicit subsidy over the nine years of 115 billion to the broiler industry and 85 billion to what the authors termed industrial hog operations thus the leading firms gained great deal during those years from us agricultural policies that helped lower the prices for many agricultural commodities 31 30 according to the world bank among other international institutions increased biofuel production has been one of the principal causes of the dramatic rise in food pricesalmost all of the increase in global corn production from 2004 to 2007 the period when grain prices rose sharply went for biofuels production in the united states bush administration officials have disputed this assertion arguing that only 3 of the more than 40 rise in world food prices in 2008 has been due to increased demand on corn for ethanol see usda officials briefing with reporters on the case for food and fuel usda may 18 2008

agriculture committees however the committees did include in their farm bills incentives for the development of other types of renewable fuels besides cornbased ethanol such as cellulosic ethanol production and they expanded research and conservationrelated policy options separate provisions drafted by the congressional taxwriting committees and included under title xv of the new farm bill contain reduction in the ethanol blenders tax credit of 51 cents per gallon it is to be 45 cents per gallon for calendar 2009 and thereafter although the credit reduction would be delayed if usda and epa determined that annual ethanol production andor imports did not reach 75 billion gallons including cellulosic ethanol on the other hand the 54cent per gallon import tariff on ethanol was extended for two more years through calendar 2010 for more detailed information on energy and conservationrelated provisions adopted in the house and senate farm bills see crs report crs report rl34696 the

recent years to help mitigate the financial losses experienced by crop farmers as result of natural disastersa federal crop insurance program and emergency disaster loans generally livestock losses are eligible for federal loans but have not been eligible for federal crop insurance except under several pilot programs offered in certain geographic areas by usdas risk management agency rma for example rma enables some producers to purchase income insurance protection against losses of pasture rangeland and forage 32 separately congress has provided supplemental assistance on an ad hoc basis for crop and livestock losses due to drought or other natural disasters through various emergency supplemental assistance programs33 the federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized and hence does not require periodic reauthorization in an omnibus farm bill however modifications to the crop insurance program were discussed in the context of th omnibus 20072008 farm bill some policymakers expressed strong interest in expanding the crop insurance program andor complementing it with permanent disaster payment program others viewed the crop insurance program as potential target for cost reductions with savings used to fund new initiatives in various titles of the farm bill 32 see usda rma pasture rangeland forage pilot insurance programs factsheet revised october 2007

for crop years 20082011 timated by cbo to cost 38 billion over the period of the five new programs under which payments could be made are three relating to livestock the livestock indemnity program making payments based on 75 of fair market value of livestock that die in excess of normal mortality rates due to adverse weather the livestock forage disaster program providing assistance to ranchers with forage losses due to drought with eligibility requirements and payments based on formula in the new law and emergency assistance for livestock honey bees and farmraised fish making available total of up to 50 million from the trust fund for emergency relief to producers of these animals with losses due to adverse weather or other conditions

livestock and poultry operations have drawn congressional attention as animal agriculture increasingly concentrates into larger more intensive production units interest arises about impacts on the environment including surface water groundwater soil and air some environmental laws specifically exempt agriculture from regulatory provisions and some are designed so that farms escape most if not all of the regulatory impact the primary regula tory focus for large feedlots is the clean water act 33 usc 1251 et seq since contaminants from manure if not properly managed also affect both water quality and human health operations that emit large quantities of air pollutants may be subject to clean air act 42 usc 74017671q regulation in addition concerns about applicability of superfund the comprehe nsive environmental response compensation and liability act the superfund law 42 usc 96019675 to livestock and poultry operations are of growing interest 34
