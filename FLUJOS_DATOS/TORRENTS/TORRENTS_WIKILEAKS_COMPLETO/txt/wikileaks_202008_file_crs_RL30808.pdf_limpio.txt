outlays more than doubling between1970 and1975 and more than tripling through the 1970s this increased spending was due primarily to congressional implementation of the legislati ve reorganization act of 1970 which increased the budgets and staffs of congressional committees and support agencies the creation of the house and senate budget committees and the congressional budget office in 1974 and funding for the development of house and senate computer capabilities during the 1970s and 1980s also account for increases in contrast with executive branch spending growth of spending in the legislative branch has been steady across all organizational units and following the decadelong upgrade of institutional capacity in the 1970s the 1980s and 1990s were characterized by steady

and library of congresslevels were characterized by modest steady growth this pattern gave way to sharper increase in congressional staff throughout the 1970s pursuant to implementation of the 1970 legislative reorganization act by the 1980s legislative branch employment was essentially flat stabilizing at post reorganization levels considerably higher than those seen before the reorganization act the early 1990s were characterized by significant downward turn in staffing levels and the emergence of what may be another period of stability at the end of the decade congressional staff growth accounts for greater part of the overall increase in legislative branch employment than does congressional agency staff growth in 1960 6866 people were assigned to member committee and other congressional offices congressional agencies employed 156518 by 1969 those numbers had increased to 10721 and 18112 respectively an increase of 3855 or 5615 in congressional staff and 2461 or 1572 in agency staff this disproportionate growth continued throughout the 1970s during the 1980s legislative branch employees were effectively evenly divided between congressional staff and congressional agency staff in the 1990s both congressional staff and agency staff numbers declined significantly but the decline was higher for agency staff at 1909 than the 1296 congressional staff downturn thus

iii judgeships from 1950 to the present has been much less than the rate of increase in the total number of employees in the federal judicial system during the same period leading authority on the judiciarys growth writing in 1995 observed that article iii judges had become by that point diminishing fraction of the total employees of the federal court system this shrinkage he said began well before 1960 accelerated between 1970 and 1975 and continues unabated to this day18 the dramatic increase in the federal judicial workforce over the past half century has coincided with an increasing number of claims that must be heard in federal courts this trend was underscored in recent budget request to congress in which the judiciary noted that over the past 20 years congress had enacted more than 200 new laws many creating new federal crime s as new criminal defendants and releasees from prison continued to increase the judiciary noted increased demands were placed on the federal courts 7500 probation and pretrial service program officers requiring according to the judiciary further increase in their numbers19 besides article iii judges thousands of other federal employees perform in judicial or judgelike roles but are not regarded as being part of the federal judicial workforce most notable among these are administrative law judges who are appointe d by and work with federal

legislative activities of congress popular measure is the number of bills enacted into law as table 7 demonstrates however the number of public bills so enacted reveals particular upward or downward trend over the last 50 years21 other measures such as private bills enacted into law and the total number of measures introduced reveal more consistent patterns of change takenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30808crs14 together they offer mixed picture of legislative activity several trends stand out including decrease in both the number of measures introduced and the number of private bills enacted into law also of note is the increase in the volume of the record of proceedings which has grown even as legislative productivity has declined after sharp increase from the 1950s to the 1960s there has been since the mid 1970s steady decline in the number of bills and joint resolutions introduced the decline in public bills in the 1980s is largely due to change in house rules allowing multiple sponsors cospon sors of bills the number of cosponsors allowed on an individual bill was once so severely limited that many members introduced identical versions of popular proposals in addition to fewer measures introduced there has been sharp drop in the number of private laws enacted over the last 50 years the decline in private laws enacted cannot be traced to specific rule change but rather to broad changes in immigration and government claims law through which congress has delegated some of its authority on matters that affect individuals to executive branch agencies for resolution while these data suggest general decline in legislative productivity they also chart steady rise in the record of legislative proceedings indicating an upturn in the attention given to legislative matters the 84th congress 1955 through1956 enacted 637 public and 759 priva bills into law the proceedings of those efforts were recorded in 27723 pages of the congressional record four decades later the 105th congress 1997 through 1998 passed almost 1000 fewer bills yet the proceedings required almost twice as many pages of the congressional record to chronicle these data offer picture of legislative activity but they should not be taken as definitive reliable determination of congressional workloads statistics detailing legislative productivity do not directly illuminate all facets of work carried out by member of congress because they fail to account for time and effort spent carrying out legislative and oversight activity at the committee level representatio nal duties carried out in washington dc and home districts and constituent services carried out through member offices even though these activities are likely to take up more of members working time than legislative activity they are often interrelated and carried out simultaneously which causes difficulty in quantifying this activity in widely accepted manner thus while

become primarily criminal courts of appeals more than half the total docket now consists of criminal or prisoner cases30 the 7374 cases that the supreme court disposed of during its october 1999 term were record number reflecting steady increase in the annual number of cases brought over the preceding five decades and dwarfing the courts caseload level of almost half century earlier1202 cases disposed of in 1950 this longterm growth in caseload one scholar notes reflected in the 1950s and 1960s the development of interest groups that assisted litigants in carrying litigation through the courts massive growth in the activities of the federal government which produced new laws and legal questions and the courts considerable sympathy to challenges to government action based on alleged violations of civil liberties31 after slower rate of caseload growth in the 1970s through the mid1980s second period of rapid growth took place thereafterwith 7374 cases disposed of in the 1999 term representing an 80 increase over the 4103 cases disposed of in 1985 this new rise in cases was entirely in papers petitions the bulk coming from prisoners or criminal defendantsdespite recent rulings by the court and laws passed by congress to limit the use of habeas corpus actions to challenge criminal convictions32 another notable trend was that beginning in the late 1980s the courts justices reduced the volume of cases they decided on the merits by the courts 1999 term its annual number of cases accepted and the number decided with full signed opinions had declined by about half compared

many of these programs focused on minority and disadvantaged populations the great society initiative accounted for the largest increase in federal outlays for grants during the second half of the

federal funds the only period in which the grantsinaid system has not grown was during the early 1980s congress and president ronald reagan created several block grants and reduced the amount spent on grant outlays this halt in the growth of the grantinaid system was brief by the late 1980s the number of programs and amount of outlays was again increasing arguably the most significant change in the

statutory basis for federal postwar procurement enacted in 1949 the federal property and administrative services act established the general services administration gsa to procure supplies and

the number and size of committees and subcommittees can be explained primar ily by the major congressional reorganization acts periodic rules changes party caucus reforms and informal changes to meet emerging needs and demands the development of todays committee system is the product of internal congressional reforms but national forces also have played role the great depression and world war ii greatly expanded the legislative agenda and inspired the legislative reorganization act of 1946 from which the modern congress is customarily dated42 outside forces also spurred second bicameral reorganization act 24 years later new complex policy areas an increasingly dominant executive branch and low opinion polls were cited by supporters of the legislative reorganization act of 197043 the

subcommittees reflects the federal governments expansion into new policy areas efforts to dispe rse committee leadership authority and attempts to foster specialization since the mid1970s periodic reforms have reversed the earlier trend of increasing subcommittees in 1977 the recommendations of the stevensonbrock committee led to reduction of about onefift h of the number of subcommittees from 122 to 96 the figure rose somewhat in the 1980s partly because the select committee on small business was elevated to standing committee the number of senate committees and subcommittees and

relatively little change yet within that structure congress through legislation has made various important modifications creating several new courts of specialized jurisdiction to supersede already existing courts splitting one geographically large court of appeals into two circuits and creating one appellate court of special subject matter jurisdiction within the circuit court of appeals system table 14 shows that half century ago the federal trial courts consisted of 91 us district courts having jurisdiction to hear nearly all categories of federal cases including both civil and criminal matters today there are 94 federal judicial districts including at least one district in each state the district of columbia and puerto rico three territories of the united statesthe virgin islands guam and the northern mariana islandsalso have district courts that hear federal cases including bankruptcy cases httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30808crs28 besides trial courts of general subject matter jurisdiction the federal system historically has included various special trial courts having nationwide jurisdiction over certain types of cases in 1950 these included the us customs court having jurisdiction in actions arising under the tariff acts in 1980 congress reconstituted this court as the us court of international trade when it passed the customs court act to implement broad judicial review powers enacted into law in the trade agreements act year earlier shortly thereafter in 1982 congress established the us claims court which succeeded the former court of claims in having jurisdiction over claims seeking money judgments against the united states in 1992 congress changed the name of the court to the us court of federal claims also half century ago the federal appellate court system consisted of 11 geographical circuits 10 denominated numerically as the first through the tenth with the other being the district of columbia circuit today there 12 regional courts of appeals the first through the eleventh plus the dc circuit each of which hears appeals from the district courts located within its circuit as well as appeals from federal administrative agencies the increase in geographical circuits from 11 to 12 occurred in 1980 when congress passed legislation to divide the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit made up of alabama florida georgia louisiana mississippi and texas into two circuits pursuant to the legislation the new fifth circuit is made of up of louisiana mississippi and texas while new eleventh circuit consists of alabama florida and georgia more recently in 1997 the senate passed legislation to split the nation s largest geographic judicial circuit the ninth into two circuits but that effort failed completion in the house of representatives the federal appellate court system also includes court of appeals for the federal circuit which congress established in 1982 this court has nationwide jurisdiction to hear appeals in specialized cases such as those involving patent laws and cases decided by the court of international trade and the court of federal claims upon its creation it succeeded the former us court of customs and patent appeals and assumed the appellate functions of the us court of claims during the last half century congress passed legislation as well creating other specialized federal courts outside the primary federal appellate and trial court system in 1969 legislation was enacted creating the us tax court which has jurisdiction to try controversies involving deficiencies or overpayments in income estate and gift taxes in 1988 congress statutorily created the us court of veterans appeals renaming it the us court of appeals for veterans claims in 1998 giving it exclusive

types of ongoing planning evaluation and reporting requirements for executive branch agencies strategic plans covering six years but revised at least every three years annual performance plans and annual reports on program performance in complying with gpra agencies must set goals devise performance measures and then assess results achieved gpra represents the latest in series of initiatives taken over the past 50 years attempting to link budget levels with expected results so that spending decisions can be better aligned with anticipated performance this general perspective is commonly referred to as performance budgeting and should be viewed as an evolving rather than as static approach64 in the aftermath of world war ii the hoover commission on organization of the executi ve branch of the government charged with promoting economy efficiency and improved services in the executive branch included among over 270 recommendations call for performance budgeting in the federal government some of these recommendations were reflected in the budget and accounting procedures act of 1950 and led to permanent changes in the presentation of the presidents budget submission such as obligations by activities tables65 in the 1960s the planningprogrammingbudgetingsystem ppbs was introduced in the defense department and subsequently was mandated for governmentwide application by

by march 31 2001 and recommend whether performance budgeting in the more extensive form seen in the pilots should be implemented throughout the federal government progress in gpra implementation has proved uneven to date some agencies have yet to define adequately their goals program objectives and expected outcomes and results and to develop appropriate measures to gauge their attainment there are concerns about the costs and benefits of developing new resultsoriented performance measurement systems about the lack of interagency coordination to use similar measures to compare similar programs and about the need to link results act implementation to the everyday work of program mangers despite such unsettled issues it is well to keep in mind that gpra differs in important respects from past efforts at performance management and budgeting previous formulations such as ppbs and zbb were executive branch initiatives in contrast gpra has statutory base with its requirements set in

36developments restraints chadha decision to control the actions of the president and executive officers congress established arrangements whereby socalled legislative veto could be exercised over delegated authority while various legislative veto arrangements were created typically they mandated that the executive branch notify congress of proposed action and then wait for specified period of time usually 60 to 90 days before actual implementation during the waiting period congress could veto the proposed action by majority vote in both houses or in one house or by majority vote of single committee although the legislative veto has some precedents in the period following the civil war it came into prominence in the 1930s and the subsequent decades the economy act of 1932 for example authorized the president to propose limited reorganizations of the executive branch75 reorganization proposal embodied in an executive order had to be transmitted to congress for 60day review period if neither house by majority vote disapprov ed the proposal it could then become effective at the close of the review period president herbert hoover had asked congres s for similar reorganization arrangement in 1929 and his first chance to exercise the authority given him in 1932 occurred after his electoral defeat that year congress disapproved his proposals for changes in 58 governmental activities preferring to leave any such reorganizations to the incoming president franklin d roosevelt nonetheless the legislative veto arrangement was seen to offer advantages to both the executive and the legislative branches the president obtained fixed timeframe of relatively short duration before his proposals might become effective and oftenti mes under terms which prohibited any amendment of his offerings congress retained control of delegated authority throug h an arrangement far less cumbersome than passing legislation which might incur presid ential veto and therefore require twothirds majority in each house to override executive reorganization arrangements continued to make use of the legislative veto over the next few years with slight variations from the 1932 model 1939 version for example substituted reorganization plan for the executive order and twohouse veto for the onehouse disapproval76 the innovation also was introduced in few other areas such as military and

funds over the years congress has struggled with the challenge of mainta ining some control over impoundment actions while still allowing sufficient discretion for the executive branch in implementing the budget conflicts over the use of impoundments increased greatly during the nixon administration and eventually involved the courts as well as congress and the president during these impoundment conflicts congress responded with not only ad hoc efforts to restore individual programs but also gradual ly more restrictive appropriations language arguably the most authoritative response was enactment in 1974 of the impoundment control act ica which established new framework for congressional review of impoundment actions89 the ica differentiates deferrals or temporary delay in funding availability from rescissions or permanent cancellations of designated budget authority with different procedures for congressional review and control of the two types of impoundments in the case of rescission the ica provides that the funds must be released unless both houses of congress take action to approve the presidents rescission request within 45 days of continuous session for the first few years after its enactment there was little criticism of the ica but dissatisfaction grew in the 1980s as the number of rescissions requested by the president increased greatly while the number approved by congress declined90 many came to view the president as unduly restricted by the provis ions in the ica and sought to restore greater flexibility in impoundments so as to facilitate budgetary savings some supported constitutional amendment to grant the president authority to veto individual items in bill as allowed to the governor in 42 states and consideration of impoundment reform became increasingly joined with the subject of an item veto however legislative efforts to modify the framework for congressional review of rescissions by the president ultimately proved successful with the enactment of the line item veto act of 199691 the line item veto act sought to provide the president with functional equivalent of an item veto by granting the president enhanced

cancellations contained in special presidential messages consequently the burden of action with regard to rescissions was reversed from that contained in the impoundment control act absent congressional action under the line item veto act rescissions requested by the president became permanent in 1998 the supreme court found the line item veto act unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the presentment clause92 subsequently measures seeking to provide the president with expanded rescission authority by amending the impoundment control act in constitutionally viable manner were introduced in congress the institutional tensions between the executive and legislative branches inherent in the federal budget process continue and additional efforts to modify the existing framework for congressional review of impoundment actio ns by the president as established by the ica in 1974 may occur unfunded mandates achieving balance of power between the federal government and the states has been an issue of debate since the founding of the republic and ratification of the us constitution by the statesfrom 1787 through 1790 increased federal intervention in domestic policy since the end of world war ii particularly in the 1960s through the great society initiatives of the johnson admi nistration arguably resulted in decline in state sovereignty federal legislation and regulations preempted state authority in such areas as civil rights environmental and consumer protection and community development and required that specific actions be taken by state and local governments for citizens unable to achieve redress at the state or local level such federal involvement was welcome for advocates of state sovereignty however the federal government in some areas had become too intrusive and powerful in imposing requirements often without providing funds to help state and local governments meet those requirements beginning in the late 1970s some academics and state and local officials argued that certain federal mandates had become unnecessary and costly however the issue of federal intervention had already reached the supreme court which ruled in 1976 that the commerce clause of the constitution does not empower congress to impose federal regulation of the states traditional governmental functions93 debate continued however and the issue again reached the supreme court in 1985 reversing itself the court held that states should instead seek relief from federal regulation through the political process in congress the political process ensures that laws that undu ly burden states will not be promulgated94 subsequently the states advocates turned to congress for mandate reliefhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30808crs40 95109 stat 48 962 usc 658ba2

executive order vs statutory policymaking although the constitution does not explicitly and specifical ly authorize the president to issue executive orders presidents have relied upon article ii executive power commander in chief authority and responsibility for faithful execution of the laws to justify issuance of executive orders99 two scholars have contended that the ambiguity surrounding

related to securing the release of americans held hostage in iran and providing them financial compensation on more routine basis transition and reelection periods have witnessed an increase in the number of executive orders study of executive orders issued between april 1936 and december 1995 indicates that while the start of new presidents term does not result in higher number of executive orders the end of term may be notable for an increase in the quantity issued103 specifically presidents who were succeeded by member of the other party signed nearly six additional orders in the last month of their term nearly double the average level104 when party control of the white house did not change following presidential election there was corresponding increase in order frequency105 this study also found that reelection plays role in the number of executive orders signed and issued presidents who were running for reelection issued approximately 14 more executive orders per month14

12889 president william j clinton helped to implement the north american free trade agreement presidential use of executive orders has not gone unnoticed or unchallenged particularly in cases where the contents and purpose of an order are objectionable and presidential encroachment on congressional legislative powers is alleged107 there are various means by which the effect if not the contents of an executive order can be altered or voided through congres sional action or initiative judicial ruling or subsequent presidential action should congress object to an executive order it might deny funds necessary to implement the order or if constitutional authority is cited for the order congress could alter the underlying statute in such way as to undermine the order another option but one that has been tried with very little success is to write statute designed to overturn an executive order between 1973 and 1997 when approximately 1000 executive orders were issued congress attempted to pass legislation on 37 occasions that would overturn certain orders but only three attempts succeeded and became law108 if proactive approach were preferred congress could include sunset provision in legislation or write more specific legislation which would limit the presidents opportunities and latitude in issuing executive orders tactic that has failed to date is passing legislation designed to restrict the presidents use of executive orders andor make it easier for congress to monitor that between 1973 and 1997 congress tried three times and failed in each attempt to pass legislation restricting the presidents power to issue executive orders during the 106th congress three bills and one concurrent resolution aimed at limiting the presidents use of executive orders andor their

expanded reflection at least in part of the increasing program responsibilities and tasks of the federal government during that period and continued reliance upon career civil servants for their performance attempts to reduce the size and cost of the federal government during the final decade of the twentieth century prompted calls for contracting out or outsourcing certain government

projects was the china lake experiment undertaken at two naval weapons laboratories in california begun in the spring of 1980 the project simplified the systems for classifying jobs hiring promoting and paying personnel used pay for performance in the framework of broad pay bands and increased the discretion of managers to manage the workforce it was made permanent in 1994 the results at china

the participants agreed on aspects of broad vision of the future including these central agency that enables agencies especially managers to fulfill the personnel function for themselves treating human resources as an asset and an investment and labormanagement partnership based on mutual goals of successful organization and employee satisfaction149 one scholar provided some cautionary advice about the road to administrative reform the most fundamental point to be made is that reform of the public sector is political exercise that is rarely if ever informed unambiguously by organization theory in the public sector politics and ideology continue to play crucial role in the selection of the mechanisms that are supposed to make government in the words of vice president gore work better and cost less150 another scholar expressed an enduring principle the fundamental purpose of government management remains what it has been since 1789 the implementation of the laws passed by congress151httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30808crs54 15267 stat 145 153us commission on intergovernmental relations the commission on intergovernmental relations report to the president for transmitt to the

realignment of federal and subnational authority reserve national action for residual participation where state and local governments are not fully adequate and for the continuing responsibilities that only the national government can undertake154 four years later in 1959 congress established permanent agencythe advisory commission on intergovernmental relations acir bipartisan body of 26 members representing federal state and local governmentsand charged it with monitoring and reporting to congress on the growing complexities of intergovernmental relations and the state of american federalism155 the commission was terminated in 1995 as an economy initiative the creation of the acir came on the cusp of two significant periods in american federalism during the 20th century the first of these lasting from 1901 to 1960 has been called the era of cooperative federalism and was characterized by widening federal involvement in social economic and environmental policy it was during this era that the national income tax and the grantinaid system were mandated indeed the federal grant system which expanded in response to the great depression of the 1930s fundamentally changed the power relationships between federal and state governments the second or subsequent period from 1960 to 1968 has been denominated as the era of creative federalism president lyndon b johnsons great society program s were the embodiment of this era creative federalism and great society programs including the war on poverty sought to expand the national governments role in an effort to achieve socially desirable outcomes prior to the johnson administration federal involvement in domestic policy was undertaken as necessary evil in order to legitimize intrusion into state and local

as long as congress could establish national purpose for its actions during the past 32 years the roles of national state and local governments have fluctuated as the courts the executive branch congress state and local governments and the electorate have sought to determine their appropriate status within the system of federalism this era of contemporary federalism from 1970 to the present has been characterized by shifts in the intergovernmental grant systemfrom categorical grants to revenue sharing then to block and performance grants the evolving awareness of the fiscal impact of unfunded federal mandates on state and local governments which culminated in the passage of the unfunded mandates act of 1995156 debates over the federal preemption of state authoritythe most recent infractions according to state and local government officials occurring with the passage of the telecommunications act of 1996 and the intern et tax freedom act of 1998157 the growth of federal regulation and subsequent efforts to reduce the federal regulatory burden on states and local governments which culminated in the passage of the federal financial assistance improvement act of 1999158 the emergence of the states as laboratories of innovation in such areas as economic development as illustrated by the enactment of state enterprise zone legislation by 36 states well before the passage of similar federal legislation159 and the movement to devolve greater authority to state and local governments in the name of the new federalism the temporary assistance to needy families act of 1996 being the most recent notable example160 during the 1970s presidents richard m nixon and gerald r ford sought to redirect power relations within the federal system using principally revenue

regarded by many as defender of states rights coupled with the american people s growing dissatisfaction with the national government revived and elevated the federalism debate after lull during the presidency of jimmy carter president reagan sought not merely to reform the federalism system at the edges but also to pursue fundamental restructuring of the system through policies and initiatives to strengthen the role of states in his 1981 inaugural address he stated that the federal government did not create states the states created the feder government this statement expressed the sentiments found first in the virginia and kentucky resolution of 1798 and the websterhayne debate of 1830 which championed such ideas as statecentered federalism state sovereignty and the doctrine of nullification161 the reagan administration achieved some success early in its first term with the omnibus budget reconcilia tion act which consolidated number of revenue sharing programs into nine block grants162 the administration was not successful in the second phase of its new federalism initiative which would have reallocated federal and state responsibility and resources for welfare food stamps and medicare and would have turned back revenue sources to the states during the 1990s congress and the executive branch continued to debate the limits of federalism and the role of the federal state and local governments the 1994 elections brought the republicans majority status in the house of representatives after they had campaigned in part on promise to reduce the size and reach of the federal government the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 discussed earlier in this report requires the congressional budget office cbo to identify unfunded federal mandates in any legislation reported from committee if the mandate total exceeds 50 million in the case of state and local government or 100 million in the case of the private sector the act also requires cbo to assess the costbenefit impact of federal legislation containing unfunded federal mandates on state and local governments and on the private sector on several issues the partys leadership took positions contrary to its long held state sovereignty orthodoxy for instance republican controlled congress supported the internet tax freedom act which usurped state taxing authority over internet transa ctions for their part democrats through the presidency of william clinton sought to reduce red tape and make the federal governm ent more responsive to citizen needs the clinton administrations national performance review sought to achieve management efficiencies throughout federal agencies and programs president clinton also sought to affirm the primacy of the national governm ent in eo 13083 of may 4 1998 concerning federalism163 the order noted the supremacy of the federal government and espoused set of principles that many state and local officials felt subordinated the importance of the states as coequal partners rebuffed in this attempt by state and local governments and the republican controlled congress president clintonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30808crs57 164see 3 cfr 1999 comp pp

federalism implications164 during the last half of the 20th century the supreme court also played major role in interpreting the powers duties and responsibilities conferred on national and state governments by the united states constitution its noteworthy decisions concerning federalism include national league of cities v usery in which the court addressed one of the fundamental issues in federalism to what extent may congress impose upon the sovereignty of the states in its 1976 ruling the court found that 1974 amendments to the fair labor standards act extending hour and wage coverage to state and local public employees violated state sovereignty as protected by the 10th amendment165 nine years later in garcia v san antonio metropolitan transit auth ority the court revisited the issue of state sovereignty and federally imposed requirements on state and local government holding that the 10th amendment does not protect state and local governments from compliance with the fair labor standards act the court also declared that the states must find redress from congressiona l actions through the political or legislative process and not the judiciary166 in federalismrelated cases decided during the final decade of the 20th centuryseveral of them decided by narrow margins including new york v united states in 1992 united states v lopez in 1995 and seminole tribe of florida v florida in 1996the court in the view of some scholars took more activist role in limiting the power of the federal government and narrowing its interpretation of the commerce clause in favor of the states in new york v united state s the court declared unconstitutional provisions of the low level radioactive waste policy amendments act of 1985 and found that the federal government could not compel states to establish sites for the disposal of nonfederal radioactive waste generated by businesses within their borders167 in united states v lopez the court ruled that the drug free school zone act of 1990 could not be justified under the constitutions commerce clause and was therefore unconstitutional168 in 1996 in the seminole tribe of florida case the court found unconstitutional provision in the indian gaming regulatory act of 1988 that gave tribes the right to sue states in federal court to compel good faith negotiations in establishing compact between the states and indian tribes allowing the tribes to undertake gambling activities the court ruled that allowing tribes to sue states in federal court was unconstitutional because

fundamental principles of federalism he argued that there exists federal right to citizenship with which the states may not interfere171 the federalism debate of the past 50 years borrows much from the earlier debates during the infancy of the republic the federalism pendulum during the latter half of the 20th century has moved from favoring strong role for the national gove rnment toward being
