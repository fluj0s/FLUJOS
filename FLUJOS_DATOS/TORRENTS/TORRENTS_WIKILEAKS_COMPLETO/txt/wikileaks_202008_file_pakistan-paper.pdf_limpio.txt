restricted restricted 1security challenges of 21st century regional and national perspective pakistan 1 i consider it singular honour and privilege to be invited to 8th asean regional forum meeting to discuss enhancing strategic studies to meet the challenges of 21st century i will be speaking on security challenges of the 21st century and present pakistani perspective in south asia n context it is complex and multi dimensional topic and it would be presumptuous of to pretend that i can present co mprehensive assessment of the security issues facing the south asian region all that i would attempt to do is to outline the co ntours of the secu rity challenges that south asia faces in general and pakistan in particular 3 pakistan as indeed south asia face host of security challenges that include territorial disputes poor economic performance high population growth scarcity of resources such as water energy food etc terrorism poor governance corruption etc i will however restrict myself to the challenges threatening peace in the region rise of fundamentalism leading to terrorism low economic growth and issues emerging in post 911 period restricted restricted 24 let begin by introducing my country pakistan is located in south asia and is bordered by iran in the west afghanistan in the west and northwest china in the north and india in the east narrow wakhan finger 730 miles wide separates it from tajikistan the strategic strait of hormuz lies close to its border in the southwest history and culture binds it to south asia while its islamic faith and values tie it with muslim countries of the middle east and north africa its 150 million population makes it the 6th most populous state in the world and it is the second largest muslim country it has the 7th largest military in the world which is armed with nuclear and ballistic missiles mr paul wolfowitz us deputy defence secretary told the house armed services committee recently that pakistans military is the most important instrument of influence1 5 pakistan serves as link between middle east north africa and central asia to the west and northwest and south asia and asia to the east with capacity to affect regional and international stability yale iversity historian paul kennedy regards pakistan pivotal state pivotal state is the one that is so important regionally that its collapse would spell transboundary mayhem while its steady economic progress and stability would bolster its regions economic vita lity and political soundness and benefit regional trade and investment2 restricted restricted 36 historical pakistans perspective on security ever since its independence in 1947 has been dominated by its dispute over kashmir with its eastern neighbour the details of the dispute are well known to this august gath ering and needs further elucidation there are of cour the pakistani version and the indian version of the dispute and the two are poles apart without entering into blame game as to which is the guiltier party the sad truth is that the dispute has led to two full fledged military conflicts between them and major border skir mish in 1999 that had the potential of escalati ng into devastating nuclear conflagration in the region besi des we barely averted war just 2 years ago due to international mediation 7 the dispute is primarily responsible for debilitating arms race in the subco ntinent since 1947 the arms race continues unabated and there is likelihood of any let up till the kashmir dispute is resolved for the dispute to be resolved both sides need to display patien ce and forbearance an d move away from their maximal positions and only then an acceptable formula can be worked out statesmanship of the hi ghest order needs to be displayed by the leaders of both india and pakistan restricted restricted 48 the arms race an d instability in the region has stymied the economy and led to abject poverty in the region the economic performance4 of both india and pakistan are as displayed india pakistan rate of gd p growth 43 45 defence spending as of gdp 3 46 illiterate population 503 million 828 million population living below poverty 25 262 million 36 527 million 9 as is amply eviden t from this table high military expenditure has resulted in low rates of gdp growth and literacy which has led to high percentage of population living below the poverty line this has imposed severe restrictions on human development and resulted in limited social and economic opportunities and much human suffe ring in south asia according to the latest ilo report5 unemployment rate in south asia is around 17 million which is more than 13 of the total population of the region while another 30 population lives below the poverty line the conflict between india and pakistan is primarily responsible for this the undp human development report 20036 has given world ranking of 127 and 142 to india and pakistan respectively in the human developmen t index this restricted restricted 5indicates the effects of high military expenditu re by the two major south asian countries overall this provokes re sentment and discontent amongst the people wh ich leads to anger and violence 10 ladies and gentlemen this brings to the next challenge facing the region rise of fundamentalism leading to terrorism however this menace needs deeper analysis 11 as you all know afghanistan was invaded by the erstwhile soviet union in 1979 pakistan bore the main br unt of the chaos that followed over 3 million afghan refugees took shelter in pakistan while the afghans start ed resisting the soviet forces the resistance was declar ed jihad or holy war muslim youths were encouraged to come to pakistan from l over the world for training and then go to afghanistan to wage jihad pause mujahideen were supplied liberally with sophisticated weapons which enabled them to take he avy toll of the soviet forces unable to withstand these losses the soviet union withdrew form afghanistan in 1989 12 civil war broke out amongst th heavily armed afghan mujahideen soon after the soviet withdrawal and af ghan refugees refused to go back use of religion to wage war in afghanistan had let the religious g enie out of the bottle limited economic opportunities high rate of unemployment and low rate of literacy in pakistan coupled with jihadi teachings prevailing in the region restricted restricted 6at that time led to religious extremism presence of armed and battle hardened afghans and jihadi ements in pakistan inevitably resulted in vi olence and terrorism 13 in september 2001 pakistan joined the war against terrorism and provided invaluable support in the fight against terrorism general tommy franks in his book the american soldier has acknowledged that wi thout pakistans active support us could not have succeeded in launching operation enduring freedom against taliban pakistani forces are still battling qaida militants on pakist an afghan border as we ll as in its cities as i speak today pakistan is bearing the main brunt of alqaida terrorism president mu sharraf has survived two attempts on his life the prime minist er has barely escaped assassination attempt and its military commanders have been targeted in urban areas however i want to reiterate that majority of pakistanis are moderate muslims and support the gove rnment efforts it is only small misguided minority which has been driven to extremism on account of poverty lack of educ ation and economic opportunities the us defence secretary donald rumsfeld has recently stated that terrorists are being created fa ster than the us could kill which acknowledges the same facts thus to root out extremism and terrorism we need to long take longterm view of the problem we must continue the batt against extremists elements but at the same time we have to revive paki stans economy create jobs and restricted restricted 7provide justice and hope to the poor so that the breeding ground of the menace of terror ism is rooted out 14 now few words on the issue of nuclear proliferation the very idea that some rogue elements or fr inge groups could get hold of crude nuclear weapon or even dirty bomb remains nightmarish scenario the matter came to head when one of the leading pakistani nuclear scien tists was expose d as nuclear proliferator during the period 19 8999 pakistan reacted quickly against the errant scientist and took punitive measures against him and his associates though he got president ial pardon but the public humiliation of man of his status who was revered as national hero was considered suff icient i would like to draw distinction between the period wh command and control system did not exist and the period since 2000 todate when pakistan has in place fail safe measures including robust command and control mechanism to ensure that its strategic assets remain secure and chances of nuclear weapons or nuclear technology proliferation is reduce d to zero pakistans record since 2000 is impressive and i would like to hold out an assurance that proliferation has not occurred sinc then and will not take place in future restricted restricted 815 i would take this opportunity to talk about the custodial control of our nuclear weapons in pakistan custodial control has been established on multi layered concept at the national command authority and dedicate d secretariat responsible for safety and security s been developed in the form of strategic plans division its composition is as shown amongst other aspects of security robust personnel re liability programme induction of modern surveillan ce techniques and tight export control measures have ensured strict custod ial controls of our nuclear weapons handling of these weapon s cannot be undertaken by amateurs or novice s simply by read ing manual or after rudimentary training of semieducated zealots in the mountains without the essential components and sound technical expertise these wea pons cannot be employed in pakistan we have foolproof systems to ensure that various components remain in safe custody and cannot be taken away by wanted people our scientists are now accounted for and cannot be involved in any unlawful activities in future i want to ssure the house that our weapons are in safe custody the chances of their falling in the wrong hands does not arise restricted restricted 916 in the post 911 period the doctrines of preemption and regime change had set alarm bells ringing in south asia citing these doctrines india declared th at it had the right to launch preemptive strikes against paki stan to defend itself these statements were rightly rejected by us leaders since india faces none of the threats to its securi ty that us had faced which compelled it to resort to these doctrines so what is the way ahead 18 in my opinion the peace process currently underway between india and pakistan must continue and both countries need to show greater understanding of each others position on kashmir which is the core is sue between the two countries president musharraf has stated that if india took one step towards peace in kashmir pakistan will takes two steps that is the approach which is required for ju st solution of kashmir dispute this process requires flexibility and mutual trust however the process cannot cont inue forever 19 to develop trust and avoid mishaps we must undertake confidence building measures wh ich would develop tolerance and better understanding some measures are in place such as the exchange of information about military forces facilities and activities communications measures for use during crises ie hotlines at the ghq levels notification measures including restricted restricted 10advance notification of troop mo vements and exercises etc some other measures may be initiated to im prove the atmosphere of trust and promote better understanding such as track ii diplomacy preferential trade agreements trade fairs individual contacts intraregional transportation agreement cultural exchanges bilateral tourism etc at the same time it would be prudent to make regional forums such as saarc more effective for mutual consultations and benefit of the entir region 20 pakistans economy must be revived to reduce poverty and unemployment which will elimin ate the breeding grounds of extremism and terrorism for this pakistan requires the help of other countries which can be provided in the shape of foreign investment being pivotal state revi val of economy in pakistan will benefit the entire south asia region only the revival of our economy will eradicate the bree ding grounds of terrorism bombing and killing of terrorist s alone will not eliminate the scourge of terrorism it will at be st provide temporary reprieve and the menace will come back stronger than ever before 21 in order to reform the misg uided muslim youth president musharraf has given his vision for enlightened moderation he has urged the musl ims to undertake selfintrospection to determine who we are what do we stand for and what do we want we must face stark realities and avoid the path of confrontation which on ly lead to bloodshed pakistan is taking restricted restricted 11this path to achieve progres s and development for this we are concentrating on human resource velopment through poverty alleviation providing health and education and providing hope and justice to the people we are also workin g to rejuvenate organization for islamic countries oic to look fter the muslims collectively this will pacify ever yone and help achi eve the goal of peace worldwide and lead to progress and velopment 22 peace between india and paki stan would reap tremendous benefit for the entire region oil and gas pipeli nes between iran and energy rich centra l asian republics in the west and energy starved india east of pakistan would provide ergy at the lowest rate transit trade through pakistan woul d provide the shortest land route for trade between indi and west and central asia all this would become possible only af ter peaceful resolution of kashmir dispute 23 misgivings about the doctrine of preemption and regime change must be removed in sout h asia everyone in the region as indeed in the world is entitled to have guarantees to live in peace restricted restricted 1224 as i have argued in my paper terror groups proliferate in extreme poverty where injustice prevails national security can be compromised either through na ked external aggression or breakdown of law and order due to internal issues from within of the two factors internal issues have become more prominent in the 21st century which undermines the security of state alleviation of poverty therefore is the ke to enhancement of security in south asia in gene ral and pakistan in particular 25 since second world war many nations have generally resorted to military means to settl their disputes which in almost all cases has provided solution and in the barg ain bankrupted and impoverished the adversaries realiz ation appears to have dawned that conflict resolution of the bitterest disputes is best achieved through discussions and di alogues rather than through armed conflicts this is the silver lining i discern in the otherwise very dark clouds of insecurity around us and this is my final message to all of us and on this optimistic note i would like to end thank you for your patience restricted restricted 13 1 statement before the hous armed services committee
