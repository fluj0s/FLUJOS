dod fy2009 budget proposes to cancel the f136 alternate engine for the f35 joint strike fighter jsf program that was initiated by congress in the fy1996 defense authorization act and which has received consistent congressional support since its inception dod also proposed terminating the f136 in both its fy2007 and fy2008 budgets however congress rejected both of these proposals in fy1996

development program that includes flight qualification of an alternate engine in joint strike fighter airframe p33 since its inception in 1997 both dod and congress have funded 21 billion for the joint strike fighter alternate engine program the alternate engine program is expected to need an additional 13 billion through 2013 to complete the development of the f136 engine some have criticized dod and the air force for being shortsighted with its proposal to terminate the f136 alternate engine critics of the decision not to mention osd and the air force itself during testimony before congress note that it was driven more by immediate budget pressures on the department rather than long term pros and cons of the f136 engine program others applaud this decision and say that single

row to cancel the f136 alternate engine for the f35 joint strike fighter jsf the f136 engine is built by the gerolls royce gerr fighter engine team and is an alternate engine to the pratt whitney pwbuilt f135 pratt whitneys f135 engine is derivative of its f119 engine developed for and used on the f22 gerrs f136 is derivative of its f120 engine initially developed to compete with the f119 the alternate engine program was initiated by congress in the fy1996 defense authorization act and has received consistent congressional support since its inception2 the reason usually cited for this proposed cancellation is that it would save close to 2 billion over the future years defense plan fydp yet entail little operational risk some dod leaders however have expressed mixed feelings about the proposal to cancel the f136 and note that nearterm budget constraints are driving their actions on february 16 2006 then secretary of defense rumsfeld testified that the merits of terminating the f136 were clearly debatable3 on march 1 2006 air force secretary michael wynne testified that he was worried about the downstream effects of this decision4 again in 2008 both secretary wynne and general moseley air force chief of staff testified to their personal desire to keep the alternate engine program alive5 these statements may suggest that there is lack of consensus within dod

conference report to accompany hr 5658 p 228 10 at that time the jsf program was the joint advanced strike technology program called jast crs3 become known as the great engine war that ran from 1984 to 1994 the great engine war describes the competition between pratt whitney pw and general electric ge to produce engines the f100 and f110 respectively to power the air forces f16 falcon fighter aircraft11 this competition was held annually between 1984 and 1994 to produce and maintain these engines for the air force after 1994 pw and ge continued to compete for engine business among foreign air forces that operated the f16 and f15 at the time this acquisition strategy was unprecedented and controversial many extolled the advantages of competition and the benefits it conferred to dod and the taxpayer others however believed that the engine competition unjustifiably jeopardized combat effectiveness and pilot survivability12 the great engine wars roots extend well before 1984 in the development of the f100 engine for the f15 in the 1970s historians note air force frustrations with pratt whitneys management along with concerns about solesource engine powering their fighter fleet as the impetus for an alternate engine while the f100 was the most advanced engine ever developed at that time its rushed development to meet f15 initial fielding deadline prevented problems from being properly addressed in addition one report notes that the f100 engine was so powerful and the f15 so maneuverable that pilots began pushing the aircraft to the edge of the performance envelope in ways that stressed the engine far more than had been anticipated13 mounting frustrations over pratt whitneys reluctance to fully address the f100s shortcomings without additional funding resulted in the air force navy and congress working in concert to fund work on an alternate engine14 after number of contentious hearings in 1979 congress provided funding through the engine model derivative program emdp congressionally directed program of the 1960s for ge to develop its f101 alternate engine to become the f110 ultimately dod spent over 376 million to develop the f110 to compete with the f100 and 600 million to improve the f100s durability and reliability to make it stronger competitor proponents believe that the annual competition during the great engine war produced better engines on better terms for less money than would purchasing from single company facing competition recently contrary opinions have emerged and pratt and whitney notes that there is evidence that the f16 engine competition saved money15 however preponderance of the studies on the great engine war note that contractor responsiveness was the driving force behind the competition and not dollar savings 11 while the competition was the result of the air forces concerns with the reliability of the f100 in the new singleengine f16 ges f110 engine was also eventually used in the dual engine f15 12 robert w

have criticized dod as being penny wise and pound foolish in its proposal to terminate the f136 critics argue that this decision appears driven more by immediate budget pressures on the department rather than long term pros and cons of the f136 program for example secretary of the air force michael wynne reportedly said that the idea of cancelling the f136 came up during the qdr in the course of attempts to identify ways to save costs at the pentagon16 others applaud this decision and say that single source engine production contracts are the norm not the exception longterm engine affordability they claim is best achieved by procuring engines through multiyear contracts from single source congressional response in 2006 and early 2007 to the f136 termination proposal was both positive and negative those in favor of continued f136 development prevailed however both authorization and appropriations conferees included funds in fy2007 for continued f136 development strong language supporting the program and directed dod and other agencies to conduct independent analyses of potential f136 cost savings17 by march 2007 osds cost analysis improvement group the government accountability office and the institute for defense analyses had all completed their reports on the merits of the alternate engine program results summarized in the next section it appears that the administrations decision in fy2009 budget to terminate f136 is again influenced more by nearterm budgetary pressures than by the potential gains in the future the alternate engine program appears to be affected in budget considerations by the fact that its benefits wont be realized for decade while its costs are noteworthy and immediate congressionally mandated studies the 2007 national defense authorization act pl 109364 120 stat 2117 sec 211 directed osd and the comptroller general to conduct three independent costbenefit analyses on having an alternate engine for the f35 joint strike fighter section 211 also directed osd to continue funding the development and procurement of an alternate engine until the three directed reports were submitted and the congressional defense committees notified of any programmatic change each of these reports was conducted independently using the same data provided by the contractors and by the joint strike fighter program office osd cost

control of continued crs5 great engine wars the engine competition for the fa18 aircraft19 and the sole source pratt and whitney f119 engine for the f22 given their analysis of past cost performance stemming from competition the caig report noted their baseline assumptions were generally favorable to dual source case20 the caig assumed that the follower in this case the gerolls royce fighter engine team f136 would meet leader pratt whitney f135 pricing in 2014 first year of competition the caig also assumed that there would be both an immediate 5 price decrease and 5 increase in the rate for cost improvement what the caig calls learning curve rotation21 over the lifetime of the program overall the caig estimated that the competition would require 211 reduction in costs in constant fy2002 dollars over the lifetime of the program in order to break even the breakeven cost reduction requirement climbs to 256 when converted to net present value22 the caig estimated that dod would be unable to recoup its initial investment in the alternate engine development program through procurement savings alone the caig report noted dod would have to effectively compete operations and support ie maintenance contracts and attain 256 savings which the report seems skeptical of attaining in order to eventually reach break even point by 204023 while the caig report highlights from financial standpoint that the alternate engine program might eventually break even over time the caig goes on to note number of nonmonetary benefits that could be gained through having an alternate engine program for the f35 one of the most notable appears to be the issue of growth potential in the joint strike fighter engine as shown in the figure below the 18 continued osds director of program analysis and evaluation and is tasked with providing independent cost assessments of major defense acquisition programs the caig also serves as the principle advisor to the milestone decision authority on program lifecycle costs see dodd 500004 for additional information on the caig and its independent analysis role 19 unlike the f100f110 competition the competition for the fa18 the f404 engine differs from the great engine war in that both ge and pw competed only in cost since they were both building identical gedesigned f404 engines analysts note that the f404 competition removed key component engine design since both companies built their engines to the same blueprints therefore analysts note that the f404 competition did not achieve the same results as the previous f100f110 competition for independentlydesigned engines 20 osd cost analysis improvement group report v6 f35jsf alternate engine acquisition and independent cost analyses march 15 2007 slide 31 21 in discussion with the caig learning curve rotation was defined as the effect competition has on the learning curve in this case competition would result in both competitors streamlining their processes in order to compete more effectively maximize efficiency hence lower cost to the air force 22 net present value is the discounted present value of the return on investment when taking risk and other potential investment opportunities into consideration it is considered the standard method for financial appraisal of longterm projects 23 osd caig report slide 37 crs6 caig estimates that the average aircraft weight growth of 4th5th generation fighter from critical design review to initial operational capability is 72 with 03 weight growth thereafter24 basically the initial planned empty weight of an aircraft could grow over time beyond the thrust margins of safety provided by the engine eventually the engine would have to be upgraded for additional thrust to overcome the additional aircraft weight the caig report notes that pratt whitneys f135 engine is already close to exceeding the designed engine temperature specifications therefore the f135 engine would require additional modifications beyond that of the gerolls royce f136 engine to allow for thrust growth25 figure 1 f35 stovl variant weight growth projection source osd caig f35jsf alternate engine acquisition and independent cost analyses report march 15 2007 institute for defense analyses the institute for defense analyses ida was selected by osd as the federally funded research and development center ffrdc to perform the independent cost 24 the caigs analysis of expected future weight growth is not in line with the joint program offices estimate that weight will unchanged after initial operational capability ioc the caig slide shows historical data showing expected weight growth of 28 to 115 following ioc from other 4th and 5th generation fighter aircraft additionally the caigs estimated preioc weight growth of 6 is in stark contrast to the jpos estimate of 3 25 ibid slides 25 and 26 note since the f136 is earlier in its development cycle analysts comment that its design is not as set as the f135 and could better incorporate engine growth requirements without major modifications crs7 analysis of the f136 engine program ida provided its cost analysis in march 2007 and completed its final report in july 2007 ida as with the caig analysis examined the great engine wars of the 1980s along with the f404 engine competition for the fa18 its analysis showed an estimated gross savings due to competition ranging from 11 to 1826 when examining past studies of various procurement competitions ida determined that these studies showed an average weighted savings of 14627 examining the breakeven point for the case of the f136 ida determined the overall increase in cost of having an alternate engine program both direct and indirect costs to be 88 billion fy2006 dollars28 as was the case with the caigs findings ida concluded that it would not be feasible to recoup dods investment in an alternate engine if procurement costs alone were competed ida determined for the alternate engine program to break even on net present value basis the savings required would fall from an unrealistic 40 to 18 net present value when operations and support contracts are also competed29 this is somewhat in line with the caig and shows potential for dod to recoup its investment throughout the life of the alternate engine program however ida noted that dod has not typically linked procurement and costs in single competition and therefore had limited historical data in which to estimate plausible savings raising doubts as to how successful this will be in the future30 ida like the caig also noted number of other benefits stemming from competition improved fleet readiness reduced risk and industrial base sustainment are common benefits cited by both reports however ida notes that contractor responsiveness was the primary motivation for the great engine war31 ida goes on to note that by 2035 that the f35 would comprise 95 of the uss fighter attack force thus with an alternate engine program any future groundings will only affect portion of the fleet in addition enhanced industry responsiveness to engine upgrades and fixes resulting from competitive forces could potentially have profound effect on overall fleet readiness 26 institute for defense analyses report joint strike fighter jsf engine cost analysis summary of results revised march 2007 pg s3 note ida determined 11 savings from competition over the upgraded f100220 pw engine and an 18 savings from competition between the original pw f100 and the ge f110 pg 23 27 ibid pg 24 however ida noted significant inconsistencies with studies of past competitions which need to be taken into consideration when evaluating potential savings 28 ibid p 20 29 ibid p s3 30 ibid p s3 31 ibid p 44 crs8 government accountability office the government accountability office gao report noted that savings of 103 to 123 would be required for the alternate engine program to break even32 gao goes on to note that analysis of past engine competitions have shown financial savings of up to 2033 therefore gao concludes that it is reasonable to assume that savings generated from competing the engine would recoup dods investment in addition during testimony michael sullivan director of gaos acquisition and sourcing management noted that he believed the alternate engine program would reach its breakeven point by the late 2020s34 similarities and differences between the studies what appears to be the key difference between the three studies is the break even point analysis for the alternate engine program the gao noted in its report maximum savings requirement of 123 in order to recoup dods future investments in the late 2020s osds caig and ida require savings of 256 and 18 respectfully in net present value to break even in the 2040 time frame michael sullivan from gao testified that he speculated the other two studies may have included portion of costs sunk into the alternate engine program35 however in response james woolsey from ida noted that ida did not include sunk costs and also commented that he thought the major difference between gao and the other studies had to do with costs associated with operations and support os36 he contended that ida included sustainment engineering costs costs to improve the engine and additional costs tied to two supply chains that might not have been included in the gaos analysis gao analysts however noted that under competitive environment the need for an f35 engine component improvement program cip would be reduced and therefore potential funding required for cip was not included in their analysis37 engine cip funding is normally designed to be reactive and proactive throughout an engines life cycle to resolve newly identified problems and to find ways to reduce costs of aircraft and engine ownership38 basically cip is designed to fund 32 analysis of costs for the joint strike fighter engine program gao07656t march 22 2007 p 1 33

is not designed to fund engine performance improvements beyond the initial design only to reduce life cycle costs of operating the engine it was gaos opinion that competition would result in industry funding its own product improvements in order to win greater market share therefore the need for cip funding would be reduced from what is normally budgeted for sustainment engineering ida in its report fully examined the requirement for cip and noted there was still requirement for cip with the f100 and f110 engine both engines that were part of the great engine war40 while all three independent reports came to different conclusions as to the breakeven point they all agreed there are number of nonfinancial benefits that would be derived from an engine competition each of the studies notes expected improvements in fleet readiness contractor responsiveness sustainment of industrial base and stronger international relations by having the alternate engine for the f35 the gao report notes that dods program management advisory group in 1998 and again in 2002 recommended continuing the alternate engine program due to these nonfinancial benefits in spite of only finding marginal financial benefits issues as dod has noted cancelling the f136 poses questions on operational risk and potential cost and savings additional issues include the potential impact this termination could have on the us defense industrial base and on us relations with key allied countries finally eliminating competitive market forces for dod business worth billions of dollars may concern those who wish to change dods acquisition system to achieve what they see as higher standards of accountability relations with key allies the f35 unlike the f22 has been designed from the outset for export allied participation in jsf program development and sales stemming from program participation have been actively pursued as way to defray some of the cost of developing and producing

and that britain should look instead to france and european institutions on defense54 however other european countries such as the netherlands have firms making inroads into both the f135 and f136 programs the dutch currently have 74 companies and research labs involved in the jsf program55 as european companies secure more and more contracts the debate within each of the partner nations over the need for the second engine might become more complicated operational risk dod officials argue that terminating the f136 poses little operational risk the decision to pursue an alternate engine for f14s f15s and f16s they say came at time when the services were dissatisfied with the performance of existing engines tf30 and f100 during the great engine war dod was more motivated to improve engine performance reliability and to reduce operational risk than by potential cost savings dod argues that these same conditions do not exist today in briefing provided to congress in 2006 the dod office of program analysis and evaluation pae stated the f135 engine produced by pratt whitney pw for the f35 was performing well56 further pae stated that the f119 engine that pw produced for the f22a raptor which served as the basis of the f135 is also performing well pae notes that the f119 has performed well after roughly 18000 flight hours and will achieve 100000 flight hours by 2009 this briefing also notes that the f22 raptor and the fa18ef super hornet rely on sole source engine supplier the pw f119 and ge f414 respectively implying that the f35 can likewise rely on single engine manufacturer however by the time the decision was made to divide engine production contracts between ge and pw in 1984 the pw f100 engine had accumulated 2000000 hours of operational service by comparison the 18000 hours of testing might be considered modest foundation to make projections of the f119s future performance dod also argues that industry advances in engine design tools such as computational fluid design for airflow prediction and advanced software for prognostic health monitoring further reduce the risk of powering the f35 with single type of engine57 presumably using these tools will result in engines that are capable of selfdiagnosis and notification to the pilot of impending failure vice 53 rodney l pringle jsf engine rumblings military aerospace technology october 8

more efficient and costeffective maintenance procedures and quicker diagnosis of required repair parts others who support dods decision to terminate the f136 argue that an alternate engine will not help mitigate risk one defense analyst postulates that the alternate engine could actually increase operational risk this analyst notes that engines undergoing maturation first in twinengine aircraft such as the f15 f22 or the fa18 prior to use in singleengine aircraft allow more time for detecting and fixing engine deficiencies58 another analyst however notes that the f135 is quite different than the f119 it was derived from59 therefore while being derivative of an engine first introduced on the twin engine f22 it is still expected to undergo developmental growing pains with the f35 in the same vein the f136 is three to four years behind the f135 in its development and should undergo its own set of developmental growing pains and potential for cost growth recent events with the f135 engine development have increased attention to the issue of risk once on august 30 2007 and again on february 4 2008 the f135 engine experienced testing failures while on the test stand the jsf joint program office noted the engine failures in both cases were due to highcycle fatigue resulting in the failure of thirdstage turbine blade60 william balderson from the department of the navy noted during congressional testimony that the second engine failure was as result of ongoing testing to determine the causes of the first failure on august 3061 mr balderson goes on to note that pratt whitney appears confident that it understands the root causes of the malfunctions and that design fix is in the works and will be implemented once testing is complete62 program and service officials note that these engine malfunctions have pushed back the expected first flight of the f35b aircraft month or two those supporting an alternate engine point to the potential risk of future fleet wide grounding and note that the f35 will make up preponderance of the air forces fighter fleet currently the air force has 183 f22s with potential for maybe an additional 24 aircraft the air force is also currently expected to procure 1763 f35s over the next 20 plus years future fleetwide grounding of the f35s they maintain would potentially have debilitating effect on the air force similar issue though unrelated to the aircraft engines was recently experienced when the air force twice grounded its fleet of f15s because of structural problems the 58 loren thompson powering jsf one engine is

year 2009 budget for air force and navy aviation programs 62 ibid crs14 air force however was able to continue combat operations by leaning on its sizeable fleet of f16s to take up the slack the navys operational risk should be reduced because its fleet will be more balanced with fa18s using the ge404 or 414 on the ef engines along with their f35s while fleetwide groundings for enginerelated malfunctions are rare they do happen the marine corps for example grounded 106 av8b harriers in july 2000 after faulty engine bearing was cited as the cause of crash63 since 1997 66 of the navys grounding bulletins were for airframe related issues whereas 18 were related to engine issues64 the air force has experienced only two systemwide fleet standdowns due to engine issues since 199065 some have responded that the air force could find itself in the same grounding predicament with the f35 based on nonengine issues regardless of whether there is an alternate engine because of reduced diversity of its future fighter fleet one issue that pertains to operational risk that has not been discussed by dod is that of reduced fleet readiness due to for example lack of spare parts two manufacturers would maintain two supply chains and perhaps additional suppliers for critical parts eliminating one manufacturer could lead to fewer suppliers and potentially leave the remaining supply chain more vulnerable to disruptions caused by labor disagreements foreign takeovers or natural disasters on the other hand splitting the engine buy will reduce the workload for the supply vendors and increase the level of uncertainty as to the amount of business they will receive in addition one defense consulting firm notes that approximately 50 of each engine is procured in competition environment today leading one to conclude there are multiple vendors available that could create parts for each of the engines66 during march 1 2006 hearing secretary of the air force michael wynne discussed the potential cost and risk of having one engine supplier versus two secretary wynne said that the decision to terminate the f136 was very tough call because it involves industrial base and involves longterm reliability statistics and involves economics in the context of reliability and risk secretary wynne continued with the statement that i dont like to see our industrial base go to

march 1 2006 house armed services committee holds hearing on fy2007 budget air force crs15 cost and savings68 over the past three years dod has mainly explained its decision to terminate the f136 on its financial return on its investment congressional testimony by osdatl the air force and the navy all note that the business case does not sufficiently support the large upfront investment in an alternate engine for the f35 as was previously noted by the three congressionally directed studies and associated testimony back in 2007 while there are number of nonfinancial benefits to having an alternate engine the ability for dod to recoup its financial investment is matter of great debate it is not surprising that there is lot of debate on the merits of the f136 especially given the complexity of the issue and the amount of resources required to fund second engine there is inevitably lot of subjectivity when analyzing business cases in the case of the f136 one will need to assess how likely it is for the program to achieve the estimated savings the likely number of engines that will be acquired the potential for the fleet to suffer debilitating issue related to the engine how much better the engine designs will improve and how much more responsive the manufacturers will be under competitive environment not only will one have to assess the ability to achieve financial and nonfinancial improvements but one will have to assess the qualitative worth of such savings when compared to the opportunity costs of the investment both within dod and outside analysts note that the f136 program requires large upfront investment for benefits that wont be realized for decades these factors arise in an environment where dod is facing tough financial choices while on warfooting and the potential for budget reductions as administrations change two of the key variables in analyzing the business case for the f136 is the development cost of the alternate engine and the number of engines that those costs will be amortized over beginning with expected procurement numbers dod is currently planning on buying 2443 f35s excluding test articles the air force current engine production profile for the f35 is for total of 3649 engines 3173 primary engines and 476 spares69 this current engine production profile is about 100 engines more than the three congressionally directed studies used for their analysis back in 2007 however the overall planned dod procurement of 2443 operational f35s is over 500 aircraft less than the 1996 preliminary planning estimate of 2978 aircraft it should be emphasized that dods planned buy of 2443 aircraft has remained steady since 2003 when the department of the navy under the tactical aircraft integration plan reduced its buy from 1083 to 680 aircraft70 68 to date approximately 2 billion has been provided to develop the f136 engine the cost to complete the f136 development phase is estimated at 136 billion from fy2009 to fy2013 source provided to crs by safllw on april 30 2008 69 safllw correspondence april 30 2008 70 the department of the navys buy includes both the navys f35cs and marine corps f35bs the marine corps have set their requirement for f35bs at 420 which would leave 260 f35cs for the navy if the department of the navy limits the buy to 680 and fully supports the marine corps requirements crs16 while dods procurement numbers have remained steady over the past five years international orders as previously mentioned are expected to exceed the minimum anticipated orders of 646 aircraft and could reach over 2500 aircraft71 in addition the f35 is designed to take the place of the f16 an aircraft with an initial planned run of 1388 aircraft that eventually exceeded 4000 built72 dod has been focused on keeping the f35 program on track and procurement numbers sufficient to prevent undo cost growth deputy secretary of defense england in letter to congress noted the departments desires to procure more f35s than additional f 22s73 given the disparity between the af requirement for 381 f22s and the current program of record of 183 aircraft there appears to be strong potential for the air force requirement of f35s to grow beyond 1763 aircraft if the f35 program goes beyond current procurement expectations both for domestic and international orders the business case for keeping the f136 program alive might be significantly strengthened however current service and allies budget pressures along with aircraft cost and development issues may drive lower procurement numbers one defense analyst notes the air forces procurement numbers are likely to fall to around 12001400 aircraft74 another analytical assessment notes the air forces strategy to replace legacy aircraft on oneforone basis is excessive and that one might contemplate 8001000 f35as as being sufficient75 the department of the navy on the other hand is facing tactical aircraft shortfall of around 125 aircraft in 2017 while the marine corps appears focused on acquiring the stovl variant for its modernization efforts the navy could potentially acquire additional fa18efs to help reduce its fighter shortfall with the navy being the only customer for the f35c reductions in their numbers could put the viability of the cvariant into question in addition there could be fallout over the kcx competition in which northrop grummaneads kc30 tanker won over boeings kc767 potential fallout could affect the f35s international orders if the competition results are overturned and european nations backlash against the pricy us fighter finally any program setbacks that result in excessive cost growth beyond what has already been encountered to date could have profound effect on aircraft orders on both sides of the atlantic therefore there is potential that dods business case planning factors for the f136 alternate engine might not reach the levels assumed in the current studies and therefore become very expensive nice to have 71 while procurement numbers have remained steady the length of the acquisition program has been extended due to issues with aircraft weight growth resulting in program delays

watts us fighter modernization plans nearterm choices center for strategic and budgetary assessments 2007 crs17 the other key variable to the business case analysis the remaining developmental costs of the f136 engine is estimated to be 136 billion from fy2009 to fy201376 in addition total f136 costs from fy2009 to fy2015 is estimated to be 35 billion 136 billion for development 029 billion for component improvement program efforts 171 billion for procurement and 014 billion for initial spares77 noteworthy is the fact that from fy1995 to fy2008 approximately 2 billion has been provided by dod to develop the f136 engine therefore over half of the total development cost of the f136 are sunk costs while currently not in the dod budget 495 million will be required in fy2009 to continue developmental efforts on the f13678 the 290 million required for component improvement program cip efforts might be debatable by some as previously stated gao did not incorporate cip in its 2007 analysis because of its position that competition would reduce its need79 the gao analysts felt that competition would drive the manufacturers to make the improvements in their engines on their own to help them attain larger share of the engine contracts ida however did include cip after its analysis of the results of the great engine war ida notes that while cip funding did not exceed 4 of the estimated life cycle costs in any of their analysis it is still cost that must be approximately doubled to ensure two equally supported engine designs80 procurement and spares costs will be required whether there is single or dual supplier of engines while the numbers could result in greater number of spare engines required under dual supply environment the overall number should remain close however there will be additional costs in maintaining two separate production and supply lines along with the additional management required by the services industrial base as noted earlier dod officials have expressed concern over the potential impact of this proposed termination on the industrial base further dod analyses acknowledge that the f136 alternate engine provides significant industrial base benefits81 therefore it is reasonable to assume that the decision to terminate the f136 may have negative consequences on the industrial base the debate focuses on how significant these negative consequences may be 76 safllw correspondence april 30 2008 77 ibid 78 ibid 79 telephonic conversation with bruce fairbairn gao assistant director acquisition and sourcing management

strike fighter jsf engine cost analysis final report july 2007 p 87 81 jsf alternate engine decision briefing osdpae february 27 2006 crs18 the industrial base issues discussed and debated in hearings and other public fora have focused on whether single supplier of fighter aircraft engine will result in costlier engines over time and whether reliable access to engines and spare parts might be jeopardized the root of this question is what effect canceling the f136 engine will have on ges ability to continue to compete in the high performance fighter aircraft engine business currently the only us manufacturers of fighter aircraft engines are pw and ge82 ge is dominant player in the large commercial aircraft engine market by most estimates ge has captured approximately 50 of this market figure 2 shows ges large engine position in relation to pws83 ges current business in building and supporting highthrust highperformance fighter aircraft engines is more modest currently ge builds and maintains engines f400 series for the navys 462 fa18ef super hornets it is expected to also build engines for the navys 90 ea18g growlers ge supports the f110 series of engines for domestic and

were cancelled ges fighter aircraft design and manufacturing capabilities would not disappear immediately the business outlined 82 however as previously noted rolls royce will be opening up new plant in virginia in 2009 that in part is planned to support their work in the f136 83 majority of ges commercial sales come from the cfm56 engine since ge has 50 share of the cfm56 with frances snecma the teal group reduced ges commercial cfm56 numbers by half this methodology was used with other joint engine ventures the future engine for the 737 and a320x is still undecided between ge pw and rolls royce however the teal group accounted for the kc45 competition by awarding its engines to ge crs19 above is likely sufficient to maintain ges design teams engineers and assembly line workers and much technology and expertise can be extracted from the commercial business lines ges own experience during the great engine war shows that company on the periphery of business area can catch up and beat an incumbent in headtohead competition even if that incumbent had been producing particular type of engines for decade each of the three congressionally mandated studies commented on the effects to the industrial base the caig and ida both noted ges dominance in the commercial engine market the caig study noted that ge produced 1000 commercial engines in 2007 compared to 220 commercial engines for pw84 additionally the caig noted that pw is highly dependent on military sales 50 of direct sales in 2006 vice ge 1585 while there appears to be significant loss of overall engineering talent at either manufacturer the caig highlighted that 200 ge military jet engineers would be unable to transfer skills to ges commercial engines if the f136 engine was terminated ida provided more indepth analysis on the effects to the industrial base in their final report while they concluded that the us industrial base may not be irreparably harmed if the f136 engine is terminated they expressed reservations in dod placing all of its fighter engine production with firm that has weak position in the commercial marketplace86 ida felt that firm with weak commercial marketplace presence would have fewer resources that could be leveraged for use on dod products ida also examined the top suppliers of components for the f136 and determined that it is unlikely that any supplier would exit the domestic industrial base because of f136 termination87 overall ida concluded that the us industrial base would be stronger as result of an active f136 program one defense analyst however postulated that ges current commercial market dominance over pw could actually weaken the industrial base if ge was to secure sizable share of the jsf engine business88 this analyst noted that ge from 2007 to 2016 is expected to produce more engines for the fa18 than pw will for all of the fighter aircraft it supports f15 f16 f22 and f3589 the teal groups analysis appears to back up this claim and figure 3

production figure additional industrial base issues have not yet been widely debated but may also inform decisions on the future of the f136 one issue concerns export and competitiveness the jsf is centerpiece of the federal governments fighter aircraft policy since the programs beginning the desire to produce costeffective multirole aircraft appears to have been shaped by consideration of what the international market would bear90 the f35 is designed as an export aircraft and one that is hoped to leverage the international success of the f16 falcon another cost effective single engine multirole fighter to perpetuate us dominance in this market foreign participation in the jsf program was sought to defray development costs but also to prime the pump for export91 key question appears to be whether the jsf will achieve the same export success with one enginetype as it might with two some argue that the f16s export success is directly attributable to having two engine types the f16 became much more exportable aircraft when ge and pratt were killing each other in the international market so if you are selling these jsfs and you have got one 90 see for instance john tirpak world

enginethat reduces the attractiveness to these international customers92 singapore and south korea have both selected the ge f110 engine to power their f 15 eagles and saudi arabia is giving serious consideration to reengining its f15s with ge engines these decisions contrast with us air force decisions to power its eagles with pw engines further while ge engines power large fraction of usaf f16 falcons pw engine sales to international f16 customers have dominated ge sales this background lends credence to the suggestion that competition in engine selection can enhance us fighter aircraft export success would cancelling the f136 and the attendant competition with the f135 adversely affect potential future advances in engine performance reliability and maintainability if so might this be at the expense of us competitiveness some of those who participated in or studied the great engine war assert that the competition between ge and pw made both companies better and proved invaluable to future engine development93 the economic stakes in international fighter engine competition appear to be high us companies face competition from france sweden russia and european consortium of companies and it is argued that some of these governments heavily subsidize their aerospace industries aerospace is an important export for the united states despite this competition aerospace has at times provided the us economy with its highest trade surplus94 many observers project that the size of the international market for fighter aircraft will remain high for the next decade after which it may peak and then decline95 acquisition reform and accountability the final point one might make about the potential termination of the f136 pertains to acquisition reform or good government96

problems such as funding instability unrealistic requirements poorly structured contractor incentives too much reliance on lead system integrators and the improper use of commercial contracts to purchase military items in this context many observers believe that the competition during the great engine war conferred number of benefits to government that todays acquisition officials would have difficult time duplicating for example prior to the first contract award the air force demanded that ge and pw provide six years of cost projections to include the production of engines but also the price of support equipment spare engines technical data and dual sourcing data and second sourcing data for operations and support the contractors were held to these cost projections for six years the air force let six years of firmfixed price or nottoexceed contracts from the first production lot prior to the great engine war government had succeeded in negotiating firmfixed price contracts only after the engine had been operating in the field for several years never before had contractors agreed to provide cost projections into the future and contracts were typically for production only not work by requiring ge and pw to compete for annual production and work dod may have reaped number of benefits such as better contract terms and conditions better warranties to assure engine quality consistency and long term stability of support97 further after competition was introduced the incumbent pw offered engine improvements to the air force earlier than the air force had been led to expect without the competition98 to avoid potential disruptions in production and to protect itself against price gouging dod required each contractor to provide his plan for providing dual sources of critical parts these separately priced options in the proposals would allow the government to reprocure spare parts from sources other than the prime contractors99 successfully orchestrating the great engine war in the mid1980s required considerable amount of effort and skill by air force leaders it is unclear whether todays environment would allow or whether dod leadership would be able to exploit
