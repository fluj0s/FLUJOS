refugees and displaced persons the dayton peace accords also set up bosnias current political structure of two semiautonomous ethnicallybased entities and relatively weak central government it resulted in the deployment of natoled peacekeeping force which was charged with providing secure environment for the implementation of the peace agreement in december 2004 european union force took over peacek eeping duties from nato appointed high representative created by the dayton accords oversees the civilian implementation efforts in the more than nine years since the accords the united states and other countries have scored significant achieve ments in bosnia including sharply reduced interethnic violence restored freedom of movement and the return of many refugees and displaced persons to their homes the international community has also helped bosnia hold largely free and fair elections and set up many of the institutions of modern democratic state however these individual

necessary and that when these reforms reach critical mass they will beco selfsustaining according to critics of current international policy on bosnia international interventionism has led to

autonomous entities the largely bosnia k and croat fede ration of bosnia herzegovina and the bosnian serbdomin ated republika srpska rs under the accords the bosnian federation received roughly 51 of the territory of bosnia herzegovina while the republik srpska received about 49 each of the entities has its own parliament and government with wideranging powers as well as its own armed forces each entity may establish special parallel relationships with neighboring states consistent with th sovereignty and territorial integrity of bosniaherzegovina most powers are vested in the entities the central government has responsibility for foreign policy foreign trade and customs policy monetary policy and few other areas ce ntral government decisions are nominally taken by majority but any of the thr ee main ethnic groups can block any decision if it views it as against its vital interests the federation is further divided into ten cantons each of which has control of policy in key areas

how country l acking all the attributes of sovereignty can hope to join nato or the eu one day or in the near term participate meaningfully in such programs as natos partnership for peace program they wonder if bosnia can or should continue to operate indefinitely as ward of the international community as the rest of the region moves however slowly in some cases toward european integration another important issue is whether bosnia is still important to us interests particularly given perhaps more pressing us commitment s in other countries and regions the united states has invested substantial sums to stabilize bosnia from fy1991 through fy2004 the united states spent over 136 billion in incremental military costs in bosnia mainly for the us peacekeeping contingent2 us aid to bosnia over the same period amount ed to more than 15 billion3 some observers believe that the european union is now capable of dealing with bosnias remaining problems on its own indeed the eu alread provides the bulk of financial aid and political guidance to bosnia and took over the military mission there from nato in december 2004 however many observers believe that the united states still has stake in bosnias stability as part of building europe whole and free the overarching us objective in the region c ontinued us involvement in bosnia may be needed to arrest indicted war criminals as well as to make sure that bosnia is not used as haven for organized crime or terrorists successes and remaining challenges bosnia has achieved progre ss on some issues since 1995 but continues to fall short in many others one relative success story has been the restoration of freedom of movement within bosnia and the gradual return of refugees to their homes according to the high commissioner for refugees unhcr by october 2004 over 1 million of the 22 million refugees and displaced persons had returned to their homes including over 447000 who retu rned to areas in which they are an ethnic minority over 92 percent of the legal claims of persons wanting to have their homes returned to them have been resolved4 while ethnic relations are sometimes tense and some acts of violence do occur the main obstacle to refugee returns is economic the war often had the effect of destroying local industries along with th jobs that made communities viable many returnees are elderly many young pe ople want to leave bosnia for better opportunities elsewhere up to twothirds of them according to some polls5 at thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32392crs4 6 bih corruption moderately dropping tr ansparency international bih press release march 11 2004 end of 2003 ohr handed over responsibility for refugee issues to the bosnian human rights and minorities ministry key focus of international efforts in bosnia is to strengthen the rule of law the rule of law is particularly important in order to break down the parallel structures connecting nationalist political parties certain enterprises and organized crime widespread corruption also retards economic development according to an opinion poll commissioned by transparency internati onal bosnians view corruption as the second most serious problem the country faces after unemployment6 high representative ashdown has undertaken several steps to promote the rule of law in bosnia he pushed through new criminal code and criminal procedure code in 2003 and put into place high j udicial and prosecutorial council hjpc which has vetted bosnias j udges and prosecutors for integrity and professional competence with ethnic representation proportionate to the 1991 prewar bosnian census the hjpc is also responsible for disciplinary actions as well as for appointing new judges and prosecutors ashdown also forced the creation of the bosnian state court with special panels dealing with organized crime this court has both bosnian and internati onal judges and prosecutors until january 2003 police training was conducted by police mission in bosnia the mission vetted policemen fo r their professional qualifications and participation in wa r crimes or illegal activity an eu police mission which replaced the mission is continuing the advisory and training functions of the mission ashdown successfully pushed for the establishment of new central government law enforcement institutions including ministry of justice ministry of security and state information nd protection agency sipa charged with dealing with issues such as money undering and organized crime as well as terrorism in december 20 04 police restru cturing commission composed of bosnian and international officials issued report calling for bosnian central government institutions to take over re sponsibility for all police matters ashdown has also called for the elimination of entity interior ministries such proposals if implemented would mark dramatic blow to the power of the entities within bosnia which had previously controlled most po lice functions and have been strongly resisted by bosnian serb leaders however it should be noted the implement ation of these reforms has been slow these institutions often do not function effectively as they lack resources and sufficient staffing however there have been few successes in the area of rule of law courts in both entities have prosecuted several cases against organized crime figures in march 2004 the bosnian state court handed down guilty verdict in bosnias biggest human trafficking case another area key to bosnias future st ability is economic reform and poverty reduction here

officials have pushed through laws to establish an indirect taxation authority and value added tax in bosnia rationalizing bosnias tax system is n ecessary in order to stimulate economic growth as well as to provide resources for bosnias underfunded central government institutions as well as to assist bosn ias eu integration the international community is pressing bosnian leaders to cut back the size and expense of entity and lower level governments as the central governments rule is strengthened however severe economic problems remain bosnia is one of the poorest countries in europe with gross domestic product gdp about 60 of the prewar level about half of the population liv close to or be low the poverty line7 according to some experts bosnias ec onomy may be on the verge of crisis many of bosnias main prewar industries including military industries have collapsed and new businesses to replace these lost j obs have not materialized according to this view substantial part of the econom is dependent on gove rnment spending on oversized government bureaucracies in part legacy of the complicated government structures created by the dayton peace accords as well as residual international funding government spending account s for over 50 of the countrys gdp8 efforts to stimulate the economy to pr oduce jobs and foreign investment have only been partially successful ashdow n established bulldozer committee composed of ohr officials and bosnian businessmen to develop specific proposals to cut through red tape and take other steps to improve the business climate in bosnia nevertheless bosnia still lacks many elements of suitable legal framework to encourage domestic and international investors moreover the privatization process which is in the hands of the entity governments remains slow and plagued by endemic administrative and legal shortcomings according to the international officials foreign direct investment fdi is increasing in part due to ashdowns efforts but from very low base fdi made up only 5 of gdp in 2003 one of the lowest percentages in the region 9 prospects for stability and selfsustaining reforms major concern for international policymakers is the longterm impact on bosnia of declining interna tional attention and resources as noted above most of the modest reform successes in bosnia have been initiated and pushed forward by the international community international aid has played an important role in keeping the economy afloat the nati onalist parties in pow er have often reacted passively on reform issues or even engaged in overt or covert obstructionism local leaders often concentrate on political maneuvering and securing resources for political patronagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32392crs6 10 for one such

strengthening of statelevel institutions have also met with indiffe rence or opposition under in ternational pr essure new institutions have proliferate d often without the funding or staffing to make them effective analysts have therefore expressed cern about the sustainability of bosnias reforms and the countrys longterm unity according to some analysts part of the problem is due to the shortcomings of the dayton constitution they say the governing structures set up by dayton are too complex with too many layers of government that are too expensive and not accountable to the people various proposals have been made for simplifying the structure including eliminating the entities to create unitary state or syst em of cantons within more conventional federation10 another problem is that while bosniaks overwhelmingly favor united bosnia serbs and to lesser exte nt croats do not for ex ample state department sponsored opinion poll in the republika sr pska rs in 2003 found that 69 favored rs independence from bosnia another po ll from the same source found that former bosnian serb leader and indicted war cr iminal radovan karadzic is the most popular politician in the rs on the other hand 55 of bosnian serbs expect that notwithstanding their wishes bosnia will re main single state the poll found that 41 of bosnian croats favor remain ing part of bosnia while 54 favor independence or union with cr oatia interestingly bosn ian croat support for bosnia has sharply increased since 1999 at the same time as croatia n governments have publicly renounced territori claims on bosnia11 ashdown and previous high representatives have tried to exhort local leaders to take ownership of reforms without much success the international community also tried to influence the domestic politi cal scene by helping nonnationalis t parties win elections and form government coalitions however these efforts were not very successful due to the hetero geneity of the coalitions nd the continued popularity of nationalist groups which successfully play on the fears of people and still have effective patronage networks after the victory of the three major nationalist parties in the october 2002 general elections ashdown has tried to wo rk with the new nationalist leaders on reform issues but has also jumped into the middle of the bosnian political system himself campaigning under the slogan j obs and justice he has intervened actively in the making of laws and continue s to fire and take other actions against obstructionist politicians and parties his moves have angered bosnian leaders at times but there has been little public protest against his actions indeed an october 2003 state departmentsponsored opinion poll indicated little public awareness of the jobs and

opposition which could have been his natural allies now they charge he is at political deadend partnered with ruling nationalist elites with little interest in reform and an opposition too weak and disenchanted to serve as viable alternative13 ashdown has replied that he has had to work with whomever the bosnian people elect as their leaders some analysts support ashdowns actions saying that however paradoxical it may seem interventionism is needed in the short term to provide the basis for selfsustaining bosnia14 on the other hand other experts are concerned that local institutions cannot develop as long as ohr continues its active and some critics say undemocratic intervention in bosnian affairs they suggest that the development of responsible democratic local institutions should take priority and that ohrs use of its powers should be more limited and more accountable to the bosnian people15 possibly acting in the international communitys favor in the long run is the slowly increasing realization of bosnian politicians that it is in their own interest to promote bosnias integration into the european union the 2003 eu summit in thessaloniki greece held out the prospect of bosnia and other countries in the region joining the eu when they are ready the problem with possible eu membership as motivating factor is that it may be too distant to have as powerful an effect as it has had in central europe as of early 2005 bosnia continued to fall short in implementing the 16 measures set by an eu feasibility study before it can begin negotiations on stabilization and association agreement first step in the long road to eu membership bosnias central government has set goal of eu membership by 2009 although most observe rs view this goal as unrealistic at present what would be the impact of reduced international intervention in bosnias political system and decrease in economic assistance pa rticularly if reforms are slowed as result it appears unlikely th at the situation could explode into conflict again in the near future perhaps most im portantly because the geopolitical situation in the region has changed bosnias civil war was in part the playing out of the designs of nationalist leaders in croatia and serbia on bosnian territory according to state department sponsored opinion poll about third to slightly less than one half

about partition of bosnia as ne w democratic regimes in both countries put domestic reforms and improving relations w ith the west over past nationalist projects to redraw borders the comeback of the nationalist hdz party in croatia and nationalist forces in serbia in 2003 have caused some concern however the hdz government has shown inte rest in carving up bosnia again knowing that to do so would put an end to achieving its main foreign policy goal joining euroatlantic institutions similar views are held by l eaders in serbia although some voices have raised the possibility of partition of bosnia if kos ovo is permitted to become independent from serbia the serbian political scene remains unsettled and victory by the ultranationalist radical part in future elections could conceivably pose danger to bosnias future on the other hand even if poor di sunited unreformed bosnia could be nominally stable it still might also present problems the weakness of its institutions could provide an environmen t conducive to organi zed crime activities such as trafficking in weapons drugs and persons as well as the operations of terrorist groups which could threaten us and european interests us policy issues sfor and partnership for peace due in part to the improving security situation in bosnia and the need to shift troops to the wa r on terrorism and other responsibilities the natoled

approved new defense minister in march 2004 after two previous bosnian serbnominated candidate s for defense minister were rejected by ashdown due to their questiona ble conduct during the war reforms that are needed include staffing stateleve l defense institutions with qualified personnel providing these institutions with adequate funding and premises and eliminating the entity defense ministries19 war crimes and cooperation with the icty the most important factor hindering bo snias membership in pfp and opening talks on stabilization and association agreement with the eu is bosnias lack of cooperation with the international crimin tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty an important focus of current us and international efforts in bosnia is to apprehend indicted war crimes suspects and transfer them to the icty particularly former bosnian serb leader radovan karadz ic and former army chief ratko mladic the bosnian government and the two entity governments are required by the dayton peace agreement to fully cooperate with the icty according to icty chief prosecutor carla ponte the federation has largely cooperated with the icty but the rs has not rs officials have not arrested single war criminal indicted by the icty since the peace accords were signed20 indeed some of them have allegedly assisted indictees to evade capture therefore the transfer of war

reports both mladic and karadzic move within bosnia and between bosnia and serbia and mont enegro both eufor and the remaining nato presence in bosnia participate in developing intelligence for the

tried few war crimes cases so far but have been criticized for long delays insufficient protection for witnesses and ethnic bias recognizing this fact the court will have international judges and prosecutors working with their bosnian counterparts for the first few years similar to bosnian courts currently charged with prosecuting highprofile organized crime cases however the court will have to depend on local police forces to assist its work domestic war crimes prosecutions will also depend on ashdowns efforts to improve bosnias judicial system including by dismissing corrupt and ine

terrori sm has also become an important focus of us policy toward bosnia which s been haven for qaeda and other terrorist groups although it has not played as important role in this regard as other

define its adversar ies some bosnian serb officials have alleged that bosniaks were harboring islamic terrorists however it should be stressed that bosnian opposition to terrorism has been remarkably broad despite the stilldeep ethnic divide in the country the united states enjoys strong reservoir of support in bosnia especially among bosniaks for bringing peace to the country and providing postwar aid in ddition bosniaks are known in the muslim world as particularly secular and european in outlook this has often caused friction between foreign islamic extremists and many ordinary bosniaks efforts by foreign islamists to recruit bosniaks into thei r organizations have met with limited success some bosniaks also fear that the terrorists will give bosnia bad name in europe thereby hindering their ability to travel there and setting back bosnian efforts to join european institutions in the long run24 in general the bosnian constitution gives domestic powers to fight terrorism to the entities while the central government deals with international efforts to fight terror bosnian efforts to fight terro rism are hampered by the weakness and inefficiency of its
