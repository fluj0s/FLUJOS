for hybrid vehicles salvatore lazzari specialist in public finance resources science and industry division summary hybrid vehicles are propelled by standard gasoline or diesel internal combustion engine in combination with an electric motor and battery storage system which improves fuel economy the energy polic act of 2005 replaced 2000 deduction for hybrids with system of tax credits that va ry according to fuel efficiency and estimated lifetime fuel savings compared with 2002 comparable gasolineonly model these credits which range from 250 to 3400 per vehi cle went into effect on january 1 2006 and are available through december 31 2009 however there is an approximately 60000permanufacturer limit on the number of hybrid vehicles that would qualify for the full credit toyota reached its limit in the second quarter of 2006 and the credits for those vehicles are being phased out and will not be availabl after october 1 2007 honda reached its limit in the third quarter of 2007 us manufacturers primarily general motors and ford produce mostly suv hybrids which have seen slower demand the tax credits for hybrids were enact ed to promote energy conservation in the transportation sector by encouraging the mand for fuelefficient alternativetechnology vehicles the 60000vehicle limit was imposed to limit the benefits accruing to foreign hybrid manufacturers which curren tly dominate the hybrid market section 1341 of energy policy act of 2005 epact05 pl 10958 provides tax credits for four types of advancedtechnology vehicles atvs hybrid vehicles fuel cell vehicles advanced leanburn vehicles and other alternativ fuel vehicles the hybrid vehicle tax credits which are in internal revenue code irc 30b are part of somewhat complex tax credit structure that includes separate credits for hybrid vehicles weighing 8500 pounds or less and for hybrid vehicles weighing more than 8500 pounds credit for hybrid vehicles weighing 8500 pounds or less for vehicles weighing 8500 lbs or less the formula for computing the credit has two components fuel economy credit nd conservation credit the fuel economy credit depends on how much greater the hybrids rated city fuel economy is in percentage terms compared to base 2002 city fuel ec onomy figure for vehicle in the same inertia weight class as the hybrid the city fuel economy rating used in the formula is the same figure reported by the vehicle manufactur er to the epa for purposes of the cafehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22558crs2 1 nor are they generally the fuel economy one may experience based on actual driving experience 2 in other words each hybrid vehicle has corresponding inertia weight which is used to establish the 2002 city fuel economy base inertia weight is basically curb weight plus 300 lbs 3 procedurally the vehicle manufacturer calcula tes the two tax credit components based on the above formulas and files for certification with the irs us department of the treasury internal revenue

described in table 2 3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22558crs3 example as an example of how the total cr edit would be computed for passenger cars and light trucks weighing 8500 lbs or less which comprise the vast majority of the vehicle stock in the united states cons ider the 2006 toyota highlander 2wd this hybrid was rated by toyota mo tor sales inc as having city fuel economy of 368 miles per gallon and inertia weight of 4500 lbs for vehicles having an inertia weight of 4500 lbs the tax code irc 30bb2 establis hes corresponding base city fuel economy of 176 mpg since the highlander is rated at 209 of the base fuel economy 368 176 x 100 209 the purchaser of this vehicl would qualify for fuel economy tax credit of 1600 as shown in table 1 the conservation credit is determined based on the estimated lifetime fuel savings of the hybrid vehicles over the 2002 base fuel economy continuing with the same example over 120000 miles as specified by st atute the highlander hybrid would use an estimated 3260 gallons of gasoline 120000 miles 368 mpg and the standard 2002 vehicle would use 6818 gallons of gasoline 120000 miles 176 mpg thus the estimated lifetime fuel savings would be 3557 gallons according to table 2 the allowed conservation tax credit corresponding to this fuel savings is 1000 thus the total tax credit that this taxpayer would be able to claim on his or her 2006 income tax return would be 2600 1600 1000 credit for hybrid vehicles heavier than 8500 pounds for hybrids weighing more than 8500 lbs heavy duty hybrid vehicles the credit is percent of the qualified marginal or incremental hybrid cost for that vehicle subject to certain limits there are three applicable percentages each corresponding to differences in fuel economy relative to comparable 2002 model gasoline or diesel powered vehicle these are shown in table 3 column 1 shows the fuel efficiency differences column 2 shows the corresponding tax credit as pe rcent of marginal cost the marginal cost of the hybrid vehicle is the difference in the suggested manufacturer selling price between the hybrid vehicle and gasoline or diesel powered vehicle comparable in weight size and use as determined and certified by the manufacturer as noted the amount of the tax credit for heavy vehicles cannot exceed certain limits which are also specified by statute these limits which depend on the vehicles gross weight are shown in table 4 table 3 hybrid credit for vehicles weighing more than 8500 pounds relative increase in fuel econom credit as of marginal cost at least 30 but less than 40 20

an example of how the credit w ould be computed for hybrid vehicles weighing more than 8500 lbs primarily heav duty trucks such as semis consider hybrid truck weighing 20000 lbs rated at 20 mpg and selling for 150000 assume that comparable diesel truck is rated at 10 mpg and sells for 100000 because the difference in mpg is 100 20 mpg 10 mpg the taxpayer would be entitled tentatively to hybrid vehicle tax credit of 20000 40 of 50000 however the maximum credit limit for vehicles in this weight range table 4 is 15000 thus this taxpayer could claim tax credit of 15000 against his or her tax liability hybrid vehicles weighing more than 8500 lbs have been produced that have been certified by the internal revenue service irs definition of hybrid vehicle in each case the tax statute defines hybrid vehicle as motor vehicle that draws propulsion energy from two onboard sources of stored energy standard internal combustion or heat engine using consumable fuel primarily gasoline and rechargeable energy storage system or battery qualifying hybrid vehicle must meet the applicable tier ii emissions standards of the clean air ac t bin 5 for vehicle with gross vehicle weight rating 6000 pounds and less bin 8 fo r vehicle weighing between 6000 and 8500 pounds the tax credit for hybrid vehicles is available for vehi cles purchased after december 31 2005 and before january 1 2010 60000 vehicle limitation and credit phaseout the hybrid vehicle tax credits are limited to the sale of the first 60000 vehicles for each manufacturer plus any vehicle sold during the first calendar quarter after reaching its 60000 vehicle threshold after that the cred it begins to gradually phase out over four quarters as follows 50 of the otherwise available tax credit is available in the second and third quarters after the quarter in wh ich manufacturer records the sale of 60000 hybrids 25 of the otherwise available tax credit is available in the fourth and fifth calendar quarters after the quarter in which manufacturer records the sale of the 60000th vehicle thus there is onequarter delay in reducing the credit and the phaseout period is actually one year example an example of how this limitation works is as follows assume that manufacturer sells its 60000th hybrid and advanced lean burn vehicle in february 2007 the first quarter then the full tax credit is available for purchases made through june 30 2007 the second quarter half of the cr edit would be available on purchases madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22558crs5 from july 1 2007 through december 31 2007 onequarter of the credit would be available on purchases made from january 1 2008 through june 30 2008 tax credit would be available for purchases made afte r june 30 2008 however the hybrid vehicle tax credit ends on december 31 2009 which means that if the 60000th vehicle is sold in september 2009 the full allowable tax credit is available on purchases made through december 31 2009 thus there would not be gradual phasing down of the amount of the tax credit if the 60000th vehicle sale occurs in may 2009 then 100 of the credit could be claimed on sales from july through ptember 30 2009 and 50 of the otherwise allowable credit would be ava ilable from october 1 2009 through december 31 2009 credit would be available after th at there would be reduction to 25 table 6 shows the credit levels for the

treasury internal revenue service credit for toyota and lexus hybrids begins phaseout with reporting of third quarter sales internal revenue notice ir2006172 november 9 2006 rationale for the hybrid vehicle tax credits the hybrid tax credits were part of broader tax provision in epact05 that provided tax credits for three other categories of atvs subsidizing the purchase of atvs through tax credits was viewed by the congress as way of generating greaterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22558crs6 consumer demand for and accepta nce of alternatives to c onventional gasoline and diesel powered automotive technologies technologies th at would be both more fuel efficient and cleaner the congress believed that there wa s consumer resistance to these technologies which would be weakened by system of consumer tax credits congress also believed that in order to achieve these goals policy was needed that would transform the mode of transportation in the united states toward cleaner and more energy efficient atvs in this regard hybrids and alternative fueled vehicles eg ethanol fueled or flexfueled vehicles were viewed as the short term opti ons advanced leanburn and fuel cell vehicles were viewed as longerterm options ultimate ly the ideas underlying the hybrid vehicle tax credits were first to promote energy policy goals petroleum conservation and environmental policy goals reduc ing emissions of pollutants by developing more fuel efficient atvs however while the ultimate goals were focused on energy and environmental objectives policymakers wanted to achieve this in way that benefitted or at least did not harm the domestic auto industry in particular proponents of the auto industry wanted to avoid an increase in ca fe standards and othe r government mandates they aspired for more freemarket approach and incentives are more consistent with this than standards brief discussi on of the origin and evolution of the hybrid vehicle tax credits as part of efforts to enact comprehensive energy policy legislation supports this point in 2000 of the 106th congress congressman kildee and senator levin both of michigan introduced hybrid tax credit gislation hr 4270 introduced in april 2000 s 2685 introduced in june 2000 another chigan representative representative camp also introduced the original clear act of 2001 hr 1864 clean efficient automobiles resulting from advanced car technologies act which proposed system of hybrid vehicle tax credits very similar to current law but without the 60000 unit cap the same bill was introduced on april 21 2001 by senator hatch in the senate s 760 for variety of reasons these bills which received support from the auto industry were not incorporated into comprehensive energy policy legislation h r 4 or s 389 and s 596 which in any event failed to be appr oved by the congress in 2005 another effort was made to enact comprehensive energy po licy legislation as in earlier versions the senate bill included tax credits for hybrids and other atvs while the house versions did not subsequent comprehensive energy policy legislation hr 6 did eventually include the hybrid vehicle tax credits in the sena s 760 was reintroduced again as s 971 in 2005 and eventually incorporated into hr 6 which became law on august 8 2005 by this time the domestic automobile industry wa s declining and the congress did not want to enact policies such as higher cafe sta ndards that could be harmful to the industry in conference the house offered to recede on the atv tax credits but only if the senate accepted 60000 vehicle limit and the phaseout provisions the final conference report on hr 6 included this limit house versions of energy policy legislation did not contain tax credits for hybrids and other atvs the most likely reason for the cap was to limit estimated revenue losses but some analysts speculate that this lower cap was introduced to prevent benefits from accruing excessively to foreign auto companies at the expense of domestic manufacturers since hybrids were developed in japan japanese manufacturers had an advantage in their production particularly by 2005 just befo re epact05 was enacted the additional demand for hybrids stimulated by the tax credits combined with the cap on individual manufacturers would be filled by domestic production toyota reached its limit in the second quarter of 2006 honda reached its limit in the third quarter of 2007
