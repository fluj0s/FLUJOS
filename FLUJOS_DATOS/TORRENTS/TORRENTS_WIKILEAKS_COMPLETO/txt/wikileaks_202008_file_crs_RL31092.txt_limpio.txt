phasedown period 20012009 updated april 1 2005 nonna noto specialist in public finance government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress calculating estate tax liability during the estate tax phasedown period 20012009 summary this report provides basic explanation of how to calculate the federal estate tax liability for taxable estate of any given size using the schedule of marginal tax rates and the applicable credit amount for the year of death the amount of any persons taxable estate that is free from tax is known formally as the applicable exclusion amount or informally as the exemption the applicable exclusion amount is not subtracted from the net taxable estate as an exemption or deduction would be rather it is converted into tax credit equal to the tax that would be due on taxable estate the size of the applicable exclusion amount unlike deduction which is worth more to taxpayers in higher marginal tax rate brackets the applicable credit amount is worth the same regardless of the estates top marginal tax brackets to determine the estate tax liability first calculate the tentative tax that would be due on the entire taxable estate from the marginal tax rate table for the year of death then subtract the applicable credit amount for the year of death from the tentative tax to determine the net tax due numerical example is presented in the text and in worksheet for 5 million taxable estate of decedent dying in 2005 blank worksheet is provided for readers to make their own calculations for 2004 and 2005 the applicable exclusion amount or estate tax exemption is 15 million the corresponding applicable credit amount is 555800 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 egtrra gradually lowered the maximum estate tax rate and substantially raised the applicable exclusion amount and thus the corresponding applicable credit amount over the years 2002 through 2009 the tables in the appendix to this report present the marginal estate tax rates and the applicable exclusion amount for each year of this phasedown period the maximum tax rate fell from 55 on taxable estate over 3 million plus 5 surtax from 10 million to 17 million under prior law in 2001 to 50 on taxable estate in excess of 25 million in 2002 it was then scheduled to fall by one percentage point per year down to 45 on amounts in excess of 15 million in 20072009 the applicable exclusion amount rose from 675000 in 2001 to 1 million in 2002 and 2003 and 15 million in 2004 and 2005 it is scheduled to rise further to 2 million in 2006 through 2008 and to 35 million in 2009 egtrra repealed the estate tax for decedents dying in 2010 however all of the provisions under the act are scheduled to sunset on december 31 2010 unless changed beforehand in 2011 the law will revert back to what it would have been had egtrra never been enacted the first table in the appendix presents the marginal tax rates that applied in 2001 prior to egtrra and that would apply again in 2011 and beyond however in 2011 and after the applicable exclusion amount would be 1 million in contrast to 675000 in 2001 this report will not be updated

calculating estate tax liability during the estate tax phasedown period 20012009 this report provides basic explanation of how to calculate the federal estate tax liability on taxable estate of any given size it uses the schedule of marginal estate tax rates and the applicable exclusion amount as provided in the internal revenue code and the corresponding applicable credit amount for the year of death the report does not address how to determine the value of the taxable estate except to note that deductions from the gross estate are permitted for funeral expenses costs of administering the estate debts and mortgages owed charitable bequests and bequests to the surviving spouse nor does the report explain the accompanying tax on gifts made during persons lifetime or the generationskipping transfer tax1 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 egtrra pronounced eggtra phased out the federal estate tax over the years 2002 2009 egtrra lowered the top marginal estate tax rate gradually and raised the applicable exclusion amount and consequently the corresponding applicable credit amount in large increments over the phasedown period egtrra repealed the estate tax for decedents dying in 2010 but the estate tax repeal and all other provisions of egtrra are scheduled to sunset on december 31 20102 unless changed beforehand in 2011 the law will revert to what it would have been had egtrra never been enacted applicable exclusion amount and applicable credit amount it is common parlance to say that certain amount of decedents assets are free from excluded from or exempt from the estate tax however the applicable exclusion amount is not subtracted from the value of the net taxable estate before applying the schedule of tax rates as true exemption or deduction 1 for more information about these topics see crs report rl30600 estate and gift taxes economic issues by jane g gravelle and steven maguire and crs report 95416 federal estate gift and generation skipping taxes description of current law by john r luckey 2 for fuller explanation of the estate tax provisions in egtrra see crs report rl31061 estate and gift tax law changes under the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 by nonna noto and crs report rs20989 federal estate gift and generationskipping transfer taxes modification phase out and repeal under the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 by john r luckey crs2 would be instead the exclusion amount is converted into tax credit known as the applicable credit amount the credit is equal to the tax that would be due on taxable estate the size of the applicable exclusion amount for the year of death this tax credit is subtracted from the tentative tax liability on the entire taxable estate unlike deduction which is worth more to taxpayers in higher marginal tax rate brackets the applicable credit amount is worth the same dollar amount regardless of the estates top tax brackets however the credit is nonrefundable that is it cannot reduce estate tax liability below zero consequently taxable estates that are smaller than the applicable exclusion amount are not able to take full advantage of the available credit the applicable exclusion amount also serves as the tax filing threshold an estate tax return must be filed if the gross value of the estate exceeds the applicable exclusion amount for the year of death this filing requirement holds even if the estates taxable value falls below this amount after subtracting eligible deductions such that estate tax is owed3 table 1 presents the applicable exclusion amount and the corresponding applicable credit amount for each year from 2001 until 2011 and beyond in 2001 prior to egtrra the applicable exclusion amount was 675000 it was scheduled to rise gradually to 1 million for 2006 and beyond under provisions of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 tra egtrra raised the applicable exclusion amount to 1 million immediately for 2002 and 2003 it raised the amount further to 15 million for 2004 and 2005 2 million for 20062008 and finally 35 million for 2009 it repealed the estate tax for 2010 only if the sunset provision of egtrra is not repealed or the law is not otherwise changed beforehand in 2011 estate tax law will return to what it would have been had egtrra not been enacted under the provisions of tra of 1997 that would mean an applicable exclusion amount of 1 million for the years 2011 and beyond not 675000 the applicable credit amount was calculated by crs by using the estate tax rate schedule to determine the tentative tax on taxable estate the size of the applicable exclusion amount for the estates of decedents dying in 2004 or 2005 the applicable credit amount is 555800 corresponding to the estate tax on an applicable exclusion amount of 15 million for 20062008 the applicable credit amount is scheduled to rise to 780800 corresponding to the estate tax on an applicable exclusion amount of 2 million for 2009 the applicable credit amount is 1455800 corresponding to the estate tax on 35 million for 2011 and beyond the applicable credit amount is scheduled to return to 345800 the amount in effect for 20022003 corresponding to the estate tax on 1 million and not to the credit of 220550 in effect for 2001 corresponding to the estate tax on 675000 3 less than half of estate tax returns filed in 1998 through 2003 were taxable for additional information see crs report rl32768 estate and gift tax revenues several measurements by nonna noto

credit amount was calculated by crs marginal tax rates appendix presents the graduated schedule of federal estate and gift tax rates for each year from 2001 through 2009 as an example here we will use the rates that apply to decedent dying in 2005 shown in table a5 rising marginal tax rates apply to different portions of an estate the statutory rates range from 18 for the taxable value of estates below 10000 up to 47 for taxable value over 2 million in practice for 2005 however the lowest marginal estate tax rate affecting the value of deductions or increments to the estate is not 18 but 45 this is the rate corresponding to taxable estate values in the range over 15 million but not over 2 million the maximum marginal rate for 2005 is 47 on taxable estate values over 2 million the applicable exclusion amount for 2005 exempts from tax the first 15 million in taxable estate per decedent the exclusion is emphasized by gray shading over the first 13 rows of table a5 these rows encompass taxable estate values from 0 to 15 million and the corresponding statutory marginal tax rates from 18 to 43 an explanatory row is inserted in the table to indicate where the applicable exclusion amount for 2005 of 15 million falls within the graduated rate table crs4 calculating estate tax liability the steps involved in calculating the net estate tax liability on taxable estate of any given size are laid out in the worksheet shown in tables 2 and 3 table 2 contains numerical example for an estate with taxable value of 5 million for decedent dying in 2005 table 3 is blank worksheet provided for readers to make their own calculations two basic steps are involved in calculating the estate tax liability the first is to calculate the tentative tax due on taxable estate of the size in question based on the tax rate schedule in the appropriate table in appendix for the year of death the second is to subtract from the tentative tax the applicable credit amount for the year of the decedents death shown in the last column of table 1 calculating the tentative tax in turn includes four steps the first is finding in the tax rate table the amount of tax due at the bottom of the bracket in which the estate value falls the second is calculating the amount of estate in excess of the bottom of the bracket the third is multiplying that excess amount by the marginal tax rate to determined the additional tax the fourth is adding that additional tax to the tax due at the bottom of the bracket in table 2 the value of the taxable estate 5 million is entered in line 1 column to determine the tentative tax on the estate of decedent dying in 2005 look down the first column of table a5 and find the bracket that encompasses the taxable value of the estate for an estate of 5 million that is the top bracket beginning with 2 million column c of the last row of table a5 shows that the tax on 2 million is 780800 this equals the sum of the taxes due from all of the preceding brackets in the table enter this amount in line 2 column b next calculate the amount of the estate in excess of 2 million the bottom of the tax rate bracket in column subtract line 2 from line 1 and enter the difference of 3 million on line 3 this 3 million is taxed at marginal rate of 47 as shown in the last row of table a5 enter 047 on line 4 multiply line 4 047 times line 3 3000000 enter the resulting additional tax of 1410000 on line 5 in column and again in column b in column b add the additional tax of 1410000 on line 5 to the 780800 on line 2 and enter total tentative tax of 2190800 on the 5 million estate on line 6 next find the applicable credit amount corresponding to the year of the decedents death in the last column of table 1 for person dying in 2005 the tax credit is 555800 enter this amount on line 7 this corresponds to the tax that would be due on an estate of 15 million the applicable exclusion amount for 2005 subtract the applicable credit amount of 555800 on line 7 from the tentative tax of 2190800 on line 6 and enter the resulting net estate tax liability of 1635000 on line 8 the tax of 1635000 on taxable estate of 5 million represents an average tax rate of 33 crs5 table 2 sample calculation of estate tax liability for taxable estate of 5000000 of decedent dying in 2005 estate value b and marginal tax liability line instruction tax rate 1 enter

of calculating the estate tax other tax credits can affect the final federal estate tax liability prior to egtrra an estate could claim credit subject to limit for state death taxes paid on the estate egtrra phased out the state tax credit by 25 percentage points per year from 2002 through 2004 in 2005 the credit was replaced with deduction credits may still be claimed for foreign death taxes and for federal estate taxes paid on property that was transferred to the decedent within the past 10 years subject to phaseout limits crs7 from 1998 through 2003 estates with qualified familyowned business interests qfobi could claim special deduction of up to 675000 that could reduce the value of their applicable exclusion amount to 625000 egtrra repealed this special deduction as of 2004 when the applicable exclusion amount for all estates reached 15 million this surpassed the 13 million in combined deduction and exclusion previously available only to estates with qualified familyowned business interests under egtrra the estate and gift taxes remain unified through 2009 the amount of lifetime gifts that claim the gift tax exclusion is subject to cumulative lifetime limit of 1 million for 2002 and thereafter the exclusion claimed for taxable lifetime gifts is subtracted to determine the applicable exclusion amount remaining available to persons estate at death the amount of taxable lifetime gifts is included in the base used to calculate the tentative estate tax including gifts affects where the estate falls in the marginal tax rate schedule however the estate is then credited for taxes previously paid on taxable lifetime gift transfers in 2010 the gift tax will remain in place when the estate tax is repealed the lifetime applicable exclusion amount for gifts will remain at 1 million the maximum rate of tax will be 35 on cumulative gifts over 500000 finally separate tax is levied on generationskipping transfers through 2009 crs8 appendix federal estate tax rate schedules for 2001 through 2009 and 2011 and beyond during the phasedown period for the estate tax from 2002 through 2009 the provisions of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 egtrra gradually reduce the maximum estate tax rate and substantially raise the applicable exclusion amount the tables in this appendix present the changes yearbyyear the graduated rates from 18 to 43 established under prior law continue to apply to estate values up to 15 million the maximum estate tax rate dropped from 55 on taxable estate values over 3 million plus 5 surtax in specified range over 10 million in 2001 under prior law to 50 on taxable estates over 25 million in 2002 the maximum tax rate continues to drop by one percentage point per year down to 45 on taxable estate values over 15 million in 20072009 notes at the bottom of each table summarize any reduction in the maximum estate tax rate or increase in the applicable exclusion amount scheduled to take effect that year there is an explanatory row in each table indicating the applicable exclusion amount for that year of death taxable estate values up to the applicable exclusion amount are protected from tax by the unified tax credit for the year the marginal tax rates that affect the value of deductions from or increments to the estate are those above the exclusion amount the applicable exclusion amount of 2 million for 20072008 and 35 million for 2009 will fall within the top marginal tax rate bracket of 45 which will begin at estate values over 15 million the tax rates presented in table a1 are the rates that were in effect prior to enactment of egtrra they continued to apply to the estates of decedents who died in 2001 they are also the rates that will be reinstated in 2011 if egtrra is allowed to sunset on december 31 2010 one notable difference is that the applicable exclusion amount will be 1 million for 2011 and beyond in contrast to 675000 in 2001 under provision of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 105 34 the estate tax rate schedules for 20022009 presented in this appendix were created by crs the tax rate schedule under prior law from section 2001c1 of the
