madam secretary your paris embassy and the french are eager to welcome you to france fm kouchner quickly invited you to lunch or meeting on sunday which is not usual practice he looks forward to talking with you about key issues including afghanistan iran and relations with russia kouchner recently visited afghanistan and he will undoubtedly be interested in hearing your insights about recent developments there and your views on pakistan france is our strongest ally in pursuing dual track policy with iran and has been helpful in rallying europe to more cleareyed assessment of irans nuclear ambitions paris welcomed the us reset with russia and views moscow as strategic partner that cannot be ignored end summary sarkozy and kouchner 2 snf fm kouchner coming from the opposition socialist party is regularly polled as one of the most popular french politicians and is highprofile example of sarkozys successful policy of outreach to the leaders of other political parties he has solid working relationship with the demanding french president kouchner has also carved out specific areas where he has largely free rein and which play to his strengths and previous experience including in humanitarian affairs the balkans and democratization efforts despite these positives we have occasionally witnessed lapses in communication between the two offices due to sarkozys tendency to seize the initiative and speak first consult later and his penchant for proposing highlevel summits to cut through bureaucratic red tape 3 snf both sarkozy and kouchner are committed to strong europe with strong transatlantic relationship with the us both see europe as our closest most natural partner in fighting terrorism in afghanistan and piracy on the high seas or promoting peace as part of the middle east peace process quartet fighting irans nuclear weapons ambitions and in stabilizing the balkans likewise they view france and neighboring germany as the natural leaders of europe kouchner and sarkozy both have pragmatic approach to problems characterized by high degree of hands on personal involvement in the issues that interest them your visit will give fm kouchner an opportunity to showcase his close ties to you and to the obama administration vindicating frances unabashed proamerican stance which is significant reversal from the chirac years when france defined its power more in opposition to rather than collaboration with the united states afghanistan same goals limited resources 4 cnf fm kouchner was in afghanistan on october 1718 on purely political trip designed to consult with the main presidential candidates and to move the electoral process forward he cooperated closely with senator kerry to send combined message of support for the acceptance of second round of voting afghanistan remains high foreign policy priority for the french government but they have difficulty translating their interest into additional concrete military and civilian support french government officials including both president sarkozy and fm kouchner have long advocated that there is purely military solution to afghanistan when it comes to putting resources behind the statement however the french government has limited options due to political maneuvering and real economic constraints as sop to his own party in exchange for support for french reintegration into nato this april sarkozy has publicly and repeatedly promised not to send one extra soldier to fight an unpopular war in afghanistan this is now political line french leaders will not cross although their military has privately expressed both the will and the capacity for further contributions to compensate the gof is currently shifting some of its troops from security posture in kabul paris 00001473 0022 of 004 to more active combat roles in the east where the bulk of their 3000 troops are now located in march president sarkozy created frances first politicallyappointed special representative to afghanistan and pakistan post now held by sarkozy crony ump deputy thierry mariani kouchner fought this appointment in favor of career diplomat because political appointments in the french parliamentary system are limited to six months in length limiting the effectiveness of the position as it currently functions 5 cnf there is great interest particularly within the mfa and from kouchner personally to increase french civilian development assistance to afghanistan with focus on raising the salaries of afghan police and other security forces however these goals are tempered by very limited resources after battle with the finance ministry the mfa succeeded in restoring french civilian assistance to afghanistan to previous modest levels of 40 million euros 584 million us dollars after budget cuts threatened to limit french assistance to only 10 million euros this year about 146 million us dollars one additional area for growth is the deployment by december 1 of the bulk of the 150 french gendarmes who make up part of the european gendarmerie force for police training they will be joined soon by italian carabinieri and possibly small contributions from other countries in the coming year president sarkozy is expected to finally take longdelayed trip to the region next spring 6 cnf in september the french president joined his german and uk counterparts to propose conference on afghanistan by the end of the year kouchner wanted to bring other foreign ministers to paris to meet you to pursue this european goal french officials have since stated that if the security situation allows they would like the conference to take place in kabul as soon as possible with possible second session taking place later after the afghan government is better able to prioritize its work plan and strategy pakistan coin and civilian loans 7 cnf on pakistan the french are relative newcomers who have requested close cooperation with the uk and united states particularly in areas of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency assistance france is providing military assistance and security cooperation to pakistan in addition to civilian emergency and humanitarian aid paris officials complain that pakistani cooperation in combating the afghan taliban refuged in their country is weak if not nonexistent france has given about five million euros 73 million us dollars in emergency and reconstruction assistance to pakistan this year france has also increased its concessionary loan commitments to pakistan since the april tokyo conference from 200 to 382 million euros 573 million us dollars the loans cover nine projects in the areas of hydroelectricity and energy efficiency france is still also dispensing funds made under soft loans worth 11 million euros 16 million us dollars for postearthquake reconstruction it is not yet ready to contribute to the world bankadministered multidonor trust fund for pakistan as it was not clear who their partners on the pakistani side would be and what safeguards there would be over the funds iran fears that we are losing ground 8 snf in their october 14 phone call presidents sarkozy and obama agreed that if iran responds negatively to the uranium enrichment deal on the table then we must take more serious measures including additional sanctions senior french officials believe that we are losing traction on this issue within the international community as countries continue to engage in normal diplomatic and commercial relations with iran exemplified by chinese business interests turkish pm erdogans recent visit to iran and iranian president ahmedinejads planned trip to brazil in late november sarkozys position is bolstered by his staunch paris 00001473 0032 of 004 belief in nonproliferation to maintain frances own deterrent capability his real concern about the threat to israel and his personal ire at the way iran has tried to manipulate france including by holding french citizen clotilde reiss and francoiranian dual national nazak afshar for alleged illegal participation in this summers street protests some senior french officials have suggested that sarkozys tough line can be useful as the pointy edge of the sword in meeting the iranian challenge as we plan next steps on iran kouchner will likely be interested in your readout of your recent discussions in moscow as well as the latest efforts to bring china on board pushing engagement with russia 9 cnf french policy toward russia under president sarkozy reflects the belief that engagement with moscow is the best way to influence russian behavior paris has welcomed us efforts to reset relations with russia and has consistently emphasized developing common approach with washington toward moscow french officials maintain that dialogue must underpin our efforts to elicit moscows cooperation this is particularly true on european security an area in which sarkozy who last year proposed an osce summit on the issue seeks to exert french leadership french priorities for strategic dialogue with moscow include promoting economic cooperation encouraging russia to work through institutions with set rules supporting russian actions in public while taking more honest approach in private meetings and cultivating relations with russian president dmitri medvedev in the hope that he can become leader independent of vladimir putin putin is due in paris later this month sarkozy will go to moscow in february and medvedev will visit france in march 2010 an urgent focus on climate change 10 sbu the french remain divided on how to respond to the obama administrations approaches to climate change most of the interested public and many in the government believe that interim 2020 reduction targets and the level of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and concentrations at that time will determine success or failure in slowing global warming for them the eus target of 20 to 30 percent reductions below 1990 is the sole measure of an acceptable policy even sophisticated observers are skeptical that longterm reduction goals legislated in the united states can be counted on as more than aspirations especially if radical cuts are not imposed up front we have reiterated that us laws are reliably enforced by the federal government and by us courts using the clean air act as our example ministry of foreign affairs officials agree that legislation moving through congress and the administrations proposals would establish system comparable to the eus measures these officials regard environment minister jeanlouis borloos public criticisms of waxmanmarkey as insufficient on the medium term goal as distracting attention from the need for china and india to reduce their rates of growth in ghg emissions wants to be player in the middle east 11 snf the gof is eager to engage with the united states on the middle east peace process and worries we are not moving fast enough president sarkozy and fm kouchner continue to press for middle east peace summit before the end of the year to be held under the auspices of the union for the mediterranean of which egypt and france are currently cochairs sense of frustration and ambition informs the french approach toward the middle east peace process they are frustrated that they must rely on the usg and on stubborn parties in the region to end conflict whose persistence adversely affects their national interests and they are ambitious to play larger role in the peace process in order to facilitate successful outcome and to enjoy the prestige that such role would earn them as case in point last week kouchner had to cancel planned visit to israel and the palestinian territories in part because of the continuing tension there and in part because of israels refusal to allow him paris 00001473 0042 of 004 to visit french hospital in gaza nonetheless aside from their criticism of the pace at which we have proceeded with negotiations french officials continue to take concrete steps to support our efforts to broker peace among the various states and groups in the region they have consistently affirmed our leadership role in their own bilateral contacts in multilateral fora and in public and private statements increasing concerns about us focus on disarmament 12 snf french officials are increasingly concerned that the obama administrations commitment to an eventual world free of nuclear weapons represents divergence from the french position on strong deterrence policy furthermore they worry that focus on disarmament goals by legitimate nuclear weapons states will pressure them to cut their own modest arsenal and will serve as distraction from serious proliferation concerns by states like north korea and iran the gof would like to use every available forum including the 2010 npt review conference to strongly and specifically rebuke iran and north korea and were greatly disappointed by our decision not to do so at the september 24 unsc summit additionally france is psychologically committed to deterrent force as symbol of its strategic independence and they will strive to maintain the legitimacy of nuclear weapons as key element of military strategy any suggestion that bilateral usrussian arms reduction talks should eventually include other nuclear powers or that an fmct should address existing stockpiles are absolute redlines for the french partner in africa 13 c france is struggling somewhat to implement sarkozys vision of new approach to africa in part because of recent governance crises in number of francophone countries including mauritania gabon madagascar niger and guinea where the need for expediency in bringing stability can sometimes trump loftier principles we are still waiting to see if france will in fact close down one of its military bases on the atlantic side in senegal or gabon in an effort to streamline its presence in africa that said france is progressively more open interlocutor on africa and there are many areas where we are working closely including pushing for transitional government in guinea supporting efforts to deter sexual violence and increasingly coordinating on addressing the aqim threat in mali and mauritania the mfas initial response to our new sudan strategy is positive france as the leader of the eus anti piracy effort off the horn of africa is an important partner on counterpiracy and maritime security issues rivkin
