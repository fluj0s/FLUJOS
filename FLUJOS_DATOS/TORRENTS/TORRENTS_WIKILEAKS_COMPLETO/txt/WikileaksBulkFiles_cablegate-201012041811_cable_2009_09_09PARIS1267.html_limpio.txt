subject hadopi 2 french assembly approves internet piracy sanctions bill ref paris 559 1 on september 15 the french national assembly approved the sanctions portion of the gofs disputed internet piracy law by 285 votes in favor and 225 against including some members of the ump majority party nicknamed hadopi 2 this draft bill complements the law creation and the internet passed in june hadopi 1reftel hadopi 2 provides for two written warnings and then suspension of internet access by judge joint parliamentarian committee will hold final vote on the bill on september 22 2 the socialist party has already announced that it will challenge hadopi 2 in front of the constitutional council notably because they believe the bills ordonnance pnale deprives potential offenders of the ability to defend themselves properly record companies film producers and artists have supported the governments bid to crack down on internet piracy recording industry organization snep estimates that it has destroyed 50 percent of the value of the french recorded music market in six years other french organizations representing major and independent labels songwriters and publishers noted that the new legislation should put an end to years of laissezfaire resulting in sharp erosion of their income the original hadopi 1 bill includes an elaborate system of sanctions devised to that effect and ranges from 1500euro fine and monthlong suspension for allowing third party to pirate music or films using their web connection to 300000 euros in fines and three years imprisonment for counterfeiters 3 french culture minister frederic mitterrand who pushed for this bill last summer stressed that artists would remember that we had the political courage to finally break the laissezfaire attitude and to protect their rights from those who want to turn the internet into ground for their libertarian utopia last week mitterand announced he would submit bill hadopi 3 to improve online legal offerings by the end of the year by then hadopi 1 and 2 will be operational he said mitterand appointed patrick zelnik ceo of french independent label naove which produces carla brunis music to develop the hadopi 3 proposals in the meantime parti pirate the first french affiliate of piracy pirate international will present candidate in the september 20 interim election for vacant seat in the national
