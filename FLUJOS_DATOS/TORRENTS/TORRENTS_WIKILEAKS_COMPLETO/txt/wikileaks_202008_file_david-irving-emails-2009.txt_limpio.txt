date sat nov 7 2009 254 pm jeff lives in raleigh as you know since he is coming to our raleigh function we discussed this yesterday and yes you were listening i think the socalled unhelpful and hostile messages were things that need to be said i dont like the way you have been treating you asked for more advance notice if i wanted to flounce out i am considering it you were very well behaved on this whole tour up until this past week when you have been snotty rude and disrespectful towards this is exactly the same way you behaved last summer and the very reason i flounced out then i dont care if you are frustrated angry stressed out tired or whatever treating anybody the way you have been treating is unacceptable i bend over backwards to help you out on this tour doing jobs that last year you would have done yourself and not just making bookings but also doing things like driving helping you secure funds to reprint books and locating secondhand books the only thanks i usually get are long whines about how something isnt exactly perfect why would anybody in the world want to work with or even be friends with someone who is acting the way you have been acting lately you like to say you treat better than anyone else does but the truth is lately you have treated worse than anyone else ever has it hurts my feelings it makes angry and resentful and it makes question whether or not i should be doing this job anymore sorry to have to say that but im trying to head off major conflict please start treating with more courtesy and respect i really am doing the best i can in the limited time i have available to from focalpaolcom date sat 7 nov 2009 094351 0500 subject re richmond to desolate_ever_after_1hotmailcom in message dated 71109 93041 am

to go to richmond i have and had idea where your friend lives is this the shooter friend you do not always tell your plans in detail we can change things around so far your friends do not seem to to be worth much upheaval however you probably think the same about mine as for your more unhelpful and hostile messages get over it i have been working since 6 am this morning trying to catch up and plug holes you have left eg by not bothering to inform the sala thai longer exists from focalpaolcom to desolate_ever_after_1hotmailcom subject answers date sat nov 7 2009 316 pm your messages have been increasingly illjudged this morning i assume you are not feeling well and are taking it out on okay thats what men friends are for and b you are instinctively trying to distract from what i see as the accumulating omissions of the last few days 2 if you want to quit i cant stop you it will not be the first time i have been let down at the last moment and by your own account you have done the same to others too i will then fulfil my obligations without you advice it might be good idea if you refrain from kneejerk retorting 3 i am still not able to email todays raleigh guests with location

douglas not paid address or phone number raymond peters maybe cannot confirm please phone misspelled name of his own city ask what his interest is how he found out etc d mark maybe insufficient details has paid phone ask questions if phone or email is dud then randall vega probably okay confirmed name and address middle aged male wife is dawn rodriguez phoned did not register did not give any personal details if phones again blow him off had plenty of time to register properly and said he would but did not alan rogers probably okay says friend of bobby ammons check with bobby if yes

so cheaply in 1940 caused the holocaut it forced germany into corner you should continually blame the jews who controlled churchill with causing their own disaster also blame the jews for the loss of

focalpaolcom date wed oct 28 2009 859 pm david the venue for richmond is exactly the same as last year i just had lunch with my father out that way and stopped by the restaurant to sign the deposit manakin grille 12912 plaza drive richmond va 23233 8047840544 the venue is reserved under my name chip lamb my phone number and wonderfully disguised julies idea without even being asked as book signing not yours or some group so just in case some nasty is poking around they will come up with nothing hopefully as last year we will have trouble the owners darren julie witten and their staff are the same as last year and they remembered you and how good the event was last year our waiter even asked after you your well being this waiter remembered exactly what tables he used and where they were placed so the layout of the room will be the same as well you are clear to come in and set up as early as 5pm and we are welcome to stay past their closing time of 9pm as needed see if you can word it certain way to those planning to attend that it would be nice not to lose money for such nice supportive and discreet locale and that they should have steak and glass of wine or two rather than small sandwich and glass of water perhaps you have other ideas along these lines based on your experience in these events we continue to learn and improve so you are in raleigh the evening prior will you come up here sat pm and spend the night with us it is under 3 hrs to our house problem if you come in late i make that trip all the time coming back from car auctions i am off to hilton head sc tomorrow through sunday for concours delegance and couple meetings expect ill be back later than midday monday still hopeful for sunday night this email address goes to my blackberry as does the

roygodenauhotmailcom date tue oct 27 2009 1133 pm hi roy i believe the good bishop knows well the hound technique of these bloodseeking sharks ill also send this on to our heroic lawyer here in london in case he can come up with one of his perspicacious suggestions meantime i am devastated to hear of attorney jûrgen riegers stroke and dreadful rumours that already he may be brain dead if so germany will have lost formidable champion and we will have lost splendid comrade i am hoping and hoping and anxiously awaiting news that this is not going to or have already happened and that we still have him at our side i have only two precious little filmed interviews from him for my forthcoming jailing the lawyers but i always meant to get in another one but each time i tried to it proved not the right moment for him an attorney soldier always very heavily workoverloaded and ever at many humane frontline best wishes michèle on 27 oct 2009 at 2147 roy armstrong wrote hello lady m please tell the good bishop that he is obligated to refute the charges they will use it to hound him if he doesnt the german law specifies that such an act would have to occur in the jurisdiction of the brd filming an interview to be shown in another country does not fill the requirements of 130 in any way even if it could be viewed in germanistan as i recall he filmed the interview with swedish tv to be shown there and not in germany judicia is the whore of politics and such strafbefehl should never have been issued it constitutes rechtsbeugung bending the law 130 is socalled rubber law anyway which the criminal jewowned politicians like to have stretched to serve any purpose to imply that statements on the holyhoax would incite the german people are patently absurd it is however blatent proof that the brd is zionistcontrolled entity it does in fact constitute censorship by other means which is unconstitutional even in zionist germanistan keep up the gute arbeit regards roy in germanistan

stabbedtalkholocaustdenierdavidirvinghtml re last night at ritz carlto9n from john johntipofthespeartv to focalpaolcom date tue oct 27 2009 744 pm i respect your wishes you are certainly free to choose who can or cant attend your events however i regret that you are holding responsible for last evenings incident i have not associated myself with anyone that illegally carries weapons uses weapons or engages in violence as solution to problem if they were invited by someone in my party then they may have been invited through an indirect relationship and if that is the case then sincerely i apologize to you to everyone in attendance and the community as whole my sources within law enforcement tell that the husband or boyfriend of the woman that was going to sell books for you brought several knives and firearm that he dumped out of his pocket while running away from the authorities i have seen the security tape that clearly shows the gentleman using the knife in an aggressive and not defensive manner in addition i have inspected the damage done to the ritz carlton and the damage can be undone by carpet cleaning if there was some other damage that i am not aware of then the staff did not point it out i think some self examination on your part is warranted but you cant ask yourself not to attend future events it seems the questionable association was trojan horse within your own house if i had not walked out into the hallway when i did and removed the knife from the young mans hand then someone may have been killed the weapon could have been used against the young man if it came into the possession of less responsible individual this was the extent of my involvement and i have never seen any of those people that were involved prior to that evening my expertise lies in the area of security prevention and protection it may be wise for you to have metal detector at future speaking engagements and provide security for your own interest although i am strong supporter of your work my attendance was meant to prevent or contain any such incident from happening i am happy that my actions may have prevented the death of person as self proclaimed author and speaker that documents true or real events in history it would make sense that you would approach this incident in the same manner as you have approached your historical accounts of world war ii it is clear that you have not taken such steps you have not gathered the evidence or conducted any interviews like you have done while tackling your past and current works of history instead it seems you have implemented the tactics of your opponents and have directed them against i am saddened by your choice but as i stated before i respect your wishes and continue to support and admire your work i wish you success in all your future endeavors and thank you for giving this community the opportunity to hear the truth sincerely jb from focalpaolcom mailtofocalpaolcom sent tuesday october 27 2009

union can tell you where i can go where system is working i have lots of things to do and just dont have more time to give this and would prefer not to be involved 1021 am i reply kevin we are 450

international calls there is western union office in conduit street near the park lane end south side they never let us down this is one of those days jae now replies 1 i really am quite displeased

ive been to 4 places and all say system down ive more time to waste on this so if you can locate one that is working and called them to make sure then i will go otherwise the recipient can send

good crowd and jae calculates kneeling on the floor in the suite as per the custom of all or at least most of my former assistants over the years the cash take at about 2200 including two good donations from greg gant and drew campbell we are both semiexhausted after yet another long day and she is great assistant in every way saturday october 17 2009 irving houston texas up at 940 am after long night 1032 am i send out very late the notification for tonights location we omit ira bleiweiss and mary lee webeck after jae works her magic on them her magic machine reveals that ira bleiweiss is proisraeli activist while webeck is director of education at the holocaust museum in houston bleiweiss has given us fictitious name ira wise and false phone number and webeck too is hostile they get directions to the laquinta at hobby airport in houston instead last years location twenty or thirty miles away on the road to houston by 130 pm statement from mayor johnson of jackson mississippi about david irving neither the city of jackson nor i am hosting the david irving event at city hall i will not be at this event and i have not communicated at all with david irving in fact i do not support or endorse the claims made by david irving it is my understanding that city hall council chambers was reserved through the city clerks office which has purview over scheduling that venue based on the counsel of the city legal department the city of jackson cannot legally ban someone from speaking in city hall based on their political beliefs andor the content of their speech posted by ronni

fills until only four chairs are left empty those which would normally have been filled by bleiweiss and his guests and webeck at 650 pm ms webeck shortly phones from 512 632 4137 sweetly enough i am at laquinta at the airport but cant find the meeting ah then you are there and we are here i say evenly and add you probably know why we have not give you the actual location few minutes later at 653 pm bleiweiss phones from 713 898 3102 for the same reason i give him the same answer and add you will find nice female there from the holocaust museum and you may wish to have an enjoyable evening chatting with her oh bother he doubt says or words in hebrew to that effect but i have already hung up seconds later he phones again furious we are coming over to where you are now he snarls how can he know the real location journalist then phones but i fob her off until later tonight i doubt he is keen to hear my talk but nonetheless i go into the foyer and remove all signs relating to the meeting and try to convey to the large overweight black seated alone at the reception desk that he is not to assist any angrylooking wronguns who come in asking where we are it proves difficult to make him understand sunday october 19 2009 houston texas covington louisiana up at 8 am quick breakfast two or three hours work then downtown for an interview at 1130 am with page of the houston chronicle at don diegos café in travis street she is pleasant tanned woman of 46 with prepared list of questions inevitable predictable inflexible holocaust racism etc she turns out to have accompanied the troublemakers including she says black activist at their invitation to the quinta at hobby airport last night from where she phoned so it is just as well that i did not invite her straight round to the meeting to attend last night as my instinct had at first suggested i apologise for her inconvenience but explain that it was their purpose to stop speaking to sixty or seventy consenting adults who wished to hear my views toward the end of the interview she becomes fascinated with the blonde bombshell sitting at my right who as usual consistently but sometimes even helpfully puts her oar in to our interview i emphasise that there is nothing going on between us couple of drifters come over to our little huddle in the houston market square the first white or rather graylooking meth addict who shuffles over crumpled and pathetic and incurable and gets five dollars from to go away so that our interview can continue the second few minutes later is thin young black girl sonia who turns out to be thirtyone born in chicago she never knew her mother or father her brother and sister are somewhere she knows not where her grandmother abused her and she finally quit doing marijuana and crack four months ago i am clean she says she wants cash to go over the road ahead to subway she nods in that direction and when i give her five bucks too she asks innocently can i add 41 cents as she wants to get footlong whatever that is because of four drugrelated felonies including supplying charge she cannot get work anywhere of course so it is hopeless cycle for her i tell her that the prison i was in was full of people with the same problem and beam of recognition of an unlikely fellowfelon spreads across her face dere aint nothing to be shamed of she says everybody goes to prison at some time sad reflection of her own colored world view she sleeps under dat bridge over dere she says pointing backwards without turning round to where the police few days ago trashed all her few possessions she has bummed coarseknit pullover off somebody its arms several inches too long there is something about her that leaves born sceptic accustomed to the wily romanian gypsy beggars of londons west end mildly suspicious her clothes are rather clean for somebody sleeping rough her teeth are polished and perfect though one at the back is missing and her english is very articulate and her vocabulary well organised at one point she says i have to fend them off an unusually well chosen phrase for black she has nearly completed college when the drug disaster hit she explains jae finds her convincing on an impulse i empty my pockets of cash and hand all the crumpled notes to sonia without opening them around thirtyfive or forty dollars all that jae allows to carry around page the chronicle journalist makes effort to follow suit and before the black goes i lever myself to my feet off the stone bench where we are all sitting and give this pathetic but friendly human being hug if you ever need any help i tell her mischievously indicating the journalist phone the chronicle and ask for page long drive over to new orleans in heavy traffic along the narrow i10 interstate highway follows lasting six or seven hours and it is nine pm before we get into the hotel brand new one which jae has found and which opened only two weeks ago the rooms are very pleasant but as usual jae turns the suites heating system to below icecold larry dicks larry_m_dhotmailcom has written i enjoyed your houston lecture very much and was glad to see that
