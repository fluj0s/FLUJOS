restriction has the effect of imposing an undue burden on womans right to obtain an abortion although the new standard was not form ally adopted by the court until 1992 in planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey justice oconnors opinions on abortion prior to casey had already expressed dissatisfaction with the trimester framework established in roe v wade and an interest in cons idering abortion restrictions based on whether they imposed an undue burde n on the right to obtain an abortion this report will examine justice oconnors notable opinions on abortion and explore her role in the development of the undue burden standard justice oconnor first addr essed the legitimacy of abortion restrictions in city of akron v akron center for reproductive health case involving five provisions of an akron ohio ordinance that regula ted the performance of abortions1 the five provisions imposed various restrictions on abortion incl uding parental consent requirement for unemancipated minors and re quirement that all abortions performed after the first trimester be performed in hospital the court determined by 63 vote that the five provisions of the ordinance were unconstitutional after reaffirming its decision in roe the court indicated that the five provisions did not comply with that decision and the trimester framework articulated in that case2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22198crs2 2 continued abortion legislative response by karen j lewis and jon shimabukuro 3 city of akron 462 us at 45657 4 city of akron 462 us at 458 5 maher v roe 432

akron in her dissent justice oconnor maintained that the trimester framework established in roe was unworkable she explained that technologi cal advances not only made abortions more safe but also blurred the line between pe rmissible and impermissible regulations of abortion just as improvements in medical technology inevitably will move forward the point at which the state may regulate for reasons of maternal health different technological improvements will move backward the point of viability at which the state may proscribe abortions except when necessary to preserve the life and health of the mother3 justice oconnor maintained that the trimester framework which used the end of the first trimester and viability as reference points for regulati on was inappropriate because of decreased medical risks and earlier fetal viability as medical risks associated with various abortion procedures decreased it w ould seem that restrictions on abortion to preserve maternal health woul d probably not be imposed at th end of the first trimester but rather at later time in womans pregna ncy closer to childbirth in addition under the trimester framework earlier fetal viability would mean that restrictions on abortion to protect potential life could be imposed early in womans pregnancy justice oconnor concluded that the roe framework then is clearly on collision course with itself4 justice oconnor also not ed that adherence to roes trimester framework was inconsistent with the courts more recent abortion decisions in maher v roe and harris v mcrae the court appeared to recognize that an undue burden standard should be used to review restrictions on abortion5 for example in mcrae the court stated the doctrine of roe v wade protects the woman fro m unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whet her to terminate her pregnancy6 justice oconnor maintained that this unduly burdensome st andard should be app lied to the challenged regulations throughout the entire pregnancy wit hout reference to the particular stage of pregnancy involved7 justice oconnor reiterate d her support for the undue burden standard in her concurring opinion in webster v reproductive health services 8 webster involved four sections of missouri statut that imposed various rest rictions on the performance of abortions including prohibition on the use of public facilities or employees to performhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22198crs3 9 webster 492 us at 499 10 webster 492 us at 51920 11 webster 492 us at 532 12 505 us 833 1992 13 id at 856 justices oconnor kenne dy and souter were joined in part by justices stevens and blackmun 14 casey 505 us at 846 15 casey 505 us at 878abortions and prohibition on public funding for abortion counseling justice oconnor joined four other justices to uphold the four sections of the missouri statute the five justices in the majority wrote three separate opinions that concurred in the judgment but expressed differing views on roe and the trimester framework while justice oconnor discussed eliminating the trimester framework and applying the undue burden standard chief justi ce rehnquist and justices wh ite and kennedy discussed another standard for review ing restrictions on abortion9 they maintained that restrictions should be evaluated on the basis of whether th ey permissibly further the states interest in protecting potential human life10 the fifth member of the majority justice scalia contemplated the overruling of roe in its entirety11 despite the justices three opinions it was clear that the idea of using different standard to evaluate restric tions on abortion was not held by justice oconnor alone in fact just three years after webster the court adopted the undue burden standard in casey 12 casey was decided by vote of 54 in joint opinion justices oconnor kennedy and souter expre ssed refusal to overrule roe and discussed why it was important to follow precedent the constitu tion serves human values and while the effect of reliance on roe cannot be exactly measured neither can the certain cost of overruling roe for people who have ordered their thinking and living around that case be dismissed13 the court stated clearly that it was reaffirming roes essential holding and identified the holdings three parts14 first woman has right to choose to have an abortion prior to viability without undue inte rference from the state second the state has right to restrict abortions after viability so long as the regulation provides an exception for pregnancies which endanger wo mans life or health third the state has legitimate interests from the outset of the preg nancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus in affirming only the essential holding of roe the court rejected the trimester framework articulated in that case in its place the court adopted the undue burden standard for reviewing restrictions on bortion the court explained that an undue burden exists and therefore pr ovision of law is invalid if its purpose or effect is to place substantial obstacle in the path of woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22198crs4 16 530 us 914 2000 17 for additional discussion of stenberg v carhart and partialbirth abortion see crs report rl30415 partialbirth abortion recent

dilation and evacuation d proceduresapplying the new standard to the pennsylva nia abortion restrictions at issue in the case the court determined that the provisi ons of the pennsylvania abortion control act imposing mandatory waiting period and requiri ng the patients informed consent the consent of one parent if the patient is minor and certain recordkeeping and reporting by facilities that provide abortion services did not impose an undue burden however fifth provision requiring spousal notification did not survive the undue burden test the court reasoned that such requirement placed substantial obstacle in the path of woman seeking an abortion because fear of spousal abuse could inhibit the abortion decision altogether in 2000 the undue burden standard was applied in stenberg v carhart case involving the constitutionality of nebraska s partialbirth abortion ban statute16 stenberg was the courts first substantive abortion case following casey in stenberg the court determined by 54 vote that th nebraska statute was unconstitutional because it failed to include an exception to protect the health of the mother and because the language defining the prohibited abortion procedure was too vague17 although roe indicated that an abortion regulation must include an exception where it is necessary in appropriate medical judg ment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother the nebraska statute did not incl ude such health exception18 nebraska claimed that health exception was unnecessary because safe alte rnatives to the partialbirth abortion procedure remained available to women while the court conceded that the actual need for the partialbirth abortion procedure was uncertain it recognized that the procedure could be safer in certain circumstances nd maintained that ban on the procedure without health exception created significant health risk19 in addition the court maintained that the language of the nebraska statute could be interpreted to prohibit not just the dilation and extraction dx abortion procedure the procedure commonly associated with par tialbirth abortion but the dilation and evacuation procedure that is the most common abortion procedure during the second trimester of pregnancy20 the court believed that th statute was likely to prompt those who perform the procedure to stop because of fear of prosecution and conviction the result would be the impos ition of an undue burden on womans ability to have an abortion justice oconnor wrote concurring opinion in stenberg in her concurrence she maintained that the nebraska statute should be invalidated b ecause of its failure to include health exception and because of the undue bur den that would be imposed as result of the statutes broad definition for the banne d procedure however justice oconnor suggested that other state statutes that pr ohibited partialbirth bortions could possiblyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22198crs5 21 stenberg 530 us at 950 22 id 23 id supreme court consideration of another case involving partialbirth abortion is expected the federal partialbirth abortion ban act has been challenged on grounds similar to those argued in stenberg

986withstand constitutional challenge21 citing the partialbirth abortion statutes of kansas utah and montana justice connor contended that statut that was narrowly tailored to prohibit only the d x procedure could be upheld22 justice oconnor observed if nebraskas statute limited its application to the d x procedure and included an exception for the life and health of the mo ther the question presented would be quite different from the one we faced today23 questions about the future of the undue bur den standard seem likely following the announcement of justice oconno rs retirement chief justice rehnquists dissent in casey joined by justices scalia and thomas criticized the undue burden standard and declared that it was not built to last24 chief justice rehnquist maintained that the standard was based on judge s subjective determinations to greater degree than the trimester framework25 in his dissent in stenberg justice scalia affirmed his belief that the standard was hopelessl unworkable in practice26 while it appears unlikely that the court would return to standard like the trimester framework it is not entirely certain what new standard would consider to termine whether rest riction on abortion is permissible
