hearing committee must define the information it need s and determine the points it wishes to communicate then evaluate whether hearing is the best method of achieving these ends deciding whether to schedule hearing is influenced by factors including the salience of issues to the nation presidential initiatives matters of significance to particular committee members and the importance of policies to constituents and interest groups programs requiring reauthorization generally require committee hearings as do allegations of waste fraud or abuse in agency activities each committee receives dozens or even hundreds of legislative proposals for possible examination and has other responsibilities such as oversight in the context of this overall workload committee must decide whether holding particular hearing is the best use of staff resources and funds committee also considers whether and how hearing would fit into its overall schedule of planned activities

hearing schedule and determines the agenda however variety of rules and other factors affect the scheduling of hearing many of these rules and related practices aim to coordinate committee hearings with other committee meetings or senate sessions to minimize interruptions of deliberations and scheduling conflicts for senators in order to maximize their participation committee sessions except of appropriations and budget are restricted when the senate also is meeting rule xxvi paragraph 5a committee may not meet on any day after the senate has been in session for two hours or after 200 pm when the senate is in session whichever is earlier in practice the rule is routinely waived usually by unanimous consent but it also may be waived by joint agreement of the party leaders senate rules also restrict committees to meeting during specified time periods committees however do not always adhere rigorously to these restrictions rule xxvi paragraph 6 the computerized scheduling service of the senate allows committee to coordinate its schedule with that of other committees further the rules of some committees contain provisions requiring subcommittee coordination in scheduling hearings paramount in scheduling hearing is choosing date and time convenient for committee leaders committee also must check the availability of its hearing rooms before scheduling hearing if committees own rooms are unavailable it may be possible to borrow room from another committee or senate leader or officer s httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98337g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142

senate committees or subcommittees may conduct hearings jointly with another committee or subcommittee of the senate or house panels meeting jointly must agree on common rules of procedure and
