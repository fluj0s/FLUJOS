from malcolm hughes mhughesltrrarizonaedu to tom melvin tmmelvinueaacuk subject re recent paper date mon 21 sep 2009 152349 0700 cc keith kbriffaueaacuk xflowed hi tom please find the esper article in question attached the socalled indigirka river data set is not yet available because it has not been published i am currently working on that with russian colleagues and was indeed in switzerland the week before last to work with one of them on specifically this all being well there will be an accepted manuscript before next summer and at that point i will make the data freely available once we get to that point ill let you know of course cheers malcolm tom melvin wrote malcolm 1 there was recent esper siberian paper i recall reading but i cannot find it at the moment my comment was on the divergence pitfalls paper i will find the paper and see if there is an explanation 2 for trend distortion to produce divergence effect there needs to be distinct increase or decrease over the last few decades of growth eg at tthh and curve fitting methods should be used in the attached figure the scandinavian site groups red have an increase at 1920 and are likely to show divergence using curve fitting methods some of the eastern most chronologies might also show divergence if 250 year old trees were used 3 rcs should not produce divergence over decades as an artifact if subfossil trees are used rcs on modern chronologies has all sorts of bias we have lots of ideas to test in the divergence project and lots of data to test them on 4 keith has been complained at by climate audit for cherry picking and not using your long indigirka river data set not used because we did not have the data please could we have the data we will make proper aknowledgementcoauthorship if we use the data tom at 1635 21092009 you wrote tom i dont disagree with your take on the lack of originality of much of what is in the paper the question is why is there apparently divergence in ring width in some of this region in briffa et 98 but not in this paper isnt espers failure to see divergence counterintuitive when using rcs in his way cheers malcolm on sep 21 2009 at 211 am tom melvin tmmelvinueaacuk wrote malcolm the esper divergence pitfalls paper does not appear to add anything of significance none of the figures show any form of the divergence discussed in papers eg recent last few decades change in the slope of treering growth indices compared to climate differences in overall slope generally weak relationships differences in variance and the effects of using selected calibration periods are all problems to be addressed in reconstructions but are not divergence i cannot foresee needing to reference this paper in discussions of divergence as all the suggestions have more detailed earlier references tom at 2233 18092009 you wrote hi tom i had good talk with keith on the phone the other day mainly to wish him well he did suggest i ask you for your take on the recent esper et paper on divergence or rather the lack of it in siberia looks like the problem disappears what do you think cheers malcolm dr tom melvin climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593161 fax 441603507784 dr tom melvin climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593161 fax 441603507784 xflowed attachment converted ceudoraattachesper2009gcbpdf
