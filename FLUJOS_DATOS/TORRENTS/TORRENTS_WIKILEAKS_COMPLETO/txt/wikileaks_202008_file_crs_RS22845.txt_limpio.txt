warrant the forcible seizure of japanese citizens by north korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s continues to be pivotal issue in the ongoing sixparty talks on north koreas nuclear weapons program tokyos participation in the international forum is dominated by its efforts to achieve progress on the abduction issue while the united states is now aggressively pursuing deal that provides energy and economic assistance to north korea in exchange for the dismantlement of its nuclear weapons program japan has refused to contribute aid without satisfactory progress on the kidnappings this had led to japans relative isolation in the multilateral talks although better relations between new leaders in japan and south korea may provide some flexibility to end the impasse us interest in the abductions issue is driven by its needs for japans diplomatic and economic assistance in the negotiations as well as concerns that friction in the usjapan relationship will damage one of the united states most important alliances in the world1 1 for more information see crs report rl33436 japanus relations issues for congress continued crs2 us negotiators maintain that they strongly support japans position on the abductees but also indicate that the issue will not block nuclear deal this stance contrasts with the pre2007 approach of the bush administration in which the abductions issue provided platform for tokyo and washingtons strategic priorities to converge in the earlier six party talks the united states and japan joined to pressure north korea on not only nuclear weapons but also on human rights refugees and the abductions the next several months are likely to be decisive for how the abductions issue will affect the usjapan relationship foremost is how progress in the sixparty talks proceeds if time pressure and proliferation concerns lead the bush administration to accept nuclear deal with north korea that does not appear to enhance japanese security leaders in tokyo may find it difficult to convince their citizens to steadfastly support us strategic interests including military basing however amid some indications that tokyo may be reconsidering its priorities in the negotiations deal that extracts significant concessions from pyongyang could reinforce the fundamentally strong usjapan alliance background httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22845 in the 1980s and 1990s circumstantial evidence began to surface that north korean agents were responsible for the disappearance of several japanese citizens isolated press reports addressed the suspicion but the japanese government initially dismissed the accounts and reacted slowly to the allegations as tokyo moved to reestablish diplomatic relations with pyongyang in the early 1990s some japanese politicians saw the issue as possible obstacle to normalization and may have suppressed information that suggested north koreas responsibility2 unconfirmed reports from north korean defectors emerged that japanese nationals were held by north korea but the mainstream media largely ignored them then in 1996 an article appeared in which north korean defector spoke about his experience at spy school where native japanese trained agents in japanese language and culture support groups for the victims families formed in japan and politicians particularly those opposed to negotiating with pyongyang mobilized support in the diet parliament in 1998 pyongyangs test of an intermediaterange ballistic missile over japan raised security fears about the threat from north korea and made the general japanese public more suspicious of its behavior eventually the kidnappings became part of the diplomatic agenda with north korea and in september 2002 prime minister junichiro koizumi traveled to pyongyang to resolve the abductions issue and move toward normalizing relations at the 2002 summit north korean leader kim jongil admitted to and apologized for north korean agents abduction of 13 japanese citizens the kidnappings took place 1 continued coordinated by emma chanlettavery and crs report rl33740 the changing usjapan alliance implications for us interests by emma chanlettavery 2 johnston eric the north korea abduction issue and its effect on japanese domestic politics japan policy research institute jpri working paper 101 june 2004 crs3 in japan and europe between 1977 and 1983 he claimed that only five remained alive3 the japanese public shocked at the revelations became fixated on the drama with attention reaching its height month later when the five abductees were returned to japan in may 2004 koizumi returned to pyongyang to secure the release of five of the abductees children4 coverage of the abductees saturated the press and the issue quickly became the top priority in japans north korea policy given north koreas record of truculence and denial many analysts expressed surprise that kim jongil admitted the kidnappings and allowed the abductees and their families to return to japan however when tokyo pressed for proof of the remaining abductees deaths pyongyang produced apparently forged death certificates and traffic accident reports when asked for physical evidence north korean officials provided cremated human remains that most japanese felt to be of dubious origin see below and also claimed that some remains were washed away in floods the inconsistency and apparent deception compounded the japanese publics anger at north korea and reinforced the views of many conservative politicians that pyongyang should not be trusted because of the shaky evidence tokyo determined that its policy would be based on the premise that all the remaining abductees are alive httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22845 the effect of the abductions on japans political landscape as the abductee drama has played out three japanese prime ministers have navigated the issue in subtly different ways though always mindful of the emotional reaction of the public koizumis bold initiative to visit pyongyang in 2002 brought the issue to the surface although he may not have anticipated the strong response from the public koizumis position toward north korea gradually hardened as the publics criticism of north korea swelled and the bush administration indicated reluctance to aggressively pursue negotiated settlement with pyongyang his successor shinzo abe rose to prominence based on his hardline position toward north korea specifically on the kidnappings upon taking office abe established headquarters in the cabinet secretariat to coordinate abductee affairs led efforts to impose international and unilateral sanctions and restrictions when north korea tested missiles and nuclear device in 2006 and called for the immediate return and safety of all the abductees on the assumption that all were still alive since assuming the premiership in 2007 yasuo fukuda has stated his interest in reengaging more actively in the sixparty talks but has not indicated that he will adjust japans policy on the abductees advocacy groups for the abductees note that he has retained the office that abe created but voice some doubt that his stance will mirror abes approach 3 koizumi had presented list of 13 names of suspected abductees of which the north korean side said eight had died four were alive and one never entered north korea they also confirmed that one abductee not on the list was alive since then the japanese government has added three more names to the list for total of 17 abductees 4 one return abductees husband charles jenkins and two children did not return to japan with the others jenkins an american soldier who defected to north korea in 1965 feared facing desertion charges from the us military if he came to japan japanese officials arranged for the family to reunite in indonesia and eventually for all four of them to come to japan in july 2004 turning himself into us authorities jenkins served 25day sentence at us naval base in japan in november 2004 he was released and joined his family in northern japan crs4 due to the overwhelming public reaction there has been little open opposition to the official policy on the abductions opposition political parties have not challenged the ruling partys orthodoxy on the issue and politicians from all parties have formed special diet committees to indicate their support for the victims advocacy groups have gained particular clout as the controversy grew the association of the families of victims kidnapped by north korea made up exclusively of relatives of the abducted have become major media figures other groups of conservative activists some explicitly committed to regime change in pyongyang have elevated their political influence and public profile5 among the most active of these are the national association for the rescue of japanese kidnapped by north korea narkn the yokota case as with many popular movements the outrage over the abductees fates has powerful poster child megumi yokota was only 13 years old when she was reportedly snatched by north korean agents on her way home from school north korean officials claimed that she committed suicide in 1993 her case had drawn widespread media attention both domestically and internationally as the subject of documentaries and even httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22845 an american folk song as leaders of the association of the families of victims kidnapped by north korea and in frequent media appearances yokotas parents have become the face of the abductee cause in 2006 president bush invited the yokotas to the white house later calling the encounter one of the most moving meetings since ive been the president earlier that day yokotas mother testified in front of house subcommittee on asia and the pacific and subcommittee on africa global human rights and international operations joint hearing because of yokotas high profile any progress or setbacks to resolve her case is of particular symbolic importance the public reacted with outrage when north korea provided what they claimed were her cremated human remains to japan only to have japanese officials later announce that they were not yokotas6 at the 2002 summit north korea relayed that yokota had fifteenyearold daughter reunion of yokotas parents with their granddaughter has been floated as possible path to reconciliation and observers maintain that any settlement of the yokota case would make significant impact on the public perception of the issue the abductions issue in the sixparty talks usjapanese tension as the bush administration has moved aggressively to reach deal on denuclearization with north korea in the sixparty talks since early 2007 distance has emerged between washington and tokyo japanese officials have expressed alarm that the united states may remove north korea from its list of state 5 japan and north korea bones of contention international crisis group report june 2005 6 controversy over the remains ensued with scientific laboratories providing conflicting reports on the dna analysis the science journal nature published an article questioning the integrity of the analysis performed by one of the labs in which one of the forensic experts who tested the remains said he could not rule out that the samples had become contaminated and therefore incapable of producing accurate results see nature volume 433434 februaryapril 2005 crs5 sponsors of terrorism7 the removal considered likely by many analysts is one of series of phased actions agreed to in the sixparty talks in exchange for pyongyang allowing the disablement of the yongbyon reactor and providing declaration of nuclear programs in the past us leaders have linked north koreas inclusion on the list to the abduction issue although state department officials reportedly claim that the issue is not legal obstacle for removal in december 2007 the committee on abduction of japanese citizens by north korea of japans lower house adopted resolution urging the united states to refrain from delisting north korea the resolution read in part we are concerned that if north korea is removed from the list without repatriation of the detained victims the japanus alliance will be adversely affected and the japanese people will be greatly disappointed us decision to delist north korea is unlikely to shake the foundations of the fundamentally strong alliance but japanese analysts say that the usjapan relationship could suffer in the shortterm if washington accepts weak deal if the japanese public views washington as abandoning the abductees japanese leaders may have difficulty convincing their public to continue to support the united states on range of strategic interests including the hosting and realignment of us military bases in japan if httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22845 however the government can point to enhanced japanese security because of north korean concessions on disarmament the public may be more accepting particularly if the united states continues to press pyongyang for more information on the kidnappings japannorth korean bilateral talks one of the five working groups established by the breakthrough february 13 2007 agreement in the sixparty talks is dedicated to resolving tokyos and pyongyangs bilateral controversies8 the agreement states that the working group will hold talks to work toward the normalization of relations on the basis of settlement of outstanding issues of concern phrase interpreted to mean the abductions and compensation to north korea for japans colonial rule of the korean peninsula from 19101945 two rounds of consultations in vietnam and mongolia yielded major progress on the stalemate only one other working group is dedicated to strictly bilateral issues the usnorth korean normalization process which some say indicates the high priority of the abduction issue on the other hand relegation of the abductions to separate track could demonstrate willingness to move the rest of the process forward without satisfactory resolution of the kidnappings prospects for change in tokyos policy although the issue remains politically sensitive in japan many commentators acknowledge some degree of abductee fatigue among the japanese public government officials and influential opinion leaders also privately voice concern that the abductee issue has led to japans marginalization in the multilateral negotiations on north koreas nuclear weapons program the combination of fears of diplomatic isolation and concern about range of security threats from north korea may lead the defense establishment and policy elite to support any shift or adjustment to the current policy on north korea 7 for more information see crs report rl30613 north korea terrorism list removal by larry niksch 8 for more information see crs report rl33590 north koreas nuclear weapons development and diplomacy by larry niksch crs6 fukudas reputation as pragmatist who places special emphasis on developing closer ties with asian nations suggests that he would be amenable to compromise approach to north korea particularly if pyongyang indicated any movement on the issue in addition his rhetoric when speaking about japans interests in north korea signifies shift from abes singular focus on the abductions issue fukuda describes the kidnappings as one of three areas of concern the others being pyongyangs nuclear and missile programs however fukudas tenuous hold on power and the threatened collapse of his ruling party have precluded any serious foreign policy initiatives the abductions issue and regional relations since the sixparty talks began tokyos focus on the abductions issue has isolated it from the other parties particularly china and south korea some critics say that the abductions issue allows japan to play the victim while refusing to take responsibility for its own historical offenses particularly in the world war ii era9 thorny historical controversies between japan and its neighbors however have showed significant signs of easing in the past few years after period of rocky relations under koizumi abe and fukuda made strides in warming ties with seoul and beijing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22845 amid an overall detente in sinojapanese relations fukuda visited china in january 2008 when asked about the abductions issue during the visit chinese premier wen jiabao reportedly stated that we understand japans position and we are confident that resolution can be reached through dialogue new south korean president lee myung bak has stated explicitly that he does not intend to press japan to apologize for historical grievances as his predecessor did in his capacity of special envoy lees brother who is also the vice speaker of south koreas national assembly reportedly told japanese officials that the new leader understands and supports japans position on the abductee issue lee has also indicated that he is more willing to raise human rights issues with the north than his predecessor most observers think it is unlikely that chinese or south korean negotiators will actively champion the abductees cause but both capitals appear to recognize the need for japanese involvement and funding in any diplomatic arrangement with north korea optimistic observers say that new leadership in tokyo and seoul combined with beijings interest in maintaining smooth relations before the 2008 summer olympics and the bush administrations determination to reach negotiated agreement this year provide an environment ripe for breakthrough 9 japan and north korea bones of contention international crisis group report june 2005
