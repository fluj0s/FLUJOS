b 09 sanaa 1299 classified by ambassador stephen seche for reasons 14b and d 1 s summary after several successful counterterrorism operations aimed at uprooting an entrenched alqaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap president saleh announced on january 9 that he was willing to negotiate with aqap members who renounced violence signaling return to one of the tactics saleh has used previously to control the wide spectrum of islamic extremists in yemen with variety of domestic actors from conservative clerics to the political opposition and the tribes protesting the roygs recent strikes against aqap saleh is feeling pressure to shore up his domestic political base by offering the possibility of softer approach to aqaps lowerranking membership he has not however shied away from his commitment to go after alqaedas top leadership which he understands is unlikely to either renounce terrorism or agree to negotiate with the royg especially after series of sweeping ct operations in december and january end summary 2 s during january 9 interview with abu dhabi tv president saleh said that while he was willing to negotiate with members of alqaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap who were willing to renounce violence he would continue to pursue to the best of his abilities those who continued to engage in terrorism dialogue is the best way even with alqaeda if they set aside their weapons and return to reason he said official news outlets including 26 september aljamhurriya and almutamar reprinted the complete text of the interview on january 10 signaling the governments official endorsement of the presidents comment note the interview echoes his january 1 editorial in official althawra newspaper in which he called for the houthis and aqap to renounce violence and embrace dialogue with the government as well as his december 14 call for national dialogue to include variety of societal actors ref end note 3 s xxxxx told poloff on january 11 he was surprised at the presidents openness in offering to talk to members of alqaeda but that the royg has history of dialogue through the rehabilitation program for reformed extremists note in the past minister of religious endowments judge hamoud hitar ran nowdefunct rehabilitation program for religious extremists based on dialogue end note saleh is known for negotiating with his domestic opponents including alqaeda for years he has negotiated with exploited bribed and cajoled islamic extremists in yemen for his own political gain ref b even officials at the ministry of foreign affairs mfa including head of the north america department adil alsunaini acknowledged that negotiating with aqap is an old government policy our good president says things to play the old game and keep everyone under his thumbxxxxx told poloff on january 11 comment despite history of negotiating with alqaeda salehs current offer of dialogue to aqap members who renounce violence is unlikely to apply to the groups hardened leadership instead the president is likely appealing to his religious base by offering an out to the organizations rank and file who after series of punitive operations against aqap in december and january might be looking for just such an opportunity end comment 4 s salehs remarks come after three weeks of public criticism of the roygs close ct cooperation with the us and specifically december 17 airstrike in abyan governorate from variety of domestic actors including religious clerics tribal leaders and the political opposition one of the most significant challenges has come from the conservative religious establisment in january 8 friday sermon conservative salafi cleric and powerful islah member abdulmajid alzindani railed against yemens ct cooperation with the us accusing it of wanting to occupy yemen according to local press reports dubaibased alarabiya reported on january 11 that influential adenbased salafi cleric ali mohammed umar said his followers would fight with aqap against any american intervention in yemen the presidents two pillars of support are the military and the salafis these comments were for the salafis xxxxx said xxxxx told poloff on january 11 do not give these remarks too much care it is just media statement xxxxx pointed out that the remarks made in arabic on middle eastern satellite tv channel were intended for domestic not western consumption xxxxx told emboff on january 11 thatxxxxx on the presidents remarks because they were not to be taken seriously comment 5 s while salehs remarks reflect need to appease certain domestic constituencies upset by close cooperation with the us against aqap he has not given any indications of shying away from future operations against aqap leadership in the same interview saleh said that terrorists are danger not just to yemens security but to international security especially alqaeda while the president likes to keep all options on the table and never writes off the possibility of negotiations with any political opponent his current offer is likely to apply to aqaps rank and file not its hardened isolated and hunted leadership in yemen especially actions speak louder than words and salehs actions have not yet wavered in uprooting alqaeda end comment seche
