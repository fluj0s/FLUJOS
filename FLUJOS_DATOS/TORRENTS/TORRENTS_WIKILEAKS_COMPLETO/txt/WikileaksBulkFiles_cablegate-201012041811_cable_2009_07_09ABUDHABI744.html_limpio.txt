subject uae gulf security dialogue gsd july 20 plenary session and cos dialogue abu dhabi 00000744 0012 of 004 classified by charge daffaires douglas cgreene for reasons 14 b and d summary 1 snf in july 20 plenary session of the gsd with large uae delegation accompanied by smaller session with the uae chief of staff the immediate focus was largely on iran participants reiterated the good defense cooperation that the us and uae enjoy while noting the need to improve coordination further to deal with real and urgent threats in the region in this regard the uae put the threat of irans potential reaction to likely israeli attack on its nuclear program at the center of scenarios to be considered other issues to include yemen counterproliferation pakistan the israelipalestinian conflict and extremism were also addressed but even these were often seen through the prism of iranian intentions 2 snf this message begins with the chief of staffs urgent plea on munitions to deal with an unpredictable iran followed by synopsis of gsd plenary proceedings list of uae participants is included at 20 end summary chief of staff presses for munitions urgent about irans unpredictability 3 snf in brief session with principals only chief of staff hamad thani alromaithi who also participated in the mbz dinner and was on his way to lebanon later july 20 said the uae cannot act alone in the region and needs coherent plans especially to deal with the unique threat of iran how to deter iran without provoking it is challenge ambassador alotaiba emphasized how the proximity of the uae to iran magnifies the threat perception the cos said uae military planning had to consider worstcase scenarios 4 snf asd vershbow said the usg did not disagree with the uae evaluation of irans objectives but that we need to work to prevent them from achieving those objectives diplomacy is only one tool the usg wants to help provide the uae with defensive capabilities and our troop presence here should help act as deterrent to iran we dont want to signal that we will give up on diplomacy yet in parallel to that effort we intend to keep the pressure on iran we appreciate the candor of our defense engagement with the uae we are dealing with an unpredictable foe and need to take all precautions 5 snf the cos said iran will remain threat in any case as its objectives are constant he added that if the israelis strike iran may lash out at the uae and around the gulf one can conceive of many possible scenarios from missile strikes to attacks on isolated islands to the exploitation of 130000 iranians living in the uae the uae therefore seeks ongoing support from the regions main actor the us and desires close defense coordination the uaes friends in the gcc on the other hand are not always realistic in their approach to iran he said citing arab misinterpretation of brotherly iraqi intentions with regards to kuwait back in 1990 6 snf asd vershbow said that our message to iran is that threats against our allies will not go unanswered we need to be prepared in case deterrence does not work with the realization that with or without nuclear weapons iran seeks to be dominant power in the region this is very interconnected region asserted the cos if i was in the israelis shoes i would attack to reduce the nuclear threat the first reaction may be that the iranians launch missiles against targets in israel and then the gulf he added air chief sweidan added that the uae needs munitions on tighter timeline than previously assumed with urgent needs in 2010 11 and 12 he said the uae armed forces could receive munitions from the us inventory and then replenish them later he supplied the same list of requirements as was relayed some months ago noting that they had only received political answer to that inquiry thus far abu dhabi 00000744 002 of 004 7 snf the cos was appreciative of patriot deployments progress on command and control systems and movement toward more effective shared early warning but lamented that other pieces of the air defense puzzle require immediate attention ambassador alotaiba reiterated the need to borrow from us inventories to meet urgent timelines as vershbow said we were leaning far forward for the uae on thaad for example and would continue to look into opportunities to assist including filling gaps before uaepurchased systems were delivered 8 snf highlighting the importance of close defense coordination the cos noted that in the event of an attack the uae may have time to react taking the fight to iran may require passing over us aircraft carriers for example so we need to be in lockstep at all phases of preparation and operation introductory remarks 9 c the plenary session of the usuae gulf security dialogue gsd convened july 20 at the armed forces officers club with newly promoted deputy chief of staff major general ali hamad subaih alkaabi stating that the small but significant gulf region makes large contribution to global peace and development and seeks enhanced cooperation with the us he cited uae troops in afghanistan us use of uae bases robust intelligence exchange strong counterterror efforts and improved border control as evidence that the uae shares common goals with the us citing the high importance of strong relations among gcc members he thanked the us for its role in the defense relationship and wanted to learn more about us strategies visavis iran afghanistan iraq and palestine 10 c assistant secretary of defense vershbow leading the us team along with assistant state of state for politicalmilitary affairsshapiro expressed confidence in the strength and future of the bilateral relationship anchored by common strategic interests recounting shared priorities he noted that the gsd was being taken to new level as we seek strategic synergy in facing real threats like iran which we are obligated to defend against he called for more multilateral approach to counterproliferation and cited the need to prepare missile defenses he lauded the uae decision to host leading edge 2009 and cited the 123 agreement with the us as the high standard on civil nuclear cooperation the responsible drawdown of us troops in iraq also calls for continued uae support he emphasized as iraq seeks to assume responsibility for its own security and integrate into the region the uaes advanced fighter squadron growing air defense net participation in red flag and leadership of ctf 152 are all indications of maturing defense capability 11 c as shapiro emphasized the usg desire to ensure regional stability counter extremism curb wmd proliferation and tackle the interrelated challenges of the region holistically he focused on the threat from iran stressing that the usg was attempting diplomatic solution if possible and would proceed in consultation with our friends in the region recounting the basic components of our iraq policy he also highlighted the need to strengthen the institutions of government in lebanon and build capacity within the palestinian authority uae offers threat analysis all iran 12 s the uaes presentation of the primary regional threat assessed that irans leadership genuinely believes that it has emerged victorious from its clash with the us with gains made in iraq an expanding shia tide in the region an ongoing nuclear program missile modernization and continued provocation of resistance in gaza while israel was able to neutralize to some degree threats on its flanks in lebanon 2006 and gaza 20089 abu dhabi 00000744 003 of 004 irans main goals of regional influence were not inhibited the uae assessment continued that israel may act on its perception that only extreme and unlikely unsc action or unilateral israeli military action can slow irans nuclear goals as iran continues to reject political solution the uae must prepare for the fallout should israel act on its fears with that the briefer introduced slide on irans capabilities with missile sites in the south of iran and concentric circles showing their likely range all covering uae territory 13 s iranian promotion of shiism coupled with sleeper cells in the region magnify the threat articulated by the uae if attacked it may seek to obstruct shipping in the gulf and control more islands over which it does not have legitimate sovereignty working in alliance with alqaeda hezbollah and iraqi shia iran is poised to do damage of an unpredictable nature ifwhen provoked in sum iran continued as the traditional focus of the threat briefing offered by the uae at gsd sessions other regional concerns noted in lesser detail included iraq yemen afghanistan pakistan the arabisraeli conflict terrorism and piracy strategic cooperation 14 c in further briefings the uae team highlighted good operational cooperation with the us and offered review of the maturing critical national infrastructure agency cnia which is taking charge of security on land along the coast and off shore with an initial focus on abu dhabi but an intent to serve as federal agency the us coast guard and nypd were cited as partners in the growing cnia mission with us promise of firsttime nuclear security training in the near future 15 s the uae delegation received draft uae national defense strategy and usuae comprehensive defense strategy document outlining key priorities in the defense relationship document proposed by uae ambassador to washington yousef alotaiba without immediate comment on the substance of the usg draft alkaabi said the uae would reply via embassy channels and looked forward to continuing the dialogue qa on iran yemen 16 c when the floor was open to general discussion two topics dominated iran and yemen the uae asked whether the usg had any new information since the december 2007 nie regarding irans nuclear weaponization program the us team noted that new estimate was in progress but it was premature to comment the dmi representative also noted that iran exploits crises for its own advantage making the defusing of crises like palestine and lebanon imperative if we are to keep iran in check in the case of palestine he added optimistically it is time to cut to the chase and deal with final status issues lebanon is also ripe for progress he suggested without drawn out process 17 s on yemen the uae said it shared us concern that failed state could emerge on the arabian peninsula with terrorist partners and iranian influence further poisoning the mix collapsed yemen gives us afghanistan said commander of the air force and air defense major general hamad bin suweidan alqamzi and then it presents longterm threat to the region he said the uae was coordinating economic development support for yemen while also trying to assist with political reconciliation he noted the dangers of another somalia asd vershbow hoped the uae could help secure unified gcc approach to yemen as time is running out on the seccession question and yemen cannot afford two front war with both seccesionists and the alhouthi insurgency in brief discussion of pakistan all agreed that islamabad needs to focus resources to fight insurgency rather than obsessing with india as its potential military foe abu dhabi 00000744 004 of 004 positive conclusions 18 c enhanced usuae cooperation to counter troublesome financial flows and cash smuggling solidified during recent visit by treasury secretary geithner was noted by the charge as another area of productive engagement both sides also put in very positive words about the role of the air warfare center which has become proud center of excellence for the region 19 s in closing alkaabi raised iran yet again noting that its leadership is not likely to change fundamentally and therefore the threat is likely to continue he looked forward to ongoing discussion of the defense strategy discussed earlier as we continue to pursue common vision 20 sbu uae
