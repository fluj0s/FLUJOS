divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33351immigration enforcement within the united states summary an estimated 11 million unauthorized aliens reside in the united states and this population is estimated to increase by 500000 annually each year approximately 1 million aliens are apprehende d trying to enter the united states illegally although most of these aliens enter the united states for economic opportunities and family reunification or to avoid civil strife nd political unrest some are criminals and some may be terrorists all are violating the united states immigration laws immigration enforcement is the regulation of those who violate provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina this includes violations of the inas civil provisions eg violate the conditio ns of their admittance as well as us citizens or aliens who violate the criminal provisions eg marriage fraud or alien smuggling many divergent tasks are incorporated under the banner of immigration enforcement these include removing alie ns who should not be in the united states investigating alien smuggling and trafficking patrolling between and at ports of entry combating document nd benefit fraud and enforcin g the prohibitions against employers hiring aliens without work authorization historically more resources measured in staff hours have been allotted to enforcement at the border than enforcemen t within the united states while the amount of us border patrol usbp resources almost doubled between fy1997 and fy2003 time spent on other enforcement activities increased only slightly while the number of inspection hours decreased furthermore focusing on interior enforcement in fy2003 the largest amount of staff time was devoted to locating and arresting criminal aliens 39 followed by administrative and noninvestigative duties 23 and alien smuggling investiga tions 15 only 4 was devoted to worksite enforcement ie locating and arresting aliens working without authorization and punishing employ ers who hire such workers congress has spent much time deba ting immigration enforcement and the unauthorized alien popula tion congress could allocate more resources to immigration enforcement activities raising the question of what is the most efficient allocation of resources among the different enforcement tasks for example some assert that the united states has not truly tried immigration enforcement arguing that most of the resources have been devoted to border enforcement instead of fully engaging in other types of immigration enforcement others contend that only legalization program can reduce the unaut horized population in addition congress could expand the immigration enforcement role of other federal agencies and state and local law enforcement many fear how ever that this option will distract the agencies and local law enforcement from their primary missions since many of the unauthorized aliens come to the unite d states for economic opportunities some argue that guest worker program crea ting opportunities for large number of aliens to come to the united states to wor k could significantly reduce unauthorized migration others argue that an increase in the enforcement of the prohibition against hiring illegal alien workers and the us and manufacturing of fraudulent documents would make it more difficult for unauthorized aliens to find work resulting in decrease in the unauthorized populati on this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33351key policy staff immigration enforcement subject area analyst phone email

how militant islamic terrorists entered and remained in the united states washington center for immigration studies may 2002immigration enforcement within the united states introduction it is estimated that there are more than 11 million unauthorized aliens1 currently living in the united states and the re sident unauthorized alien population is estimated to increase by 500000 people per year2 in addition each year approximately 1 million aliens are apprehended while trying to illegally enter the united states although most of these liens are entering the united states for economic opportunities or fleeing civil strife and political unrest some are criminals and some may be terrorists3 all are violating the immigration laws of the united states the existence of large unauthorized population creates an illicit industry devoted to creating fraudulent identities and documents to aid unauthorized aliens in living and working in the united states illegal identity documents may be used by terrorists and other criminals who desire to remain hidden from law enforcement4 in addition some argue that it would be harder for unauthorized aliens including criminals and terrorists to stay in the united states if finding job were more difficult5 the center for immigration studies found that eight of the 48 qaeda foreign born terrorists operating in the unite d states since 1993 worked in the united states illegally6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33351crs2 7 belinda i reyes hans p j ohnson and richard van swearingen holding the line the effect of recent border build up on unauthorized immigration public policy institute of california july 2002 p 80 hereafter cited as reyes holding the line the effect of recent border buildup on unauthorized immigration 8 importantly the discussions of certain enfo rcement activities eg worksite enforcement and alien smuggling are more detailed than those for other activities since crs does not have individual reports on these subjectssome have argued that the us government has been unsuccessful in controlling illegal immigration due to conflict in political will the desire to prevent the illegal entry of those who might seek to harm the united states and its populace eg terrorists criminals and the need to provide workers for laborintensive industries eg agriculture f ood processing restaurants there is evidence of this conflict as far back as the mid1800s with the arrival of irish immigrants7 policy issues the large unauthorized alien population raises concerns since it is very difficult to know if any unauthorized aliens ar terrorists or criminals in add ition the existence of underground population lead s to the propagation of an illegal document industry nonetheless the major ity of unauthorized aliens work in the united states raising concerns that thei r removal will harm the us economy and illustrating desire or need of some employ ers for this pool of labor what are the best methods to decrease the unauthorized population without disrupting sectors of the economy that depend on foreign labor should the united states increase its efforts to reduce the unauthorized alien population and what are the best methods and use of resources to achieve this goal are the current laws adequate should other federal agencies or local law enfo rcement agencies become more involved in immigration enforcement is the depar tment of homeland security conducting immigration enforcement in an efficient manner report overview this report provides an analysis of immigration enforcement within the united states the report opens with definition of immigration enforcement discussion of the statutory authority to conduct immig ration enforcement and an overview of immigration enforcement related legisla tion since 1986 it follows with an exposition on the dichotomy of interior nd border enforcement the report then details different aspects of immigration enforcement in the united states including detention and removal alien smuggling and traffick ing document and benefit fraud worksite enforcement inspections at ports of entry and patrolling the border between ports of

devoted to divergent immigration enforcement activities it concludes with discussion of crosscutting immigration enforcement issues related to the structur of the department of homeland security list of acronyms is provided in the appendixhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33351crs3 9 for example this includes an alien who overst ays his visa or an alien who is working when his visa prohibits employmentdata and analysis the report uses different workload measures for the distinct immigration enforcement activities and these measures are presented for the most current years that the data are available for example for the removal of aliens the workload measure used is the number of removals while the workload for worksite enforcement in measured in the issuance of notices of intent to fine nifs nonetheless none of these measur are comparable with each other for example comparing the number of nifs issued with the number of removals does not provide any insight into the disparate resource allocation for these two tasks in addition due to the changes in immigration enforcement priorities after the attacks of september 11 2001 wherever possible measures of enforcement activities are presented prior to and after fy2001 to compare the resources devoted to different enforcement activities the report analyzes data on agent work hours for each enforcement activity the data are from the department of homeland securitys performance analysis system pas the hours are presented as workyears as 2080 hours equal one workyear due to data limitations the analysis of the hours is limited to fy1992 through fy2003 during 2004 immigration and customs enforcement ice and customs and border protection cbp switched their accounting system from pas to the us customs services treasury enforcement communications system tecs and as result data for 2004 onward are not comparable with previous years tecs contains fewer data fields than pas which means that some of the measures in pas do not exist in tecs in addition the data for fy2004 are incomplete in both systems as the different components in dhs did not sw itch from pas to tecs at the same time what is immigration enforcement immigration enforcement is the regulation of those who violate provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina this includes violations of the civil provisions of the ina eg aliens who enter without inspection or violate the conditions of their admittance9 as well as us citizens or aliens who violate the criminal provisions of the ina eg marriage fraud or alien smuggling some of the duties under immigration law have aspects of immigration enforcement but also contain adjudicative functions sometimes referred to as services and are not universally considered enforcement immigration inspectors are the classic example of this dual role as inspectors are responsible for keeping those who seek to harm us interests out while letting bona fide trav elers in an alien who is denied entry to the united states by an inspector has not violated any provision of the ina unless the alien has committed some type of fraud to gain entry indeed there have been people both aliens and us citizens who have been wrongly denied entry by an immigration inspector it could also be argued that department of homeland security dhs citizenship and immigration services uscis adjudicator is performing an enfo rcement function by denying an aliens application for benefit to which he is not entitled others would argue that this ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33351crs4 10 department of

depending on the circumstancean example of purely ad judicative function for unle ss the alien has committed fraud to receive the benefit he or sh has not committed violation under the ina according to dhs immigration enforcemen t should be viewed as part of comprehensive homeland security strate gy that unifies and coordinates law enforcement operations across formerly separate agencies eg the immigration and naturalization service ins the federal protective service the us coast guard and the us customs service10 the former commissioner of ins11 james zigler was quoted as saying we need to set up regime where we dont have to spend so much of our time and effort in enforcement activities dealing with people who are not terrorists who are not threats to our na tional security who are economic refugees12 some argue that since the terrorists res ponsible for the 911 attacks were aliens immigration enforcement has recently had an antiterrorism focus moreover the center for immigration studies found that at least 22 of the 48 qaeda foreignborn terrorists found operating in the united st ates since 1993 had committed significant violations of immigration laws13 thus it can be argued that more stringent enforcement of the immigration laws may have disrupted some of the terrorists plans authority to conduct immigration enforcement14 the immigration and nationality act ina as amended is the primary law by which congress legislates on immigration15 basic enforcement authority for immigration officials stems from 287 and 235 of the ina16 ina 287 gives any officer or

authorized and designated to conduct certain law enforcement activities18 overview of select majo r immigration enforcement legislation since 1986 since 1986 there have been several b ills with major immigration enforcement provisions the following highlights some of the most important enacted legislation for immigration enforcement activities in the united states and provides brief summary of the important changes the enacted immigration enforcement legislation includes the immigration reform and control act of 1986 irca pl 99603 which addressed the control of illegal immigration by creating sanctions for employers who hire or continue to employ aliens who are not authorized to work and by legalizing most of the unauthorized aliens present in the united states at that time violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 pl 103322 which gave the attorney general the option to bypass deportation proceedings for certain alien aggravated felons enhanced penalties for alien smuggling and reentry after deportation and increased appropriations for the border patrol illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira pl 104208 which added to the grounds of inadmissibility and deportability expanded the list of crimes constituting an aggravated felony created expedited removal procedures and reduced the judicial review of immigration decisions usa patriot act of 2001 pl 10756 which broadened the terrorism grounds for excluding aliens from entering the united states and increased monitoring of foreign students enhanced border control and vi sa reform act of 2002 pl 107 173 which required the development of an interoperable electronic data system to be used to share information relevant to alienhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33351crs6 19 for

which expanded the grounds of inad missibility and deportability accelerated the deployment of the entryexit system and increased criminal penalties for alien smuggling21 and real id act of 2005 pl 10913 which established statutoryguidelines for removal cases expanded the terrorismrelated grounds for inadmissibility and deportati on included measures to improve border infrastructure and required st ates to verify an applicants legal status before issuing drivers license or personal identification card that may be accepted for any federal purpose 22 interior vs border although many make the distinction be tween interior and border enforcement questions have been raised about the us efulness of the distin ction many immigration professionals do not accept the rationale that there is distinct interior enforcement mission since interior enforcement can be viewed as continuum of border enforcement ie violators not caught at the border must be apprehended and processed in the interior23 however certain aspects of interior enforcement lack border component for example fugitive task forces investigations of alien slavery and sweatshops and employer sanctions do not require close coordination between dhs customs and border protection cbp and dhs immigration and customs enforcement ice as an illustration that not all enforcement activities contain border component in

aircraft and 274d penalties for failure to departgreatest illegal immigration in order to detect deter and apprehend aliens attempting to cross the border between official points of entry30 after september 11 2001 the usbp refocu sed its strategy on preventing the entry of terrorists and weapons of mass destruction in order to prevent and deter terrorist entry intelligence and surveilla nce operations have been focused on known smuggling operations that have previously trafficked aliens from significant interest countries the usbp also coordinates nd shares intelligence with canadian and mexican authorities it is important to note however that the increased emphasis on preventing terrorist entry into the united states did not change the scope of the usbps mission preventing unauthorized liens from entering the country there is evidence that although border enforcemen t has increased forcing aliens to take more dangerous routes to enter the united states and increasing the risks and costs of those attempting to illegally enter the united states the number of unauthorized aliens in the united states has continued to increase31 types of immigration enforcement the ina includes both criminal and ci vil components providing both for criminal charges eg alien smuggling which is prosecuted in the federal courts and for civil violations eg lack of legal st atus which may lead to removal through separate administrative system in the department of justice32 being illegally present in the us has always been civil not criminal violation of the ina and subsequent deportation and associated administrative processes are civil proceedings33 for instance lawfully ad mitted nonimmigrant alien may become deportable if his visitors visa expires or if his student status changes criminal violations of the ina on the other hand include felonies and misdemeanors and are prosecuted in federal district courts thes types of violations include the bringing in and harboring of certa in undocumented aliens i na 274 the illegal entry ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33351crs9 34 other criminal provisions include 243a disobeying removal order 1306 offenses relating to registration of aliens and 274af gaging in pattern or practice of hiring illegal aliens 35 an alien may be present in the united states but not admitted for example if an alien entered the united states without being inspecte d by an immigration officer the alien would be physically present in the united states but would not have been admitted under the law 36 all aliens must satisfy to dhs inspectors upon entry to the united states that they are not ineligible for admission under the socalled grounds for inadmissibility of ina 212 these include healthrelated grounds criminal history national security and terrorist concerns becoming public charge seeking to work without proper labor certification illegal entry and immigration law violations lack of proper documents ineligibility for citizenship and aliens previously removed 37 moral turpitude is not easily defined under immigration law some argue that the flexibility in the term allows for changing social norms 38 the definition of aggravated felony defin ed in ina 101a43 includes over 50 types of crimes in addition an alien convicted of an aggravated felony is conclusively presumed to be deportable ina 238c misdemeanors at the state level may be aggravated felonies under the ina 39 so few aliens have been deported under these grounds since 1980 that dhs does not report the numberaliens ina 275 and the reentry of alie ns previously excluded or deported ina 27634 removal deportation an alien is removable if 1 the alien has not been admitted to the united states and is inadmissible under ina 21235 or 2 the alien has been admitted to the united states and is portable under ina 237 the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira combined exclusion and deportation proceedings into single removal proceeding ina 237 specifies six broad classes of deportable liens including aliens who are inadmissible at time of entry or violate their immigration status36 commit certain criminal offenses eg crimes of moral turpitude37 aggravated felonies38 alien smuggling high speed flight fail to register if required under law or commit document fraud are security risks such as aliens who violate any law relating to espionage engage in criminal activity which endangers public safety partake in terrorist activities or assisted in nazi persecution or genocide become public charge within five years of entry39 or vote unlawfully in removal proceedings an immigration judge ij from the department of justices executive office for immigration review eoir determines whether an

appeals judge overturns the decision of an immigration judge the case is returned to eoir to be heard by different immigration judge increasing the aliens time in removal proceedings ie the length of

which may impact the availability of detention and removal resources88 in addition although at points dro units are responsible for the transpor t of aliens in cbp custody some cbp officials have said

the general tactical approach of auditing i9 forms to identify suspected unauthorized aliens it did so on largescale basis in an operation ta rgeting the meatpacking industry called operation vanguard

performan ce over time the program also faces more perennial challenges that impact performance among these challenges are the applicable legal standards for sanctioning employers and the prevalence of fraudulent documents ina 274a makes it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire or continue to employ unauthoriz ed aliens under the law an employer is required to attest that he or she has verified that an employee is not unauthorized to work by examining documentation provided by the empl oyee an employer is considered to be in compliance with this examination requirement if the document reasonably appears on its face to be genuine ina 274a also provides that an employer who establishes that he or she has complied in good faith with the i9 requirements has an affirmative defense agains t the charge of knowingly hiring an unauthorized alien the widespread availability and use of fraudulent documents171 makes it difficult to prove that an employer knowingly hired an unauthorized alien and thus should be subject to penalties with respect to sanctions for violations of the i9 requirements 1996 amendment to ina 274a provides employers with the possibility of good

reports are available at httpwwwuscisgovgraphicsaboutusr epsstudiespilotevalpilotevalhtmcurrent policy issues and options worksite enforcement is current focus of congressional interest among the reasons for this is the large and growing unauthorized alien population the majority of whom are in the labor force according to estimates by the pew hispan ic center in 2004 th unauthorized alien population totaled about 103 million and the unauthorized alien working population totaled about 63 million172 particularly since the 2001 terrorist attacks security concerns have been raised about havi ng such large unauthorized population in addition the issue of worksite enfo rcement has gained attention recently in connection with guest worker proposals in january 2004 president bush outlined proposal for new temporary worker pr ogram and called for increased workplace enforcement as part of the program173 as congress turns its attention to worksite enforcement there are several key policy issues it may opt to consider resources historically as discu ssed above investigative time devoted to employer cases has been limited in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks resources available for worksite enfo rcement further dwindled as interior enforcement increasingly focused on national security investigations policy questions include whether dditional personnel or other re sources would improve the performance of the worksite enforcement program and whether such resources should be provided employment eligibility verification related to worksite enforcement and its goal of reducing unauthorized empl oyment is the process of employment eligibility verification under the manda tory i9 system employers examine documents to verify new hires identity and work authorization and employers and employees complete i9 forms there is broad agreement that the widespread availability and use of fraudulent documents has largely undermined the i9 system another available mechanism for employment eligibility verification is the basic pilot program in which participating employers electronically verify new hires i9 information through social security admin istration and cis databases to determine whether individuals are authorized to work the basic pilot program is now available nationwide and participati on is for the most part voluntary174 policy questions include whether to revise or replace the current verification systems options under discussion include making the basic pilot program mandatory for some subset of or all employers and re quiring job seekers to have some type of tamperproof work authoriza tion document these and other options may in turn raise concerns about pr ivacy and discriminationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33351crs44 175 reyes holding the line the effect of re cent border buildup on unauthorized immigration p 80 176 testimony of richard m stana director of justice

york times feb 11 2006 p a8employer sanctions another policy question concerns whether the current penalties for employers who violate the law on the unlawful employment of aliens should be changed some have argued th at employer sanctions and the prohibition against hiring unauthorized aliens should be repealed entirely on the grounds that they have not succeeded in curbing unauthorized employment and have had other negative effects such as lowering wages and undercutting efforts to improve working conditions others have argu ed alternatively that exis ting penalties should be raised and vigorously enforced to increase their deterrent effect some have argued that worksite enforcement has never been truly implemented as employer sanctions were never systematically enforced the former ins conducted few inspections nd they were generally performed randomly instead of targeting industries that were most likely to hi re unauthorized aliens175 role of other federal agencies in worksite enforcement there are other federal agencies which could play larger role in aiding dhss worksite enforcement efforts the most obvious agencies who could aid in worksite enforcement are the department of labor dol since many argue that those who commit wage and hour violations are also lik ely to use unauthorized alien labor and social security administration ssa since the agency can detect possible fraudulent uses of social security numbe rs ssns however increasing the immigration enforcement role of other federal agencies is controversial and could distract the agencies from their primary missions gao has testified that coordination between the ins and with other federal agencies was sometimes problematic noting that the department of labor dol was hesitant to delve into work authorization issues as it might cause workers to fail to report potential wage and safety violations176 in addition recently ice has been critic ized for impersonating other federal agencies to locate unauthorized aliens for example in 2005 ice agents conducted an operation by pretending to be fro m the occupational safety and health administration osha and tricking workers into attending mandatory training session the operation wa s successful leading to the arrest of 48 unauthorized workers but was also criticized by the dol local officials and immigration and job safety advocates who argued that the operation could cause immigrant workers to distrust safety officials responsible fo r protecting the workers by reducing injury rates177 department of labor discussing the mou at

in dol investigations when they perceive that doing so thr eatens their continued employment either because of retaliation by their employer or because contact with dol could trigger an ins action to deport them their family or their friends178 as discussed above in 1998 and 1999 the ins experimented with alternative raids called operation vangua rd using ssas work records to identify unauthorized aliens rather than conducting worksite raids operati on vangaurd did not result in many deportations but may have worked as deterrent reducing the desirability of the meat packing industry to

logistical challenge given its length geography and comparative lack of manpower about 90 of usbp agents are depl oyed along the southwest border with mexico this deployment reflects the usbps decade long policy of prevention through deterrence which aims to place enough agents and resources directly on the border to deter wouldbe border crossers and reroute illegal border traffic from traditional urban routes to less populated and geographically harsher areas providing usbp agents with tactical advantage over illegal border crossers and smugglers208 it also reflects the operational reality that the vast majority of unauthorized migrationinto the us originates in mexico shortly after the creation of dhs the usbp was directed to formulate new border patrol national strategy that would better reflect the realities of the post 911 security landscape in march of 2005 th usbp unveiled the new strategy which places greater emphasis on interdicting terrorists and features five main objectives establishing the substantial probability of apprehending terrorists and their weapons as they attempt to enter illegally between the ports of entry deterring illegal entries through improved enforcement detecting apprehending and deterring smugglers of humans drugs and other contraband leveraging smart border technol ogy to multiply the deterrent and enforcement effect of agents and reducing crime in border communities thereby improving thequality of life and economic vitality of those areas 209 in the national strategy dhs notes that while many classify aliens attempting to enter the country illegally between poe as economic migrants an ever present threat exists from the potential for terrorists to employ the same smuggling and transportation networks infra structure drop houses and other support then use these masses of illegal alie ns as cover for successful crossborder penetration210 in an attempt to address this threat the usbps new strategy focuses on laying thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33351crs54 211 ibid p 3 212 apprehensions have long been used as performance measure by the usbp however it is impossible to gauge solely from apprehen sions data whether increases or decreases in apprehensions are due to unauthorized migration patterns or border enforcement policies and resources an increase in apprehensions could be due to an increase in the number of unauthorized migrants attempting to enter the country the same increase could also be due to increased patrolling of the border as the add itional agents make more arrests or it could be due to both an increase in the number of people attempting to illegally enter the country and increased patrolling lastly it could be due to neither and merely be statistical anomaly foundation for achieving opera tional control over the borde r the usbp defines operational control as the ability to detect respond to and interdict border penetrations in areas deemed as high prio rity for threat poten tial or other national security objectives211 the strategy places greater emphasis on hierarchical and vertical command structure featuring direct chain of command from headquarters to the field the strategy also builds on the prevention through deterrence strategy outlined in the agencys previous national strategic plan by placing added emphasis on enhancing its ability to rapidly deploy agents in response to emerging threats tactical operational and strategic intelligence is critical to this new emphasis on rapid deployment as it will allow the usbp to assess risks and target its enforcement efforts to best address those risks according to the strategy much of this intelligence will be generated through the use of next generation surveillance systems including cameras sensors and other technologies additionally the usbp will coordinate closely with cbps office of intelligence and other dhs and federal agencies intelligence apparatuses lastly the new usbp national strategy formulates different strategies tailored to each of the agencys three operational theaters the southwest border the northe rn border and the coastal waters around florida and puerto rico apprehensions212 the impact of the prevention through deterrence strategy has been difficult to gauge there is considerable evidence that it has made border crossing more challenging expensive and dangerous for illegal aliens however the total number of aliens apprehended increased steadily from 1994 to 2000 as the number of personnel and resources deployed along the border more than doubled it is possible that the increased pr esence of agents and resources stationed on the border led the ins to catch more unauthorized aliens accounting for the increase in apprehensions it is also possibl that the increase in apprehensions during that period instead reflects an increase in the number of people trying to enter the country in order to benefit from the qui ckly growing economy of the mid to late 1990s figure 10 shows the recent trends in usbp apprehensions along the border usbp apprehensions increased steadily th rough the late 1990s reaching peak of 168 million in 2000 from 2000 to 2003 apprehensions have declined steadily reaching low of 931557 in 2003 this reduc tion could be attributed to the prevention through deterren ce strategy finally reaching critical mass of enoughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33351crs55 agents and resources placed directly on the border to severely i nhibit illegal migrants from entering the country conversely th reduction may be the result of fewer unauthorized aliens trying to enter the country due to the economic recession and rising unemployment during this period that made finding low paying jobs increasingly difficult for illegal

investigations would result in an increase in removals of criminal aliens nonetheless there may be limit to the effect that addition of resources will have on criminal alien investigations for example an increase in the number of criminal alien arrests would increase the workload of the executive office for immigration review eoir thus if ice significantly increases their arrests of criminal aliens the removal cases will still have to be adjudicated by eoir before th alien can be remove d in addition since criminal aliens are subject to mandatory detention increasing the arrests of criminal aliens will increase the need for detention bedspace worksite enforcement an analysis of ins investigation workload data reveals that time spent on employer cases by agents supervisors and nonclerical support personnel accounted for less than 18 of total investigation workyears in each year from fy1992 through fy2003 see figures 11 and 12 one factor routinely cited to explain why greater sh are of interior enforcement resources was not available for employer cases is the growth of the criminal alien workload in the 1990s224 according to under secretary hu tchinson the criminal alien workload eventually grew to the point that it c onsumed more investigative hours than any other enforcement activity225 figures 11 and 12 reflect series of changes to the worksite enforcement program that

spent on status violators as well as the percent of time devoted to status violators declined between fy2000 and fy2001 then increased betw een fy2001 and fy2003 nonetheless it is interesting to note that in the most recent data year only 67 of investigative hours were spend on status violators wh the unauthorized population was estimated to be almost 10 million administrative and other the amount of hours spent on administrative and noninvestigative task s more than doubled between fy1992 and fy1998 from 205 workyears to 477 workyears as illustrated in figure 11 similarly as shown in figure 12 the percent of hours devoted to ad ministrative tasks increased from 149 to 232 the largest proportion devoted to ad ministrative duties for any year it is interesting to note that in 1999 ins released its interior enforcement strategy which may account for the increase in noninvestiga tive hours in addition the increase in administrative and other hours may be the result of an increase in time devoted to developing databases including the development of an entryexit system which was mandated in iirira in 1996 in fy2003 23 of all hours 435 workyear s were devoted to administrative and noninvestigative tasks in ddition the percent of time devoted to miscellaneous tasks re mained under 1 until fy2002 and fy2003 and then increased in both years see figure 12 this increase may be attributable to the productivity time lostneeded when dhs was being formed border enforcement inspectors as figure 9 and table 2 above shows the number of hours spent on inspection duties increased betw een fy1992 2273 workyears and fy1994 2446 workyears decreased in fy1995 2245 workyears and then steadily increased until fy2000 3189 workyears the total number of hours decreased between fy2000

source crs analysis of data from the performance analysis system pas interestingly as illustrated in figure 15 an increase in workyears does not automatically result in an increase in apprehensions

the workyears increased eight percent from 6093 to 6591 while apprehensions increased 25 from 931557 to 12 million comparatively between fy2004 and fy2005 the number of usbp workyears increased 22 from 6591 to 8018 while the number of apprehensions increased only 3 the decrease in apprehensions si nce fy2000 may be attributable to fewer unauthorized aliens trying to enter the c ountry due to the economic recession and the increased difficulty finding employment usbp argues that the reason why apprehensions do not seem to be increasing at the same rate as resources is because1997 1998 1999

importantly inspecti on hours are dependent on workload ie how many people are entering the country in any one year but since the number of aliens illegally present in the country tinues to grow it is difficult to argue that there has been decrease in the inte rior or border enforcement workload dhs organizational structure questions have been raised concerni ng the impact of dhss organizational

is essential for us immigration policy to be effective in securing the homeland some maintain that the reforms congress made in the mid1990s requiring all visa applican ts to be checked against lookout databases were inadequate because the databases across the relevant agencies were not interoperable and the various agencies were territorial with their data they maintain that in the long run the most efficient nd effective guard against the entry of aliens who would do us harm is an interagency and interdepartmental database that is accessible in real time to consular fficers cbp inspectors and key law enforcement and intelligence officials others point to the cost time and complexity of developing interoperable databases they cite the difficulty thus far in determining what biometric identifiers are most appropriate for screening aliens244 they point out competing technologies of the existing databases in which vari ous key agencies have already heavily invested some maintain that success of the interope rable database technology depends on 100 inclusion of aliens applying for visas and seeking admission but that the sheer scope of such system poses real time implementation issues they also warn that if intelligence data beco mes too accessible across agencies national security may actually be breached because sensitive information may be more likely to fall into the wrong hands privacy concerns arise as well as the data sharing and interoperability broadens separation of immigration functions into separate dhs agencies when ice and cbp were created neither agency was given responsibility for all immigration enforcement activities and neither was designated the lead agency in immigration enforcement ice receive d ins investigations and intelligence functions as well as its detention and removal cbp received the inspections functions and the border patrol cbp and ice need to heavily rely on each other because within the new structure enforcement efforts initiated by cbp often are supposed to be completed by ice in addition cbp border patrol agents are dependent on ices dro for the detention nd removal of some of the aliens that they apprehend245 nonetheless there have been re ports of rivalries between ice and cbp which inhibit coordina tion moreover the creation of the dhs has meant that in order to implement an interior

the interaction between uscis and ice ins approach to benef it fraud was fragmented and unfocused ins also failed to establish guidance to assure that highpriority cases were investigated248 with the creation of dhs investigating benefit fraud became the responsibility of ice nonetheless ic reportedly did not do this and uscis established its own benefits fraud investigations unit according to ice

that the role of inte grating ice and cbp activities had been the responsibility of directorate of border of transportation security bts which oversaw both ice and cbp but due to staffi ng shortfalls and lack of authority including budget authority over the bureau s bts failed to 1 prevent ice and cbp from working at cross purposes 2 synchronize cbp and ice operations and 3 resolve conflicts between the two agencies the report concluded that cbp and ice had failed to coordinate efforts and that each organization engaged in discrete planning and strategy development processes leading to different priorities and field staff were accountable to separate chains of co mmand in addition the report indicated that the division between ice and cbp is marked by clear institutional barrier and the shortfalls in operational coordination nd information sharing have fostered negative relations between cbp and ice personnel including competition and mistrust252 many have said that merger the magn itude of dhs would take five years or more to settle into satisfactory operations however the oig concluded that the integration has not progre ssed as well as expected noting that the people they interviewed almost universally stated that the current problems were seen as unresolvable because of the unnatural paration of interd ependent functions253 nonetheless dhs responded to the oig s recommendation to merge ice and cbp by maintaining another reor ganization would entail costs including loss of employee productivity during the transition in additi on dhs noted that the new organization could be too big and unwieldy with an ove rly large span of control moreover the report indicated that other agencies may f ear that combined border security agency would become the dominant law enforcement entity254 furthermore the secretary of homela nd security michael chertoff undertook review of the department called the second stage review and after careful study concluded that the best course was not to merge ice and cbp but to institute new management structure to reduce bureau cracy improve account ability and enhance coordination secretary chertoff also c oncluded that merger would diminish the roles of the assistant secretary of ice and the commissioner of cbp creating new bureaucratic reporting mechanism which would diminish coordination rather than enhance

intelligence stru ctures and products the oig reported that the intelligence coordination needs to improve and that the only significant coordination between ice nd cbp relates to intelligence

does not highlight trends or detect anomalies in addition most cbp personnel lack the required clearance to retrieve critical information entered into tecs by ice the oig concluded that the reliance

enforcement these include removing aliens who should not be in the united states investigating alien smuggling and trafficking patrolling between and at ports of entry combating document and benefit fraud nd enforcing the prohibitions against employers hiring aliens without work authorization due to the breadth of immigration enforcement activities the allocation of resources appears to be significant in determining the ability to enforce the immigration laws nonetheless some contend policy based solely on enforcement is bound to fail and only legalization program providing clean slate can reduce the unauthorized population261 however others assert that the united states has not tried immigration enforcement arguing that most of the resources have been devoted to border enfo rcement and that the united states has not fully engaged in other types of immigration enforcement most notably worksite enforcement262 the majority of aliens come to the united states for economic opportunities and for family reunification the ability to contain illegal migration caused by those seeking family reunification may also depend on the ability of dhs to clear the backlog of immigration petitions and proce ss new petitions in addition the per country ceilings on certain types of fa mily based immigration ffect the ability of aliens from countries with high levels of immigration eg the philippines to immigrate263 congressional action would be needed to change the percountry ceilings264 some maintain that only reform of the legal immigration system can decrease illegal immigration265 in addition the amount of illegal migra tion may also be dependent on the economic health of the sending countries especially of those countries in the americas factors in other countries effect the desi re of their populations to immigrate legally or illegally to the united states for example between 2000 and 2003 uruguay experienced recession increas ing the propensity of

2006worker program creating opportunities for large number of immigrants to come to the united states to work could signif icantly reduce the unauthorized migration267 however others argue that better works ite enforcement and enforcement document fraud would make it more difficult for unauthorized aliens to find work resulting in decrease in the unauthorized population268 it is possible that combination of guest worker program and increased worksite enforcement may be utilized to reduce the unauthorized population although within the united states the enforcement of immigration law is primarily the responsibility of the department of home land securitys bureaus of immigration and customs enforcement ice and customs and border protection cbp one possible option to aid in the reduction of the unauthorized alien population might be to increase the coordina tion and information sharing with other federal agencies such as the social security administration and the department of labor another approach may be to increase the role of local law enforcement agencies in the enforcement of immigration laws269 yet many fear that these options will distract the agencies from their primary missions and could hinder the agencies ability to perform other functions if unauthor ized aliens will not interact with them in some instances the enforcement of certain immigration laws can be controversial although few would argue that aliens should be allowed to enter without being inspected by an immigration fficer and that smugglers and traffickers should not be punished enforcement agai nst longerterm noncriminal unauthorized aliens is often politically difficult due to these aliens long standing ties to their communities often these aliens are integrated in their communities and the governments attempts to remove them can result in backlash from the community furthermore there are concerns that incr eased enforcement agai nst aliens working illegally will disrupt sectors of the econom that depend on fore ign labor and harm the united states economy the conflic ting pressures to reduce the unauthorized population while safeguarding the us economy and maintaining good
