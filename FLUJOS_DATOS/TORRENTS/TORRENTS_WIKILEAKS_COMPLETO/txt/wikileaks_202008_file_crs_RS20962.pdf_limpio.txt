g343g561g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561 the territory now known as the western sahara became spanish possession in 1881 in the mid 1970s spain prepared to decolonize the region intending to transform it into closely aligned independent state after referendum on selfdetermination morocco and mauritania opposed spains plan and each claimed the territory although their claims were based on historic empires the western saharas valuable phosphate resources and fishing grounds also may have motivated them 1 at moroccos initiative the general assembly referred the question to the international court of justice icj but on october 12 1975 the icj ruled in favor of self determination for the sahrawi people in response on november 6 1975 king hassan ii of morocco launched green march of 350000 unarmed civilians to the western sahara to claim it spanish authorities halted the marchers but on november 16 spain agreed to withdraw and transfer the region to joint moroccanmauritanian administration the independenceseeking popular front for the libe ration of saqiat hamra and rio oro or polisario founded in 1974 forcefully resisted the moroccanmauritanian takeover in the 1970s about 160000 sahrawis left the western sahara for refugee camps in algeria and mauritania with algerias support the polisario established its headquarters in tindouf in southwest algeria and founded the sahrawi arab democratic republic sadr in 1976 mauritania could not sustain defense against the polisario and signed peace treaty with it abandoning all claims in august 1979 morocco then occupied mauritanias sector and in 1981 began to build berm or sand wall to separate the 80 of the western sahara that it occupied from the polisario and sahrawi refugees moroccos armed forces and polisario guerrillas fought long war in the desert until the arranged ceasefire and proposed settlement plan in 1991 security council resolution 690 april 29 1991 established the united nations mission for the organization of referendum in the western sahara minurso and called for referendum to offer choice between independence and integration into morocco however over the next decade morocco and the polisario differed over how to identify voters for the referendum with each seeking to ensure an elec toral roll that would support its desired outcome in march 1997 secretarygeneral kofi annan named former us secretary of state james baker iii as his personal envoy to break the deadlock baker brokered an agreement to restart voter identification which was completed in 1999 with 86000 voters identified minurso then faced more than 130000 appeals by those denied identification as voters who were supported by morocco security council resolution 1301 may 31 2000 asked the parties to consider alternatives to referendum the concluded that processing appeals could take longer than the initial identification process and that effective implementation of the settlement plan would require the full cooperation of morocco and the polisario and the support of algeria and mauritania because morocco and the polisario would each cooperate only with implementation that would produce its desired outcome full co operation would be difficult or impossible to obtain the also stated that it lacked mechanism to enforce the results of referendum 1 the possibility of oil and gas reserves as yet unproven off the atlantic coast surf aced years later and has probably increased both sides desire for the region but the lack of resolution to the western sahara dispute deters exploration

20 2001 report on the western sahara proposed framework agreement that became known as the baker plan to confer on the population of the western sahara the right to elect executive and legislative bodies and to control local government and many functional areas the executive would be elected by voters identified as of december 1999 that is by an electorate favoring the polisario and excluding moroccansupported appellants morocco would control foreign relations national security and defense referendum on final status would be held within five years with oneyear residence in the western sahara then the sole criterion for voting that electorate would favor morocco by including its settlers as well as native sahrawis 2 annan hoped that morocco the polisario algeria and mauritania would negotiate changes acceptable to all after baker met representatives of algeria mauritania and the polisario however annan on his and bakers behalf doubted the parties political will to resolve the conflict and cooperate with efforts 3 the security council could not agree on new approach and both sides and algeria rejected partition in january 2003 baker presented compromise that did not require the consent of the parties4 it would lead to referendum in which voters would choose integration with morocco autonomy or independence v oters would be sahrawis on the december 1999 provisional voter list on the office of the high commissioner for refu gees repatriation list as of october 2000 or continuously resident in the western sahara since december 30 1999 therefore including moroccan settlers the would determine the voters without appeal in the interim western sahara authority would be the local government and morocco would control foreign relations national security and defense morocco objected mainly questioning why the was reviving the referendum option it also was upset by the use of the word independence instead of the vaguer selfdetermination to describe an option 5 on april 9 2004 morocco declared that it would only accept autonomy as solution6 it called for negotiations only with algeria insisting that the sahara is bilateral geopolitical problem underlying these views was rejection of any challenge to moroccos physical possession of the territory algeria concluded that the baker plan was gamble that should be taken and the polisario accepted it too algeria declined to negotiate insisting that it is not party to the dispute and not substitute for the sahrawis the polisario rejected autonomy and insisted on the right to choose selfdetermination in referendum james baker resigned as the secretarygenerals personal envoy in june 2004 the baker plan has not been mentioned in security council reso lutions since then in july 2005 annan appointed danish diplomat peter van walsum as his new voy van walsum indicated that he could not draft new plan because morocco would only endorse one that excludes independence while the 2 security council

could not endorse plan that excludes referendum with independence as an option he concluded that the remaining options were deadlock or direct negotiations since the former was unacceptable responsibility rested with the parties van walsum also reported that the western sahara was not high on the international political agenda and that most capitals seek to continue good relations with both morocco and algeria hence they acquiesce in the impasse7 security council resolution 1754 april 30 2007 called on morocco and the polisario to negotiate without preconditions on political solution that will provide for the selfdetermination of the people of the western sahara in 2007 and 2008 the two sides met and held consultations with van walsum four times at manhasset new york but neither was willing to discuss the others proposals ie moroccos for autonomy and the polisarios for referendum algeria mauritania and other interested countries were present in april 2008 van walsum stated that an independent western sahara is not realistic proposition prompting the polisario to accuse him of bias in favor of morocco call for his replacement and refuse to return to negotiations secretarygeneral ban kimoon did not reappoint van walsum in august talks have not resumed the secretarygeneral is expected to name us diplomat christopher ross to replace van walsum the also has been

political systems algeria emerged from bloody revolution with leftist orientation while the moroccan monarchy survived intact from much less violent struggle with france almost since independence the neighbors have competed for regional preeminence and the western sahara is where the contest is now joined from the beginning the western sahara issue has unified moroccans and reinforced support for monarchy that had survived two coup attempts king mohammed vi has strongly reasserted moroccos claim to the region since he ascended to the throne in july 1999 although the territory may be shortterm financial liability its actual and potential resources may be longterm economic boon furthermore moroccan authorities see the western sahara as check on algerias regional ambitions being pursued via what they consider polisario surrogates on april 21 2001 the king suggested decentralization as the best option for the sahara and in november 2002 he declared that political solution must respect moroccos territorial integrity 8 morocco has markedly increased investment in the region to reinforce its claim to sovereignty on april 11 2007 morocco presented an autonomy plan for the western sahara under moroccan sovereignty without the prospect of independence for negotiation to the secretarygeneral 9 abdelaziz bouteflika became president of algeria in april 1999 an activist in the algerian revolution he and his countrymen sees the western sahara as one of the worlds last decolonization campaigns if the polisario won control of the region algeria would benefit by gaining access to the atlantic ocean should the issu simply simmer it still is lowcost way to keep morocco bogged down algeria has unwaveringly supported its protégés desire for self 7 security council report of the

for the sadrs african union au membership and for many african governments recognition of the sadr latin american governments also have recognized it morocco suspended its membership in the organization for african unity oau the predecessor of the au and has not joined the au because of the aus acceptance of the sadr g18g155g152g156g153g142g140g157g156g561 moroccos response to the 2003 baker plan and subsequent official statements indicated diminished willingness to compromise at the same time that algeria and the polisario then appeared more willing to compromise the polisario has since become less compromising in its insistence on selfdetermination while morocco will not bend on its autonomy proposal in other words the current impasse is likely to continue for the foreseeable future the polisario periodically threatens return to armed struggle but it remains unable to resume military campaign without the aid and presumably the permission of algeria which are not expected algeria is focusing on its economy and international image and is concerned about resurgent islamist terrorism it has nurtured closer ties with the united states france and spain that would be strained if it allowed return to violence moreover some of the polisarios threats may only be rhetoric to enable entrenched leaders to appease vocal young militants in addition the polisario is disadvantaged militarily it has between 3000 and 6000 soldiers although much of the civilian refugee population could be mobilized to support guerrilla campaign they would confront about 100000 moroccan troops stationed in the western sahara with civilian support services the moroccan presence in the region may total 300000 the moroccan army has total strength of 175000 with 150000 more in reserves the polisario has instigated popular demonstrations for independence in the western sahara but it has not resorted to terrorism that would cost it sympathy abroad and denies all moroccan allegations that it has links to qaeda the western sahara is transit point for illegal moroccan sahrawi subsaharan african and south asian migrants attempting to reach the canary islands spain by boat the secretarygeneral has noted significant increase in operations to smuggle migrants through the western sahara since 2003 morocco and the polisario have justified violations of the ceasefire as actions to curb smuggling morocco appears to be using the need to control illegal immigration as pretext to bolster its forces in other words it is tightening its hold on the region as long as the western sahara issue is unresolved relations between morocco and algeria are unlikely to be normalized algeria had indicated that it was willing to develop bilateral relations without resolution to the conflict but morocco insisted that the western sahara was too important an issue to set aside noting that algeria shelters and hosts people who carry weapons against morocco in march 2008 morocco called for reopening its border with algeria but algeria said that the border would remain closed until agreement on many issues including solution for the western sahara due to the western sahara dispute the arab maghreb union of which both are members has not held summit since 1994 10 10 the arab maghreb union including algeria morocco tunisia libya and mauritania was founded in 1989 to
