internet commerce updated march 9 2006 steven maguire economist government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31252state and local sales and use taxes and internet commerce summary in theory state sales and use taxe s are consumption taxes based on the destination principle the destination principle prescrib that taxes should be paid where the consumption takes place sales taxes collected at the point of sale achieve this if consumption takes place near th point of transaction thus to remain consistent with the destinati on principle consumers pay use tax on products purchased outofstate and used in their home state where cons umption likely takes place under current law states cannot reach beyond their borders and compel outof state vendors without nexus in the state to collect the use tax owed by state residents the supreme court has ruled th at requiring remote vendors to collect the use tax would pose an undue burden on inters tate commerce states are concerned because they anticipate gradually losing more tax revenue as the growth of internet commerce allows more residents to buy products from vendors located outofstate and evade use taxes recent estimates put this loss at approximately 8 billion in 2003 for this report internet taxes ar existing use taxes and taxes on internet access services states that rely more h eavily on the sales and use tax will likely lose more revenue than states ss reliant on the sales and use tax congress is involved in this issue because commerce conducted by parties in different states over the internet falls under the commer ce clause of the constitution related issue is the internet tax moratorium the moratorium prohibits 1 new taxes on internet access services and 2 multiple or discriminatory taxes on internet commerce this moratorium was created by the internet tax freedom act itfa of 1998 and had expired on oc tober 21 2001 congress extended the internet tax moratorium through nove mber 1 2003 with pl 10775 enacted on november 28 2001 the moratorium was extended for an add itional four years through november 1 2007 by pl 108435 enacted on december 3 2004 the moratorium is related to the use tax collection issue but is distinct from the remote collection issue the degree of further congressional involve ment in the remote collection issue is uncertain opponents of remote vendor use tax coll ection responsibility generally support clearer definition of nexus for use tax purposes many state officials would like congress to change the law and allo w states to require outofstate vendors without nexus to collect state use taxes simplification and harmonization of state tax systems are likely prerequisites for congress to consider approval of increased collection authority for states

taxes in fy20032 both state and local sales taxes are collected by vendors at the time of transac tion and are levied at per centage of products retail price alternatively use taxes are ofte n not collected by th vendor if the vendor does not have nexus loosely defined as phy sical presence in the consumers state consumers are required to remit use taxes to their taxing jurisdiction compliance with this requirement however is quite low because of the low compliance many observers suggest that the expansion of the internet as means of transacting business across state lines both from busin

debate this report in tends to clarify important issues in the internet tax debate overview brief history of the sales and use tax in 1932 mississippi was the first state to impose general state sales

congress steven maguire nonna noto 9 gross receipts tax such as new mexicos is business tax that is levied on all of the revenues generated by business operating in the state the grandfathering provision in the internet tax freedom act allowed states with internet access taxes in place to keep them the current list of states with internet access taxes new mexico north dakota ohio south dakota tennessee texas with 25 exemption and wisconsin 10 pl 105277 title xi23 other states followed suit and implemented general sales tax5 at the time the sales tax was relatively easy to administer and could raise significant amount of revenue with relatively low rate6 given the relative success of the sales tax in raising revenue 45 states and the district of columbia added the sales tax to their tax infrastructure by the late 1960s the last of the 45 states to enact general sales and use tax was vermont in 19697 what are internet taxes over the last several years number of bills have been introduced in congress that address internet taxes8 for this report and in the majority of the legislation introduced internet taxes refer to two subfederal taxes 1 state sales taxes on internet access services sometimes referred to as internet access taxes and 2 state sale s and use taxes on products and services purchased over the internet internet access taxes in states where they exist are typically sales tax or gross receipts tax grt on internet access services9 the internet tax freedom act itf defines internet access rvice as service that enables users to access content information electronic mail or ot her services offered over the internet10 the economic burden of an internet access tax is shared by access providers such as america online nd earthlink and consumers of internet services the most recent extension of the in ternet tax moratorium pl 108435 prohibited internet access taxes unless they existed before the original passage of the itfa in october 1998 the extension of the moratorium expires november 1 2007 permanent prohibition of internet access taxes would prevent state and local governments from ever assessing sales tax or grt on the provision of these services some observers have argued th at the definition of internet access should be broadened to ensure th at all means of connecting to the internet such as through digital subscriber lines dsl are treated equally the most recent moratorium extension modified the moratorium to include new taxes on dsl those not existing before november 1 2003 under the originalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31252crs3 11 special provision applying only to wisconsin extends the grandfather provision for existing dsl taxes in that state thr ough november 1 2005 not november 1 2007 12 tax evasion is illegal whereas tax avoidance where individuals change their behavior to reduce their tax burden is legal for exampl moving to state with personal income tax such as florida maine or texas is legal state income tax avoidance florida resident not paying the florida use tax on an outofstate purchase is tax evasion 13 two decisions shape the current legal status of remote collection national bellas hess inc v department of r evenue state of illinois 386 us 753 1967 and quill corporation v north dakota 504 us 298 1992 14 see crs report rs22387 the streamlined sales and use tax agreement brief description by steven maguiremoratorium telecommunications services in cluding dsl were not subject to the moratorium and thus were taxable althoug h cable internet access was included in the moratorium many states began taxing dsl services and during the debate over the most recent extension pl 108435 many policymakers proposed including dsl in the moratorium as compromise congress banned new ds l taxes and allowed states that had already taxed dsl to continue to do so for the life of the moratorium11 the second type of internet tax is the imposition of the sales and use tax on transactions arranged over the internet the expanding acceptance of the internet as an alternative to traditional retail transactions has complicated the collection of this tax generally if vendor does not ve nexus loosely defined as physical presence in the buyers home state then the vendor is not required to collect the sales or use tax in these situations where the vendor does not have nexus the buyer is required to remit use tax to his or her state government typically through the state income tax in reality consumer compliance with this requirement is quite low thus contrary to what some obser vers suggest internet purchases are tax free only in the sense that consumers are evading the use tax due on those transactions12 the variation among the state and local governments in the administration of the sales tax is at the center of the internet tax debate the us supreme court has ruled that the collection of sales taxes by remote vendors woul d be too burdensome there are thousands of taxing jurisdic tions each with its own rates and base13 in an effort to minimize that administrative burden many states are working together to simplify and standardize their tax systems in the hope that congress will grant them the authority to require remote vendors to collect the sales tax this initiative is identified as the streamlined sale s and use tax agreement ssuta14 simplification of sales and use taxes will be difficult because of the extensive variation among states in the administration of the sales and use tax an analysis of state and local sales tax systems follows below two components of the sales and use tax the revenue that sales and use tax generates assumin g given level of compliance depends upon the chosen rate nd the base to whic h the rate applieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31252crs4 15 for example only two states tax dical services hawaii and new mexico 16 common identity in the economics of income accounting is the following cys or consumption c equals income less saving s thus income less savings is total consumption 17 cline robert john mikesell tom neubig and andrew philips sales taxation of business inputs council on state taxation special report january 25 2005the more narrow the base the higher the ra must be to raise an equivalent amount of revenue states often have similar consumption items included in their tax base but they are far from uniform tax rates can also vary considerably depending on the states reliance on other revenue sour ces the ssuta is intended to create more uniform sales tax system among participating states the ssuta would establish system where states would use common definitions for goods and services once uniform definition is established states would then indicate whether the good or servi ce is taxable in addition states would also identify which entities would be exempt from paying sales taxes eg nonprofit or religious organizations tax base the sales tax which is often considered consumption tax is perhaps better identified as transaction tax on tangible personal property expenditures on internet access legal and medical services are often excluded from the state sales tax base15 in many states groceries are also exempt from the sales tax or taxed at lower rate see table 1 true consumption tax would include all income that is not saved including personal expenditures on services16 businesstobusiness transactions are often exempt from the retail sales tax particularly in cases where the purchaser is using the good as an input to production these transactions are exempt because incl uding the transactions could lead to the pyramiding of the sales tax for example if coffee shop were to pay retail sales tax on the purchase of coffee and then impose retail sales tax on coffee brewed for the final consumer the total sales tax paid for the cup of coffee would likely exceed the statutory rate products that busin ess purchases for resale are typically not assessed retail sale s tax for similar reason if coffee shop buys beans only for resale levying sales tax on the wholesale purchase of the beans and then on the retail sale would more than double the stat utory rate tax tr eatment of business purchases is not uniform acr oss states according to recent estimates approximately 18 of business purchases are taxable more or less depending on the state17 many individuals and organizations ar also exempt from state sales taxes entities wishing to claim the sales tax exemption are often issued certificate indicating their taxfree status and are required to present this certification at the point of transaction nonprofit organi zations such as those whose mission is religious charitable educa tional or promoting public health often hold sales tax exempt status tax rate the second component of sales ta x is the tax rate applied to the base described in the prev ious section in 39 states local governments piggybackhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31252crs5 18 for example see chris micheli california strengthens salesuse tax collections state tax notes dec 15 2003 pp 964965 19 the bureau of the census also collects data on excise taxes and selective sales we do not report these receipts because they are typica lly collected at the wholesale level not at the point of retail transaction for example th gasoline excise tax is typically paid by the carrier tanker truck at the point of collec tion the end of the pipeline not retail sale 20 under gross receipts tax grt vendor remits designated percentage eg 5 in new mexico of monthly gross receipts or sale s revenue to the state gross receipts tax is different from the sales tax because the vendor is legally responsible for paying the tax not the purchaser under the sales tax the ve ndor acts as the collection agent for the taxing jurisdiction and is not technically paying the tax the buyer is paying the taxa local sales tax which often varies among localities within the state on the state sales tax 11 states and the district of columbia levy single rate see table 2 with local taxes some states in the group of 39 may collect uniform local tax along with the state tax and send the local revenue share back to the localities this structure would look like single rate to the consumer because vendors typically do not differentiate between the state and local share for example vendors in virginia levy 50 sales tax on purchas and remit the entire amount to the state the state then sends what would have been raised by 1 tax back to the local jurisdiction where the tax was collected the state of virginia keeps the remaining 40 generally states with br oader base can collect the same amount of revenue at lower rate than state with narro w base mississippi rhode island and tennessee have the highest st ate sales tax rate of 70 however in 2006 alabama had the highest potential combined state nd local rate of 120 residents in high sales tax rate jurisdictions could gain from internet purchases and tax evasion more than those in low tax rate states recognizing this potential revenue drain many states have stepped up efforts to inform consumers of their responsibility to pay use taxes on internet and mail order catalog purchases18 as suggested earlier states with high rates and whose residents have greater incentive to evade taxes are exposed to greater potential revenue losses from the growth of internet commerce because of the greater potential losses thes states are more likely to support reforms that help maintain their sa and use tax revenue base table 2 presents the sales tax rates for the 50 states their localities and the district of columbia also reported in table 2 is the reliance as measured by crs of state and local governments on the general sales or gross receipts tax even though gross receipts taxes have more in common with traditional business taxes the bureau of the census combines them with general sales taxes19 depending on the state law and the vendor revenue generated by internet tr ansactions with outofstate purchasers may or may not fa ll under the gross receipts tax20 internet taxes economic issues during the debate about internet taxes some economic issues will be important to consider how will the treatment of internet taxes influence the efficiency and equity of state tax systems what will be the impact of changes in the treatment of internet transactions on states that are more reliant on the sales taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31252crs6 21 equity has both horizontal and vertical co mponents tax is defined as horizontally equitable if people of equal circumstances pay equal taxes tax is defined as vertically equitable if people with greater ability to pay carry greater tax burden than those less able to pay an optimal commodity tax woul d likely violate accepted principles of vertical equity 22 this example is based on one provided in dennis zimmerman the internet sales tax debate sorting through the economic issues paper prepared for the 94th annual conference national tax association baltimore md nov 810 2001 23 the pretax absolute price difference betw een the two retailers is unimportant the internet price inclusive of shipping could actu ally be lower before taxes the application continuedwhat will the potential revenue loss be absent changes in the treatment of internet transactions summary of those issues follows below efficiency commonly held view among ec onomists is that good tax or more precisely an efficient tax is one that does not significantly distort consumer behavior broadly speaking individuals should make the same choices before and after tax is imposed the greater the dist ortions in behavior caused by tax the greater the economic welfare loss sales tax levied on all consumer expenditures equally would satisfy this definition of fficiency however as noted earlier under the current state sales tax system all consumption expenditures are not treated equally the growth of taxfree internet transactions both business to business and business to consumer will likely amplify the efficiency losses from altered consumer behavior an alternative theory for sales taxation is referred to as optimal commodity taxation u nder an optimal commodity tax the tax rate should be based on or determined by the price elasticity of demand for the product sometimes called the ramsey rule conversely products that are price inelastic meaning quantity demanded is insensitive to changes in price should be levied higher rate of tax products that are price elastic should have lower rate of tax if products purchased over the internet are relatively more price elastic then the lower tax rate created by effectively taxfree internet transactions may improve economic efficiency however the price elasticity of products available over the internet is difficult to measure and the efficiency ga in if any would be small21 an additional economic inefficiency w ould arise if vendors change location to avoid collecting sales taxes the location change would likely result in higher transportation costs in the long run it is conceivable that the higher transportation costs would erode the advant age of evading the sales tax for example consider virginia consumer who wants to buy set of woodworking chisels22 the local virginia hardware store sells the set for 50 including profit an internet savvy hardware store in georgia is willing to sell the same chisel set for 52 inclusive of profit nd shipping costs so before taxes the local retailer could offer the chisels at lower price the marginal customer who is indifferent between the two retailers before taxes is just as likely to buy from the internet retailer as from the local retailer23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31252crs7 23 continued of the use tax makes the local retailers product relatively more expensive regardless of what the prices were before taxes 24 shipping costs can be thought of as cost of production the local retailer probably also paid shipping costs to have the product on the shelf those costs are included in the price of the good because the local retailer likely bought in bulk the shipping cost per unit would be considerably lower than the internet retailer 25 regressive tax collects smaller percentage of income as income increases economists will usually avoid normative questions of what is equitable because such statement implies an interpersonal comparison of utility 26 goolsbee and zittrain 1999 found that the average internet user had on average two more years of education and 22000 more in family income than noninternet usershowever the virginia state and local sale s tax of 50 yields final sales price to the consumer of 5250 given the higher relative price inclusive of the tax the marginal consumer along with many othe r consumers would likely switch to buying chisels from the georgia based internet retailer assuming these consumers do not feel compelled to pay the required virginia use tax on the internet purchase the diversion from retail to the internet in re sponse to the noncollection of the use tax represents loss in economic efficiency the additional 2 in production costs 52 less 50 represents the efficiency ss to society from evading the use tax24 note that if in the absence of sales nd use taxes the internet vendor in the above example may yield to market forces and close up shop howeve r if the internet vendor continues to operate even without the tax advantage it could be the case that consumers are willing to pay high er prices for the convenience of internet shopping if this were true then the hi gher production costs for internet vendors would not necessarily result in an efficiency loss equity the sales tax has often been criticized as regressive tax or tax that disproportionately burdens the poor25 assuming internet shoppers are relatively better off and do not remit use taxes as prescribed by state law they can avoid paying tax on larger portion of their consumpti on expenditures than those without internet access at home or work26 consumers without ready in ternet access are not afforded the same opportunity to evade the sales nd use tax in this way electronic commerce may actually exacerbate the regressiveness of the sales tax at least in the short run as computers and access to the internet become more readily available the potential inequity arising from this aspect of the digital divide could diminish differential effect among states the growth of internet based commerce will have the greatest effect on the states most reliant on the sales and use tax in addition to having more revenue at risk high reliance states also face greater efficiency losses because of their generally higher state tax rates as noted earlier higher rates drive larger wedge between the retail price inclusive of the sales tax and the internet price and thus exacerbate the efficiency loss from the sales tax states with low rates and less reliance would tend to have smaller wedge between the two modes of transaction high rateh igh reliance states would tend to recognize the greatest revenue loss from ban on th taxation of internet transactionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31252crs8 27 in addition those three states were well above the average state tax rate in the us of just over 53 of the 45 states with state sales ta x and the

and william fox estimated in july 2004 that the new ecommerce loss in 2003 was approximately 8 billion29 new ecommerce as measured by bruce and fox is the lost revenue from states not collecting the use tax on remote internet transactions this estimate excludes purchases made over the telephone or through catalogs that would have occurred anyway an earlier general ccounting office gao report estimated that the revenue loss in 2003 from internet sa would be between 10 billion and 124 billion30 the wide range of the gao estimate reflects the degree of uncertainty on the size of the potential state and local revenue loss from ecommerce the rapid growth of electronic commerce is exhibited by data provided by the us bureau of census and could imply that the state and local revenue loss will grow over time according to retail survey data from the us department of commerce the third quarter 2004 commerce sales estimate 176 billion increased 215 from the third quarter of 200331 policy options congress can play an active or passive ro in the remote vendor tax collection debate more active role would likely involve new limits on the ability of state and local governments to levy taxes on internet access and to further regulate transactions conducted over the internet passive pproach would end the moratorium whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31252crs9 32 charles mclure jr sstp out of great swamp but whither plea to rationalize the state sales tax state tax notes december 31 2001 p 1077 33 all states except vermont have some type of balanced budget ruleexpires on november 1 2007 and not intr oduce any additional legislation that directly affects taxes on internet commerce including the remote collection issue this section explores some possible outcomes and consequences of the two alternatives active approach the active options available to congress range from 1 forbidding subfederal governments from levying taxes on both internet access and on transactions conducted over the internet regardless of nexus issues to 2 requiring remote vendors thos without nexus to collect and remit use taxes the first option is unlikely without an acco mpanying concession by the federal government to compensate for the federa l mandate the second option is unlikely without continued action by the states and local governments to simplify and harmonize their tax regimes32 both extremes in the active appro ach have their supporters however proponents closely aligned with the first op tion essentially creatin g an internet tax free zone seem driven more by reducin g taxes generally than by other policy concerns supporters closer to the othe r option are concerne d about state revenue losses as well as the apparent need to reform state and local taxes these activists believe the internet tax bate provides unique opportun ity to simplify and reform state and local sales taxes passive approach this approach not renewing the moratorium and inaction on the use tax collection issue would implicitly maintain the current limitations on the states ability to require remote vendors to co llect sales and use taxes some observers believe that this course may result in st ates depending less on the sales tax because untaxed internet transactions would over time significantly erode the revenue base the lost sales ta x revenue would likely be replaced by tax source that is potentially less stable eg the individual income tax or corporate income tax unstable revenue sources are unwelcome to state officials who must balance their operating budgets annually r biannually and unlike the federal government states face constitutional or gislated restrictions on the use of debt and on the total amount of debt outstanding33 thus funding mporary shortfalls with borrowing is more difficult for state and local governments than for the federal government move away from the sale s tax as primary revenue source could present difficult fiscal choices for state and local governments nevertheless advocates of the passive approach suggest that lower tax burden on internet transactions would help small internet retailers compete with larger established retail entities while relatively lower tax burden would clearly help internet vendors in the short run direct pa yments to internet vendors would seem to be more transparent means of delivering subsidy opponents of congressional pa ssivity on the sales and use tax collection issue focus on potential state revenue losses if congress does nothing also thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31252crs10 differential tax trea tment of internet vendors and traditional bricks and mortar vendors is cited by opponents of congressional inactivity in the internet tax debate finally some critics of the passive approach believe that anticipated congressional action provides the impetus for state and local governments to simplify their sales tax systems table 1 state
