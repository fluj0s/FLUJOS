fy2006 medicaid medicare and state childrens health insurance program schip provisions fy2006 budget reconciliation targets the house and senate approved the conference report hrept 10962 on hconres 95 the concurrent resolution on the fy2006 budget on april 28 2005 the annual concurrent resolution on the budget sets forth the congressional budget when the federal deficit is expected to be large budget resolutions often require reductions in mandatory spending in such instances the budget resolution includes reconciliation instructions that require authorizing committees to report changes to legislation to reduce spending on mandatory programs under their jurisdictions the fy2006 budget resolution includes reconciliation instructions that direct authorizing committees to report legislation to reduce mandatory spending for the fy2006 fy2010 period subsequently these proposals are to be combined in single reconciliation bill by each of the house and senate budget committees the senate committee on finance was instructed to meet budget reconciliation target of 10 billion in mandatory spending savings over the fiveyear period on october 25 2005 the senate finance committee reported its reconciliation proposal to the senate budget committee which subsequently incorporated the proposal into s 1932 the deficit reduction omnibus reconciliation act of 2005 the finance committee met its reconciliation instruction by making changes in medicaid medicare and the state childrens health insurance program schip in the house the committee on energy and commerce had budget reconciliation instructions specifying mandatory savings target of 14734 billion between fy2006 and fy2010 the energy and commerce committee markup took place on october 27 2005 in the health care area its recommendations resulted in changes in medicaid the committees recommendations were incorporated into the house budget committee bill hr 4241 the deficit reduction act of 2005 and reported on november 7 2005 budget reconciliation conference agreement on s 1932 was filed on december 19 2005 the house agreed to the report by vote of 212206 that day on december 21 the senate removed extraneous provisions form the legislation pursuant to point of order raised under the byrd rule passed the amended agreement and returned the measure to the house final action on the conference agreement is expected when the house reconvenes later this month crs2 senate bill like number of senate committees the senate committee on finance achieves its reconciliation instruction budget mark through recommended program changes that result in both direct spending increases and decreases the committees medicaid saving proposals include changes in the payment methods for prescription drugs b changes in eligibility and benefit rules for longterm care services c changes in the programs approach to limit fraud and d changes in some components of state medicaid financing the finance committee also recommended number of changes that would result in medicaid spending increases these proposals include temporary financial relief for medicaid costs of individuals who resided prior to hurricane katrina in selected parishes in louisiana and counties in alabama and mississippi and provision not to allow alaskas federal medical assistance percentage to fall below its fy2005 level b an increase in the disproportionate share hospital payment allotment in the district of columbia and c number of demonstrations and program expansions the legislation also contains several provisions that affect the state childrens health insurance program schip including 1 provisions to redistribute unspent fy2003throughfy2005 original allotments to states that fully spent their original allotments and 2 to prohibit additional states from using schip funds to cover childless adults the medicare provisions include both direct spending savings and increases the three major areas of committee recommendations include changes to the medicare advantage component of medicare b the development of value based reimbursement for medicare providers and c 1 update for physician reimbursement rates in 2006 the finance committee provisions include number of other medicarerelated provisions based on congressional budget office cbo estimates changes in the medicare program would amount to 57 billion in savings from fy2006 to fy2010 changes in the medicaid and the schip program would amount to 43 billion in savings over the period1 the change in medicares payment for physician services would result in 108 billion increase over the fiveyear period but this would be offset by 12 billion in medicare advantage plan savings and an additional 45 billion in savings from valuebased purchasing temporary increase in federal medical assistance percentage fmap payment rates for individuals in selected louisiana parishes and counties in alabama and mississippi affected by hurricane katrina would increase medicaid spending by 18 billion the largest medicaid savings proposal is the result of changes in the reimbursement for outpatient prescription drugs the finance committee proposals result in 63 billion reduction over the fiveyear period the health provisions in the senate finance committee proposal were modified by several floor amendments the amendments included changes that 1 would require that fy2006 fmaps would be recalculated and it would limit any reductions 1 congressional budget office cost estimate reconciliation recommendations of the senate committee on finance as approved by the senate committee on finance on oct 25 2005 crs3 in states fy2006 fmap rate the estimated increased cost of this provision would be offset by extending outpatient prescription drug rebates to most managed care organizations other amendments would 1 authorize the continued provision of certain adult day health care services or medical adult day care services under state medicaid plan 2 exclude discounts provided to mail order and nursing facility pharmacies from the determination of average manufacturer price and to extend the discounts offered under feeforservice medicaid for prescription drugs to managed care organizations 3 amend medicare to make technical correction regarding purchase agreements for powerdriven wheelchairs provide for coverage of ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms under part b improve patient access to and utilization of the colorectal cancer screening benefit and provide for the coverage of marriage and family therapist services and mental health counselor services under part b of such title 4 modify the quality measurement system defined in the medicare valuebased purchasing section of the proposal 5 provide for medicaid demonstration project for lowincome hivinfected individuals and 6 modify the federal upper payment limit for independent pharmacies located in rural and frontier areas information on these amendments are incorporated in the senate bill provision descriptions medicaid medicaid outpatient prescription drugs the major medicaid outpatient prescription drug provisions alter the upper limits that apply to federal reimbursement of state spending on prescription drugs alter the formulas for calculating the rebates that prescription drug manufacturers are required to pay to states and establish special reporting requirements for the prices of certain authorized generic drugs and certain outpatient drugs administered in physicians offices federal upper limits under current law state medicaid programs set the prices paid to pharmacies for medicaid outpatient drugs federal reimbursements for those drugs however are limited to federal upper limit ful the ful that applies to drugs available from multiple sources generic drugs for the most part is calculated by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to be equal to 150 of the lowest published average wholesale price awp for the least costly therapeutic equivalent the upper limit that applies to brandname and other drugs is equal to the acquisition cost as estimated by the states the senate bill would replace the current ful requirement so that state payments for single source drugs provided in pharmacies that are not critical access pharmacies would qualify for federal reimbursement up to 105 of the average manufacturer price amp as reported to cms by the manufacturers fuls for multiple source drugs provided in pharmacies that are not critical access pharmacies would be equal to 115 of the weighted amp for those drugs state payments for single source drugs provided in critical access retail pharmacies would qualify for federal reimbursement up to the lesser of 108 of the amp or the wholesale acquisition cost for the drug fuls for multiple source drugs provided in critical crs4 access pharmacies would qualify for federal reimbursement up to the lesser of 140 of the amp or the wholesale acquisition cost for the drug critical access retail pharmacies are defined as those retail pharmacies that are not within 20 miles of any other retail pharmacy in addition the bill includes interim upper payment limits that would apply during calendar year 2006 before the new fuls become effective in addition this section of the bill would modify the definitions of the prices that manufacturers are currently required to provide to cms the definition of amp an important price point for calculating medicaid drug rebates and for the proposed fuls would become more specified than under current law for example one of the new specifications would direct manufacturers to include cash and volume discounts in the computation of amp the bill would also define weighted amp for the purpose of calculating fuls for multiple source drugs and would establish that dispensing fees for multiple source drugs may be higher than those for single source drugs rebates under current law prescription drug manufacturers that participate in the medicaid program are required to pay rebates to states for drugs provided to medicaid beneficiaries for which fee for service payments are required the rebates are calculated based on formula in statute for single source and innovator multiple source drugs those drugs that had formerly been sold under patent but are now off patent basic rebates are equal to the greater of 151 of the amp or the difference between the reported amp and the best price for each drug the rebate for all other multiple source drugs is equal to 11 of the amp the senate bill makes two major changes to medicaid rebate policy the bill would require manufacturers to begin paying rebates for drugs provided to medicaid beneficiaries who are enrolled in most managed care organizations and would raise the rebate percentages for all drugs the basic rebate for single source and innovator multiple source drugs would be raised to the greater of 181 of the amp or the difference between the reported amp and the best price for each drug the rebate for all other multiple source drugs would be raised to 17 of the amp states would have the option of collecting rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers for those drugs provided to enrollees of mcos or alternatively allowing the mcos to collect the rebates in exchange for reduced mco payment rates authorized generics and physicianadministered drugs authorized generic drugs are generics that are produced by the same manufacturer that produces the brandname version of the drug or by different manufacturer with the authorization of the manufacturer that holds the patent on the brandname version the senate bill would establish requirement that manufacturer reporting the amp and best price for brandname product must also include the prices at which authorized generic versions are sold this provision is estimated to increase rebates that result in savings to the medicaid program since authorized generic drugs are generally less expensive than brandname versions of the same drug in addition the bill would require states to provide utilization and coding information to cms for physicianadministered outpatient drugs this would improve the ability of cms to ensure manufacturers pay rebates for those drugs crs5 longterm care under medicaid medicaid is meanstested program current law regarding eligibility asset transfers and estate recovery are designed to restrict access to medicaids longterm care services to people who are poor or have very high medical or longterm care expenses and who apply their income and assets toward the cost of their care under current law states must impose penalties on individuals applying for medicaid who transfer assets all income and resources of the individual and of the individuals spouse for less than fairmarket value an estimate of the value of an asset if sold at the prevailing price at the time it was actually transferred specifically states must delay medicaid eligibility for individuals receiving care in nursing home and at state option certain people receiving care in communitybased settings who have transferred assets for less than fairmarket value on or after lookback date the lookback date is 36 months prior to application for medicaid for income and most assets disposed of by the individual and 60 months in the case of certain trusts calculating the length of the penalty period the length of the delay in medicaid eligibility is determined by dividing the total cumulative uncompensated value of all assets transferred by the individual or individuals spouse on or after the lookback date by the average monthly cost to private patient of nursing facility in the state or at the option of the state in the community in which the individual is institutionalized at the time of application states use different methods for counting transfers and determining the length of penalty period when more than one transfer is made during limited time period the senate bill would impose certain requirements on how these calculations would be made in an attempt to ensure that such calculations result in longer rather than shorter penalty periods specifically the provisions would 1 require states to count cumulative transfers transfers made during different months as one transfer and 2 prohibit states from rounding down to shorten the penalty period changing noncountable assets to countable assets not all assets that an applicant may have are counted for the purposes of determining an applicants eligibility for medicaid longterm care services or for determining if transfer for less than fairmarket value has been made states generally follow rules established by the supplemental security income ssi program for counting income and assets of applicants provisions in the senate bill would change the status of certain types of assets from noncountable or exempt assets to countable assets to decrease the ways in which individuals might protect assets to meet medicaids meanstesting requirements sooner than they otherwise would under this proposal certain types of assets that are currently exempt including certain types of annuities promissory notes loans mortgages and life estates would be counted for the purposes of medicaid eligibility determinations the bill would also require that states treat the purchase of an annuity as the disposal of an asset for less than fairmarket value unless the state is named as the remainder beneficiary in the first position or in the second position after the community spouse for at least the total amount of medicaid expenditures paid on behalf of the annuitant undue hardship waivers to protect beneficiaries from unintended consequences of asset transfer penalties current law requires states to establish procedures for waiving penalties for persons who according to criteria established crs6 by the secretary show that penalty would impose an undue hardship the ways in which states implement this requirement vary significantly by state whereas few states have formal application processes and specified eligibility criteria to apply to each application most states have informal methods for evaluating each application and formal method for notifying applicants of the availability of undue hardship waivers the senate bill would impose requirements on state practices to formalize and standardize the waiver application process the bill would specify criteria that states would use to determine eligibility for waiver and require states to provide notice to applicants about the availability of undue hardship waivers medicaid estate recovery current law requires states to recover the private assets eg countable and noncountable assets of the estates of deceased beneficiaries who have received certain longterm care services recovery of medicaid payments may be made only after the death of the individuals surviving spouse and only when there is surviving child under age 21 and surviving child who is blind or has disability estate recovery is limited to the amounts paid by medicaid for services received by the individual and is limited only to certain assets that remain in the estate of the beneficiary upon his or her death as result estate recovery is generally applied to beneficiarys home if available and certain other assets within beneficiarys estate the senate provision would make any remaining balance of an annuity subject to recovery by the state after beneficiarys death longterm care insurance partnership program under medicaids longterm care ltc insurance partnership program certain persons who have exhausted or used at least some of the benefits of private longterm care insurance policy may access medicaid without meeting the same meanstesting requirements as other groups of medicaideligible individuals for these individuals means testing requirements are relaxed at 1 the time of application to medicaid and 2 the time of the beneficiarys death when medicaid estate recovery is generally applied under current law these provisions are limited to selected states2 the senate committees provision would allow additional states to implement longterm care partnership programs as long as the state longterm care insurance programs would provide for the disregard of assets in an amount equal to the amount of payments made to or on behalf of the ltc insurance policyholder longterm care partnership programs would be required to meet certain requirements the senates bill would also require ltc insurance partnership programs already in existence to meet most of the specified requirements on or after two years after enactment 2 section 1917 of the social security act amended by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 allows states with an approved state plan amendment as of may 14 1993 to exempt individuals from medicaid estate recovery who apply to medicaid after exhausting their private longterm care insurance benefits by that date five states california connecticut indiana iowa and new york had received cms approval for such exemptions all of these states except iowa have implemented partnership programs crs7 ltc insurance policies sold under the ltc insurance partnership plan would be required to meet certain requirements specified in the national association of insurance commissioners naic longterm care insurance model regulations and longterm care insurance model act in addition the secretary in consultation with specified entities would be required to develop uniform standards for reciprocity minimum reporting requirements suitability incontestability nonforfeiture independent certification for benefits assessment rating requirements and dispute resolution fraud waste and abuse third party liability with certain exceptions medicaid is payer of last resort meaning that states must ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay for medicaid care and services they must also seek reimbursement for medicaid costs from third parties when necessary examples of potentially liable third parties specified in current medicaid law include health insurers group health plans service benefit plans and health maintenance organizations with respect to thirdparty liability the senate bill would clarify the right of states to obtain reimbursement from specific third parties selfinsured plans and pharmacy benefit managers that are legally responsible for payment of claims for health care items or services provided to medicaid beneficiaries the bill would also require each state to have laws that in effect require third parties to provide eligibility and claims payment data for medicaideligible individuals and to cooperate with payment and recovery efforts by medicaid medicaid integrity program under current law states and the federal government acting primarily through cms and the office of inspector general within the department of health and human services hhs share in the responsibility for safeguarding medicaid program integrity the senate bill would establish medicaid integrity program under which entities that meet certain contracting requirements modeled after the medicare integrity program would review the actions of medicaid providers audit claims for payment identify and recover overpayments and provide education on payment integrity and benefit quality assurance issues appropriations for the medicaid integrity program would total 50 million in fy2006 49 million in each of fy2007 and fy2008 74 million in each of fy2009 and fy2010 and 75 million in fy2011 and beyond medicaid chief financial officer and medicaid integrity program oversight board would also be established and an additional 25 million would be appropriated in each of fy2006fy2010 for medicaid activities of the office of inspector general in hhs other provisions other fraud waste and abuse provisions in the senate bill would require states to adhere to compensation standards for medicaid consultants and other contractors issued by the inspector general of hhs encourage states to enact laws modeled after the federal false claims act by decreasing the percentage of medicaid amounts recovered under such laws that must be repaid to the federal government require that any entity receiving annual medicaid payments of 1 million or more educate its employees about state and federal falseclaims laws whistleblower protections and policies and procedures for detecting fraud waste and abuse and prohibit states from billing medicaid twice for the same drugs crs8 state financing and medicaid temporary fmap increases two provisions in the senate bill would affect federal medicaid reimbursement for states first for items and services furnished between august 28 2005 and may 15 2006 states would receive 100 reimbursement for medicaid assistance provided to individuals who resided prior to hurricane katrina in one of the parishes in louisiana or counties in mississippi and alabama specified in the bill costs directly attributable to related administrative activities would also be reimbursed at 100 second the bill would provide that if alaskas calculated federal medical assistance percentage fmap which is based on formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average and vice versa for fy2006 or fy2007 is less than its fy2005 fmap the fy2005 fmap shall apply managed care organization provider tax reform states sometimes raise their share of medicaid program costs by establishing provider taxes that federal law requires to be broad based the statute defines broad based taxes as those that apply to all providers within class of providers two examples of classes of providers are hospitals and physicians one of the classes of providers that current law allows state provider tax to apply to is medicaid managed care organizations the senate bill would modify this class of providers both medicaid and non medicaid to encompass all managed care organizations so that in the future these taxes would be required to be more broad than are allowed under current law states with existing provider specific taxes levied against medicaid managed care organizations would be allowed to keep those taxes disproportionate share hospital allotment for the district of columbia medicaid requires states to make payments to hospitals that treat disproportionate numbers of medicaid beneficiaries and those who cannot pay for their care the senate bill would increase allotments for the district of columbia for making such disproportionate share hospital dsh payments the increased allotments would become available on october 1 2005 changes to medicaid targeted case management benefit targeted case management tcm is an optional benefit under the medicaid state plan that is designed to help medicaid beneficiaries access needed medical social educational and other services states that cover the tcm service do not have to offer the benefit statewide and can limit the service to specific groups of medicaid beneficiaries eg those with chronic mental illness several states extend the tcm services to individuals who may also be receiving certain case management services as part of another state andor federal program eg foster care juvenile justice this proposal would clarify the activities that can be considered tcm service and those activities primarily foster carerelated activities that may not be reimbursed as tcm services the proposal also states that medicaid funding would only be available for tcm services if there are other third parties liable to pay for such services including as reimbursement under medical social educational or other program the proposal would take effect january 1 2006 crs9 inclusion of podiatrists as physicians currently states may provide medicaid coverage for podiatrist services under an optional benefit category of other practitioners in contrast physician services are mandatory medicaid benefit the proposal would treat podiatrists as physicians as is the case under medicare thereby making it mandatory for states to provide medicaid coverage for the medical services of podiatrists demonstration project providing medicaid coverage for institutions for mental disease to stabilize emergency medical conditions current law prohibits medicaid payments for residents of an institution for mental disease imd between the ages of 22 and 64 this proposal would require the secretary of hhs to establish threeyear demonstration project in eligible states to provide medicaid coverage for imd services not publiclyowned or operated for medicaid eligible individuals who are between the ages of 21 and 64 and who require imd services to stabilize an emergency medical condition eligible states include arizona arkansas louisiana maine north dakota wyoming and four additional states to be selected by the secretary the proposal appropriates 30 million for fy2006 for the demonstration which would be available through december 31 2008 the proposal also requires the secretary to submit annual and final reports to congress regarding the progress of the demonstration project limitation on fmap reduction the federal medical assistance percentage fmap which has statutory minimum of 50 and maximum of 83 is the rate at which states are reimbursed for most medicaid service expenditures an enhanced fmap is available for both services and administration under schip subject to the availability of funds from states schip allotment when state fmaps are calculated by hhs for an upcoming fiscal year usually in the preceding november the state and us per capita personal income amounts used in the formula are equal to the average of the three most recent calendar years of data on per capita personal income available from the department of commerces bureau of economic analysis bea when bea undertakes comprehensive revision of its income data reflecting methodological and other changes every few years there may be upward and downward revisions to each of the component parts of personal income eg wages and salaries supplements to wages and salaries such as employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds etc to calculate fmaps for fy2006 hhs used per capita personal income data for 2001 2002 and 2003 that reflected beas latest comprehensive revision under the senate bill fy2006 fmaps would be recomputed so that fy2006 fmap would be less than the greater of 1 states fy2005 fmap minus 05 percentage points 01 in the case of delaware and michigan 03 in the case of kentucky or 2 the fy2006 fmap that would have been determined for state if per capita incomes for 2001 and 2002 that were used to calculate the states fy2005 fmap ie prerevision bea data which are not available for 2003 were used authority to continue providing certain adult day health care services or medical adult day care services adult day care services are generally communitybased daytime programs for adults with disabilities or chronic conditions that provide health social and related support services in setting outside the persons home most states currently offer these services to medicaid beneficiaries through the rehabilitation or clinic benefits of the medicaid state plan crs10 in approximately 10 states or more commonly through home and community based hcbs waiver under section 1915c of the social security act in approximately 44 states through 102 hcbs separate waiver programs3 because states define the state plan service criteria and tailor the hcbs waivers to specific groups of beneficiaries states offer adult day care services under both the state plan and hcbs waivers or under multiple hcbs waivers the way in which state covers medicaid benefit makes difference in terms of who can receive the benefit and what administrative steps may be necessary the medicaid state plan must be available statewide and individuals who need the service are entitled to receive it the hcbs waiver program on the other hand can be limited by the state both in the number of people covered and its statewide availability in addition the hcbs waiver program is designed as an alternative to institutions ie nursing home hospital or intermediate care facility for those with mental retardation and must meet costneutrality provision on average the per person cost of the hcbs waiver can not exceed the perperson cost of comparable institution this provision would prohibit the secretary of hhs from denying federal medicaid funding or withdrawing federal approval for adult day health care services or medical adult day care services under the medicaid state plan as defined by the state and approved by the secretary on or before 1982 demonstration project regarding medicaid coverage of low income hivinfected individuals section 1115 of the social security act gives the secretary of hhs broad authority to modify virtually all aspects of the medicaid program among other projects the secretary has used the section 1115 waiver authority to approve benefitspecific demonstrations that provide targeted services to certain individuals so as to divert them from full medicaid eligibility for example under existing hivaids demonstration waivers the secretary approved programs that provide limited set of medicaid benefits eg case management and pharmacy services to individuals with hivaids who would not otherwise be eligible for medicaid approved section 1115 waivers are deemed to be part of states medicaid or schip state plan for purposes of federal reimbursement project costs associated with waiver programs are subject to that states fmap unlike regular medicaid cms waiver guidance specifies that costs associated with waiver programs must be budget neutral to the federal government over the life of the waiver program the federal and state government negotiate budget neutrality spending cap beyond which the federal government has fiscal responsibility this section of the bill would require the secretary to allow states to seek approval for fiveyear section 1115 demonstration projects that provide full medicaid medical assistance coverage to specified hivinfected individuals for fiscal years 2006 through 2010 only 450000000 in federal funds would be appropriated for such demonstrations from these federal funds the secretary would allocate money to states and territories without regard to existing federal medicaid spending caps with approved hiv section 1115 demonstrations based on the 3 crs analysis of medicaid state chart as published by cch internet research network and the home and communitybased waiver database from the centers for medicare and medicaid services july 2003 crs11 availability of such funds allotment of funds among states and territories with approved demonstrations would be equal to the states enhanced federal medical assistance percentage enhancedfmap for quarterly expenditures associated with medical assistance provided to individuals under the waiver up to the specified cap not later than december 31 2010 the secretary would be required to submit report to congress evaluating the costeffectiveness and the impacts of the demonstrations on the medicare medicaid and supplemental security income programs this provision would be effective on january 1 2006 improving the medicaid and state childrens health insurance programs family opportunity act this provision would create new optional medicaid eligibility group for children with disabilities up to age 18 who meet the severity of disability required under the supplemental security income ssi program but whose family income is above the financial standards for ssi but below 300 of the federal poverty level fpl under current law children with disabilities have generally had to qualify for medicaid using an income standard that is lower than 300 of fpl medicaid coverage for this optional group would be initially effective january 1 2008 and would be fully phased in starting in fy2010 within certain limits states would be permitted to charge monthly premiums based on income and other costsharing fees under this new group finally under this option states must require the parents of medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in any available employersponsored private insurance meeting certain criteria demonstration projects regarding home and communitybased alternative to psychiatric residential treatment facilities for children this proposal would establish fiveyear demonstration project in which up to 10 states could provide broad range of home and communitybased services to children who would otherwise require services in psychiatric residential treatment facility though these types of home and communitybased services are often allowed for other types of disability groups eg children with developmental disabilities under section 1915c waivers of the social security act the waiver requirements prohibit states from developing home and communitybased services as an alternative to psychiatric residential treatment facility the demonstration would test the effectiveness of improving or maintaining the childs functional level and the costeffectiveness of providing these types of services as an alternative to psychiatric residential treatment services these projects must also follow the existing requirements of the section 1915c waiver the demonstration project must be budget neutral and there must be an assurance that an interim and final evaluations will be conducted by an independent third party the secretary will also be required to complete evaluations of the project and report the findings to congress this proposal would authorize total of 218 million for fy2007fy2011 to carry out the demonstration development and support of familytofamily health information this proposal would increase funding under the special projects of regional and national significance program sprans of the maternal and child services block grant title v of the social security act for the development and support of new crs12 familytofamily health information centers these familytofamily health information centers would assist families of children with disabilities to make informed decisions about health care options and available resources the proposal would appropriate total of 12 million for fy2007fy2009 and would authorize an additional 5 million each year for fy2010 and fy2011 the secretary would be required to develop familytofamily health information centers in at least 25 states in fy2007 40 states in fy2008 and all states in fy2009 restoration of medicaid eligibility for certain ssi beneficiaries the provision would extend medicaid eligibility to persons who are under age 21 and who are eligible for ssi effective on the later of 1 the date the application was filed or 2 the date ssi eligibility was granted currently ssi and medicaid eligibility is effective on the first day of the month following the dates specified above this provision would be effective one year after the date of enactment grants to promote innovative outreach and enrollment under medicaid and schip the provision would establish new grant program under schip to finance outreach and enrollment efforts to increase the participation of eligible children in both schip and medicaid currently schip administrative activities which include outreach cannot exceed 10 of total schip expenditures various entities would be eligible to receive these grants such as state or local governments indian tribes schools nonprofit organizations and certain faithbased organizations the proposal specifies several criteria the secretary must use to prioritize grant awards for example entities that target geographic areas where there are large number of eligible but not enrolled children the provision would appropriate 25 million for fy2007 for these grants 10 of the appropriation would be for grants to certain organizations that specifically provide health care services to indian children money follows the person rebalancing demonstration the proposal would authorize the secretary to award demonstration projects to states that provide 90 federal medicaid reimbursement for home and communitybased longterm care services for 12 months for certain individuals relocating from an institution into the community to participate in the demonstration person must be medicaid beneficiary who is residing in hospital nursing facility intermediate care facility for person with mental retardation or an institution for mental disease imd to the extent that imd services are covered in the state and must have resided there for six months up to maximum of two years as specified by the state state demonstrations must operate for at least two years in fiveyear period starting in fy2007 and services for individuals must continue following the demonstration so long as the person remains eligible for these services states must also take steps to eliminate barriers to using medicaid funding to provide longterm care services in the setting of persons choosing and meet maintenance of effort requirements the secretary would be required to provide technical assistance and oversight to state grantees and conduct and report the findings of national evaluation this proposal would appropriate 175 billion from january 1 2009 through fy2013 september 30 2013 to carry out the demonstration crs13 state childrens health insurance program schip under current law each states federal schip annual allotment is available for three years at the end of the threeyear period of availability the unspent funds from the original allotment are reallocated based on methodologies that vary depending on the fiscal year unspent original allotments from fy2003 forward are to be redistributed according to the original balanced budget act of 1997 bba97 methodology that is redistributed funds will go only to those states that spend all of their original allotments by the applicable threeyear deadline with the redistributed amounts determined by the secretary of hhs and made available for one year only the provision would reduce the period of availability of the fy2004 and fy2005 original allotments from three years to two years and would specify rules for the reallocation of unspent fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005 schip original allotments the reallocated fy2003 and fy2004 funds would be available in fy2006 the reallocated fy2005 funds would be available in fy2007 the proposal is projected to eliminate state shortfalls in fy2006 the proposal is projected to nearly eliminate state shortfalls in fy2007 each of the 15 states expected to face shortfall in fy2007 under the proposal would still be able to cover at least 97 of their federal schip demand in addition the provision would limit the types of payments that could be matched at the schip enhanced matching rate for schip expenditures drawn against the fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005 redistributed funds available to shortfall states specifically the enhanced fmap would be available for targeted lowincome children but all other schip expenses such as benefit expenditures for adults other than pregnant women would be matched at the regular fmap the provision would also limit the secretary of hhss section 1115 waiver authority by prohibiting the approval of demonstration projects that allow federal schip funds to be used to provide child health assistance or other health benefits coverage to nonpregnant childless adults finally the proposal would permit the 11 qualifying states to use fy2004 and fy2005 funds under the 20 allowance and would permit all states to use up to 10 of their fy2006 and fy2007 original allotments for expenditures on outreach activities incurred during fy2006 and fy2007 respectively medicare physicians physicians are paid under the fee schedule which assigns relative values to services based on physician work practice expense costs and malpractice costs the relative values are then adjusted for geographic variations in costs these adjusted relative values are converted into dollar payment amounts by conversion factor the conversion factor is updated annually according to complex formula specified in the law cms has announced that the update for 2006 will be negative 44 the bill would override the formula by setting minimum update for 2006 at positive 1 crs14 medicare valuebased purchasing programs the medicare statute would be amended to establish valuebased purchasing systems for each of the different medicare providers there would be separate value based purchasing programs for hospitals physicians and other practitioners medicare managed health care plans esrd providers and facilities home health agencies and skilled nursing facilities medicare payments to providers currently are not based on any measures of quality the valuebased purchasing programs sometimes referred to as payforperformance programs would introduce variations in provider payments reflecting differences in measured quality although the specifics of each program differ in the details they all share some general principles the valuebased purchasing programs would begin collecting data on quality measures in the initial year of establishment with incentive payments disbursed in subsequent years data from the initial year would be used to inform providers what their payments would have been for the year had the valuebased purchasing program already been in place each valuebased purchasing program would create an incentive pool funded by withholding up to 2 of total payments to that category of provider the percentage of funds that goes towards the incentive pool would not decrease over time and all funds collected for the incentive pool must be paid to providers as incentive payments participation in the valuebased purchasing program would be voluntary but providers would be required to report quality data in order to be eligible for incentive payments incentive payments would be paid to providers who meet certain thresholds for quality measurement these thresholds would be based on either relative or absolute standards the quality measures would be specific to each category of providers and would be revised over time but the measures would be required to be evidencebased easy to collect and report address process structure outcomes beneficiary experience efficiency over and underuse of health care and to address disparities in health care provided and health outcomes between majority and minority groups in the initial year the measures would include at least one measure of health information technology infrastructure because all the funds collected under the valuebased purchasing programs would be paid out as incentive payments the total payments over time would not change as result of these provisions but the timing of the incentive payments would be delayed year compared to payments made in the absence of the valuebased purchasing programs crs15 medicare advantage under medicare advantage ma part c of the medicare program private health plans agree to provide medicare covered benefits to beneficiaries who enroll in their plans ma plans are paid per capita monthly fee for providing all required part and part b services to each plan enrollee regardless of the amount of services used an ma plans per capita payment is adjusted to reflect the higher health care use of sicker enrollees though payments to plans are risk adjusted based on the demographics and health history of each enrollee the risk adjustment method is imperfect and cannot account for all of the variation in health care use phaseout of risk adjustment budget neutrality medicare payments to private plans under the medicare advantage program are risk adjusted to control for the variation in the cost of providing health care among beneficiaries congress urged the secretary of hhs to implement risk adjustment without reducing overall payments to plans the secretary applied budget neutrality adjustment to the risk adjusted rates to keep them from being reduced overall this provision directs the secretary to 1 change the way the ma benchmarks are calculated to in part exclude budget neutrality and 2 phaseout the budget neutral implementation of risk adjustment overall these changes will lower payments to plans budget neutrality is to be completely phasedout by 2011 elimination of stabilization fund the secretary is to establish an ma regional plan stabilization fund to provide incentives for plan entry in each region and plan retention in certain ma regions with below average ma penetration initially 10 billion is to be available for expenditures from the fund beginning on january 1 2007 and ending on december 31 2013 additional funds are to be available in an amount equal to 125 of average per capita monthly savings from regional plans that bid below the benchmark the section which created this fund under the medicare modernization act is repealed other medicare provisions the senate provisions would make several other changes to the medicare program as described below medicare dependent hospitals under current law special reimbursement for facilities with medicare dependent hospital mdh status will lapse in 2006 certain rural hospitals with 100 beds or less that have at least 60 of their discharges or inpatient days attributable to medicare patients in two of the last three years are classified as mdh hospitals this provision would extend their status through discharges occurring before october 1 2011 also mdhs could elect payment based on their adjusted fy2002 hospitalspecific costs beginning in fy2005 if that would result in higher medicare payments skilled nursing facility bad debt beginning october 1 2005 the amount of bad debts otherwise treated as allowed costs which are attributable to deductible crs16 and coinsurance amounts would be reduced by 30 for services furnished in skilled nursing facilities snf inpatient rehabilitation facilities cms requires that facility treat certain proportion of patients with specified medical conditions in order to qualify as an inpatient rehabilitation facility irf and receive higher medicare payments the 75 rule established in regulation requires irfs to meet compliance threshold of 60 from july 1 2005 and before july 1 2006 65 from july 1 2006 and before july 1 2007 and 75 thereafter this legislation would reduce the current required proportion or threshold to 50 from july 1 2005 through june 30 2007 physician self referrals the prohibition on medicare and medicaid referrals to physicianowned limited service hospitals or specialty hospitals would be effective on or after december 8 2003 certain exceptions would be made to the definition of such hospitals to include those hospitals where 1 the percent investment by physician investors is greater than the percent on june 8 2005 2 the percent investment by any physician investor is greater than the percent on june 8 2005 3 the number of operating rooms is greater than the number on june 8 2005 and 4 the number of beds is greater than the number on june 8 2005 hold harmless provision for small rural and sole community hospitals under current law most services provided by hospital outpatient departments are paid under prospective payment system which began august 2000 rural hospitals with more than 100 beds and sole community hospitals located in rural areas are to be held harmless through january 2006 that is they are to be paid less under the prospective system than they would have been paid under prior law this legislation would extend the hold harmless provisions through january 1 2007 composite rate for dialysis services medicare payments for dialysis services furnished either at facility or in patients home are based on basic case mix adjusted prospective payment system the system has two components 1 the composite rate which does not have to be updated annually and 2 drug addon adjustment which the secretary of hhs is required to update annually beginning in 2006 the legislation would increase the composite rate by 16 for services beginning january 1 2006 therapy caps the balanced budget act of 1997 established annual per beneficiary payment limits on all outpatient therapy services provided by nonhospital providers beginning in 1999 subsequent legislation suspended application of the limits beginning in 2000 moratorium has been in place since then except for brief period in 2003 under current law the caps are again slated to go into effect in 2006 the bill would extend the moratorium for an additional year through 2006 durable medical equipment rentals this provision would eliminate the semiannual maintenance payment currently allowed for capped rental equipment and pay only for repairs when needed the secretary would determine the amount of payments for maintenance and service which would only be made if deemed crs17 reasonable and necessary with the exception of powerdriven wheelchairs the title to durable medical equipment in the capped rental category would be transferred by the supplier to the medicare beneficiary after 13month rental period the current option for beneficiaries to purchase power wheelchairs when initially furnished would be retained and the amount of any necessary maintenance and servicing payments would be established by the secretary rural program of allinclusive care for the elderly pace provider grant program the program for allinclusive care for the elderly pace makes available all services covered under medicare and medicaid without amount duration or scope limitations and without application of any deductibles copayments or other cost sharing under the program certain lowincome individuals age 55 and older who would otherwise require nursing home care receive all health medical and social services they need an interdisciplinary team of physicians nurses physical therapists social workers and other professionals develop and monitor care plans for enrollees monthly capitated payments are made to providers from both the medicare and medicaid programs as specified in medicare and medicaid statutes the amount of these payments from both programs must be less than what would have otherwise been paid for comparable frail population not enrolled in pace program payments are also adjusted to account for the comparative frailty of pace enrollees pace providers assume the risk for expenditures that exceed the revenue from the capitation payments the balanced budget act of 1997 made pace permanent benefit category under medicare and state plan optional benefit under medicaid the provision would create site development grants and provide technical assistance to establish pace providers in rural areas it would also create fund for rural pace providers to provide partial reimbursement for incurred expenditures above ceratin level the proposal would require the secretary of hhs to establish process and criteria for awarding up to 75 million in site development grants in up to 12 qualified pace providers that have been approved to serve geographic service area that is in whole or in part in rural area with each grant award not to exceed 750000 waiver of part b late enrollment penalty generally individuals who delay enrollment in medicare part b past their initial period of eligibility are subject to penalty equal to 10 of the premium amount for each 12 months of delay this provision would allow certain individuals to delay enrollment without penalty specifically those individuals who volunteered outside of the united states through 12month or longer program sponsored by taxexempt organization defined by the internal revenue code upon return to the united states they would have special enrollment period federally qualified health centers this provision would allow federally qualified health centers fqhc to provide diabetes outpatient self management training services and medical nutrition therapy services provided by registered dietician or nutritional professional it would modify the definition of fqhc services so that only the primary preventative required services would be retained services would include those furnished to an outpatient of an fqhc that are crs18 provided by health care professional under contract with the center and payments would be made directly to the fqhc delay of medicare payments medicare parts and b payments for services made by fiscal intermediaries and carriers would be delayed for seven business days at the end of fy2006 these payments would be made at the beginning of fy2007 thereby shifting payments from one fiscal year to the next coverage of ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms the provision would authorize medicare coverage of ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms for individuals who 1 received referrals for such screenings as result of an initial preventive physical exam performed for new medicare enrollees 2 had not previously had such test covered by medicare and 3 had family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm or manifested risk factors included in beneficiary category not related to age identified by the united states preventive services task force the part b deductible would not apply to these services improving patient access to and utilization of colorectal cancer screening services the provision would establish national minimum payment amounts for specified facility and nonfacility service codes that reflect 5 increase above current amounts the provision would also authorize medicare coverage for an office visit or consultation prior to screening colonoscopy or in connection with beneficiarys decision to obtain such screening the part b deductible would not apply for colorectal cancer screening tests coverage of marriage and family therapist services and mental health counselor services under medicare part b the provision would authorize coverage of marriage and family therapist services and mental health counselor services for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness that the therapist or counselor is legally authorized to perform in the state house bill under the budget resolution instructions the house energy and commerce committee was required to obtain 2 million in savings in fy2006 and 14734 billion over the fiveyear budget period fy2006fy2010 the total house energy and commerce proposal which includes changes in areas outside of health is estimated to reduce federal outlays by 171 billion over the fiveyear budget window4 proposed changes to the medicaid program would result in an 119 billion reduction in spending over the fiveyear period katrina health care and energy relief would increase spending by 36 billion additional savings would result from digital television transition this report summarizes provisions dealing 4 congressional budget office cost estimate reconciliation recommendations of the house committee on energy and commerce as approved by the house committee on energy and commerce on october 28 2005 crs19 only with medicaid and schip5 these provisions were incorporated into the larger bill reported by the house budget committee on november 3 2005 the deficit reduction act of 2005 under house rule an amended committee bill was introduced the bill passed the house on november 18 2005 subtitle of title iii in the house bill reduces federal medicaid spending by 119 billion over the fy2006fy2010 five year budget period changes in outpatient prescription drug payments would result in 21 billion in savings over the period changes in medicaid costsharing and benefits would result in 65 billion in savings over the period changes in asset transfer rules would reduce medicaid spending by an additional 25 billion over the five year period changes in other provisions eg changes in the treatment of state taxes on health care providers and changes aimed at reducing medicaid overpayment when medicaid recipient also has private insurance would reduce medicaid spending by an additional 18 billion over the five year period benefit expansions would add 1 billion in medicaid spending these expansions would include changes in benefits for individuals with longterm care needs in the community and the establishment of health opportunity account demonstration programs medicaidfunded savings accounts that beneficiaries would use to pay for certain health care services under subtitle b federal government spending for medicaid and schip would be temporarily increased for medicaideligible individuals who lived or currently live in parts of alabama louisiana and mississippi affected by hurricane katrina the overall effect of this subtitles changes would result in an increase in spending over the fy2006 fy2010 period of 25 billion in total the two health subtitles in the house energy and commerce proposal is estimated by cbo to result in net medicaid and schip savings of 93 billion over the five year budget period medicaid medicaid outpatient prescription drugs the medicaid outpatient prescription drug provisions in the house bill would alter the federal upper limits that apply to medicaid outpatient prescription drugs provide for minimum dispensing fee for multiple source drugs and establish special reporting requirements for the prices of certain authorized generic drugs and certain outpatient drugs administered in physicians offices in addition the bill would allow certain childrens hospitals access to discounted drug prices and places an additional requirement on state prior authorization programs that seeks to limit access to atypical antipsychotic or antidepressant single source drugs federal upper limits the house bill would also replace the current ful requirement so that state payments for single source drugs would qualify for federal reimbursement up to 106 of the ramp defined as the average price paid to 5 specifically this report does not discuss provisions that alter the public health services act phsa these provisions are in sections 3202 3203 and 3204 in addition the report does not discuss subtitle c katrina and rita energy relief and subtitle d digital television transition of title iii crs20 manufacturer by wholesalers as reported to cms by the manufacturers fuls for multiple source drugs would be equal to 120 of the volume weighted average ramp for all drug products in the same multiple source drug billing and payment code the provision would provide the secretary with the authority to enter into contracts and engage the services of vendors to determine ramp and would allow the secretary to implement an alternative ful methodology based on survey prices the implementation of the changes to the ful would be delayed however if gao were to find that the average prices paid by pharmacies are above the new reimbursable amounts in addition this section of the bill would allow state medicaid programs to have access to manufacturers reported prices and would establish minimum dispensing fees of 8 for pharmacies dispensing multiplesource drugs authorized generics and physicianadministered drugs the house bill would establish that when manufacturer reports amp and best price for their brand name product they would include the prices of all drugs sold under the new drug application which would include authorized generic versions this provision is estimated to increase rebates resulting in savings to the medicaid program since authorized generic drugs are generally less expensive than brand name versions of the same drug in addition the provision would require states to provide utilization and coding information to cms for all single source physicianadministered outpatient drugs and for the 20 most frequently provided physician administered multiple source drugs this would improve the ability of cms to ensure manufacturers pay rebates for those drugs childrens hospitals and access to discounted drug products the house bill includes provision allowing childrens hospitals access to the discounted outpatient prescription drugs prices negotiated under section 340b of the public health service act section 340b allows certain health care providers including many community health centers and disproportionate share hospitals access to prescription drug prices that are similar to the prices paid by medicaid agencies after being reduced by manufacturer rebates prior authorization for mental health drugs the bill would limit the ability of states to place atypical antipsychotic or antidepressant single source drugs on prior authorization lists imposing other restrictions unless drug use review board has determined that doing so is not likely to harm patients or increase overall medical costs it also would require states to pay for 30 day supply of such drugs in cases where request for authorization is not responded to within 24 hours after the prescription is transmitted reform of asset transfer rules lengthening lookback period for all disposals to five years current law requires states to impose penalties on individuals who transfer assets all income and resources of the individual and of the individuals spouse for less than fair market value an estimate of the value of an asset if sold at the prevailing price at the time it was actually transferred specifically the rules require states to delay medicaid eligibility for certain medicaid longterm care services for individuals crs21 applying for care in nursing home and at state option for certain people receiving care in communitybased settings who have transferred assets for less than fair market value on or after lookback date the lookback date is 36 months prior to application for medicaid for income and most assets disposed of by the individual and 60 months in the case of certain trusts the penalty or period of ineligibility begins with the first month during which the assets were transferred the house bill would lengthen the lookback date to five years or 60 months for all income and assets disposed of by the individual it would also change the start date of the ineligibility period for all transfers to the first day of month during or before which assets have been transferred for less than fair market value or the date on which the individual is eligible for medical assistance under the state plan and would be receiving certain longterm care services if it where not for the penalty whichever is later availability and provisions concerning hardship waiversto protect beneficiaries from unintended consequences of the asset transfer penalties current law requires states to establish procedures for not imposing penalties on persons who according to criteria established by the secretary of dhhs can show that penalty would impose an undue hardship the house bill would add to existing law criteria for approving or disapproving applications for undue hardship waivers it would also require states to provide applicants with notice about the availability of undue hardship waivers to review applications under timely process and to establish an appeal process for beneficiaries who receive an adverse determination the bill would also permit facilities to apply for waivers on behalf of and with the consent of institutionalized individuals in addition if the application for undue hardship of nursing facility residents meets criteria specified by the secretary the state would have the option of providing payments for nursing facility services to hold the bed for these individuals at facility while an application is pending such payments could not be made for longer than 30 days disclosure and treatment of annuities and of large transactions current law provides that the term trust for purposes of asset transfers and the lookback period includes annuities only to the extent that the secretary of dhhs defines them as such cms guidance transmittal letter 64 asks states to determine the ultimate purpose of an annuity in order to distinguish those that are validly purchased as part of retirement plan from those that abusively shelter assets to be deemed valid in this respect the life of the annuity must coincide with the average number of years of life expectancy for the individual according to tables in the transmittal if the individual is not reasonably expected to live longer than the guarantee period of the annuity the individual will not receive fair market value for the annuity based on the projected return in this case the annuity is not actuarially sound and transfer of assets for less than fair market value has taken place the house bill would require applicants and their community spouses to report their ownership interest in annuities or similar financial instruments it would also require disclosure of all transfers greater than 100000 further it would also require that all transactions 5000 or more within single year would be treated as single transaction subject to certain requirements the bill would also require the state to be made the remainder beneficiary under such annuities or similar financial instruments the crs22 bill would also give the secretary authority to provide guidance to states on categories of arms length transactions such as the purchase of commercial annuity that could be generally treated as an asset transfer for fair market value application of incomefirst rule in applying community spouses income before assets in providing support of community spouse current law includes provisions intended to prevent impoverishment of spouse whose husband or wife seeks medicaid coverage for longterm care services allowing the community spouse to retain higher amounts of income and assets on top of noncountable assets such as house car etc than allowed under general medicaid rules the law allows community spouses with more limited income to retain at least state specified amount set within federal guidelines if the community spouses monthly income amount is less than this amount the institutionalized spouse may choose to transfer an amount of his or her income or assets to make up for the shortfall ie the difference between the community spouses monthly income and the state specified minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance the house bill would require that any transfer or allocation made from an institutionalized spouse to meet the need of community spouse for community spouses monthly income allowance be first made from income of the institutionalized spouse only when sufficient income is not available could resources of the institutionalized spouse be transferred or allocated disqualification for longterm care assistance for individuals with substantial home equity under current law states set asset standards within federal parameters that applicants must meet to qualify for coverage these standards specify limit on the amount of countable assets person may have to qualify as well as define which assets are not counted in general countable assets cannot exceed 2000 for an individual states generally follow ssi rules for computing both countable and noncountable assets current medicaid and ssi asset counting practices exclude the entire value of an applicants home the house bill would exclude from medicaid eligibility for nursing facility or other longterm care services those individuals with an equity interest in their home of greater than 750000 the secretary of dhhs would establish process to waive application of this provision for demonstrated cases of hardship this amount would be increased beginning in 2011 from year to year based on the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers rounded to the nearest 1000 individuals whose spouse child under age 21 or child who is blind or disabled resides in the individuals home would not be excluded from eligibility enforceability of continuing care retirement communities and life care community admission contracts the house bill would allow state licensed registered certified or equivalent continuing care retirement communities ccrc or life care community to require in their admissions contracts that residents spend their resources subject to medicaids rules concerning the resources and income allowances for community spouses declared for the purposes of admission on their care before they apply for medicaid it would also allow certain entrance fees for ccrcs or life care communities to be considered by states to be countable resources for purposes of the medicaid eligibility determination crs23 flexibility in cost sharing and benefits many of the provisions in this chapter allow for changes to existing costsharing and benefit requirements through medicaid state plan amendments rather than the special waiver process that is required under current law state option for alternative medicaid premiums and costsharing under current law premiums are generally prohibited under medicaid except under specific circumstances for example for pregnant women and infants with family income that exceeds 150 of the federal poverty level fpl states are allowed to implement nominal premiums or enrollment fees between 1 and 19 per month depending on family income as defined in regulations other restrictions apply to servicerelated costsharing for example all servicerelated costsharing is prohibited for children under 18 servicerelated costsharing is also prohibited for pregnant women for any pregnancyrelated services or for services to treat other medical conditions that complicate pregnancy other groups and services are also exempt from servicerelated costsharing eg emergency care family planning services services delivered to persons receiving medicaid hospice care for most other beneficiaries and services nominal servicerelated costsharing between 050 and 3 depending on the cost of the service provided may be imposed the house bill would allow states to impose premiums and costsharing for any group of individuals for any type of service subject to several specific restrictions certain groups would be exempted from paying premiums eg children under 18 in mandatory coverage groups inpatients in certain medical institutions who must spend nearly all their income on medical care before medicaid pays for services also costsharing would be prohibited for specified services eg preventive care for all children under 18 services provided to hospice patients emergency care the total amount of annual costsharing for all individuals in family would be capped at 5 of family income for all families regardless of income states would be allowed to impose higher costsharing amounts than is allowed under current law for individuals with family income over 100 of the fpl states may exempt additional classes of individuals or services from premiums and servicerelated costsharing beginning in 2006 for individuals in families with incomes below 100 fpl the secretary of hhs would be required to increase nominal costsharing amounts over time based on the annual percentage increase in the medical care component of the consumer price index for all urban consumers the house bill would also allow states to condition the provision of medical assistance on the payment of premiums and to terminate eligibility for medicaid when the failure to pay premium continues for at least 60 days states may apply this provision to some or all groups and may waive premium payments when they would be an undue hardship in addition states could permit medicaid providers to require medicaid beneficiary to pay authorized costsharing as condition of receiving services providers would also be allowed to reduce or waive costsharing amounts gao would be required to conduct study of the impact of premiums and cost sharing under medicaid on access to and utilization of services with report of findings due to congress later than january 1 2008 all provisions would be crs24 effective for costsharing imposed on items and services furnished on or after january 1 2006 special rules for costsharing for prescribed drugs under current law costsharing for outpatient prescription drugs follows the rules described above for all costsharing amounts many states require costsharing amounts that are slightly lower for generic drugs or for drugs listed on preferred drug list the house bill would allow states to impose costsharing amounts that exceed the proposed state option limits described above for certain stateidentified non preferred drugs if specific conditions are met under this option states may impose higher costsharing for nonpreferred drugs within class waive or reduce cost sharing otherwise applicable for preferred drugs within such class and must not apply such costsharing for preferred drugs to persons exempt from servicerelated costsharing costsharing for nonpreferred drugs would be based on multiples of the nominal amounts based on family income for persons generally exempt from costsharing the costsharing for nonpreferred drugs may be applied such cost sharing may not exceed nominal amounts and aggregate caps on costsharing would still apply when prescribing physician determines that the preferred drug would not be effective or would have adverse health effects or both the state may impose the cost sharing amount for preferred drugs on the prescribed nonpreferred product states may exclude specified drugs or classes of drugs from these special cost sharing rules finally states would be prohibited from implementing these special costsharing rules for outpatient prescription drugs unless the state has instituted system for prior authorization and related appeals processes all provisions would be effective for costsharing imposed on items and services furnished on or after october 1 2006 emergency room copayments for nonemergency care under current law waivers may be used to allow states to impose up to twice the otherwise applicable nominal costsharing amounts for nonemergency services provided in hospital emergency room er states may only impose these higher amounts if they have established that medicaid beneficiaries have available and accessible alternative sources of nonemergency outpatient services the house bill would allow states through state plan amendments rather than waivers to impose increased costsharing on statespecified groups for non emergency services provided in an er when certain conditions are met first alternative nonemergency providers must be available and accessible to the person seeking care second after initial screening but before the nonemergency care is provided at the er the beneficiary must be told 1 the hospital can require higher copayments 2 the name and location of an alternative nonemergency provider and that this provider uses lower copayments and 3 the hospital can provide referral when these conditions are met states could apply or waive costsharing for services delivered by the alternate provider crs25 for persons with income below 100 fpl costsharing for nonemergency services in an er could not exceed twice the nominal amounts individuals exempt from premiums or servicerelated costsharing may be subject to nominal copayments for nonemergency services in an er only when costsharing is imposed for care in hospital outpatient departments or by other alternative providers in the area served by the hospital er aggregate caps on costsharing would still apply finally the house bill would require the secretary to provide for payments to states for the establishment of alternate nonemergency providers or networks of such providers it also authorizes and appropriates 100 million for paying such providers for the fouryear period beginning with 2006 the secretary would be required to give preference to states that establish or provide for alternate non emergency services providers or networks that serve rural or underserved areas where beneficiaries may have limited access to primary care providers or in partnership with local community hospitals use of benchmark benefit packages medicaid benefits may differ for what are called categorically needy cn versus medically needy mn groups in general cn groups include families with children the elderly certain persons with disabilities and certain other pregnant women and children who meet applicable financial standards these financial criteria are tied to rules under two federal cash assistance programs the former afdc program for poor families with children or the ssi program for the poor elderly and persons with disabilities some groups of the elderly pregnant women and children must meet financial standards tied to specified percentages of the fpl instead mn groups include the same types of individuals but different typically higher financial standards apply medical expenses if any may be subtracted from income in determining financial eligibility for the mn for nearly all cn groups medical expenses are not considered in determining medicaid eligibility examples of benefits that are mandatory for cn groups include inpatient and outpatient hospital services services provided by federally qualified health centers fqhc physician services and nursing facility care for persons age 21 and over examples of optional benefits for cn groups that are offered by many states include physiciandirected clinic services routine dental care other licensed practitioner services eg optometrists podiatrists psychologists physical therapy inpatient psychiatric care for the elderly and persons under age 21 and prescribed drugs all states in general states may offer more restrictive benefit package to the mn but at minimum must offer 1 prenatal and delivery services 2 ambulatory services for persons under 18 and those entitled to institutional services and 3 home health services for those entitled to nursing facility care within state services available to all cn groups must be equal in amount duration and scope likewise services available to all mn groups must be equal in amount duration and scope the house bill would give states the option to provide medicaid to state specified groups of beneficiaries through enrollment in benchmark and benchmark equivalent coverage described below states could implement this option through medicaid state plan amendment rather than waiver as would be required under current law states could require fullbenefit eligible individuals to enroll in such coverage fullbenefit eligible would be person eligible for all services covered crs26 for the cn or under any other category of eligibility for full services as defined by the secretary some individuals would be excluded from the definition of full benefit eligible eg the mn persons who spenddown their income for medical care to meet the financial requirements for medicaid coverage several other specific groups would also be exempted from this option eg mandatory pregnant women and children dual eligibles hospice patients persons with special medical needs individuals who qualify for medicaid longterm care services states could only apply this option to eligibility categories established before the date of enactment of this provision the benchmark and benchmark equivalent packages would be nearly identical to those offered under the state childrens health insurance program schip with some additions beyond the basic elements of schip under this option benchmark coverage would include 1 the standard blue crossblue shield preferred provider option plan under the federal employees health benefits program fehbp 2 the health coverage offered and generally available to state employees or 3 the health coverage offered by health maintenance organization hmo with the largest commercial nonmedicaid enrollment benchmarkequivalent coverage would be defined as package of benefits that has the same actuarial value as one of the benchmark benefit packages such coverage would include each of the benefits in the basic benefits category including 1 inpatient and outpatient hospital services 2 physicians surgical and medical services 3 lab and xray services 4 well baby and wellchild care including ageappropriate immunizations and 5 other appropriate preventive services designated by the secretary such coverage must also include at least 75 of the actuarial value of coverage under the benchmark plan for each of the benefits in the additional service category including 1 prescription drugs 2 mental health services 3 vision services and 4 hearing services both benchmark and benchmark equivalent coverage would also include qualifying child benchmark dental coverage qualifying child would be person under 18 with family income below 133 of the fpl benchmark dental coverage would be equivalent to or better than the dental plan that covers the greatest number of individuals in the state who are not eligible for medicaid finally states could only enroll eligible beneficiaries in benchmark and benchmarkequivalent coverage if such persons have access to services provided by rural health clinics rhc and fqhcs and the medicaid prospective payment system for both types of providers remains in effect state option to establish nonemergency medical transportation program federal regulations require states to ensure necessary transportation for recipients to and from providers and to describe the methods that they will use to meet this requirement in their medicaid state plan states may choose whether to provide transportation as an optional medicaid service or claim it as an administrative expense if state chooses to provide transportation as an optional medicaid service costs are reimbursed by the federal government using the federal medical assistance percentage fmap which varies by state and has statutory floor of 50 and ceiling of 83 under this option states must meet number of federal requirements crs27 that apply to all medicaid services eg enrollees must have freedom to choose among qualified providers unless they have an approved waiver costs are only allowable for fmap reimbursement if the transportation is furnished by provider to whom direct payment can be made other arrangements eg payment to broker who manages and pays transportation providers must be claimed as an administrative expense if state chooses to claim transportation as an administrative expense costs are reimbursed by the federal government at rate of 50 which is lower than the fmap in many states but there are fewer federal requirements that must be met under the house bill state would have the option to establish non emergency medical transportation brokerage program in order to more cost effectively provide transportation for medicaid enrollees who need access to medical care or services and have other means of transportation under the program the state would not be required to provide comparable services for all medicaid enrollees or freedom to choose among providers the program could include wheelchair van taxi stretcher car bus passes and tickets and other transportation methods deemed appropriate by the secretary and could be conducted under contract with broker who 1 is selected through competitive bidding process 2 meets oversight requirements 3 is subject to regular auditing by the state and 4 complies with requirements related to prohibitions on referrals and conflict of interest established by the secretary also the hhs inspector general would be required to submit report to congress examining this new program later than january 1 2007 exempting women covered under breast or cervical cancer program under current law states may offer medicaid to certain uninsured women who are under age 65 and are in need of treatment for breast or cervical cancer based on screening services provided under an early detection program run by the cdc this group has access to the same medicaid services offered to the cn in given state and are subject to medicaids nominal cost sharing rules under the house bill none of the proposed costsharing or benefit provisions described above would apply to women who qualify for medicaid under the breast and cervical cancer eligibility group benefit expansions expanded access to home and communitybased services for the elderly and disabled under current law states may provide broad range of home and communitybased services under medicaid waiver authorized by section 1915c of the social security act these services which may include for example respite adult day care and personal care may be provided to medicaid beneficiaries who would otherwise need the level of care provided in nursing facility intermediate care facility for persons with mental retardation icfmr or hospital approval of medicaid waiver is contingent on state documenting the waivers costneutrality the average per person cost under the waiver cannot exceed the average per person cost of services in an institution this proposal would allow states to cover these types of home and community based services under the medicaid state plan without requiring the state to seek crs28 waiver or document the waivers costneutrality to cover this option states existing waiver must have expired similar to rules governing the current waiver program states would be able to 1 define which services will be covered room and board may not be paid for 2 offer the waiver on lessthanstatewide basis 3 limit the number of individuals who are eligible for services and 4 establish waiting list for services this section would be effective for home and communitybased services furnished on or after october 1 2006 optional choice of selfdirected personal assistance services cash and counseling traditionally medicaid personal care and other related benefits have been provided to beneficiaries through local public or private agency however in the last decade medicaid programs have been increasing the discretion that medicaid beneficiaries have over key elements of the service eg what time service provider comes to the home who provides the service this proposal would allow state to establish and operate program in which the medicaid beneficiary could hire supervise and manage the individuals providing his or her services including personal care and related services or other home and communitybased services the beneficiary would have significant discretion within an approved service plan and budget as part of this option state may limit the population eligible to receive these types of services and may limit the number of persons served expansion of state longterm care partnership program u n d r medicaids longterm care ltc insurance partnership program certain persons who have exhausted or used at least some of the benefits of private longterm care insurance policy may access medicaid without meeting the same meanstesting requirements as other groups of medicaid eligibles for these individuals means testing requirements are relaxed at 1 the time of application to medicaid allowed with secretarys approval without changes to current law and 2 the time of the beneficiarys death when medicaid estate recovery is generally applied current law allows states with an approved state plan amendment as of may 14 1993 to exempt individuals from medicaid estate recovery who apply to medicaid after exhausting their private longterm care insurance benefits by that date five states california connecticut indiana iowa and new york had received cms approval except for iowa all of these states have implemented partnership programs this provision would allow additional groups of individuals in states with state plan amendments approved after may 14 1993 to be exempt from estate recovery requirements if the amendment provides for qualified state longterm care insurance partnership program new partnership programs would disregard any assets or resources of medicaid applicant and beneficiary in the amount equal to the amount of insurance benefit paid to or on behalf of an individual who is beneficiary under longterm care policy policies sold under new ltc partnership programs would be taxqualified cover an insured who was resident of such state when coverage first became effective under the policy require that policyholders be offered policy with some level of inflation protection and impose certain requirements on states concerning seller training it would also require insurers to report information as specified by the secretary concerning benefit payments policy terminations among others existing partnership programs programs in california connecticut indiana iowa and new york would not be subject to these requirements the secretary crs29 would also be subject to certain requirements concerning data reporting and the development of recommendations for certain uniform standards under the house bill the secretary would be permitted to develop portability standards for reciprocal recognition of partnership policies among certain states health opportunity accounts the bill would require the secretary to establish demonstration programs within medicaid for health opportunity accounts hoa effective january 1 2006 more than ten state programs could be established the first five years though afterwards other programs would be allowed if the earlier ones were not unsuccessful among other things state programs would have to make patients aware of the high cost of medical care provide incentives for them to seek preventive care and reduce inappropriate uses of health care eligibility for hoas would be determined by the state though individuals who are disabled pregnant or receiving terminal care or longterm care would be among those who could not participate participants would have both an hoa and coverage for medical items and services that after an annual deductible is met were available under the existing medicaid state plan and waiver authorities the deductible would have to be at least 100 but more than 110 of the annual state contributions to the hoa both the deductible and the maximum for outofpocket costsharing could vary among families the deductible need not apply to preventive care hoas would be used to pay health care expenses specified by the state payments could be restricted to licensed or otherwise authorized providers as well as to items and services that are medically appropriate or necessary withdrawals would be made by electronic transfer once account holders were longer eligible for medicaid they could continue to make withdrawals under these conditions though accounts could then also be used to pay for health insurance or at state option for job training or education participants generally would be able to obtain services from medicaid providers or managed care organizations at the same payment rates that would be applicable if the coverage deductible did not apply or from any provider for payment rates not exceeding 125 of those rates hoa contributions could be made by the state or by other persons or entities including charitable organizations including federal shares state contributions generally could not exceed 2500 for each adult and 1000 for each child other medicaid provisions managed care organization provider tax reform the house bill would like the senate bill modify the class of providers that states can tax under the provider tax rules the current law class of medicaid managed care providers would be changed to encompass all managed care organizations so that in the future these taxes would be required to be more broad than are allowed under current law states with existing provider specific taxes levied against medicaid managed care organizations would be allowed to keep those taxes in 2008 and would have to reduce the tax by half in 2009 after that all states would be subject to the new rule crs30 third party liability with certain exceptions medicaid is payer of last resort meaning that states must ascertain the legally liability of third parties to pay for medicaid care and services they must also seek reimbursement for medicaid costs from third parties when necessary examples of potentially liable third parties specified in current medicaid law include health insurers group health plans service benefit plans and health maintenance organizations with respect to third party liability the house proposal would clarify the right of states to obtain reimbursement from specific third parties selfinsured plans and pharmacy benefit managers that are legally responsible for payment of claims for health care items or services provided to medicaid beneficiaries the proposal would also require each state to have laws in effect requiring third parties to provide eligibility and claims payment data for medicaideligible individuals and to cooperate with payment and recovery efforts by medicaid reforms of targeted case management benefit targeted case management tcm is an optional benefit under the medicaid state plan that is designed to help medicaid beneficiaries access needed medical social educational and other services states that cover the tcm service do not have to offer the benefit statewide and can limit the service to specific groups of medicaid beneficiaries eg those with chronic mental illness several states extend the tcm services to individuals who may also be receiving certain case management services as part of another state andor federal program eg foster care juvenile justice this proposal would clarify the activities that can be considered tcm service and those activities primarily foster carerelated activities that may not be reimbursed as tcm services the proposal also states that medicaid funding would only be available for tcm services if there are other third parties liable to pay for such services including as reimbursement under medical social educational or other program the proposal would take effect january 1 2006 increase in payments to insular areas in the 50 states and the district of columbia medicaid is an individual entitlement there are limits on the federal payments for medicaid as long as the state is able to contribute its share of the matching funds in contrast medicaid programs in the territories are subject to spending caps these spending caps were set in fy1998 and adjusted for inflation in subsequent years for each of fiscal years 2006 and 2007 the provision would increase the total annual cap on federal funding for the medicaid programs in each of puerto rico the virgin islands guam the northern marianas and american samoa for puerto rico the total annual medicaid cap would be increased by 12 million for the virgin islands and guam the fy2006 total annual medicaid caps would be increased by 25 million and the fy2007 caps would be increased by 50 million for the northern marianas the fy2006 total annual medicaid cap would be increased by 10 million and the fy2007 cap would be increased by 20 million for american samoa the fy2006 total annual medicaid cap would be increased by 20 million and the fy2007 cap would be increased by 40 million for fy2008 and subsequent fiscal years the total annual cap on federal funding for the medicaid programs in each of puerto rico the virgin islands guam the northern marianas and american samoa would be calculated by increasing the fy2007 ceiling for inflation crs31 medicaid transformation grants under the house proposal in addition to the normal federal medicaid reimbursement received by states secretary of dhhs would provide for payments to states for the adoption of innovative methods to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of medicaid examples of innovative methods for which such funds may be used include 1 methods for reducing patient error rates through the implementation and use of electronic health records electronic clinical decision support tools or eprescribing programs 2 methods for improving rates of collection from estates owed to medicaid 3 methods for reducing waste fraud and abuse under medicaid 4 implementation of medication risk management program as part of drug use review program and 5 methods for reducing expenditures for covered outpatient drugs by increasing generic utilization total payments under this provision would equal and not exceed 50 million in each of fy2007 and fy2008 citizenship documentation as condition of an individuals eligibility for medicaid benefits section 1137d of the social security act requires state to obtain written declaration under penalty of perjury stating whether the individual is citizen or national of the united states under current law if an individual declares that he or she is not citizen or national the individual must declare that he or she is qualified alien and must present additional documentary evidence if an individual declares that he or she is us citizen or national the state is not required to obtain additional evidence but may choose to do so under the house proposal states would be required to obtain documentary evidence from individuals who declare that they are us citizens or nationals emergency services furnished by noncontract providers for medicaid managed care enrollees medicaid law provides certain protections for beneficiaries enrolled in managed care including assuring coverage of emergency services under each managed care contract awarded by the state under the house bill medicaid provider that does not have contract with medicaid managed care entity mce that furnishes emergency care to beneficiary enrolled with that mce must accept as payment in full the amount otherwise applicable outside of managed care eg in the feeforservice setting minus any payments for indirect costs of medical education and direct costs of graduate medical education this provision would be effective on january 1 2007 fmap computation for employer pension contributions when state fmaps are calculated by hhs for an upcoming fiscal year usually in the preceding november the state and us per capita personal income amounts used in the formula are equal to the average of the three most recent calendar years of data on per capita personal income available from the department of commerces bureau of economic analysis bea the definition of personal income used by bea is comprised of many parts including supplements to wages and salaries such as employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds when bea undertakes comprehensive revision of its income data every few years there may be upward and downward revisions to each of these parts the sum of which has net effect on overall personal income for example in describing its most recent comprehensive revision bea reported that upward revisions to employer contributions for pensions beginning with 1989 were the result of methodological crs32 improvements and more complete source data however bea reported upward and downward revisions to other parts of personal income as well eg wages and salaries under the house proposal for purposes of computing states fmaps beginning with fy2006 employer contributions toward pensions that exceed specified threshold would be excluded from the per capita income of state katrina health care relief targeted medicaid relief the federal medical assistance percentage fmap which has statutory minimum of 50 and maximum of 83 is the rate at which states are reimbursed for most medicaid service expenditures medicaid administrative costs are generally reimbursed at flat rate of 50 an enhanced fmap is available for both services and administration under schip subject to the availability of funds from states schip allotment under the house proposal for items and services furnished during the period august 28 2005 through may 15 2006 states would receive 100 fmap reimbursement for medicaid and schip assistance provided to 1 any individual residing in parish of louisiana county of mississippi or major disaster county of alabama and 2 individuals who resided during the week preceding hurricane katrina in parish or county for which major disaster has been declared as result of the hurricane and for which the president has determined as of september 14 2005 warrants individual assistance under the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act costs directly attributable to related administrative activities would also be reimbursed at 100 fmap hold harmless when state fmaps are calculated by hhs for an upcoming fiscal year usually in the preceding november the state and us per capita personal income amounts used in the formula are equal to the average of the three most recent calendar years of data on per capita personal income available from the department of commerces bureau of economic analysis bea for example to calculate fy2006 fmaps hhs used per capita personal income data for 2001 2002 and 2003 that became available from bea in october 2004 under the house bill in computing medicaid and schip fmaps for any year after 2006 for state that the secretary of hhs determines has significant number of individuals who were evacuated to and live in the state as result of hurricane katrina as of october 1 2005 the secretary would disregard such evacuees and their income conference agreement as passed by the senate on december 19 2005 the house agreed to conference report on s 1932 however the senate amended the report removing few provisions as the result of point of order raised associated with the byrd rule6 the amended agreement passed the senate on december 21 2006 and was returned to the house for further 6 see crs report rl33132 budget reconciliation legislation in 2005 by robert keith crs33 action it is expected that the agreement will be taken up in the early part of the session title v and title vi of the deficit reduction act of 2005 contain provisions dealing with medicare title v and medicaid schip and hurricane katrina relief title vi preliminary estimates from the congressional budget office indicate 34 billion in medicare savings in direct spending for fy2006 and 83 billion in medicare savings in direct spending from fy2006fy2010 preliminary medicaid savings estimates show 1 billion increase in medicaid spending for fy2006 and over the fiveyear period fy2006fy2010 savings of 69 billion the schip provisions are estimated to cost 170 million in fy2006 and 20 million over the fy2006fy2010 period finally the conference agreement provides for 20 billion in funding for katrinarelated health care costs in fy2006 over the fiveyear period estimated costs of the katrina provisions would equal 21 billion medicare medicares update factor to increase operating payments to acutecare hospitals medicares annual increase in its operating payments to hospitals is determined in part by the projected annual change in the hospital market basket mb measure that estimates price inflation affecting hospitals congress establishes this update for medicares inpatient prospective payment system ipps often several years in advance currently through fy2007 the ipps operating update has been established as the mb for hospitals that submit specific quality information and as the mb minus 04 percentage points for hospitals that do not provide such information under the conference agreement hospitals that do not submit the required data in fy2007 and each subsequent year will have the applicable mb percentage increase reduced by two percentage points any reduction applies only to the fiscal year in question and does not affect subsequent fiscal years the conference agreement establishes that the secretary will expand the number of quality indicators required from acute care hospitals valuebased purchasing for acutecare hospitals under the conference agreement the dhhs secretary is required to develop plan to implement valuebased purchasing program for inpatient payments to acute care hospitals beginning with fy2009 the plan is required to consider specified factors such as 1 the development selection and modification process for quality measures 2 data reporting collection and validation 3 the structure of value based payment adjustments and sources of its funding and 4 the disclosure of information on hospital performance drg adjustment for certain hospital acquired infections medicare discharges are classified into diagnosisrelated groups drgs primarily on the basis of the diagnosis and procedure code information included on the beneficiarys claim the information includes the principal diagnosis or main problem requiring inpatient care up to eight secondary diagnoses codes as well as up to six procedures crs34 performed during the stay certain secondary diagnoses are considered to be complications or comorbidities cc when present as secondary condition with specific principal diagnosis these diagnosis codes are considered to increase the length of stay by least one day in at least 75 of the patients paired drgs are split into higher and lowerpaid drgs on the presence or the absence of cc cms has added and deleted codes from the standard list of ccs but has never conducted comprehensive review of the list it is planning to systematic review of the cc list for fy2007 medicare payments under the conference agreement starting for discharges on october 1 2007 hospitals are required to report any secondary diagnosis codes applicable to patients at their admission in order to be paid by october 1 2007 the secretary is required to identify at least two highcost or highvolume or both highcost and highvolume diagnosis codes with drg assignment that has higher payment weight when present as secondary diagnosis these codes represent conditions including certain hospitalacquired infections that could reasonably have been prevented through the use of evidencebased guidelines starting for discharges on october 1 2008 the drg assigned to discharge with the identified diagnosis codes will be the lower paid drg clarification of inclusion of medicaid patient days in medicares computation of its disproportionate share hospital dsh adjustment hospitals that serve certain number of lowincome medicare and medicaid beneficiaries will receive dsh adjustment that increases their medicare ipps payments most hospitals receive the additional payments based on their dsh patient percentage which is calculated using proportion of the hospitals total days provided to medicaid recipients added to the proportion of the hospitals medicare inpatient days provided to poor medicare beneficiaries the policy of whether inpatient days provided to patient covered under demonstration projects established by section 1115 waivers could be included in the medicare dsh calculation has changed over time policies on these issues were established through regulation under the conference agreement the secretary can include inpatient hospital days of patients eligible for medical assistance under section 1115 demonstration waiver in the medicare dsh calculation these days will be counted as if they were provided to patients who were eligible for medical assistance under an approved medicaid state plan the provision ratifies existing regulations improvements to the medicaredependent hospital mdh program under current law special reimbursement for facilities with medicare dependent hospital mdh status will lapse in 2006 certain rural hospitals with 100 beds or less that have at least 60 of their discharges or inpatient days attributable to medicare patients in two of the last three years are classified as mdh hospitals under the conference agreement their mdh status would be extended for discharges occurring before october 1 2011 starting for discharges on october 1 2006 an mdh would be able to elect payments based on 50 of its fy2002 hospitalspecific costs if that would result in higher medicare payments mdhs payments would be based on 75 of their adjusted hospitalspecific costs starting for discharges on october 1 2006 mdhs that qualify for disproportionate share hospital dsh adjustment would not have the adjustment capped at 12 crs35 reduction in payments to skilled nursing facilities snfs for bad debt medicare pays the costs of certain items on reasonable cost basis outside of the applicable prospective payment system including the unpaid debt for beneficiaries coinsurance and deductible amounts historically cms has reimbursed certain providers eg snfs for 100 of the debt effective for cost reports starting in fy2001 medicare began reimbursing acute care hospitals for 70 of the reasonable costs associated with beneficiaries allowable bad debt under the conference agreement medicare payments to snfs for allowable bad debts would be reduced to 70 for beneficiaries who are not eligible for both medicare and medicare medicares payments for allowable bad debts attributed to dual eligible beneficiaries would remain at 100 extend phasein of the inpatient rehabilitation facility irf compliance thresholds cms requires that facility treat certain proportion of patients with specified medical conditions in order to qualify as an inpatient rehabilitation facility irf and receive higher medicare payments the 75 rule established in regulation requires irfs to meet compliance threshold of 60 from july 1 2005 and before july 1 2006 65 from july 1 2006 and before july 1 2007 and 75 thereafter under the conference agreement the compliance threshold for irfs is established at 60 during the 12month period beginning on july 1 2006 at 65 during the 12month period beginning on july 1 2007 and at 75 beginning on july 1 2008 and subsequently development of strategic plan regarding physician investment in specialty hospitals physicians are generally prohibited from referring medicare and medicaid patients to facilities in which they or their immediate family member have financial interests this prohibition does not extend to patient referrals to hospitals where physicians have ownership or investment interest in the whole hospital itself and not merely in subdivision of the hospital section 507 of mma established that the exception for physician investment and selfreferral would not extend to specialty hospitals for period of 18 months from enactment or until june 8 2004 this moratorium has been extended administratively by cms which has not issued provider numbers to new specialty hospitals while it examines the criteria used to award such numbers under the conference agreement the secretary is required to develop strategic and implementing plan regarding physician investment in specialty hospitals an interim report is due within three months and the final report is due later than six months after the date of enactment the secretary will continue to suspend enrollment of new specialty hospitals until the earlier date of either the submission of the report or six months after the date of enactment if the secretary does not submit the final report within the sixmonth time period then the enrollment suspension will be extended an additional two months the secretary will also provide an appropriate certification of the failure to congressional committees of jurisdiction gainsharing demonstration project in 2004 federal district court stopped cms from implementing an eighthospital gainsharing demonstration project because of civil monetary penalty concerns under the conference agreement the secretary will establish gainsharing demonstration project to evaluate
