the national audience reach limit the local television rule the radiotelevision crossow nership onetoamarket rule and the dual network ownership rule7 the commission had previously initiated proceedings regarding the local radio ownership rule and the news paperbroadcast cro ssownership rule8 those proceedings were incorporated into the biennial review on june 2 2003 the commission adopted report and order modifying its ownership rules9 in the order the commission concluded that neither an absolute prohibition on common ownership of daily ne wspapers and broadcast outlets in the same market the newspaperbroadcast cr ossownership rule nor crossservice restriction on common ownership of radio nd television outlets in the same market the radiotelevision crossownership rule remained necessary in the public interest10 the commission found that the ends sought can be achieved with more precision and with greater deference to first amendment interests through its modified cross media limits cml11 the commission also revised the market definition and the way it counted stations fo r purposes of the local radio rule revised the local television multiple ownership rule to

ownership regulation14 the commission determined that new technologies n ecessitated new rules and that the pr ior rules inadequately accounted for the competitive presence of cable ignored the diversityenhancing value of the internet and lacked any sound basi s for national audience reach cap15 according to the commission the newly adopted rules were not blind to the world around them but reflective of it and necessary in the public interest16 national ownership rules with respect to the ownership of broad cast stations on nationwide level the commission determined that while nati onal tv ownership limit is necessary to promote localism by preserving the bargaining power of affiliates and ensuring their ability to select programmin g responsive to tastes and needs of their local communities the evidence demonstrated that 35 cap was not necessary to preserve that balance and raised the limit to 4517 under the new rule single entity was prohibited from owning stations that would allow it to reach more than 45 of the national audience the commission also elected to retain the uhf discount which attributes uhf stations with only 50 of the households in their dma despite many cable operato rs now carrying uhf stations while it modified the national tele vision ownership cap the commission determined that its dual network rule wh ich prohibits common ownership of the top four television networks remained nece ssary in the public interest and did not attempt to repeal or modify it18 local ownership rules in the 2002 biennial review the commissi on either modified

necessary in the public interest and replaced both rules with single set of crossmedia limits based on market size in large markets defined as those with more than eight television stations crossownership was unrestricted the commission combined an earlier remand from the dc circuit court of appeals20 of its modified duopoly rule with the 2002 biennial review and adopted new rule that would permit common ownership of two commercial television stations in markets that have sevent een or fewer fullpower commercial and noncommercial stations and common ownership of th ree commercial stations in markets that have eighteen or more stations21 these limitations are subject to further restriction on the common ownership of stations that are ranked among the markets largest four

to be provided to outofmarket buyers with respect to local radio ownership the fcc modified its prior rule by adopting new method for determining the si ze of local market but retaining the rules

of joint sales agreements jsas26 generally jsa authorizes broker to sell advertising time for the brokered station in return for fee paid to the licensee the commission noted that because the broker

under the prior rules jsas were not attributable to the brokering entity and were not counted toward the number of st ations the brokering licensee may own in local market the new rules made the jsas

court did not address the commissions decision to raise the national audience reach cap from 35 to 45 citing congress modification of the rule in the 2004 consolidated appropriations act29 section 629 of the act directed the commission to modify the rule by setting 39 cap on national audience reach30 the court determined that because the commission was under statutory directiv to modify the national television ownership cap to 39 challenges to th commissions decision to raise the cap to 45 were moot31 additional challenges to the uhf disc ount provisions in the rule were also deemed moot even though the uhf discount rules were not mentioned in the 2004 consolidated appropriations act the c ourt determined that the uhf discount was intrinsically linked to the 39 national audience reach cap because reducing or eliminating the discount for uhf stations audiences would effectively raise the audience reach limit32 the court also noted with respect to the uhf discount that the 2004 consolidated appropriations act specifically provided that the periodic review provisions set forth in the amendm ent did not apply to any rules relating to the 39 national audience limitati on and as rule relating to the national audience limitation congress intended to in sulate the uhf discount from review none of the parties bringing the prometheus case challenged the retention of the dual network rule so this was not addressed by the court with respect to the commissions local ownership rules the court agreed with the commissions decision to modify these rules in many respects however the court found fault with the numerical limits set by the fcc in each of the local ownership rules the court stated that the commissions deri vation of new cross media limits and its modification of the numerical limits on both television and radio station ownership in local markets all have the same essential flaw an unjustified assumption that media outlets of the same type make an equal contribution to diversity and competition in local markets33 the court determined that the commi ssions decision to repeal the ban on broadcastnewspaper crossownership was ju stified and supported by evidence in the record and found that the commissions d ecision to retain some limits on common ownership was constitutional and not in violation of the communications act34 however the court found that the fcc faile d to provide reasoned analysis to support the specific limits that it chose with respect to the new crossmedia rules statinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32460crs7 35 id at 402 36 the commissions diversity index was not based on the actual market shares of companies but rather on the assumption that each television station in market provides the same diversity impact regardless of the actual size of its audience and the same for each newspaper each radio station etc the cour t rejected the contention that each outlet provides the same diversity impact saying that diversity index that requires us to accept that community college television station makes greater contribution to viewpoint diversity than conglomerate that includes the thirdlargest newspaper in america also requires us to abandon both logic and reality prometheus 373 f3d at 408 37 id at 411413 38 id at 412 39 id at 412 40 id at 418 41 id at 420 42 id at 421 43 id at 425that the limits employ several irrational assumptions and inconsistencies35 the court rejected the commissions use of diversity index36 because of what the court saw as the fallacies upon which it was based and because the commission failed to provide adequate notice of the new methodology in the rulemaking proceedings leading up to the 2002 order37 the court remande d the crossmedia limits and advised the commission to make any new metric for measuring diversity and competition in market subject to public notice and comment before it is incorporated into final rule38 the court in prometheus upheld the restriction on common ownership of the markets top four broadcast television stations but remanded the numerical limits for the commission to harmonize certain inconsistencies and better support its assumptions and rationale39 in making its decision the court found that the commission had presented evidence in the r ecord to adequately support the topfour restriction40 while failing to justify the market share assumptions used as the basis for the numerical limits the court stat ed that evidence supports the commissions equal market share assu mption and reasonable explanation underlies its decision to disr egard actual market share41 the court also remanded the commissions repeal of the failed station solicitation rule finding that the commission failed to consider the effect of its decision on minority television station ownership and thus failed to consider an impor tant aspect of the problem amounting to arbitrary and capricious rulemaking42 in addition to upholding the commissi ons restriction on common ownership of markets top four broadcast levision stations the court upheld the commissions new definition of local markets with respect to radio finding that the commissions decision was in the public interest and that it was rational exercise of rulemaking authority43 the court also found that the commission justified the inclusion of noncommercial stations in the new definition however

providing for the attribution of joint sales agreements the court affirmed the commissions decision finding that the commission changed its rules as the result of reasoned decisionmaking and that such
