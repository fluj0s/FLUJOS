scenarios miss the mark first the ipcc scenarios explicitly are not predictions second the ipcc scenarios are meant to represent different possible ghg trajectories over many decades and represent smooth emissions paths averaged over at least 10 years just as the actual weather over few years is not necessarily representative of longterm climate variability of emissions over one or several

faster than predicted the washington post september 26 2008 httpwwwwashingtonpostcomwpdyncontentarticle20080925 ar2008092503989html this article was based on report entitled carbon budget 2007 issued by the global carbon project on september 26 2008 httpwwwglobalcarbon projectorgcarbontrendsindexhtm 3 carbon dioxide emissions presented in figures are measured in metric tons of carbon carbon measurements can be converted to carbon dioxide units after multiplying by 367 the ratio of the molecular weights of carbon dioxide to carbon 4 the ghg emissions of the 1990s were strongly influenced by the collapse of the former soviet union and eastern european economies as well as by restructuring of the energy systems in the united kingdom crs3 were particularly pronounced as noted later increased coal consumption especially in developing countries is one of the main drivers behind the recent surge in emissions5 when co2 emissions accumulate in the atmosphere faster than the rate at which they are removed from the atmosphere by sinks atmospheric concentrations rise scientists have concluded that the increased concentration of greenhouse gases ghg over the past century due to human activities is likely responsible for most of the global warming observed since the 1970s and could lead to climate changes over the next century that would be unprecedented in the course of human civilization the potential impacts of such climate change including the possibility of nonlinear or abrupt effects cause alarm among many scientists and citizens reports that co2 emissions may be rising more rapidly than expected often conclude therefore that the climate system may be changing sooner than expected comparing co2 emissions with established scenarios carbon dioxide emissions have been rising almost continuously since the beginning of the industrial revolution at least 120 years ago one press report contended that the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22970 rise in global carbon dioxide emissions last year outpaced international researchers most dire projections6 statement drawn by comparing annual emissions for the year 2007 or even multiyear average from 2000 to 2007 with the ghg scenarios published by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in 20007 while co2 emissions associated with human activities continue to rise and may be worthy of alarm because of their influence on climate change comparison of one or few years emissions with the ipcc emissions scenarios misses the mark first the ipcc scenarios are not predictions the ipccs special report on emission scenarios8 sres which produced the co2 emissions estimates cited above stated scenarios are alternative images of how the future might unfold and are an appropriate tool with which to analyze how driving forces may influence future emission outcomes and to assess the associated uncertainties the possibility that any single emissions path will occur as described in the scenarios is highly uncertain while observed increases in co2 emissions merit attention and concern comparing annual or shortterm multiyear emissions with the ipcc ghg scenarios reflects misunderstanding or mischaracterization of the ipcc scenarios and the models that produce them second the ipcc exercises are intended to produce scenarios not predictions over multiple decades and to provide only longterm averages the time steps of model outputs from the six models that produced the illustrative scenarios typically is 5 to 10 5 international energy agency co2 emissions from fuel combustion

national policymakers and the public the ipcc published special report on emissions scenarios in 2000 for more information see httpwwwipccch 8 nakicenovic nebojsa et 2000 special report on emissions scenarios published for the intergovernmental panel on climate change by cambridge university press crs4 years represented by the reporting of outcomes for 2000 2010 2020 etc even with these long periods between model outputs the scenarios are meant to provide conceptual results over multidecadal periods not predictions for year or particular decade as the sres report states the modeling tools that have been used to develop these scenarios that focus on the century time scale are less suitable for analysis of near term decade or less developments9 in addition the assumptions and parameters used in modeling will change over time creating value in updating the scenarios periodically normal interannual and interdecadal variability of actual energy use and resulting co2 emissions would be expected to produce yearly emission values that fall both above and below multiyear averages for example although recent economic growth in china and india may have been higher than projected in the first part of this decade those rates may drop below the projected level perhaps substantially due to the current and expected economic adjustments figure 2 provides estimates of recent annual changes in energy related global co2 emissions the average annual rate of increase between 1981 and 2005 was about 18 but clear cyclical patterns are evident in 1981 global emissions declined by 14 in 2004

trends are higher than ipcc forecasts figure 3 shows recent co2 emissions including from cement production compared to ipcc scenarios the figure displays the six official ipcc illustrative scenarios represented by solid lines it also displays six averaged ipcc scenarios represented by dashed lines that were introduced by the global carbon project gcp whose carbon budget 2007 report was cited in the media11 the dashed lines are the numerical averages of all model results for each of the ipcc scenario storylines12 the ipcc did not calculate or publish such averaged results rather the ipcc illustrative scenarios were chosen as best representing each of the scenario storylines13 the sres illustrative scenarios intentionally did not use all the models results because of certain models

information on the a1 a2 b1 and b2 scenarios is available in the ipccs special report on emissions scenarios at httpwwwipccchipccreportssresemissionindexhtm the ipcc report notes 40 individual simulations in the a1 a2 b1 and b2 family of scenarios 17 model runs used in the a1 scenario six in the a2 scenario nine in b1 and eight in b2 13 however some of the six models used to analyze the storylines were better able than others to represent certain storylines some models could not produce results consistent with certain storyline assumptions this is one reason that all the model results for scenario were not averaged but the most representative was selected for publication crs6 the gcp averaged all models results for each scenario rather than using the ipccs most representative model results when saying that this makes current trends in emissions higher than the worst case ipccsres scenario14 the gcp statement is true only when comparing emissions with its averaged model results not those published by the ipcc recent emissions are below the a1b illustrative scenario and the top of the range ipcc found in published research literature moreover comparing recent emissions with the ipcc scenarios is not in itself adequate to understand future global ghg trajectories although the sres a1b scenario has the highest ghg emissions in the near term of all the ipcc illustrative scenarios its assumptions result in emissions beyond 2050 that are far below some other scenarios like a1f which has lower nearterm emissions understanding the factors driving emissions in the short and longrun is more revealing than comparing current emissions with scenarios monitoring emissions trends watchfulness over annual co2 and other ghg emissions is vital element of addressing climate change and evaluating the effectiveness of actions to mitigate it and it is important to use appropriate data in monitoring progress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22970 evaluating recent trends may help to discern which future ghg emission paths are most likely and why15 for example recent population growth has been lower than many of the sres scenarios while the use of some lowemission technologies eg low emissions vehicles wind power etc has been faster than in many of the scenarios the combined effects of such differences however require complex analysis both the environmental protection agency epa and the energy information administration eia in cooperation with additional federal agencies track co2 and other ghg emissions and evaluate the factors that influence interannual variability and longerterm trends several international entities provide similar services including the international energy agency the world bank and bp formerly british petroleum the epa and eia also analyze how changes in the factors driving ghg emissions may affect understanding of future climate trajectories some analysts believe however that the epa and eia do not have adequate funding to analyze sufficiently how policies may influence emissions and climate trajectories in sum the past few years of exceptionally high growth may not provide good basis for setting expectations for emissions rates in the coming few years or in the long run other changes including the rate of growth in the global economy emission control policies and regulations and the specific technologies drawing investment may provide greater insights into future ghg trajectories monitoring these factors and how they may be determining future emissions and climate paths remains important as input to policy making to address climate change 14 httpwwwglobalcarbonprojectorgcarbontrendsindexhtm 15 for more discussion of factors that drive longterm ghg trends see crs report
