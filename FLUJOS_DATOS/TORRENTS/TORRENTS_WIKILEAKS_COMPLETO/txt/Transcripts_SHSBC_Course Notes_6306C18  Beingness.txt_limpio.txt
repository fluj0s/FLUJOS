6306c18 shspec275 beingness the overtmotivator sequence is about trillion trillion trillion 1036 years old minus hundred thousand trillion it is long track but we have the process to take it apart the main difficulty with the time track and its use in auditing is that there are so many cases that cant confront time track or any part of it so you get loses trying to run engrams we have been accumulating processes that can bring someone upscale to where they can view the time track great number of processes have been accumulated and recently codified as we looked at the fundamental of what we are trying to do with case the ultimate procedure is rote engram running but not everybody could do it so the subject has had to be wrapped up in such way that it could be done by all current rote engram running is superior to and different from earlier engram running we are running engrams by chains to open up and smooth out the time track the only reason we are doing anything about engrams at all is that those are the parts of the time track that are least confrontable if you get rid of those stretches the pc has time track the worst part of the time track denies anyone the best part unless you get rid of the engrams you havent got any time track because the pc cant confront it this sets up innumerable problems the more heavily charged the track is the less the pc can confront it and there is point where the pc moves out of any confrontability of the engram and now there is nothing to confront at all this gives you the scale of cases ot to unaware awareness of the physical universe also diminishes as you go downscale if each case level were to be divided from the others it would be divided by layers of anaten anyone at level 8 would have to go through layers of anaten to get to level 7 awareness of own evaluations as one goes upscale the layers of anaten seem thinner and are thinner because the more aware one is the less one minds unawareness the lowest conscious level of unawareness would be catalepsy or amnesia but even man thinking that he has only lived once has lot of automatic unawareness of the time track when you throw into his lap the idea of having lived before you will get confrontation of his opinions about it eg what would that do to old age pensions and this will make him pretty groggy if you push him up the line his suppositional actions will occur in the absence of processing as he goes from level 7 to level 6 he will get wild ideas after going dopey he gets dubin of dubin lots of suppositional reality for instance he may think he is tutankhamen if you could get him to discuss it more intimately he would get pictures of pictures then as the pc reaches level 4 it all goes black the blackness or invisibleness are parts of real pictures the rest of the picture is just unconfrontable the blackness of level 4 is on the time track it is actually there on the time track it is nice dark safe part of the incident that actually happened run him through run him earlier and pictures can turn on at this point he gets very groggy in the incident as he reaches level 3 in this way he can see much more easily as level 2 moves into level 1 the time track disappears possibly because the time track itself is method of not confronting something he doesnt want to confront it and this overwhelms him to the point where without power of choice he makes picture of it and you have the involuntary picturetaking apparatus that is the time track one can however only be overwhelmed by that which one does not confront so the levels of cases scale is scale of confronting and we could mistakenly think that confronting would solve the time track while confronting does get results and is an interesting process it is not the common denominator of processes the common denominator of processes is duplicate the common denominator of reaction is confront the time track is duplication of an actual event and each one of the case levels is level of willingness to duplicate or unwillingness to duplicate so your breakdown from ot towards clear is an individual lack of desire to duplicate what he has to duplicate in order to be an ot leading to an overwhelming automaticity of making time track duplication goes hand in glove with the idea of beingness as we study beingness we will see this with great clarity to be or not to be is not the question in this universe you are going to be something whether you like it or not your power of choice on this matter longer exists you can notbe certain thing but only in order to be something else you can be or notbe certain thing but you will always be something the question is what to be so this is the problem one picks up as one enters this universe it doesnt matter if the universe is timeless because you entered it somewhere as you examine peoples time tracks you find that their tolerance of time is improving as you go back since time is the single source of aberration if your timetolerance improves as you go back on the track you must be getting into periods not only when the pc was less aberrated but also approaching the beginning of the time track an individuals time track is not infinite because 1 he entered the universe at some point 2 the earlier he gets on the time track the less it is constant continual and infinite thing the universe on the other hand continues at its own rate of vibration if the individuals time track were of infinite duration cases would be unresolvable getting back to the question of beingness once in this universe you cant absolutely notbe the question is what to be that is the only question in the universe that really bothers somebody you will drive kid up wall by asking him what do you want to be if you want him to be something and he knows it would be dangerous you have postulatecounterpostulate situation continuing problem of beingness theres dwindling spiral of beingness the moment one enters this universe there are fewer and fewer safe things to be you can aberrate someone by being after him to be something that is very dangerous you get problem with this the lesson of this universe is that everything you can be is too dangerous to be but there is nothing to do but be in this universe the universe has finite space that looks infinite the gains of r212 came from the fact that the pc was making lists of beingnesses and the fact that real ri is potential beingness anything you might want to be is either too dangerous or too discreditable states effort to dominate the individual is out of jealousy of beingness the press is dramatizing this by saying you mustnt be scientologist it is dangerous to be one so if you want guy to start sorting out his time track at almost any level where he is aware of it at all you could start him at once on question that would get him into some interesting categories time track is to duplicate or not to duplicate but any duplication winds up in beingness duplication and beingness are united or gradients of one another you will have cases that will not become ot until the beingness of ot is demonstrated to them to be not quite as dangerous as it has been all cases or all pcs have assigned to all upper states dangerous or discreditable beingness and the same to all lower states and to their own states impossibility to be well that is the state of any case if there is program for the security of this planet that we can push forward people become loathe to advance their states of case or do anything else they stay parked in an inertia because there is desirable future hope factor this is why hope is rudimentary therapy to some degree you would have to promise that an advanced state of case would not then bring about further problems complicated by the political or sociological problems on this planet if there is nothing that one can do with an advanced state of beingness it is doubtful that people will try to attain it so one needs future or else the problems one got into before as free thetan make one see point in case advance people will downgrade their own states if they feel uncomfortable lonely or unsafe up there planning and organization to resolve that problem alone would bring about case advance in the absence of such planning promise and organization you wont get as fast case advance if you advance any helatrobus goal lot of people will go on an automatic notis there are people who are on prevented beingness they make theta traps implants etc they can be tested for by offering them any beingness they will notis it for instance you say wise prime minister would be nice he says oh i dont know that would just give you more powerful government they would degrade any more advanced beingness or anything you wanted them to be they might even think that they were doing people favor we have the idea that if we dont have success with certain number of cases we havent got enough people to form any strata of civilization it is ok to say all right you are making an officer cadre the rest can be as they are that presupposes that there is future plan to take care of all this we have plan now for what to do with this planet fine now what about the boys from the next planet you inevitably progress into an organizational future so you have to solve the problem of beingness not only at the level of the individual case but also on out into the future through some organization that ensures some safe future an ot can straighten things out on the planet but unless you mock up plan to do so to solve the beingness problem more broadly you wont make any ots unless you plan to straighten things out few people will go through to ot because it has been so unsafe in the past the ot has had blind spot his own power was so great that he thought he could stand alone but every time he went up against an organized body he lost because the organization could furnish more viewpoints than he could it is the plurality of viewpoints that confuses the individual he cant sort it all out and eventually gets pulled down the individual could furnish only limited number of viewpoints to which he could pay attention and which he could coordinate communism advances because it has plurality of viewpoints organized to confuse the individual viewpoint the individual ot has his problems because he is an individual and has been convinced that he could do it all by himself and he could but the little boys with the airplanes always show up some time in the future the universe was ended by magellanic clouds less than 500 trillion years ago only space and rubble was left there were suns and planets lot of thetans got together to put it all back together you got planet builders and sunbuilders in spite of all this the little men with the airplanes showed up then with their thetatraps where did they come from this has happened repeatedly in this universe this universe surrenders to cooperative action and not to individual action but now we have new breed of cat the experienced being when you get through auditing someone now he is an experienced being who knows the isness of the universe and who knows that matter how tough you are you can get in pole trap we have the technology to straighten someone out unless powerful being learns that this is universe of organization and coordination he will just be back on the pole trap again any body of beings operating with coordinated program can beat him you have got situation where the individual is trying to operate in universe of cooperation and of course that degrades the beingness of the individual to that degree the more he fights to be an individual the less he cooperates the less he is willing to cooperate the more enforced is his cooperation the more he fights against this sort of thing and the less freedom he has that is description of the dwindling spiral that an individual goes through noconfront is the mechanical basis of the spiral discarded beingnesses are what bring him down in facsimile the hardest problem the pc usually has is trying to isolate what is him and who is he and what is he this is usually the biggest lie in the facsimile the pc has been running it as an overt being the executioner and he finally turns out to have been the victims wife it is in fact dangerous not to be scientologist but the rest of the beingnesses are matter of opinion and the coordination of beingnesses is one of the better solutions being at the bottom of the reality scale has gone down through scale of beingness to get him to be anything at the bottom is impossible except to be an unaware being there are deeper channels of unawareness but there is absolute unawareness he goes into coma taking responsibility for any beingness of any kind whatsoever to move him up the line he would have to have some security in being able to be something at an upper level you can have problems in processing if there is future beingness going out of responsibility occurs because one continually gets the lesson that being responsible lands you in the soup the repetition of this lesson is what puts the individual downscale in livingness the scale keeps going further south to deeper levels of unawareness it has to be made safe to be exterior to be theta clear without some guarantee that you wont just wind up in the soup again you wont become skyscraper tall again havingness is useless without purpose unless the game itself is an expanding game then processing cannot produce stability future livingness ties into rise up the scale outreality equals responsibility what to be to be an or to be b that is the question if you cant be an and cant be b and there arent any other things to be the answer is anaten it is interesting what you can do simply by using the tool of secure beingness marital difficulties result from 1 husband who wont be husband 2 wife who wont be wife 3 husband who wont let wife be wife 4 wife who wont let husband be husband this is the average marriage marriage is not unhappy marriage is difficult beingness you could use beingness processing to remedy it bypassed charge that causes jealousy is bypassed charge in the other person it is not knowing about the other persons past therefore there is crisscross of bpc because we are not bypassing charge in each other scientologists will be the first people who can be friends in this universe because time alone builds up bpc in people who know nothing about the time track you have to handle the helatrobus implant because it bolluxes up the time track and debars an easy route to running engrams and to reaccustoming the individual to different levels of beingness only engram running will clear somebody beingness case state hope expectations and confront are all tied up in the case scale now that we have the scale of cases and knowledge of what gets case up to engram running we can sort out the time track reaccustoming the person to various levels of beingness after youve got all the engrams run out youve got an ot then you need an organization to handle the problems of the ot in this universe otherwise he will just slump again
