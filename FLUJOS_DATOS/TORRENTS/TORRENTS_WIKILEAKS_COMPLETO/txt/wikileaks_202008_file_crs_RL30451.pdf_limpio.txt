pl 106113 which worked substantial reforms to the us patent system evidences congressional concern for achieving legal environment conducive to technological progress although diverse motivations shaped the eight different titles of the american inventors protection act many of its patent law reforms were influenced by the views of independent inventors and representatives of small companies4

american inventors protection act upon entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms with great precision within these limits of confidence however there is evidence that most of the recent patent law reforms do not significantly impact these companies any differently than larger more wellestablished enterprises although the reforms of the american inventors protection act are extensive they appear in large part even handed with regard to smaller and larger enterprises whether particular actor in the technological community will stand to benefit from the american inventors protection act or be

services new industries new jobs and new capital they can expand the range of services offered and extend the geographic distribution of those services where national problems are amenable to

innovative products and services for example the national academy of engineering concluded that small hightech companies play critical and diverse role in creating new products and services in developing new industries and in driving technological change and growth in the us economy8 this assessment was founded on the ability of small firms to develop markets rapidly generate new goods and services and offer diverse products the study also concluded that small businesses were less risk adverse than larger established corporations and were often better positioned to exploit market opportunities quickly similarly 1982 study supported by the small business administration sba determined that small firms are 24 times as innovative per employee as large companies9 more recent sba studies claim that 55 of the countrys innovations originated with entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms10 national science foundation report found that entrepreneurs and small firms are six times as effective as larger firms in utilizing research and development expenditures to generate new products11 high technology industries contain an especially large number of small companies according to sba data 94 of high technology companies have under 500 employees and 73 had less than 20 workers these small firms accounted for 18 of the total receipts generated by high technology industries in 1996 379 of workers in private sector high technology businesses were employed by small companies 222 of all private sector high technology workers worked in firms with less than 100 employees high technology employees comprised 31 of the total number of workers in the small business community compared to 46 for the number of high technology employees in all companies regardless of size although these studies and data suggest that entrepren eurs and small entrepren eurial firms play critical role in the technological advancement of the united states other observers are less sanguine about their contribution much of this skepticism follows from the teachings of the economist joseph schumpeter who contended that rational market actor would only seek to innovate if it could appropriate the returns on its research and development investment12 following this reasoning it would seem that technological change would be championed by largehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30451crs4

1999 47enterprises with significan t market share13 others have also maintained that conclusive evidence suggests that firm size affects the success of research and development efforts14 however even the more skeptical observers have recognized that large and small firms possess complementary strengths and weaknesses for example the globalization of the economy increasingly requires firms to access foreign markets in order to remain competitive large companies may be better able to enter the international marketplace due to number of comparative advantages as compared with smaller enterprises larger firms may be better able to tap external sources of finance and technical expertise and maintain sophisticated management teams larger businesses also benefit from scale and scope economies due to size and diversification15 as result smaller firms often enter into joint ventures or are absorbed into larger enterprises for purposes of marketing and manufacturing the relationships small entrepreneurial companies enjoy with larger enterprises appears to be crucial element influencing the ability of smaller firms to achieve technological advance16 observer s have also explained that small high tech firms enjoy certain advantages over larger enterprises small firms are perceived as enjoying organizational flexibility lack of bureaucracy and efficient internal communications that depend upon informal channels such traits may allow smaller companies to respond more quickly to changing market demands than larger competitors17 in sum even technological observers who would assign entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms lesser role in technological advancement recognize that smaller entities complement larger enterprises in the innovative process the role of patents in small business rd whether innovating directly or forging partnerships with larger enterprises small high tech companies have frequently turned to the regime of patents18

intellectual property and the costs of commercial exchange review essay 93 michigan law review 1995 1570towards technological innovation this effect is achieved by granting inventors exclusive rights to practice the patented invention19 industrial response to the plant variety protection act of 1970 pvpa is often cited in support of the rationale that patent rights can stimulate invention in field in which proprietary rights were previously unavailable the pvpa allowed plant breeders the ability to obtain patentlike protection on novel varieties of plants grown from seed20 in the decade prior to the promulgation of the pvpa industry developed approximately 150 new plant varieties but in the decade following the enactment of the pvpa over 3000 new varieties were created21 the regime of patents purportedly serves other goals as well the patent system encourages the disclosure of products and processes for each issued patent must include description sufficient to enable skilled artisans to practice the patented invention22 when the patent expires ordinarily twenty years from the date the application is filed23 others are given the ability to practice the patented invention although estimates vary one report observed that 8590 of the information available in published patent instruments would not otherwise be publicly available24 issued patents may also encourage others to invent around the patentees proprietary interest patentee may point the way to new products markets economies of production and even entire industries others can build upon the patentees disclosure to produce their own technologies that fall outside the exclusive rights associated with the patent25 the patent system has also been identified as facilitator of markets absent patent rights an inventor may have scant tangible assets to sell or license and even less ability to police the conduct of contracting party by reducing licensees opportunistic possibilities the patent system lowers transactions costs and makes technologybased transactions more feasible26 the extent to which the patent system practically achieves these goals is difficult to assess various economic studies have

example one study of the aircraft and semiconductor industries suggested that lead time and the strength of the learning curve were superior to patents in capturing the value of investments27 in contrast members of the drug and chemical industries attached higher value to patents differences in the perception of the patent system have been attributed to the extent to which patents introduced significant duplication costs and times for competitors of the patentee perhaps the best evidence available as to the perceived value patents is that in the united states the number of filed patent applications and issued patents continues to climb28 these data suggests that members of the technological community continue to view patents as valuable studies have indicated that entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms rely more heavily upon the patent system than larger enterprises larger companies often possess number of alternative means for achieving proprietary or propertylike interest in particular technology for example trade secrecy ready access to markets trademark rights speed of development and consum er goodwill may to some degree act as substitutes to the patent system as sally wyatt and gilles bertin reported in their survey of alternatives to patenting representative of one european corporation opined that multinational corporations could easily cease to use patents and use other available methods to achieve the same aims29 however individual inventors and small firms often do not have these mechanisms at their disposal as result the patent system may enjoy heightened importance with respect to these enterprises30 the american inventors protection act of 1999 following several years of discussion on november 19 1999 congress lent final approval to bill that made substantial changes to the patent law this legislation the american inventors protection act of 1999 pl 106113 was part of the intellectual property and communications omnibus reform

exploitation of the technology on the marketplace invention promoters often provide valuable services but some commentators have observed that the industry has achieved notoriety for its predatory practices32 observers also recount that inexperienced inventors have sometimes paid considerable sums to invention promoters without receiving any real service in return33 the inventors rights act mandates that invention promoters provide certain information in writing to prospective customers this information includes the number of evaluated inventions the percentage of inventions that obtain positive and negative evaluations and the number of customers known to have licensed or obtained net financial profit as direct result of the invention promoters services the act also exposes invention promoters to liability for any statement that was material and either false or fraudulent as well the pto is obliged to make publicly available all complaints concerning invention promoters subtitle b patent and trademark fee fairness act this subtitle reduces certain patent fees associated with the filing of patent applications and the maintenance of issued patents this legislation

initial maintenance fee which was reduced from 940 to 830 this subtitle also requires the pto to conduct study of alternative fee structures to encourage maximum participation of the us inventive community in the patent system subtitle c first inventor defense act this subtitle creates an infringement defense for an earlier inventor of method of doing or conducting business that was later patented by another the defendant must have reduced the infringing subject matter to practice one year before the effective filing date of the patent and made commercial use of that subject matter in the united states before the effective filing date the impetus for this provision lies in the rather complex relationship between the law of trade secrets and the patent system trade secrecy protects individuals from misappropriation of valuable information that is useful in commerce one reason an inventor might maintain the invention as trade secret rather than seek patent protection is that the subject matter of the invention may not be regarded as patentable such inventions as customer lists or data compilations have traditionally been regarded as amenable to trade secret protection but not to patenting34 inventors might also maintain trade secret protection due to ignorance of the patent system or because they believe they can keep their invention as secret longer than the period of exclusivity granted through the patent system35 it is important to note from the outset that the patent system has not favored trade secret holders wellestablished patent law provides that an inventor who makes secret commercial use of an invention for more than one year prior to filing patent application at the pto forfeits his own right to patent36 this policy is principally based upon the desire to maintain the integrity of the statutory proscribed patent term the patent law grants patents term of twenty years commencing from the date patent application is filed37 if the trade secret holder could make commercial use of an invention for many years before choosing to file patent application he could disrupt this regime by delaying the expiration date of his patent on the other hand settled patent law principles established that prior secret uses would not defeat the patents of later inventors38 if an earlier inventor made secret commercial use of an invention and another person independently invented the same technology later and obtained patent protection then the trade secret holder couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30451crs9 39149 f3d 1368 fed cir 1998 cert denied 119 sct 851

the reasoning that issued published patent instruments fully inform the public about the invention while trade secrets do not as between subsequent inventor who patented the invention and thus had disclosed the invention to the public and an earlier trade secret holder who had not the law favored the patent holder recent legal developments concerning methods of doing business have focused attention upon the relationsh ip between patents and trade secrets inventors of methods of doing business traditionally relied upon trade secret protection because such inventions had long been regarded as unpatentable subject matter as result inventors of innovative business methods obtained legal advice not to file applications at the pto on their inventions this advice was sound under the patent law as it then stood the 1998 decision of the court of appeals for the federal circuit state street bank and trust co v signature financial group 39 altered this traditional principle in the state street bank opinion the federal circuit overturned the historical bar denying patents on methods of doing business as consequence inventors in fields ranging from such sectors as finance insurance and services have sought proprietary interests in their inventions through the patent system this change in this background principle was perceived to have harmed individuals that invented business methods prior to the issuance of the state street bank opinion many of these inventors had maintained their innovative business methods as trade secrets for many years as result they were unable belatedly to obtain patent protection on their business methods as well because trade secrets did not constitute prior art against the patent applications of others subsequent inventor would be able to obtain patent protection under these circumstances trade secret holder could find himself an adjudicated infringer of patented business method that he actually invented first40 the first inventor defense act of 1999 reconciles these principles by providing an infringement defense for an earlier inventor of method of doing business that was later patented by another this infringement defense is subject to several qualifications first the defendant must have reduced the infringing subject matter to practice at least one year before the effective filing date of the application second the defendant must have commercially used the infringing subject matter prior to the effective filing date of the patent finally any reduction to practice or use must have been made in good faith without derivation from the patentee or persons in privity with the patentee subtitle d patent term guarantee act the patent term guarantee act of 1999 provides certain deadlines that if not met

in us policy 18 loyola angeles international comparative law journal 1995 p 143among these deadlines are fourteen months for first office action four months for subsequent office action and four months between the payment of an issuance fee and the grant of patent as well the prosecution of an original patent application must be completed within three years of the actual us filing date with exceptions granted for continuing applications and appeals the pto director is charged with calculating any patent term extensions that might result from missed deadlines this statute appears to further the transition of the us patent system from its previous system of patent term which was 17 years from the date the pto issued the patent41 as of 1995 however patent term was set to 20 years from the date the corresponding patent application was filed42 absent provisional rights obtained following publication of an application however the patentee obtains legal rights until the pto allows the patent to issue consequence of the current system of term calculation is that each day the application spends at the pto amounts to lost day for purposes of the duration of patent by ensuring prompt pto performance through term extension the patent term guarantee act of 1999 maintains the integrity of the 20year patent term subtitle domestic publication of foreign filed patent applications act the domestic publication of foreign filed patent applicatio ns act of 1999 requires the pto director to publish pending patent applications 18 months from the earliest filing date to which they are entitled significantly not all applications will be published if an applicant certifies that the invention disclosed in the us application will not be the subject of patent application in another country that requires publication of applications 18 months after filing then the pto will not publish the application as the pto previously maintained all patent applications in secrecy publishing them only when they had matured into formally approved patents the act marks significant change in pto procedures some background into international and comparative patent law will assist understanding of this provision43 first there is global patent system patent rights must be applied for and secured in each jurisdiction in world where technology knows borders and international trade

histories in patent claim interpretation 47 ucla law review 1998 187 in recognition of these realities the united states has long been signatory of the paris convention for the protection of industrial property44 this treaty attempts to ease the burdens of maintaining patent rights in many jurisdictions among the chief provisions of the paris convention is the socalled priority right the priority right allows patent applicants to benefit from an earlier filing date in foreign country so long as an inventor files abroad within one year of his first filing and complies with certain formalities his subsequent foreign filings will be treated as if they were made as of the date of his initial filing second important background principle is that foreign patent offices ordinarily publish patent applications 18 months after their first effective filing date45 as an example suppose that an inventor filed an application at the us pto on june 1 1996 suppose further that the inventor sought patent rights in germany which is also signatory to the paris convention if the inventor files german patent application by june 1 1997 his application will be treated as having been filed on the us filing date of june 1 1996 the german patent office will publish the german application on december 1 1997 18 months after the first effective filing date to which the inventor is entitled in contrast to overseas regimes the us patent system traditionally maintained applications in secrecy this regime advantaged patent applicants because it allowed them to understand exactly what the scope of any allowed claims might be prior to disclosing an invention thus if the applicant maintained the invention that was subject to patent application as trade secret then he could choose between obtaining the allowed patent claims and trade secret status46 however this secrecy regime has been perceived as imposing costs as well others might well engage in repetitive research efforts during the pendency of patent applications unaware that an earlier inventor had already staked claim to that technology this arrangement also allows inventors to commence infringement litigation on the very day patent issues without any degree of notice to other members of the technological community47 the domestic publication of foreign filed patent applicat ions act of 1999 attempts to strike middle ground us patent applications will be published 18 months from the date of filing except where the inventor represents that he will not seek patent protection abroad to

more robust patent protection in some countries than in others this step may be taken for business reasons or due to differences in the patent or competition laws in varying jurisdictions the domestic publication of foreign filed patent applications act therefore contains provision allowing applicants to submit redacted copy of the application filed in the patent and trademark office eliminating any part or descriptio n of the invention in such application that is not also contained in any of the corresponding application filed in foreign country as result if an applicant seeks broader patent protection in the united states than in other countries only the more limited version of the application will be published here this act also creates socalled provisiona l rights that may attach to published patent applications provisional rights are equivalent to reasonable royalty the amount that the patentee would have charged an infringer had the two parties entered into licensing arrangement at the time the infringe ment began48 persons who employ the invention as claimed in the published patent application are potentially liable for this amount provisional rights are subject to several qualifications they are only effective at such time as the patent issues apply only when the infringer had actual notice of the published patent application and the claims of the published application are substantially identical to those of the issued patent an example may clarify the workings of provisional rights suppose that an inventor files us patent application on february 1 2001 assuming the inventor does not file the appropriate certification the pto will publish the application 18 months later on august 1 2002 suppose further that this application results in an issued patent that the pto formally grants on june 1 2003 under these facts the inventor may file patent infringement suit on or after june 1 2003 assuming the statutory requirements are fulfilled the inventor may claim provisional rights equivalent to reasonable royalty from august 1 2002 the date the application was published through june 1 2003 the date the patent was granted infringing acts

publication to the pto and request that reexamination occur if the pto determines that this reference raises substantial new question of patentability then it will essentially reinitiate examination of the patent principal goal of reexamination was to resolve validity disputes more quickly and less expensively than litigation51 as originally structured the reexaminatio n statute encountered criticism reexamination was structured largely as socalled ex parte proceeding much like the process of obtaining patent in the first instance reexaminations are structured as dialogue between applicant and pto examiner the examiner does not assume an adversarial posture towards the patentee but instead assists the patentee in ensuring that the patent fulfills the statutory requirements52 the patent law essentially limited the role of third parties to initiating the reexamination following this first step third parties could only play the role of passive observer some commentators did not believe the reexamination system provided viable alternative to validity challenges in court53 judicial proceedings are conducted in socalled inter partes fashion such that one litigant may contest the assertions of the other the reexamination requestor may well have much to gain if the patent is struck down during reexamination and so he would possess significant incentives to counter the arguments of the patentee traditional reexamination procedures did not provide that opportunity as result the ability of reexamination to substitute for litigation of patent validity was compromised data supported these observations for far fewer reexaminations were requested than had been originally anticipated54 the optional inter partes reexamin ation procedure act of 1999 responds to these concerns by providing third party requesters with an additional option they may employ the traditional reexamination system which has been renamed an ex parte reexamination or they may opt

companies in high tech industries subtitle inventors rights act of all of the provisions of the american inventors protection act of 1999 the inventors rights act is most oriented towards the needs of entrepreneurs invention promotion services are ordinarily marketed towards and sought out by individual inventors who are independent of larger enterprise three components of the inventors rights act are worthy of discussion here one portion of the inventors rights act mandates that invention promoters disclose certain facts concerning their own services and the success of their clients these disclosures could chill an invention promoters desire to exaggerate its claims of success and thereby prove helpful to independent inventors experience with similar requirements in other areas of commercial law suggests that the effects of this reporting requirement may be modest however disclosures of this sort are sometimes not fully understood by consumers and may not even be read56 another component of the inventors rights act creates ptomaintained log of complaints concerning invention promoters registration of complaints regarding invention promoters could be useful to the extent that inventors both report complaints to the pto and consult the registry whether entrepreneurs diligently report complaints or routinely contact the pto prior to engaging the services of promotion service will remain matter for future observation the inventors rights act also creates cause of action for any material false or fraudulent representation or any omission of material fact by invention promoters although potentially of use to the victim of misrepresentation this possibility is to some extent duplicative of preexisting causes of action under state tort and contract law57 entrepreneurs already possessed mechanisms for achieving remedies against invention promoters who were fraudulent or otherwise misrepresented material facts to customers the success of this cause of action could also be judged by the extent to which inventors employ it during litigation subtitle b patent and trademark fee fairness act it is well accepted that high costs present significant

enterprises59 reductions in the fees associated with patent acquisition should be of particular benefit to small companies two fundamental principles can be considered when assessing the impact of these fee reductions first pto fees do not comprise large percentage of the total cost of patent acquisition the bulk of these charges go towards the preparation and prosecution of the patent application by patent attorney or agent although these fees vary markedly depending upon locale field of technology amount of preparatory work associated with the application and other factors 1993 study revealed that most inventors expend between 5000 and 10000 to acquire us patent rights60 within this financial setting the reduction of the pto filing fee by 70 may not be of great moment for patent applicants second the pto currently provides 50 fee discount for individual inventors and businesses with less than 500 employees61 because the pto is wholly funded by applicant fees larger enterprises essentially subsidize small companies in their patent acquisition efforts at the pto as result only the larger firms will receive the entire discount as entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms only bear 50 of the fees they will also receive only 50 of the discount subtitle c first inventor defense act the effect of the first inventor defense act of 1999 upon small high technology enterprises is difficult to assess business method patents are very recent phenomenon and empirical evidence of its effects are still not clear however some initial observations can be offered based upon past interactions between entrepreneurial firms and the intellectual property regime to the extent that small companies make an earlier use of business method that is later patented by another the first inventor defense act could benefit them as sole proprietorships and smaller firms may lack the funding to obtain patents on everyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30451crs17 62cordes supra

they may well be the primary beneficiary of statute that considerably augments the value of trade secrecy on the other hand observers could justly question whether the entities that are best positioned to qualify as first inventors under the stringent provisions of the act will actually be entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms in this regard it is important to note that the first inventor defense applies only when the putative first inventor actually reduced the subject matter to practice at least one year before the effective filing date of such patent the term actual reduction to practice refers to the construction of physical embodiment of product invention or the actual practicing of process invention63 an actual reduction to practice may be more difficult for small businesses to achieve than larger firms larger firms presumably have more resources available and thus more able to put inventive ideas into commercial practice therefore some contend that it is reasonable to believe that larger companies will find the first inventor defense more availing than independent inventors and small enterprises holders of patents on business methods may also discover that their patent portfolios are of diminished value competitors previous use of the patented invention may detract from the exclusive rights ordinarily enjoyed by patent proprietors to the extent that small firms rely more heavily upon patents than larger enterprises they may be more greatly impacted by the first inventor defense subtitle d patent term guarantee act the patent term guarantee act of 1999 appears to effect entrepreneurs small entrepreneurial firms and larger enterprises equally any sort of patent applicant may encounter pto delays for any number of reasons varying from simple personnel shortages to mandatory suspension of the prosecution due to the prior art definition within the patent law64 as result small high tech companies stand to benefit from extended patent terms when pto delays are encountered however they may also be subject to the lengthened terms of patents held by their competitors difficulty with the patent term guarantee act is that some patents may enjoy terms that extend far beyond the usual duration of 20 years from the date the patent application was filed in particular patents not issued within three years of the filing date ordinarily will enjoy one day of additional term for each day of delay as pto delays can sometimes be considerable65 this provision might result in substantial term extension for patents in biotechnology and

undermine these efforts66 the patent term guarantee act also charges the pto to calculate the appropriate patent term and notify the applicant this task may prove to be quite difficult in particular the act requires that any term adjustment shall be reduced by period equal to the period of time during which the applicant failed to engage in reasonable efforts to conclude prosecution of the application as result the patent term guarantee act may lead to situation where members of the public will longer be able to determine patents term based upon information on the face of the patent instrument instead they must estimate the term based on information from the patents prosecution history even then the term may remain uncertain until court resolves whether the patentee made reasonable efforts to conclude prosecution67 subtitle domestic publication of foreign filed patent applications act some of the concerns of entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms appear to have been addressed during the drafting of legislation requiring the publication of pending patent applications indeed predecessor version of the domestic publication of foreign filed patent applications act of 1999 expressly exempted small entities from the publication requirement68 as enacted the act allows applicants to certify that they will confine their patent acquisition efforts to the united states and thereby avoid publication of their application prior to grant one explanation for this publication regime is that it ensures that us inventors will be able to see the technology that foreign competition is seeking to patent much earlier than was possible before69 detractors have observed that the domestic publication of foreign filed patent applications act of 1999 essentially does nothing because the legislation only makes available applications that were already published by foreign patent offices more or less information is made available at particular times than was

jurisdictions first foreign filings are taken up later as practical matter then the only applications that will not be published under this statute are those filed by us inventors this domestic preference may violate the principle of national treatment pledge the united states made when it signed the paris convention to treat domestic and foreign inventors equally72 the impact of the domestic publication of foreign filed patent applications act of 1999 upon entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms appears uncertain the act ensures that inventors who only file patent applications in the united states need not disclose their technologies to the public until they are sure they know the scope of the grant the pto will allow however small businesses will remain uncertain about the patent applications filed by others who have chosen not to file abroad even if the pto does publish an application applicants may have opted to redact portions of applications if they chose to seek more narrow patent rights overseas as result considerable uncertainty surrounds this partial publication regime small high tech firms may spend months engaging in wasteful and duplicative research efforts only to discover that the pto issued patent foreclosing their commercialization of that technology73 the domestic publication of foreign filed patent applications act of 1999 may also discourage entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms from seeking patent protection abroad because this legislation attaches the penalty of publication to foreign filings inventors may opt to forego the possibility of foreign patent rights this incentive may impede small enterprises from receiving full compensation from the use of their technologies abroad and actually benefit

inventor and entrepreneur stated that the publishing of patent applications before grant would induce infringers to copy his invention before he has patent protection and when he may in fact never be granted patent77 other observers have noted that once the pto has granted patent the corresponding patent instrument is available for inspection on global basis us patents may be freely read by individuals located in foreign jurisdictions even though such patents offer exclusive rights only within the united states if foreign patent rights have not been obtained or are not yet in the pipeline then concerns over theft by foreigners may be besides the point78 subtitle f optional inter partes reexamination procedure act the optional inter partes reexamination procedure act could provide more effective mechanism for interested parties to challenge the validity of issued patents to the extent they wish to challenge the patents of others entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms stand to benefit from this legislation presumably these types of companies possess less financial resources than other market entrants so less costly alternatives than patent litigation would seem highly beneficial however small businesses may also bear additional costs as result of the optional inter partes reexamination procedure act prior to this legislative reform patentees that did not sue or threaten to sue their competitors could ensure that they would not be subject to costly patent litigation following the optional inter partes reexamination procedure act of 1999 patents held by entrepreneurs may be subject to inter partes reexamination as well inter partes reexaminations will undoubtedly prove more costly than traditional ex parte reexamin ations particularly if pto findings of patent validity are appealed to the pto board or court of appeals for the federal circuit and to the extent that inter partes reexaminations are cheaper then litigation then industry

firms will likely gain two principal benefits from the patent and trademark office efficiency act first the act allows the pto to retain and use all of its revenues and receipts this legislation should ensure that pto revenues are not diverted to pay for other government functions the entire patent community could benefit from pto that can deploy its revenue to retain qualified personnel maintain an appropriate technical library and devote appropriate amounts of time to the examination process80 second the public advisory committees for patents could provide small high tech companies with mechanism for dialogue with the pto director and commissioner of patents the act mandates that one member of the committee must be an independent inventor as well not less than onequarter of the ninemember committee must consist of representatives of small entities curiously this formula does not result in an integer but it does ensure that delegates of entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms will have the opportunity to address pto management however it should be noted that the members of the public advisory committee will be appointed by the secretary of commerce and that the commit tee possesses rulemaking or other formal authority issues and options many of the provisions of the american inventors protection act of 1999 were drafted in view of concerns expressed by entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms however the impact of most of the acts significant reforms will likely depend not so much on the size of specific entity but upon other factors pertinent factors include the marketplace importance of the actors patent portfolio the innovative activity of the actors competitors and the general propensity of the actors industrial sector towards patent acquisition and enforcement more specifically both the inventors rights act and the patent and trademark efficiency act appear principally to benefit small high tech businesses independent inventors have long been the favored targets of invention promotion services and the creation of public advisory committee for patents should promote communication with pto management yet the reforms achieved by this legislation appear modest in view of more significant changes wrought by the other titles of the american inventors protection act this group of statutory amendments appear to be of neutral application to entrepreneurs small entrepreneurial firms and larger entitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30451crs22 for example entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms stand to benefit from the first inventor defense act to the extent they have held methods of doing business as trade secrets yet the first inventor defense also decreases the value of patents on methods of doing business whether or not the holder of such patent is small or large entity similarly the optional inter partes reexamination procedure act makes it easier for anyone to challenge issued patents while small companies may find it easier to defeat the patents of others to the extent that they are patentees they may have to fend off more reexaminations themselves the domestic publication of patent applications filed abroad act also appears evenhanded in application among its effects is to delay public access to patent related information until such time as the patent issues if the inventor seeks patent protection only within the united states the domestic publicat ion of patent applications filed abroad act may well protect individual inventors and small businesses from unscrupulous individuals who steal information from published patent applications but to the extent that these firms have competitors who seek patent applications only in the united states they may suffer from lack of forewarning over the proprietary interests of others as the domestic public of patent applications filed abroad act seemingly discourages entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial companies from seeking patent rights abroad its directives also appear inconsistent with the current trends in international trade the provisions of the inventors protection act that decrease pto fees and extend patent terms also appear to impact small and large entities impartially the costs of obtaining patents will become marginally less expensive for both perhaps making it easier for them to obtain patents but potentially increasing the number of competitor patents for which concern must be had last pto delays in processing applications occur independently of the size of the patent applicant some entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms may reap the benefits associated with longer patent terms but others may have to deal with the delayed expiration dates of patents owned by competitors several provisions of the inventors protection act may deserve further congressional observation and consideration among them is the current articulation of the first inventor defense the first inventor defense act of 1999 provides only brief explanation of the patented subject matter to which it applies in contrast to its extended definition of commercially used the statute provides only that the term method means method of doing or conducting business this succinct delineation may contain some ambiguity as an example consider an accused infringer whose sole commercial practice is the manufacturing of particular chemical compound methods of manufacturing have traditionally been among the subject matter of the patent system yet should another patent that method the accused infringer may well argue that chemical manufacturing technique is also method of doing business given that the statutes legislative history makes clear that the first inventor defense act of 1999 was inspired by the federal circuit opinion in state street bank this argument may at first appear untenable the house report to accompany hr 1907 expressly states however that this legislation is not

patents had issued that could arguably be described as business methods for example two such issued patents one relating to managing dry cleaning establishment and the other relating to plan for saving for anticipated college tuition expenses were the subject of recent opinions from the united states supreme court82 with articulated definition of the term method of doing or conducting business in the statute clear record of congressional intent and shared meaning of this term prevalent within the patent community judicial interpretation of this term will be crucial83 the statute also contains limitation regarding the manner in which the patent claim is drafted that may prove difficult to apply in practice the first inventor defense act of 1999 provides that person may not assert the defense under this section unless the invention for which the defense is asserted is for method however the house report to accompany hr 1907 provides an invention is considered to be process or method if it is used in connection with the production of useful endproduct or service and is or could have been claimed in the form of business process or method in patent softwarerelated invention for example that was claimed by the patent draftsman as programmed machine when the same invention could have been protected with process or method patent claims is process or method for purposes of 27384 difficulty with this language is that experienced patent practitioners know that virtually any invention can be drafted in either product and method format85 the choice of one format or the other is most typically matter of drafting style that the first inventor defense is supposedly limited to methods appears to have almost substantive legal effect whatsoever looking forward

inventor defense act of 1999 prior user rights abroad are not limited to methods of doing or conducting business they instead apply to any sort of invention experience with the first inventor defense act of 1999 might suggest whether the united states should consider more fullfledged prior user rights regime or be maintained as limited cure of specific problem finally to whatever range of inventions it applies first inventor defense appears to augment the value of trade secrets at the expense of the patent regime in system where trade secret holders may face liability for patent infringement in the future inventors face significant incentives to file applications at the pto even if inventors never plan to enforce their patents against competitors the patents nonetheless possess defensive value should others come to the same invention later but where trade secret holders may employ first inventor defense the incentive to obtain patent protection is diminished prior trade secret status will block liability for patent infringement this system may reduce the number of filed patents and as consequence diminish the public trove of knowledge that appears only in issued patent instruments88 the manner in which the pto implements the domestic publication of patent applications published abroad act of 1999 may also be of interest to congress inventors often amend their applications during the eighteen months following the filing date either unilaterally or in response to statements by the examiner whether the application should be published as filed or with regard to later developments appears to be an open question as well whether the pto will publish the entire application or merely representative portion and the precise medium of presentation appear unsettled the acts piecemeal publication regime might be considered as providing first step towards an ecumenical publication system in august 1994 the united states and japan signed an agreement under which the japanese patent office agreed among other things to end its practice of allowing thirdparty preissuance oppositions and to allow the filing of patent applications in the

regime as was promised nearly six years ago finally the pto response to the new inter partes reexamination system may be of interest to congress as the patent and trademark office moves to somewhat unfamiliar regime of adversarial proceedings examiners must bear increased adjudicatory responsibiliti es90 the optional inter partes reexamination procedure act of 1999 calls for pto report progress following the passage of five years and the experience of the pto should be well worth considering it should also be noted that some patent practitioners have doubted whether industry will make significant use of the inter partes reexamination statute91 although many commentators have called for more robust third party participation in reexaminations the preclusive effect attached to inter partes reexamination proceedings may have chilling effect upon such proceedings potential requesters may be reluctant to provoke reexaminations if they lack further opportunities to challenge the reexamined patent based upon prior art that was or should have been before the pto during the reexamination the fact that inter partes reexaminations are more narrow in scope than judicial proceedings and that many observers consider the courts to be more neutral forum than the pto may contribute to this prediction whether the new inter partes reexamination will fulfill its expectations remains to be seen final observation is that the american inventors protection act of 1999 highlights the dynamic between congress the pto and the courts in administering the patent system until recently patent policy was largely controlled by the pto and the court of appeals for the federal circuit with little input from the legislature certain problems are associated with judicial and administrative oversight however patent litigation is increasingly the subject of jury trials92 which may not provide the optimal mechanism for the advancement of sound patent policies the assignment of significant policy role to the pto an agency which issues patents following ex parte examination may create an environment favoring proprietary rights holders without significant advocacy role for the larger
