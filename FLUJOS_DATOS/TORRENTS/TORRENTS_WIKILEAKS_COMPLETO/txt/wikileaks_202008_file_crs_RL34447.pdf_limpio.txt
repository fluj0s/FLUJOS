churches and other houses of worship qualify for taxexempt status as internal revenue code 501c3 organizations one qualification for 501c3 status is that these organizations may not participate in political campaign activity they are permitted under the tax laws to engage in other political activities eg distribute voter guides and invite candidates to speak at church functions so long as such activity does not support or oppose candidate additionally church leaders may engage in campaign activity in their capacity as private individuals without negative tax consequences to the church the tax codes political campaign prohibition is sometimes referred to as the johnson amendment after thensenator lyndon johnson who introduced the provision as an amendment to the revenue act of 1954 while some have argued the prohibition violates churches free exercise and free speech rights under the first amendment the two federal courts of appeals to address the issue have reached the opposite conclusion separate from the prohibition in the tax code the federal election campaign act feca may also restrict the ability of churches to engage in electioneering activities legislation introduced in the 110 th congress hr 2275 would repeal the political campaign prohibition in the tax code if this bill were enacted into law churches could engage in campaign activities without jeopardizing their taxexempt status but they would still be subject to applicable campaign finance laws this report examines the restrictions imposed on campaign activity by churches under tax and campaign finance

exempt from federal income taxes and eligible to receive taxdeductible contributions3 in return they may not participate in or intervene in including the publishing or distributing of statements any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office 4 this is an absolute prohibition church that engages in any amount of campaign activity may have its 501c3 status revoked it may also either in addition to or in lieu of revocation be taxed on its political expenditures5 in 2002 the irs indicated that only two churches have lost their 501c3 status due to campaign intervention6 one of these is the church at pierce creek in binghamton new york which took out newspaper advertisements opposing presidential candidate four days before the 1992 election the identity of the second church is not clear several nonchurch religious organizations have had their 501c3 status revoked including christian echoes national ministry reportedly the way international christian broadcasting network and old time gospel hour came to settlement agreements with the irs under which their exempt status was revoked for certain years and the christian coalition was denied 501c3 status due to its political activities7 the prohibition was introduced by thensenator lyndon johnson as floor amendment to the revenue act of 1954 he analogized it to the lobbying limitation enacted

limitation by saying organizations that lobbied were denied taxexempt status as opposed to only those that substantially lobbied8 the acts legislative history has further discussion of the provision it has been suggested he proposed it either as way to get back at an organization that supported an opponent or as an alternative to proposal denying tax exempt status to organizations making grants to subversive entities and individuals9 g18g155g152g145g146g139g146g157g142g141g561g3g140g157g146g159g146g157g146g142g156g561 irc 501c3 only prohibits campaign intervention other types of political activities are permitted the line between what is prohibited and what is permitted can be difficult to discern clearly churches may not make statements th at endorse or oppose candidate publish or distribute campaign literature10 or make any type of monetary or other contribution to campaign on the other hand they may conduct political activities not related to elections such as issue advocacy and supporting or opposing appointments to nonelective offices11 in many situations the activity is permissible unless it is structured or conducted in way that shows bias towards or against candidate some biases can be subtle and whether an activity is campaign intervention will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case12 for example churches may create and distribute voter education materials that do not indicate preference towards any candidate there are however numerous ways in which the material could show bias such as by not including all candidates on an equal basis supporting slate of candidates even if the criteria are nonpartisan and objective comparing the churchs position on issues with those of the candidates or covering onl those issues important to the church 13 other factors that may be important in specific factual situation include the timing of the materials distribution and to whom it is distributed14 churches may invite candidates to appear at services and other functions so long as bias for or against candidate is exhibited15 if an individual appears as candidate factors that may 8 see 100 cong rec 9604 1954 statement of sen johnson 9 see

candidates were provided an equal opportunity to speak the church made clear it was not supporting or opposing any candidate and fundraising occurred if the individual appears in role other than as candidate relevant factors may include the following he or she was chosen to speak for non candidacy reasons and spoke solely in that capacity campaign activity occurred in connection with the event the church maintained nonpartis an atmosphere at the event and the events announcement indicated the noncandidate capacity in which the individual was appearing and did not mention the candidacy or election it should be emphasized that even if these factors are met the appearance could still be impermissible because bias was exhibited in some other way the tax laws do not prohibit religious leaders from participating in campaign activity as individuals16 religious leaders may endorse or oppose candidates in speeches advertisements etc in their capacity as private citizens leader may be identified as being from specific church but there should be intimation that he or she is speaking as representative of the church the church may not support the activity in any way thus leader may not make campaignrelated statements in the churchs publications at its events or in manner that uses its assets this is true even if the leader pays the costs of the publication or event

of its records and activities raise concerns under the first amendments free exercise clause which states that congress shall make law prohibiting the free exercise of religion due to this issue irc 7611 provides special rules for church tax inquiries and examinations these rules apply when the irs looks into whether church has engaged in campaign activity in order for the irs to begin such an inquiry an appropriate highlevel treasury official must reasonably believe on the basis of written facts and circumstances that the church may longer qualify for 501c3 status17 the irs must then provide written notice to the church that includes an explanation of the inquirys general subject matter and the concerns that gave rise to it among other things if the churchs response does not sufficiently address the irss concerns and the agency decides to proceed to an examination of the churchs records and religious activities the irs must provide second written notice to the church this notice must include copy of the inquiry notice description of the records and activities the irs seeks to examine an offer for conference to discuss and resolve concerns and copies of irs documents collected or prepared for the examination that are subject to disclosure under the freedom of information act and tax laws in general the inquiry and examination must be completed within two years after the examination notice was sent the appropriate irs counsel must approve any revocation of 501c3 status notice of deficiency or tax assessment and determine that the 7611 requirements were met the irs is limited on further inquiries and examinations occurring within fiveyear period 16 see id 17 while the statute and regulations define appropriate highlevel treasury official in terms of highlevel irs regional officers those positions are obsolete after changes made to the agencys structure by the irs restructuring and reform act of 1998 pl 105206 currently the director of exempt

prohibition violates the free exercise and free speech rights of churches18 the supreme court has not addressed this issue19 but two us courts of appeals have upheld the prohibition against first amendment challenges in 1972 the tenth circuit court of appeals examined the issue in christian echoes national ministry inc v united states 20 the irs had revoked nonchurch religious organizations 501c3 status for violating the lobbying and campaign activity restrictions one issue was whether the restrictions violated the organizations first amendment rights the district court held they were unconstitutional reasoning that the first amendment did not allow the government to examine the organizations activities which were based on sincere religious belief to determine whether they were religious or political 21 the tenth circuit flatly rejected that reasoning because it is tantamount to the proposition that the first amendment right of free exercise of religion ipso facto assures restraints limitations and in effect protects those exercising the right to do so unfettered 22 the court said such analysis would compell it to hold that congress is constitutionally restrained from withholding the privilege of tax exemption whenever it enacts legislation relating to nonprofit religious organization23 instead the tenth circuit held the lobbying and campaign activity limitations did not violate the first amendment the court stated that the free exercise clause is restrained by the limitations only to the extent of denying tax exem pt status and then only in keeping with an overwhelming and compelling governmental interest that of guarantying that the wall separating church and state remain high and firm24 stating the maxim that tax exemption is privilege matter of grace rather than right the court also found that the limitations did not violate the organizations free speech rights reasoning that the organization was free to choose whether it would limit its activities in exchange for the benefits of taxexempt status 25 the court ended by explaining that the congressional purposes evidenced by the 1934 and 1954 amendments are clearly constitutionally justified in keeping with the separation and neutrality principles particularly applicable in this case and more succinctly the principle that government shall not subsidize directly or indirectly those organi zations whose substantial activities are directed toward the accomplishment of legislative goals or the election or defeat of particular candidates 26 18 us c onst amend i congress shall make law prohibiting the free exercise of religion or abridging the freedom of speech 19 the court has held that the 501c3 lobbying limitation does not violate an organizations free speech rights see regan v taxation with representation of washington 461 us 540 54546 1983 reasoning that congress has merely refused to pay for the lobbying out of public moneys and again rejecting the notion that first amendment rights are somehow not fully realized unless they are subsidized by the state i nternal citations omitted 20 470 f2d 849 10th cir 1972 21 see id at 856 22 id 23 id 24 id at 857 25 id

ministries v rossotti27 that the revocation of churchs taxexempt status for campaign intervention did not violate its free exercise and free speech rights in 1992 four days before the presidential election the church placed advertisements in usa today and the washington times advocating against thencandidate bill clinton and soliciting taxdeductible donations the irs revoked the churchs 501c3 status after the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the irs28 the church appealed alleging the revocation violated its rights under the first amendment and the religious freedom restoration act rfra among other things29 the dc circuit court of appeals found that the church had failed to show as required under law that its right to freely exercise its religion had been substantially burdened30 according to the court the revocations only burden on the church was less money for its religious activities and such burden was not constitutionally significant 31 also rejecting the churchs claim that it was substantially burdened because it had other means to communicate its opinions about candidates the court explained that it was constitutionally sufficient that the church could set up related 501c4 social welfare organization that could then establish political action committee pac32 the court brushed aside the fact that the church could not give the tax deductible contributions it received to the pac reasoning that the supreme court has consistently held that absent invidious discrimination congress has not violated an organizations first amendment rights by declining to subsidize its first amendment activities 33 the court also rejected the churchs claim that the irs had committed viewpoint discrimination thus violating its free speech rights the court reasoned that the campaign prohibition was viewpoint neutral because all 501c3 organizations were subject to it regardless of candidate party or viewpoint 34 27 211 f3d 137 dc cir 2000 28

constitutionality of fecas prohibition on corporate treasury funds being spent for electioneering communications more recently however the court in wisconsin right to life inc v fec wrtl ii46 found that this prohibition was unconstitutional as applied to ads that wisconsin right to life inc sought to run while not expressly overruling its decision in mcconnell v fec which upheld the provision against first amendment facial challenge the court limited the laws application specifically it ruled that advertisements that may reasonably be interpreted as something other than as an appeal to vote for or against specific candidate are not the functional equivalent of constitutionally protected express advocacy and therefore cannot be regulated

about the prohibition and 2 fasttrack procedure to review allegations of campaign activity with sa feguards to ensure the 7611 requirements are met the irs first used the expedited review procedure in 2004 where 132 cases 63 of which involved churches were selected for review 47 twentytwo of the cases including 16 church cases were determined not to merit examination of the remaining 110 cases 47 involved churches as of march 30 2007 the irs has closed 46 of the church cases in four of them the irs determined that the church did not violate the campaign prohibition in the other 42 cases the irs issued written advisory this meant th irs determined the church had engaged in campaign activity but did not impose penalty because there were mitigating factors48 impermissible activity included the distribution of church bulletins and inserts supporting or opposing candidates church officials supporting or opposing candidates during services or church functions candidates being allowed to use church facilities and distribution of biased voter guides and candidate ratings while the 2004 initiative was proceeding reports in various media outlets raised the question of whether the irs had

church to tell guest speakers about its policies and to be careful when posting information referring to candidates on its website in response the church sent letters to the irs and the treasury inspector general for tax administration raising concerns about how the inquiry was conducted58 these included whether the 7611 reasonable belief standard was met whether the irs unlawfully shared the

repeal the political campaign prohib ition in irc 501c3 but not invalidate or limit any provision in feca although the bill would affect all 501c3 organizations61 the following discussion is limited to its impact on churches if hr 2275 were enacted into law it appears churches would be able to engage in all types of campaign activity without jeopardizing their taxexempt status it appears the sole tax code restriction on the amount of such activity would be that it could not be churchs primary activity 62 churches would continue to be subject to campaign finance laws churches and their managers would still be subject to tax on the churchs political expenditures under existing irc 4955 for the church this tax is equal to 10 of the expenditures which is increased to 100 if the church does not take timely actions to recover the expenditures and establish policies preventing future ones managers are taxed at reduced rate thus while the bill would allow churches to engage in campaign activity without risking their taxexempt status so long as it was not their primary activity the 4955 tax could provide disincentive to engage in activities involving taxable expenditures another effect of the bill would be that churches could establish 527 separate segregated funds to conduct electionrelated activities for the 501c organizations permitted to engage in electioneering eg 501c4 social welfare organizations 501c5 labor unions and 501c6 trade associations these funds are lawful way to avoid the tax otherwise imposed by irc 527 for making certain political expenditures 63 churches may not establish such funds under current law because it would be an indirect way to get around the 501c3 campaign prohibition 64 while it appears the bill would allow churches to set up these funds they could still be subject to tax on amounts transferred to the funds the bill would not change existing reporting requirements churches unlike most taxexempt organizations are not required to file an annual information return form 990 with the irs other taxexempt organizations including those permitted to engage in campaign activity must generally file the form 990 however the information regarding political activity is cursory these reporting requirements can be contrasted with those imposed on taxexempt 527 political 61 legislation in prior congresses would have permitted church but not other 501c3 organizations to engage in some amount of campaign activity for more information see crs report rl32973 churches and campaign activity analysis of the houses of worship free speech
