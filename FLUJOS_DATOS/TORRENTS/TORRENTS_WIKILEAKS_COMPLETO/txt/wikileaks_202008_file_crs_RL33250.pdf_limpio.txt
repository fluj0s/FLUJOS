international population planning based on principles of volunteerism and informed choice that gives participants access to information on all methods of birth control this policy has generated contentious debate for over two decades resulting in frequent clarification and modification of us international family planning programs given the divisive nature of this debate us funding of these programs will likely remain point of contention during the 111 th congress in 1984 controversy arose over us population aid policy when the reagan administration introduced restrictions that became known as the mexico city policy the mexico city policy denies us funds to foreign nongovernmental organizations ngos that perform or promote abortion as method of family planningeven if the activities are undertaken with nonus funds presidents reagan and george hw bush also banned grants to the population fund unfpa due to evidence of coercive family planning practices in china citing violations of the kempkasten amendment which bans us assistance to organizations that support or participate in the management of coercive family planning programs president clinton resumed unfpa funding and reversed the mexico city policy in 1993 president george w bush however reapplied the mexico city restrictions following state department investigation of family planning pr ograms in china the bush administration also suspended us contributions to unfpa in 2002 the suspension of us contributions to unfpa has continued through fy2008 on december 26 2007 the president signed into law hr 2764 the

the international planned parenthood federation ippf began providing money to developing countries to control high population growth rates in 1966 when global population growth rates were reaching an historic annual high of 21 the united nations began to include population technical assistance in its international development aid programs population assistance grew rapidly over the next lfdozen years with the united states other developed countries and international organizations such as the world bank all beginning to contribute funds with passage of the foreign assistance act of 1961 congress first authorized research on international family planning and population issues and in 1965 the us agency for international development usaid launched series of population and reproductive health programs in 1968 congress specifically funded family planning aid activities and usaid began to purchase contraceptives for distribution through its programs in the developing world the first international population conference was held in 1974 followed by the second in mexico city in 1984 and the third in cairo in 1994 1 the attention and funding given to international family planning programs are credit ed with helping to decrease population growth in developing countries from about 17 per year average between 1980 and 2002 to projected annual average of 12 between 2002 and 2015 fertility rates have fallen in developing nations from 41 children per woman in 1980 to 30 in 2005 if china is excluded from this calculation however the decline in fertility rates is less dramatic at 35 children in 2005 nevertheless while global population growth has slowed the worlds population reached 6 billion in 1999 65 billion in 2005 and is expected to rise to 93 billion by 2050 with most of the growth occurring in developing nations in 1960 70 of the worlds p opulation lived in developing countries and in 2005 the level had grown to 81 these countries now account for 99 of worldwide population growth 2 g22g145g142g561g18g152g153g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561g21g157g138g157g146g156g157g146g140g156g561g6g142g139g138g157g142g561 population statistics alone are only part of larger story for the past thirty years and more countries have heatedly debated what the statistics mean proponents of active family planning programs have held that high fertility rates and rapid population growth are serious impediments to countrys development according to this school of thought people are consumers and poor country can increase its standard of living and raise its per capita income while wrestling with the problems of trying to feed and care for rapidly expanding population thus poor and developing countries should invest in family planning programs as part of their economic development process 1 the conferences were coordinated by the united nations more information is available at httpwwwunorgesa devagendapopulationhtml 2 population reference bureau prb frequently asked

hold that there is little or correlation between rapid population growth and countrys economic development some argue that increased numbers of people provide added productive capacity therefore they say high population growth rates actually can contribute to countrys ability to increase its standard of living proponents of this view argue that at the very least current economies of scale and global trading patterns have too many empirical variables and uncertainties to establish direct correlation between population growth and economic development

including the united states changed their views at the 1974 international population conference the united states and other donor countries asserted that high fertility rates were an impediment to economic developmenta point that was then rejected by developing countries in keeping with this view in 1977 the carter administration proposed legislative language later enacted in sec 104d of the foreign assistance act of 1961 that sought to link popu lation growth and traditional development assistance programs on the grounds that high population growth rate could have negative effect on other development objectives decade later at the second international conference on population in mexico city in 1984 some participants reversed their positions many developing countries had become convinced of the urgent need to manage population growth while us officials asserted that population growth was not necessarily negative force in economic development but was instead neutral phenomenon at mexico city reagan administration officials emphasized the need for developing countries to adopt sound economic policies that stressed open markets and an active private sector nearly decade later the clinton administration changed the us position on family planning programs by lifting restrictive us provisions announced at the mexico city conference at the 1994 international conference on population and development in cairo us officials emphasized support for family planning and reproductive health services improving the status of women and providing safe access to abortion g22g155g142g151g141g156g561g146g151g561g18g152g153g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561g20g142g156g142g138g155g140g145g561 since the 1994 cairo conference groups supporting strategies to limit rapid population growth have supported broader agenda of initiatives that include the promotion of gender equality increasing adolescent education on sexuality and reproductive health and ensuring the universal right of health care including reproductive health although endorsed at the july 1999 meeting of 179 nations to assess progress of the cairo population conference recommendations the issues of child education and government responsibilities for ensuring access to safe abortions in countries where the practice is legal were particularly controversial some governments opposed the broadening of the cairo mandate and some including argentina nicaragua and the vatican filed reservations to the recommendations reached by consensus

decline in birthrates in several of the largest developing nations including india brazil and egypt3 some demographers conclude that global population projections for this century may need to be reduced by as much as one billion people report dated december 9 2003world population 2300 projects as medium scenario that world population will peak in 2075 at 92 billion and then as fertility rates in all countries reach below replacement levels decline over the next 100 years to 83 billion the report projects that if fertility rates return to replacement levels world population would begin to rise reaching 9 billion by 2300 otherwise the number of people would remain at around 83 billion although there are differences of opinion as to why fertility rates are fallingand whether the trend is universal throughout the developing worlda few demographers argue that the change has less to do with government family planning policies and foreign aid and more to do with expanded womens rights in these countries women are choosing to have fewer children they argue others also contend that with improved health conditions and lowered infant mortality rates parents are deciding to have fewer babies because they are more confident that their children will survive

reproductive health care programs in developing countries became major issue at the 1994 cairo population conference participating nations agreed that foreign aid donors would provide onethird or 57 billion of the annual costs of such services that were estimated to grow to about 17 billion in 2000 july 1999 conference assessing implementation of the 1994 cairo strategy however found that industrialized countries had fallen far short of the financing goal providing only about 19 billion per year it also noted that donor allocations still fall far below the targets set at cairo 4 more recent analysis suggests different trend noting that donor nations contributed 23 billion in 2002 the largest amount ever similarly unfpa announced in 2008 that the number of donors to its program had increased from 166 in 2004 to 182 in 2007 the amount promised from donors reached record of 4571 million in 20075

approach to its family planning programs increasingly integrating it with other interventions regarding maternal and child health the enhancement of the status of women and hiv prevention6 in addition to differences of opinion over how population growth affects economic development in developing countries family planning assistance has become source of substantial controversy among us policymakers on two other issues 1 the use of federal funds to perform or promote abortions abroad and how to deal with evidence of coercion in some foreign national family planning programs especially in china and 2 setting appropriate and effective funding levels for family planning assistance g3g139g152g155g157g146g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g5g152g142g155g140g146g152g151g561 arguably the most bitter controversies in us family planning policy have erupted over abortionin particular the degree to which abortions and coercive programs occur in other countries family planning programs the extent to which us funds should be granted to or withheld from such countries and organizations that administer these programs and the effect that withholding us funds might have on global population growth and family planning services in developing nations these issues essentially stem from the contentious domestic debate over us abortion policy that has continued since the supreme courts 1973 roe v wade decision holding that the constitution protects womans decision whether to terminate her pregnancy in every congress since 1973 abortion opponents have introduced constitutional amendments or legislation that would prohibit abortions as an alternative abortion critics have also persuaded congress to attach numerous provisions to annual appropriation measures banning the use of federal funds for performing abortions much of this debate has focused on domestic spending bills especially restrictions on abortions under the medicaid program in the laborhealth and human services appropriation legislation nevertheless the controversy spilled over into us foreign aid policy almost immediately when congress approved an amendment to the foreign assistance act of 1961 in late 1973 section 104f the act prohibits the use of foreign development assistance to 1 pay for the performance of abortions or involuntary sterilizations 2 to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions or 3 to coerce or provide persons with any financial incentive to undergo sterilizations since 1981 congress has enacted nearly identical restrictions in annual foreign operations appropriation bills for the past 25 years both congressional actions and administration directives have restricted us population assistance in various ways including those set out in the foreign assistance act of 1961 and more recent executive regulations and appropriation provisions prohibiting indirect support for coercive family planning specifically in china and abortion activities related to the work of international and foreign ngos two issues in particular which were initiated in 1984 the mexico city policy involving funding for foreign nongovernmental organizations and restrictions on funding for the population fund unfpa because of its activities in chinahave remained controversial and continue as prominent features in the population assistance debate 6 for further

terminating usaid support for any foreign orga nizations but not national governments that were involved in voluntary abortion activities even if such activities were undertaken with non us funds us officials presented the revised policy at the 2nd international conference on population in mexico city in 1984 thereafter it become known as the mexico city policy during the george hw bush administration efforts were made in congress to overturn the mexico city policy and rely on existing congressional restrictions in the foreign assistance act of 1961 banning direct us funding of abortions and coerced sterilizations provisions adopted by the house andor senate that would have reversed the policy however were removed from legislation under threat of presidential veto critics charge that the mexico city policy is violation of free speech and the rights of women to choose they contend that the policy undermines maternal health care services offered in developing nations and may actually contribute to the rise in the number of abortions performed including some that are unsafe and illegal they further emphasize that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of the restrictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for usaid funding opponents also believe that the conditions of the mexico city policy undermine relations between the us government and foreign ngos and multilateral groups creating situation in which the united states challenges their right to determine how to sp end their own money and imposes socalled gag order on their ability to promote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations the latter these critics note would be unconstitutional if applied to american groups working in the united states

quality voluntary family planning services9 as was the case during the 1980s and early 1990s when the mexico city policy was in place foreign ngos and international organizations as condition for receipt of us funds would need to certify that they would not perform or actively promote abortions as method of family planning in other countries president bush in announcing the policy change noted that american taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or to advocate or actively promote abortion supporters of the certification requirement argue that even though permanent law bans usaid funds from being used to perf orm or promote abortions money is fungible organizations receiving americantaxpayer funding can use usaid resources for legal activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws and regulations the certification process they contend stops the fungibility loophole

million of previously appropriated funds to unfpa14 nevertheless on july 22 2002 secretary of state powell to whom the president had delegated the decision announced that unfpa was in violation of kempkasten and ineligible for us funding the state departments analysis of the secretarys determination found that even though unfpa did not knowingly support or participate in coercive practice that alone would not preclude the application of kempkasten15 instead finding that the recipient of us fundsin this case unfpasimply supports or participates in such program whether knowingly or unknowingly would trigger the restriction the assessment team found that the chinese government imposed fines and penalties on families social compensation fees that have children exceeding the number approved by the government the department further noted that unfpa had funded computers and dataprocessing equipment that had helped strengthen the management of the chinese state family planni ng commission beyond the legitimate uses of these and other items financed by unfpa such equipment facilitated in the view of the state department chinas ability to impose social compensation fees or perform coercive abortions the state department analysis concluded that unfpa s involvement in chinas family planning program allows the chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coercive abortion on september 17 2005 the state department stated that the united states had been urging unfpa and china to modify the organizations program in manner that would permit us support to resume but that key changes had occurred that would allow resumption of us funding under the conditions of the kempkasten provision subsequently on october 18 of that year usaid notified congress that

critics of the administrations decision opposed it for number of reasons including the loss of 34 million an amount that represented about 9 of unfpa income in 2001 they argued that access to voluntary family planning programs by persons in around 140 countries would be reduced undermining the health of women and children increasing unwanted pregnancies and increasing the likelihood of higher numbers of abortions still other critics were concerned about the possible application of the administrations interpretation of kempkasten for other international organizations operating in china and to which the us contributesfor example unicef who and the development program

china both because of chinas wellknown population growth problem and because of widespread publicity given to reports of coercion in its family planning programs chinas population increased from 500 million in 1950 to 1008 billion according to the 1982 censusan average annual growth rate of 2 or doubling of the population every 36 years although the 2 rate is not particularly large by developing country standards many consider lower rate crucial to chinas economic development prospects given the countrys already huge population size chinese authorities came to view control of po pulation growth not simply as an important priority but as necessity for the nations survival in an attempt to reach 1 annual population growth rate chinese authorities in 1979 instituted policy of allowing only one child per couple providing monetary bonuses and other benefits as incentives to comply women with one living child who became pregnant second time were said to be subjected to rigorous pressure to end the pregnancy and undergo sterilization couples who actually had second child faced heavy fines employment demotions and other penalties chinese leaders have admitted that coerced abortions and involuntary sterilizations occur but insist that those involved are acting outside the law and are punished particularly through the ad ministrative procedure law enacted in october 1990 chinese authorities have termed female infanticide an intolerable crime that must be punished by law other press reports suggest that the chinese state family planning commission sfpc has softened some of its previous harsh tactics to limit population growth number of counties have ended the system of permits for pregnancy and quotas for the number of children that can be born annually when it launched in january 1998 new 20 million fiveyear program in china unfpa announced that sfpc officials had agreed to drop birth targets in the 32 counties where activities would be focused and in may 1999 the city of beijing ended an eightyear policy that women had to be at least 24 years old to bear child and lifted the requirement for couples to obtain certificate before having child on september 1 2002 china adopted the population and family planning law the countrys first formal law on this subject the law which requires couples who have an unapproved child to pay social compensation fee and extends preferential treatment to couples who abide by the birth limits is intended to standardize the implementation of the governments birth limitation policies the state department country report s on human rights practices for 2006 dated march 2007 however found that enforcement of the law varied by location

planning practices in china remains controversial matter the state departments most recent human rights report covering 2006 concluded that chinas birth planning policies retained harshly coercive elements in law and practice the laws restrict the rights of families to choose the number of children they have and the period of time between births the penalties for violating the laws are strict leaving some women little choice but to abort pregnancies those wh violated the child limit policy by having an unapproved child or helping another do so faced disciplinary measures such as job loss or demotion and other administrative punishments including in some cases the destruction of property in the case of families that already had two children one parent was often pressured to undergo sterilization 17 chinese officials acknowledge past instances of forced abortion and involuntary sterilizations but say this is longer the case and characterize the social compensation fees as not coercive but disincentive or necessary form of economic restraint18 recent attention has focused on reports documenting campaign by local family planning officials around the city of linyi in shandong province to force couples with two children to undergo sterilizations or to demand women pregnant with third child have an abortion local activists are pursuing classaction lawsuit against the government the groups leader chen guangcheng was placed under house arrest and subsequently sentenced to four years and three months in prison19 in midseptember 2005 chinas national population and family planning commission acknowledged that illegal coercive practices had occurred and that responsible officials had been dismissed and that some had been detained20 following the may 2002 state department investigation of chinese policies senior department officials began series of discussions with china regarding its birth planning law arthur dewey assistant secretary of state for population refugees and migration told the house international relations committee on december 14 2004 that in six rounds of talks with chinese officials there had been encouraging movement in chinas approach to population policy and the reduction of coercive practices 21 nevertheless assistant secretary dewey said that the social compensation fee policy set out in chinas national law on population and birth planning is harsh and effective enforcement tool that is used to force women to have an abortion and is therefore regarded as coercive policy while negotiations have resulted in

consider new fiveyear 20062010 27 million unfpa program in china state department press release on june 24 again acknowledged that china had made some progress in its approach to population issues but argued that beijings birth limitation policy continues to contain several coercive elements including the social maintenance fee for unplanned births and regulations that limit choices by women other than to undergo an abortion at the june 22 meeting chinas deputy ambassador zhang yishan argued that due to the size of chinas population it had to maintain strong family planning program and that without the policies of the last 30 years chinas population would have grown by 300 million additional people he countered that by law family planning workers are not permitted to utilize coercive measures in their work the unfpa executive board approved the new fiveyear program for china on january 30 2006 prior to the signing us deputy representative to the united nations ambassador alejandro wolff expressed disappointment that substantive changes had been made to the draft plan that had been reviewed in mid2005 he argued that unfpa assistance provided facto united nations seal of approval to chinese abhorrent practices he further asserted that the new country program document for china was incorrect in its claim that china was committed to implementing the cairo population conference

several other state department determinations related to the july 2002 decision regarding unfpa on august 6 2003 for example the state department decided that it would fund 1 million hivaids program

international is britishbased reproductive health organization that at the time was major implementing partner of unfpa in china the state department while not making legal determination under the kempkasten amendment felt that an action not to fund marie stopes international would be an approach most consistent with us policy on august 11 however the consortium declined to accept the 1 million grant due to the exclusion of marie stopes international in another decision the administration notified the global health council in april 2004 that the us government would not provide funding for
