congress received through the crs web98905 f november 4 1998 the encryption debate intelligence aspects keith g tidball and richard best jr specialist in national defense foreign affairs and national defense division summary the 106th congress is expected to resume an ongoing debate on restricting the export of sophisticated computer encryption systems in the 105th congress strong support for removing encryption export restrictions and allowing us software firms to compete in the world marketplace was balanced by concern that widespread availability of such system s could undercut important w enforcement and intelligence interests encryption legislation passed in the 105th congress the clinton administration relaxed some restrictions on encryption sales based on existing export legislation but opposes the complete lifting of restrictions out of concern that use of highly sophisticated encryption might hinder law enforcement and intelligence collection efforts the views of law enforcem ent agencies have been forcefully set forth by fbi director louis freeh but less has been said about the implications for the collection of foreign intelligence especially by the national security agency nsa which is responsible for acquiring inform ation from foreign communications although such concerns are necessarily shrouded in s ecrecy they are likely to have an important influence in the ongoing congressional bate this report will not be updated background encryption and decryption are methods of us ing cryptography the science of writing and reading messages in code to safeguard the confidentiality of data and communications message that is encrypted is electronically scrambledtranslated by computer according to an equation or algorithm into unreadable text that can only be understood by someone who posse sses the key to unscramble it or decrypt it simple encryption systems can be broken by brute forceusing computers to try every possible combination messages encrypted by the st ronger systems now becoming available can be broken only after many years of computer time or if there is access to the key to better protect their information busin esses and consumers want the stronger computer encryption products that have beco available in recent years encryption software producers also want the opportun ity to sell stronger encryption products

provisions in effect freeh has urged tighter restrictions on the encryption industry even as industry leaders were pressing for relaxation of current regulations freehs views have not however been adopted by the clinton administrationof any encryption product in the united stat but pursuant to statutes that govern exports in general successive administrations have placed limits on the sales of strong encryption products abroad recognizing that some sophisticated encryption products are available from foreign firms or are downloadable from the internet the clinton administration has sought to accommodateat least to some extentthe demands of the software industry that export re strictions be lifted or at l east modified executive order 13026 of november 15 1996 permits exports of strong encryption systems if producers create and maintain key recovery agents essentially spare keys that can be made available to duly authorized government entities in ptember 1998 the administration announced an intention to per mit the sales of strong encryp tion products after onetime review to financial institutions insurance companies and to the health and medical sector in some 45 nations1 many in congress advocate legislation th at would remove export regulations with narrow exceptions and allow us firms to take advantage of worldwide demands for encryption products at the same time law enforcement fficials are concerned that stronger encryption may serve to protect the communications of those engaged in illegal activity federal state and local author ities conduct pproximately 1200 courtordered criminal wiretaps each year2 but law enforcement specialists are faced with growing difficulties in gathering information protected by sophisticated encryption investigators have discovered encrypted communications in minimum of 500 and possibly up to 1000 criminal cases over the past few years and the number of criminal cases is growing at an estimated annual rate of 50100 percent3 according to louis freeh director of the federal bureau of investigation fbi law enforcement remains in unanimous agreement that the widespread use of r obust nonrecoverable encr yption will ultimately devastate our ability to fight crime and terrorism uncrackable encryption allows and will continue to allow with increasing regularity drug lords terrorists and even violent gangs to communicate about their criminal in tentions with impun ity and to maintain electronically stored evidence of the crimes impervious to lawful search and seizure4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98905crs3 5 see

civil libertarian s support the removal of export controls and strongly oppose facilitating government access to private communications any key recovery process they note is only so reliabl as the custodians of the keys further they argue that on balance strong encryption serves law enforcement by deterring or preventing such abuses as credit card theft and hostile efforts to tamper with databases it is also pointed out that in some foreign countries humanrights advocates must shield their communications from hostile governments which might be able to obtain key recovery documentation if it exists the role of the nati onal security agency more widespread use of s ophisticated encryption system s outside the united states would also have significant implications for national defense and intelligence policymaking and operations in general law enforcement agencies gather and analyze information to support efforts to prosecute illegal activities foreign intelligence agencies gather and analyze information to support na tional security policymaking diplomacy and military operations extensive overlap exists between the efforts of law enforcement and foreign intelligence agencies

of american foreign and defense policy it is also significant factor in us efforts to protect its citizens and soldiers against terro rism the proliferati on of weapons of mass destruction narcotics traffick ing international crime and other threats to our nations security9 nsa officials have been involved in th preparation of the administrations initiatives on encryption providing technical advice and serving as public spokesmen in testimony prepared for the house national security committee in july 1997 nsas deputy director william p crowell argued th at the administrations goal was to create an international framework in which the use of strong encryption will grow specifically he advocated requirement for key recovery capabilities ie keys to encryption systems would be held by third partie s such keys would logically be desired by any company concerned about emergency or backup access to its data they would according to the administrations position be available to law enforcem ent agencies with proper authorization and potentially to intelligence agencies crowell acknowledged the widespread availability of encryption systems from foreign companies or downloadable from the internet but argued that legitimate consumers will seek out the infrastructure support that us firms can best provide fe w companies would trust an encryption system downloaded from the internet although fbi director freeh has had hi gher public profile nsa officials have made clear to congress their serious cern about loosening export restrictions on sophisticated encryption systems crowe ll testified to the house national security committee that the immediate decontrol of st rong encryption products would make our signals intelligence mission much more difficult and ultimately result in the loss of intelligence this would greatly complicate our exploitation of foreign targets including military targets10 nsa officials are undoubtedly c oncerned that widespread use of strong encryption will frustrate their ability to provide sigint regarding foreign entities including terrorist groups operating internationally nsa offici als anticipate that american encryption software backed by an extensive infrastruct ure when marketed is likely to become standard for international commercial communications if arrangements for legal accesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98905crs5 11the

legislative proposals although the strength of encryption products sold and used in the us is not regulated pursuant to the international emergency economic po wers act and other legislation11 strict limits are imposed on the types of encryption that can be exported legislative proposals have been introduced th at would preempt export current regulations for encryption systems and allow the us software industry to market their products worldwide hr 695 introduced by representative goodlatte on february 12 1997 became the focus of interest in the house it woul d prohibit requirements th at exported encryption systems include capabilities to permit recovery by third parties as well as eliminate export controls on generally available commercial encryption except for military enduses or to identified individuals or organizations in specific foreign countries hr 695 with over 245 cosponsors was strongly backed by the software industry it was approved by the judiciary international relations and commerce committees with only minor amendments and had support by some in the house leadership it nonetheless elicited str ong opposition not only from law enforcement officials but also from defense and intelligence agencies subsequent to briefings by nsa and other agencies the national security and intelligence committees amended hr 695 in september 1997 to impose by stat ute restrictions on encrypti on exports that the original bill was designed to eliminate the national security committee concluded that unrestricted export of capabilities that make it more difficult for the united states to comprehend the plans and activities of hostile military forces could significantly degrade the technological advantage presently held by us combat forces12 the committee proposed an amendment to the legislation that would give the president statutory authority to determine the maximum vel of encryption products th at could be exported without license with exceptions to be made with the concurrence of the secretary of defense arguing that the original version of h r 695 left our intelligence and intelligence related capabilities at considerable risk13 the intelligence

opposed by the software industry and was not sc heduled for floor consideration s 2067 introduced by senator ashcroft on ma 12 1998 would remove encryption export restrictions and establis h national

enhance the security of communications without addre ssing the export of encryption systems was passed by the house on september 16 1997 but the senate did not take action on it senate majority leader trent lott strongly advocated modernizing export controls of encryption 15 and in june 1998 house speaker newt gingrich indicated that he would personally chair task force to design plan to ease encryption restrictions16 the 105th congress adjourned however without floor action on encryption bills although the clinton administration has placed emphasis on establishing dialogue between affected agencies and the encryption industry and s further liberalized export regulations in september 1998 agreement is expected to be achieved in the near future as one industry spokesman noted both sides on th outer edges of the debate have enough votes to cancel each othe r outin congress and even in the administration17 conclusion the governments need for signals intelligence is significant factor in the encryption debate but it is one that cannot for security reasons be fully analyzed in public discourse nsa officials have repeatedly stressed the dangers of widespread use of strong encryption systems by foreign entities they have argued in particular that hr 695 would directly threaten national secur ity although some both in the executive branch and congress are inclined to suppor t the position of the software industry it appears that any consensus will to so extent accommodate nsas concerns
