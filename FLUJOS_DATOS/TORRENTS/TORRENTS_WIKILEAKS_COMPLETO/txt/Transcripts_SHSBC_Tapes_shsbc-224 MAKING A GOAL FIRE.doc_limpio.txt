making goal fire lecture given on 4 october 1962 okay this iswhats the date the 4th of october ad 12 saint hill special briefing course lecture number two okay pursuant to what i was just telling you few minutes ago we had little bit of trouble recently in california poor chuck was feeling rather sad so we chased him into the hco for check and sure enoughwe slam yeap he slams on and the oppterm is someone who wont duplicate and ava slams on scientology and ron the dynamic is people with cause and the item is someone willing to wipe out victims now you see audience oooh yes all right well thats nothing particularly discreditable its all within the realm of salvage you see it must be well within the realm of salvage with julia sitting on top of it because they alreadythey already got the dynamics and items theyre just within few inches of goal see thats easy to do and down in johannesburg well have that situation well under control but undoubtedly there was somebody rock slamming down there madly and they let the organization go down and down and down and down and all of sudden i found out quite by accident that they were facing almost immediate wipeout financially because the saint hillers that were there there were only twowere doing all outside private pcs for themselves and were doing none for the hgc so clearing was taking place and there was just little bit of staff clearing going on and clearing was being relegated for the chosen few so were having to remedy this situation right now there are heads flying and it was very upsetting it made late for supper and i couldnt give the children their movie but im afraid thats all the damage it will do when youre sitting with fistful of answers you dont worry much because you can straighten things out but it looked grim there for little while man it looked grim boy i walked in there this afternoon and you should have seen my desk it was stacked high somebody has been very busy sending telegrams to practically everybody in the world to send telegrams to see protesting any action i was taking to set the organization back together again and my action was simply to put the saint hill graduates in the hgc and start clearing people for the organization not privately just to salvage the organization and this is the action being protested there it is not very survival activity huh ve fix ve fix ve fix but life can get trying and the breakdown at that particular point was auditor in the vicinity was alert to this sec check bulletin and nobody had suddenly walked in and started putting people on the meter and say all right consider committing overts against hasi joburg you know and they would have picked up two or three slammers in key positions and that would have been that auditors dont realize that they live by the meter and that their problems are solved by the meter and their problems arent solved any other way there was member on our staff in there this afternoon was telling about solving problems but said hed left his meter home well now how could he leave his meter home that seems adventurous because he has callers all the time and some of those callers are all arc broke the proper action is not to sit there and smooth something out but this staff member is learning and advancing and im very proud of him because he did some auditing on the person not argue with him but he should have had meter because i know there was another withhold see you have every right to put people on meter dont get driven off of meter and as far as arguments are concerned theres sense in having arguments i told that adventure i had in washington well they all work out like that well whats the idea of talking to somebody for five hours trying to argue into them because look i can tell you by experience youll never argue them into anything you cannot argue them into anything except auditing theyll accept that bang you ever try to educate pe over the top of his aberrations well why argue with pc now i dont mean to give anybody any black eyes because all were trying to do is keep the show on the road and keep things together and keep things rolling and we will because mostly right is on our side were not trying anything horrible to anybody you only start breaking down when right is longer on your side when you are longer companion of truth and that is when your light starts to dim and alteris sets in and there goes the gpm and it gets bigger and it gets bigger and it gets bigger and there you are and its not always true on all planets that i come along at the opportune moment so ill give you little piece of advice for the future live with truth and thy light will always shine bright now the subject i should be talking to you about is listing and goals finding and all that sort of thing but the thing im going to talk to you about right now is how to make goals fire and that is the subject of this lecture whatever preamble it had how to make goal fire how to find the goal thats the goal thats the goal when is goal is goal is goal subject of this lecture goal is goal when it fires well how do you get goal to fire by finding it and by grooming it up and with good auditing there is nothing as sacred to pc as the arrow lodged in his heart that is jewel beyond price it must be handled with maximum of sacredity you just make comment on some pcs goal sometime and itll take the auditor half an hour to clean it off its peculiarly vulnerable to invalidation suppression and other buttons now i had big problem up to the demonstration you saw last night and that was that some pcs are more suppressive than others and there are some people whose goals are very very hard to fire and i thought it was special button and its not its special action we got the buttons what we need is special action and what you saw last night on the tv demonstration of october the 3rd was routine goals prepcheck on an item and on goal that was routine and i went off the tv demonstration turned around to another pc audited the other pc about an hour and half an hour and thirtyfive minutes and made goal fire with the same action as i had used on tv so thats that because both these pcs have been worrying about not being able to make the goal fire its obvious it was goal but i couldnt make it fire i was looking for special buttons it wasnt case of special buttons it was case of special action and that special action is this goals prepcheck and i wish to recommend to you highly this goals prepcheck now i will tell you how you do goals prepcheck you find out when the goal you are prepchecking was found and you go month earlier let us say it was found on the 2nd of september 1961 obviously it only needs august in the auditing command so you dont quibble about dates its the month before it was found even if it was the 1st of september you use august you understand theres not any point in putting it earlier you just want to get before it with the month because somebody might have been fooling around with it for several days you see before it was actually found or it might have been ticked it might have been written down on list it might have been this it might have been that see so you just try to scoop it in then your actual action that you use on something like this is to put the date of the month before it was found in as whole date its just the month you see and you say since that month on the goal whatever the goal is has anything been the seventeen now eighteen prepcheck buttons of october 1st ad 12 3ga listing by tiger buttons 114 new lines for listing and its the one on the bottom of the page of that bulletin these buttons are as follows suppress invalidate be careful of suggest things to withhold from protest about hide from reveal things to make mistake about assert things to change or alter damage withdraw from create destroy agree with ignore and counterbutton that last one made you look up counterbuttonwhats the counterbutton its the button you put on the counter of course all right now to this you could very easily add decided and you would have ayou would have very complete area for prepchecking lf you were to add that as line button itd have to bewould decide or something like that would have to be in there see be decide who or what would decide you know to be something or otherwhatever the goal is who or what would decide to catch catfish see the counterbutton is the opposite button to the goal and you get this from the pc the pcs goal is to sniff and youve got to get the counter button whats the counterbutton well youre not going to get it anyplace but off the pc so you ask the pc what would be the opposite to his goal and he says not breathe of course well you never would have dreamed up that it was not breathe but of course it is so your counterbutton is not breathe its justbe that silly dont you see you run it you say since august on the goal to know has anything not been breathed makes sense to him get the idea supposing his goal was to fly you say all right whats opposite to fly you know whats the other side of to fly and he says to flop so your counterbutton on this prepcheck begins then it starts in just goes on down the lineand finally gets to the last one as the counter button since august on the goal to know has anything flopped itll make beaucoup sense thatll be very sensible to him see got the idea thats the counterbutton because for sure that would be the greatest suppression on his goal now supposing his goal or supposing her goal or something like that was to be lawyer whats the counterbutton to be lawyer well the pc could tell you the counterbutton is to be illegal maybe this is what the pc says see so your counterbutton would read in the prepcheck question since august on the goal to be lawyer has anything been illegal and they will tell you well yes there were illegalities on the contracture of the goals on session number soandso that i had with my auditor and actually he failed to live up to the contract because at end of session why goal soandso had not been attained and therefore that was an illegal session and youd be surprised thisll make big sensemakes big sense to the pc see everyone who has goal has countergoal of some kind or another but you just dontyou dont try to assess this thing you just ask them what it is and youve got the counterbutton supposing the goal was to be sane whats the counterbutton well of course its to be insane the pc says or to be crazy since august on the goal to be sane has anything been crazy you see got the idea and they tell you oh yes as matter of fact the most psychotic actions ever heard of took place on the partthe night of soandso and so andso when i tried to tell my friend over the telephone that and my god you never got this off as suppress you never got it off as an invalidate you didnt get it off anywhere you never heard of this phone call before and there it is staring you in the face now the way you run this prepcheck is elementary my dear watson you saw run two last night one on an item one on goal i think you thought that was pretty easy auditing didnt you think that was pretty easy to do well actually it was it was very easy on the auditor you just cleaned it as though each question was rudiment fast checkjust fast check rudiment you watch this thing and you say since august on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed and you say that didnt read thank you very much and you go to the next one since august on the goal to catch catfish has anything been invalidated and you get read and you say all right that read what was that pc says oh that was soandso and you say all right and youre watching the meter see always on the meter not your prepcheck style of looking at the pc asking it and then reasking it on the meter nothing involved its just fast check see and you say since august on the goal to catch catfish has anything been invalidated and you clean that and you go to the next one and you go to the next one just in this sequence here you can add decide if you want and you go right on through down the line include the counterbutton toward the end and read the goal see this is not tiger drilling tiger drilling is working back and forth this is more of prepcheck or fast check action see probably technically it should be called fast check its goals fast check but it would be too misleading if you called it that now well call it prepcheck so you come on down to the end and you say the goal to catch catfish to catch catfish to catch catfish now actually all the time without nerving up the pc you have been watching the behavior of that goal because every time you said it you could see it you see and you will see as you run one of these thingsif you dont clean cleans and miss reads everything applies to this that applies to rudimentsyou get right on down to the end of this thing and you will notice that its read is improving if its the right goal and you start right in at the beginning and you run suppress again and you run invalidate and you run the whole sequence all the way over again and you test the goal and then you go back to the beginning and you clean them all the way over again lf that goal isnt firing by that timephooey now that is an action which can be undertaken at the beginning of listing session if goal is not firing well you understand that yet action will make it fire because if you try to tiger drill it on the pc forever and hard the pc gets nervy because you havent any finite end the pc sits in for the long haul the pcs perfectly willing to do this with this goal because its sort of long haul hes going over these things and you tell the pc why youre doing it and he knows it isnt going to be tested until you get clear down to the end so hes not nervy about it thats too far away to make him nervous he goes on down to it and by the time he gets down to the end hes forgotten why you were doing it and hell come back to the beginning of this thing and so forth now pr give you the next little knowhow on this im going to tell you some more about goals here in minutehow to find goals and what they are all about but i wanted to tell you this polishing goals because its quite an important piece of knowhow this doesnt sound like much of discovery because it sounds like much of what youve been doing but i want to point out to you it isnt quite what youve been doing all right now heres the next little piece of knowhow you get down to the end of the thing and you run the counterbutton and you come back to the beginning and you say on thesince august on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed and the pc says oh my god why are you going into that you went through it once well now look look the reason the pc sort of blows up at that point is because they consider the answers on suppress they now have to have been missed withholds throughout the prepcheck even though they didnt know about them and so you dont put in your random rudiment you tiger drill the button the pc objects to and anytime the pc objects to your going over button you tiger drill that button you got it audience yes mmhm so they answered suppress like lamb on the second run through they answer invalidate like lamb on the second run through they answer be careful of and suggest oh why are you going into this hehhehhehheh heh so you say on suggest has anything been suppressed on suggest has anything been invalidated you treat it just like goal you could actually ordinary tiger drill it you could say suggestitll fire therefore it fired so you go over into the righthand buttons on suggest has anything been invalidated on suggest has anything been suggested see wrack it back and forth left and righthand button pow powpowpowpowpow its fast drill see just ordinary tiger drill pow powpowpowpow its clean now you test it again you say suggestdoesnt fire it doesnt read you say fine thank you very much dont go into lot of preparation dont get french cooks approach to auditing they have to have out the pastry and they have to have the rabbit and they have to have this and they have to have watercress and they have to have the knives stacked up in exactly diminishing order on the board you see before they do anything you know and this drives the pc nuts you know what im saying you know you dont go through lot of ramifications about this thing its just youso the pc saysyou say all right since aug 9 99 hes been going along like lambyou say since august on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suggested yeow yeow yeow yeow yeow yeow yeow yeow you say thank you thank you very much now on suggest has anything been suggestedor suppressed or whatever it is the things going to fire dont you see get what im talking about audience mmhm do you know how bad this button invalidation and suppression and so forth can get pc today in hasi londonand some of you are going to laugh those that have been listed on linesrefused to run the 114 new lines for listing beyond line twelve said it was impossible you couldnt do it and it was good and you couldnt do anything about it and the auditor went almost went up in smoke why that pc must have every tiger drill button all smoked up so you do the same action with this see lf they gettheir tiger drill buttons are all haywire youre not going to be able to do thing the only reason they object to tiger drill buttons is when the button itself has got missed withholds on it so you just straighten up the button dont pull missed withholds you pull the missed withhold but you pull them with the tiger drill see see how you do that so that ought to keep you out of more trouble than anything you ever heard of so you start down the line so forth the pc says oh i cant answer this line i mean this line is absolutely impossible who or what would catch catfish i can answer things like that but who or what would catching catfish suppress you cant do anything like that you cant suppress fish its already under suppressure your answer to that is simply smile and pat on the back and you say on suppress has anything been suppressed get the idea you can just ordinary tiger drill it you can even go in as elementally as saying suppressfired on suppress has anything been invalidated see bang bang bang bang bang bang you get the answers that have been missed and away it goes you got the idea see you could do it on lines you could do it on the prepcheck or anything else and youll find as time goes on the tiger drill buttons will become mushy and invalidated and upset around people use them kidding around and that sort of thing youll find out one of them will go out this way you see you have to know how to put them back together again well you can put them back together again in minute because you can put them back together with the rest of them now some pc says i cant stand tiger drilling because it wipes out all my goals tiger drilling it fired has anything been invalidated and it isnt an invalidative action to do that because youll always find one sitting there now they can act of course arc broken if they have missed withholds in the session so you always want to put in your random rudiment now and then when you do this sort of thing got it theres the crux of this situation you can thank your stars that just before the congress party in washington dc i came out of my room at 1827 19th street northwest washington 9 dc and saw somebody crying in the hall and they were very upset and i was on my way to the party and should have been getting dressed and reg of course he was already dressed and he was waiting there impatiently but i knew my responsibilities you see and i dragged this person into my room and i think i did have pair of pants on but i was more formally dressed than that and i sat this character down and this character had been telling everybody everyplace that she had been pdhed so with blinding flash of inspiration i took the words pain and the word drug and the word hypnotism and i just tiger drilled them and this poor character after i got all the charge off of those she still said but if i admit that i havent been pdhed then everything ive done to people thinking i had been pdhed would be an overt so i said if you have been pdhed have you committed any overts if you havent been pdhed have you committed any overts if you have been pdhed have you committed any overts and forced her to the final conclusion which sort ofit wasnt evaluative it was processingbut she finallyshe finally had to conclude that if she was or was not pdhed she had committed overts and she felt much better after that all right but that was athat was lucky break because i was suddenly faced with having to do something rapidly in minimal time and still get to the party and so forth and so i spent i dont knowwhat how much was it thirtyfive fortyfive minutes something like that and had all of thoseall of those buttons all of those words tiger drilled see and i suddenly sat back afterwards halfway to the partyreg had been waiting rather impatiently for some timei suddenly cognited when i was about halfway to the party hey you can tiger drill any word you can tiger drill tiger drill you can tiger drill any button in fact you can tiger drill almost anything and its darn fast auditing and almost any level of ease can do it provided the words mean something and virginia told that shed been auditing somebody and shed been tiger drilling this girl but the girl was aboutoh i dont knowmust have been twelve or thirteen or fourteen or seventeen or nineteen but didnt have too much education and didnt know what suppress meant and didnt know what invalidate meant so virginia would make her go to the dictionary and look it up and then ran it and was gettingwas being successful lf you can imagine such thing well the situation here is that tiger drilling is very useful and you should know how to do it now there are two types of tiger drilling theres tiger drilling to cancel out goals list until you get to the goal and thats just ordinary tiger drilling and you wind up those you say to catch catfish it fired ticked little bitso you say on this goal has anything been invalidated and that didnt read so you say on this goal has anything been suggested and that didnt read and you say on this goal has mistake been made and thatsthat read so you clean that off and so forth and you say the goal again and it fires again one way or the other and you have to conclude then that one of the buttons you just went over has now just been invalidated or something of the sort so you take pass over them and then you take off your suppress buttonyou cant find any action on that and it isnt firingyou cant find any action on the suppress button so thats it thats itthat isnt the goal see all goals have certain amount of charge in them and the thing has to be charged up somewhat to have an invalidation register it isnt the pc who isyou see who is making all that read see its the charge on the goal that makes invalidate and so forth read now i give you this as little test take phony goal like to sing songs see it isnt the pcs goal and theres charge on it you say to sing songs all right were going towere going to take this goal to sing songs the pc at once thinks well hell that isnt my goal you read to sing songs and you get reaction you read to sing songs has anything been suppressed you get action you say to sing songs has anything on this goal been protested see what happened well for the goal to read you had to have charge the subject has to be charged in order to read you should learn that about an emeter pcs dont just make everything read you got that the read comes from the bank youll appreciate that more when you see free needle and the pc is cussing and swearing like mad and the needle just goes on floating all right so naturally you strike goal and you give it an ordinary tiger drill just coming down the list and this goal is to mend pants to mend pantsits got tick on it you say on this goal has anything been invalidated the pc yeah i saw it on the list before you came to it read it upside down and i saw it on the list and i thought gee that couldnt be my goal because it sort of amused you know to mend pantsthats to use artificial respiration i thought and you get that off of course it had little tiny bit of charge in it see so you sayto even fire that way it had little bit of charge in it so you say then all right to mend pants or you can say almost either to mend pants or has anything been invalidated dont you see because if its still got an invalidation on it then to mend pants is going to read again dont you see you understand that so its almost up to the auditor whether he doublecleans everything he gets or reads the goal again he saves little time sometimes when he just reads the goal again you understand that about tiger drilling well anyhow so he reads to mend pants and it doesnt read and on the goal to mend pants has anything been suppressed and not pants havent been suppressed so thats the end of that see nothing reads its gone well theres sense in doing anything more than an ordinary tiger drill with this thing all right now lets get to different situation entirely we say to catch catfish and it goes ticksame tick as you saw before on this goal has anything been invalidatedtick you clean it on this goal has anything been invalidatedno tick you say to catch catfishtick on this goal has anything been suggested you clean that to catch catfishtick on this goal has anything been suggested thats clean on this goal has mistake been madetick you clean that all right to catch catfish tick on this goal has anything been invalidated now youll run into this sometimes when the goal is charged and the pc knows it isnt his goal and wishes to god he never put it on the list you somesometimes it takes you twelve fifteen commands to clean one of those confounded things up he unfortunately puts on the list to never have anything more to do with tweetie candies hes thinking all this time my god this cant be my goal see and you have to keep cleaning that off as invalidation and you do you better clean it off man you clean it up maybe youre twelve or fifteen commands deep you see well thats still by ordinary tiger drill because its obviously what the source of it is well lets say at the end of about twelve commands youre still doing this kind of thing to catch catfish on this goal has anything been suppressedtick what was the suppression soandso and soandso all right good to catch catfishno read you say aaah on this goal has anything been suppressedtick well look youre now in for the only zone where you use big tiger you shift your gears at this point because ordinary tiger is going to take you long time so you just shift into big tiger on this thing anything that you consider big tiger is at the moment it is but its at least three buttons on the left and three buttons on the right and any other button that seems to apply dont you see you say now youre not going to leave this thing until careful of is clean see big tiger could be distinguished as multiple buttons and youre not going to leave the goal until both suppress and careful of are clean youre going to make sure careful of is clean before you leave the goal suppress is clean before you leave the goal in other words this thing is firing hard enough to warrant some attention so you just shift into this little bit upper gear you make sure now that you get this thing tiger drilled well it fires and it doesnt fire and it doesnt do this and it doesnt do that and maybe youre going to go about half an hour or so on this confounded goal to get the thing cleaned up and get out of there well youll get there much faster if youre doing big tiger rather than ordinary tiger thats leaving too many things by the boards you understand you could almostyouve almost got all the buttons theres probably more buttons here than should be in big tiger dont you see but you could use just those buttons at the bottom of the october 1st bulletin and you wouldnt go astray you can clean this thing and youll get charge of it off and youll wipe it up and itll come back in and youll get it out and itll come back in well youd better use quite few buttons to clean it up but theyre all played back and forth youre going to leave this thingwas to catch catfishdidnt read on this goal has anything been suppresseddidnt read on this goal is there anything youve been careful off didnt read you say well all right well leave it get the idea now its perfectly safe if you wonder why read the goal againitll probably be all right you understand the use of this so you shift from an ordinary tiger drill to more potent drill and itll speed up the length of time it takes to clean up some of these rough tough goals that go above few commands you see just shift your gears because theres more of chance that is the goal and therefore you want to give it the treatment you want to give it special treatment otherwise you can sweep these goals off at one every ten seconds you know theyre going off of that list at mad rate you say to mend pantsno read on this goal has anything been suppressed you see to be cowboy on this goal has anything been suppressed see nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing tick on this goal has anything been invalidated tells you you know to be cowgirlno read on this goal has anything been suppressed out of it you can get rid of lot of goals and then all of sudden you hit to catch catfish you know and it goes see they look so innocent at first and you tie into them and they go like mad well you just shift into big tiger thing looks like its full of beans and so forth give it the business otherwise youre liable to clean it up carelessly and leave the pcs goal behind you so thats prevention from leaving the pcs goal behind you now i will tell you few minor things little heart to heart talk by the way the treatment of an old goal or the prepcheck of goal ensues after you have found the goal by big tiger see you know this goal was staying in so you shifted into big tiger and you drilled it and it fires and it doesnt fire and so forth your next logical action for that goal is the prepcheck which i described at the beginning of the lecture not endless big tiger you understand you finally got this goal so you can say to catch catfishfire to catch catfishtick to catch catfishno tick to catch catfishtick see you finally got it so its saying that on this goal has anything been invalidated on this goal has anything been suggested on this goal is there anythingany mistake been made nothing nothing firing pin is firing to catch catfishtick oh manmust be you see youve drilled it for half an hour or so but it drives the pc out through the roof to have endless tiger drilling pcs dont like endless tiger drilling best thing to do is to shift then over to prepcheck but thats when youve decided that its pretty probable that thats the goal its pretty probable that that things the goal it sure stayed with the pc the pc sure is interested in it gave the pc some somatics and so forth ah well this looks interesting now lets go over into the prepcheck so there are three degrees of treatment of the goal ordinary tiger drill big tiger and goals prepcheck such as i just described to you see those are the ordinarythats routine on goal now ill let you in on some of the facts of life these facts of life have been troubling you pc has goal found in upper south amboy auditor somehow or another cant be identified nothing can be identified but the pc floats into your vicinity and this goal has been found on the pc youve already been auditing the pc four days before this fact was suddenly revealed that they had goals assessment in upper south amboy and the goal found was to wrap around the flagpole and spit now you think that is very silly goal and so forth well it doesnt matter what you think of the goal this is one of the goals found on the pc this is something found on the pc it doesnt matter what it is how silly you think it is or how unlikely or how likely or anything else the likeliness of the goal has very little to do with it with this simple proviso that on some of these goals such as second dynamic goals which have been misassessed you have to work harder than you ordinarily would otherwise you just know that if second dynamic goal has been found on this pc of which they would normally be ashamed that the thing is probably just reading on failed to reveal and my experience with those seeto go to bed with eight girls at once or something you knowmy experience with these things is theres simply failed to reveal is the only thing thats making them read even those fall under this same heading your first action with this pcnow were talking about finding or proving out old goals or finding new goals or what do you do at the end of dynamic assessment see this is actually all mentioned in the bulletin of october 1stwhat im talking to you about here right now your first action on this is to corral 1 every goal found on the pc and 2 every goal that went out hard you make list of those goals in chronological order against the time found not the goals occurrence on the track that you couldnt find you make your goals found in the order of their finding or their order of their giving the pc trouble pc suddenly remembers that they tiger drilled on goal for nine and half hours called to prove things nine and half hours and it finally went out see all right it was never announced as the pcs goal see nothing like that you put it down at the chronological order of its having been found now you just take those goals right from the beginning scratch and you dont tiger drill themyou dont tiger drill themyou just prepcheck every one of them just like ive given you in the beginning of this lecture and if one is still firing when youve run through the first prepcheck list you go through it second time and if its still firing the second time you better find out somebody goofed somebodys bypassed the goal because the probability is that in cases that have been assessed that is what happens the test is this if every now and then goal goes out hard on pc the probability is the pcs goal has been found and abandoned you get that little rule we have this pcand weve got one right here every third goal found on this pc goes out you practically have to shoot her down with cannon barrage its to mend pants they go down the list they get four goals below the last one that was tough and now they start tiger drilling to mend pants and it goes on and it goes on and it goes on and it goes on and it goes on and finally the auditor just gets all worn out because its takingit takes two sessions to get rid of every fifth goal on this pc now that is sign that the pcs goalive learned this just for you that the pcs goal has been found and discarded that is sign of that another sign of it is the pc was very arc breaky while finding chronologically listed goals three four five six seven and eight they havent had smooth sessions the very probable thing is that it was goal one or goal two you got that but very often they smooth out and are perfectly happy and they tell you they will surrender the goal and youve made them cheerful about it all very often thats their mood but every fifth or sixth goal they stop you by requiring the next three or four hours of auditing to drill this goal outthe next goal you get down the line its to keep store here we go see at the end of an hour we will be prepchecking and then for the next thr hours we will be trying to do something with this goal to keep store and it finally disappears and we go down the list four more goals and we have another goal which is to take trip to the moon and that takes three and half hours to grind out got the idea thats symptom of the goal is already behind you the goal has been found the goal is behind you get that just take that as an indicator its not necessarily always true i dont think because i havent seen it on too many cases but every case i have seen that on or have heard of that on the goal has already been behind theyve already gone by the goal now you take this chronological list what do you do with this chronological list what do you do with it thats interesting because it has to have prepcheck each one of them have to have prepcheck youll find out normal prepcheck on these things will take you from one to two hours and youre better off doing prepcheck than you are doing tiger drill because itll take you less time to do prepcheck than it will to do tiger drill and its more likely that the goal will finish up firing having done this goals prepcheck see and you go over those things very carefully you go over them very carefully now were talking about somebody of course that youve found sitting on the front doorstep and theyve turned up and so forth now you could go over these goals each one of them with prepcheck and find the right goal you could do this but do you know it might be more economical in terms of auditing to do dynamic assessment on this pc do you see that because if you didnt find the goal there it is and the goal has been unburdened and so its more likely to fire you see and if youre good at doing dynamic assessments at all it might be more economical to do dynamic assessment on the pc and carry the pc through to the bitter end because youll probably have to do one anyhow because they best understand their goals when dynamic assessment has been done but im not making this mandatory dont you see because that would be silly heres the way you testand this is just testheres the way you test an old goal the pc says well there was goal found on in upper south amboy at one time by somebody there and so forth and the goal was to catch catfish and so you say well all right and they want you to take look at it well of course youd be wasting lot of your time and their time and everybody elses time if you didnt take just cursory look at the thing just give it an instructors check see but that it didnt fire means nothing got it even though somebody has checked this thing out with an instructors checkyou know just done that instructors check and gotten all the buttons rattled off and called the goals three times youd be surprised how often that will discover that the old goal was the right goal see well go ahead and list ityou know checked out but if it didnt fire that doesnt mean anything you dont discard that old goal just because it didnt fire now youre going to audit this pc for blood see youre going to get right in there and pitch youre this pcs auditor you had better collect all of these goals that went out hard and goals that have been found on the pc and you better make chronological list of these things see and if this pc has had quite bit of auditing on the subject of and going up the track ways youre going to find lot of pcs like this maybe this pcs even had dynamic assessment something like that see you had better go over this list and prepcheck each one of those goals in rotation and see if you cant get one to show now what if some other auditor has already prepchecked them all well your action is to prepcheck them all now it isnt because the other auditor was good but because these things dive out and recharge and do various things it isnt that goals can change or anything of that sort its just that this is an interesting fact about it is i have seen goals missed and then somebodyand last night was straightening out four or five eases that have been in the soup around here for some time and i went down and the answers were there plain to see they were contained in it but in actual fact one of these eases had several earlierfound goals now let tell you something pc will do we cant get the old goal to fire were not going to waste lot of time trying to get the old goal to fire lets go ahead and do dynamic assessment on the pc youre not going to spend fifteen hours trying to get an old goal to fire you understand lets do some auditing this comes under the rule of giving the pc auditing see lets say you checked it out it didnt seem to check out instructors type check seeit didnt seem to check out dont spend too much time on it because you may be grooming up this dead horse and polishing his shadhis saddle you know and wiping out his mouth and combing his mane and so forth but hes still dead man matter what you do to him hes still dead your proper action in this particular thing is you check out the goal the pc had you check outor goals maybe theres one or twoand you dont get anything out of them lets do dynamic assessment now thats going to make this pc shine because by doing dynamic assessment you tend to pull them out of the horrors and arc breaks of having had their goal knocked in the head you give them new hope that old goal will now fire better because they can understand itthey never did beforeit didnt have any item to fire against dont you see but you watch for thiswatch your pc like hawk when pc do list 1 when pc do list 6 or list 5 or any other list after dynamic assessment and if pc slide old goal into list anyplace you take old goal and you prepcheck and you find that pcs goal got into an arc break with pc the other day the pc oh this was quitequite rowrrowr see i did an assessment as to which list i do things like this once in whileread off all the goal list lines and see which one assesses and do that one first you know thats only if list 6 didnt have the goal on it list 6 didnt contain the goal so i assessed found out it was list 2 naah pcpc say list 5 didnt say list 5 on that little assessment of course that isnt very valid assessment pc didnt say list 5 i get assessment for list 2 i try do list 2 pc arc break pe very upset you think this is something intuitive something deeply buried something that was hidden from even the pc like hell it was then it materializes that pc has slipped old goal has been passed over onto list 5 thats why pc want list 5 done you get that thetan may look agreeable but they never quit so i just took the old goal and tried to make it live again and it did and that was that all right so that should be very fascinating to you that there are symptoms and signs here pc keeps trying to shove this goal at you you may think well this persons just trying to sell this goal thats right but now i tell you what makes some goals stay out and this you must remember because theres double prepcheck on all likely goals there is another prepcheck on likely goals that is in selfauditing on the goal to catch catfish has anything been listing buttons thats the prepcheck that has to precede your date prepcheck because any goal thats been around for let us say six months five months two months something like that and the pc has known that goalthey selfaudit it now they may not just sit down and try to run all the buttons on it and run full prepcheck but they do that too but they might selfaudit it this way and this is selfauditing although they dont recognize it as such theyre sitting out at car stop theyre looking at all the people go by you see and the goal is to catch catfish and they say wonder im always so bored sitting at car stop because naturally there are catfish around here there are just people oh that explains then this is busy busy busy you know that explains then why ive always been bored at sitting around car stops and why ive always thought there should be ponds on all properties busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy well then i mustnt think about that anymore because im liable to suppress itnow id better not suppress the goal now there you are well there ive probably suppressed it i wonder what the suppression was busy busy busy busy busy and sometimes they just simply knuckleheadedly sit down and try to prepcheck their own goal and you cant ever tell it is because the pc has tremendous interest on this channelin fact on other channel and they cant keep their attention off of it and so you get this in self auditing now if you want to keep polishing goals up you can add other things in listing on the goal to catch catfish is another heading in other words youve got several headings and approaches but the two that are absolutely vital to trim up an old goal and get the thing going well is in selfauditing on the goal ________ and the other is since________ month before goal was found has anything on the goal soandso has anything been suppressed you have to run those two prepchecks you got it now theres the essence of old goal finding and you may beat your brains outyou may spend six eight ten hours trying to get some old goal to read before you turn around and start doing dynamic assessment and then you do the dynamic assessment and then the old goal comes back in and reads and you say well all i did was waste eight to ten hours of auditing and i have now got through doing this now often enough that i dont think it pays i look back on the backtrack now and its getting kind of strewn with dead horses ive had to learn what are the effective actions with regard to goal see the actualities of existence with regard to goals is the goals are tricky dynamic assessments are tricky the auditor first and foremost has to be good auditor he has to be lucky and he has to be clever but weve got ways and means of making goals read that we never had before theres excuse if you listing goal right at the beginning of listing session that is going one tick out of six callstheres sense in that you should know enough about auditing and just to do formal check is sometimes not enough you have to steer the pcs attention which after all is the action of an auditor you say when was this goal found this is before you get it prepchecked and so forth when was this goal found oh this goal was found in julyjuly of 1961 all right all right that goal was found then now what session was it found in gee you know i cant recall ohohohohohohoh right there right theretheres clue thats why this goal doesntthe principal reason why this goal doesnt read theres something wrong with that session lets go back and find that session well how do we find that session we can steer the pcs attention to it overtly and say in that session that found the goal was anything suppressed see and tiger drill it with that wording got it in other words you can do almost anything with tiger drill youre only culpable and youre only in the soup if the goal isnt reading and youre only ruining pc if you utterly bury and lose his goal so it can never be found so anything that recovers the goal is quite legal do you recognize that but ive been working for quite while here working on these drills and ive given you the result of that work in tonights lecture and it should give you very good show one of the things i must tell you is you must never never never leave goal lying around that has been found or the pc thought was their goal on and on and on and on through auditing because its like dragging buckets behind you when youre trying to go to sea supposing now you hadthe pc had six goals that were found on him or stayed in hard see and you found out it was goal number two that was the goal and you got it firing beautifully even though its little bit distractive to the pcyouve explained to the pc why youre doing thisyou should also give fast knockout to goal three goal four goal five and goal six you understand you should at least check those things out and get the principal dash and smash off of them because theyre going to hold you up the pcs going to be unable to do them well quite interesting goal halffound and butchered up which isnt the pcs goal stops the pc from having that ability it slows him down supposing the pc didnt have the goal to take the air and yet it appeared on his list seeit was on his list and somebodyit had stayed in hard and somebody tiger drilled it half out and then finally found out that it was to be an aviator that was his goal and we just utterly neglected this goal to take the air well for quite while the pc will not be enjoy going for walks youll have to get along and youll have to give it couple of cuffs and smashes and because it isnt his goaland he knows it isnt his goal because hes got his goalit goes out fairly rapidly but it should elicit some of your attention see youd say well lets get rid of these other goals so they dont hang up and hang us up see just give them box and with tiger drill and they seem to be quite flat and everythings fine just leave them got it all right youre not going to have any trouble getting goals to fire providing youre willing to take the time to do so but oneminute cleanup to make the goal tick once out of five readsthat isnt good enough and if you cant tiger drill this thing in an ordinary tiger drill at the beginning of session into reading you can always prepcheck it into reading and if you cant prepcheck it well into reading then by george youd better change the wording of your prepcheck to in selfauditing on the goal and so forth and if that goal is reading bit better then then lets move it up into the next category and say in listing on the goal ___ soandso and youve got many ways that you can handle this particular type of action depending to large extent on how the pc has handled the goal and how long the goals been found and so forth but getting goal to readgetting goal to readafter the goal has been found or getting an old goal to read adequately requires very slippy auditing in fact probably requires better auditing than finding goal in some cases the refinding of goal is sometimes much more rugged than just finding one fresh because now you have all the hurdles i find out almost uniformly that pcs know what their goal was and knew at some time in the past what their goal was and were very arc broke when they lost that goal and if you know how to put that goal back together againof course with the prepchecks and the stuff ive been giving you in this lectureyoull find out your pc is very happy about the thing and the goal will fire people do know their own goals i would never give pc goal who didnt cognite on the fact that it was his goal lot of symptoms go along with this dont you see ive revived now lot of old goals im getting to be specialist in it im getting to be more of specialist in the revivification of old goals than in the finding of new ones because people who come around to i busily work my brain to the bone you see finding the new goal see and ive just got my fingers on this new goal and weve just started to tiger drill it and boy is it going out hard when i look down the list four below it and i see the pcs old goal has been slipped back onto the list so i tiger drill out the goal that im working on and then i start working on the old goal and now that the dynamic assessment has been done it now fires like crazy this seems in the last month to have been my lot pc after pc do masterly job absolutely clever lucky everythingjust beautiful you know all set up for brandnew goal obviously goal number one on the list perfect it fits the pc utterly and then the pc says to you do you know that that first goal is the exact ending of my old goal well thats fortune well there it is theres lot to know about goals and their behavior this is actually the first time ive talked to you about it ill be talking to you more about it but in actual fact i have given you in this lecture the bulk if not all the things known about itthis subject thank you very much
