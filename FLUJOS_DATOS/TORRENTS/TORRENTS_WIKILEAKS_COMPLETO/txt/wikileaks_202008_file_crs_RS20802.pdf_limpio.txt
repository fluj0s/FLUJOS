industry division summary efforts to reduce tobacco consumption in the united states stimulated by the 1998 master settlement agreement msa contributed to sharp decline in the demand for usgrown tobacco the other major contri butor to the long term decline in domestic as well as foreign demand was the federa l price support program which limited supply and raised the price of us tobacco above competitive mark et levels consequently foreigngrown tobacco displaced us tobacco in both domestic and world markets because of the drop in demand farmers as ked for and received compensation and assistance from cigarette manufacturers and th federal government manufacturers in conjunction with the msa pledged 515 billion in payments to farmers to be distributed over 12 years also cong ress approved 328 million in tobacco loss payments to farmers for fy2000 340 million for fy2001 another 129 million for fy2001 and 55 million for fy20 03 in additi on losses on 1999 crop price support loan stocks amounting to 625 million were sh ifted to taxpayers finally in 2004 legislation was adopted terminating the tob acco support program but with compensation to quota owners and active producers of 96 billion paid by manufacturers this report will not be updated the tobacco price guarant ee provided by the federal support program was supposed to support and stabilize the income of growers however farmers saw an especially sharp drop in sales volume after 1997 in respons production was reduced 51 by 2004 like other farmers suffering economic hardshi p tobacco growers asked for and received assistance us tobacco production and markets based on the 2002 census of agriculture about 57 thousand farms in the united states produce tobacco they primarily are located in kentucky north carolina and neighboring states according to us depar tment of agriculture usda data crop year 2004 production was about 848 million pounds fro m 408 thousand acres 72 acres perhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20802crs2 1 data on tobacco economics are published by the economic research service in tobacco situation and outlook reports available at the tobacco briefing room 2 calculated from export and import value data in usda foreign agriculture service tobacco world markets and trade january 2004us leaf domestic use us leaf exportsfarm for yield of 2161 pounds per acre the average price is estimated at about 198 per pound for total crop value of about 1685 billion1 the utilization of us tobacco leaf by domestic cigarette ma nufacturers and export sales long have been declining economists argue that the decline in sales and the loss of market share is due to the high price nd tight supply of us tobacco caused by the federal price support program other count ries increased tobacco production and sales to traditional us markets including to us manufacturers in 2004 usmanufactured cigarettes contained about 61 of the cheaper imported tobacco additionally us leaf exports have been on declining trend for at least the past 20 years down to about 76 of world exports the disadvantage of us tobacco is illustrated by its average price during 2004 of 289 per pound declared weight leaving us ports compared to 126 for foreign tobacco entering those same ports2 the higher quality of us tobacco helped offset some of its price disadvantage but not enough to prevent the loss of market share adding to the difficulties of tobacco farmers was the declining per capita consumption of cigarettes for at least the past 30 years it is anticipated us cigarette consumption will continue to decline in future years if the antismoking elements of the 1998 master settlement ag reement are effective tobacco price support from the 1930s through 2004 tobacco farm ers benefitted from federal price support and stabilization pr ogram see crs report 95129 tobacco price support an overview of the program federal law specified guaranteed minimum price for leaf tobacco the price guarantee was achieved by controlling supply each tobacco farm was assigned marketing quota that balanced national production with domestic and export demand any tobacco that did not bring at least the guaranteed price was purchased by price stabilization cooperative with money borrowed from the usdas commodityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20802crs3 3 the ccc is financ ial institution in the usda that is authorized to borrow money from the us treasury to carry out commodity support and other farm assistance programs 4 the option of reducing the ccc list price was rejected for at least two reasons first the law also prohibited the foreign agricultural service from promoting the sale or export of tobacco in overseas markets second selling tobacco at redu ced prices in export markets that is prohibited in domestic markets raises questions of legality under international trade rulescredit corporation ccc3 the 2004 crop year support pri ce for fluecured tobacco was 1690 per pound and for burley it was 1873 by law the tobacco loan operations of the ccc were to function at net cost to taxpayers price stabiliz ation cooperatives that borrowed money from ccc earned revenue from the sale of tobacco acquired fro m farmers and this money was used to make repayments with interest if the revenue fro m tobacco sales was insufficient to cover the obligations to ccc funds were withdrawn from nonetcost assessment pool this pool of money was generated from an assessmen t on every pound of leaf tobacco marketed the assessment on 2004crop fluecured was 10 per pound and on burley it was 2 federal purchase and disposal of surplus tobacco additional assistance for burley fluecur ed and cigar binder tobacco producers was included in the fy2001 agriculture ppropriations law pl 106387 sec 844 as amended tobacco stabilizati on cooperatives were authorized to transfer ownership of 1999 crop loan inventories to the ccc without the action being charged against the netcost program and without the supplies being included in future quota calculations this meant tobacco marketing quotas would be larger in subsequent years than without the legislative action the law authorizing the ccc acquisition prohi bited the sale of this tobacco for domestic use the tobacco wa s offered for export sale at what ccc determined to be its fair market value but buyers responded4 this left the ccc with little choice but to bury the tobacco in landfills which it co mpleted in december 2003 the ccc acquired and destroyed 2214 million pounds of tobacco expenditures for this tobacco stocks disposal program including acquisition cost s interest on funds borrowed from the us treasury storage and dispos amounted to about 625 million the ccc takeover of 1999 loan stocks paralleled action taken in 1986 when 1983 crop burley loan stocks were acquired and disposed of wit hout being charged against the nonetcost program on that occasion the cost to ccc was about 376 million so while the tobacco program lived up to its mandate of net cost to taxpayers it was because congress acted to prevent sizeable downward quota adjustments and shifted the financial burden of surp lus stocks onto taxpayers instead of producers federal compensation for decreased tobacco marketing quotas tobacco marketing quotas declined as domestic and expor t demand dropped in 1999 and 2000 the quota reductions were pecially large and congress approved additional federal assistance direct payments amounted to about 1 for each pound of quota loss the fy2000 appropriation for usda pl 10678 sec 803c providedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20802crs4 another 328 million in direct quota loss payments the law directed that the funds be distributed in proportion to each farms reduction in marketing quota from 1998 to 1999 the national burley quota had decreased 29 and the fluecured quota had decreased 18 again in the agriculture risk protec tion act of 2000 pl 106224 section 204 b congress instructed that 340 million be distributed in fy2001 to tobacco farmers the statebystate distribution of this m oney was based largely on quota decreases from crop year 1999 to 2000 the national burley quot had decreased 45 and the fluecured quota had decreased 19 as directed by pl 10725 another 129 million was distributed among tobacco farmers exactly as done unde r pl 106224 before octobe r 2001 the addition of this money meant that the decline in fluec ured and burley quotas from 1997 to 2001 was compensated at the rate of 1 per pound the consolidated appropriations act fo r fy2003 pl 1087 included provision in the emergency agricultural assistance portion of the law division n title ii sec 205 directing the payment of 555 per pound of 2002 basic quota these payments were

trust the 1998 master settlement ag reement between cigarette manufacturers and states attorneys general obligated the manufactures to pay states approx imately 205 billion over 25 years in addition the agreement rest ricted marketing ac tivities and funded anti tobacco advertising an explicit goal was to reduce cigarette consumption however any reduction in cigarette consumption indirec tly would decrease use of usgrown leaf tobacco with associated adverse impacts on th financial condition of farmers and their rural communities some states designated portion of their settlement funds for farm and rural assistance as an aside and separate from the msa manufacturers committed further 515 billion for distribution over 12 years to tobacco farmers under the national tobacco grower

funds gao03262r december 3 2002 washington dc tobacco quota buyout and termination of support when congress attempted to address the economic problems of tobacco farmers it was faced with economic co mplexities that were com pounded by policy and program inconsistencies and c ontradictions in its report of january 26 2001 the commission on improving economic opportunity in co mmunities dependent on tobacco production while protecting public health commonly referred to as the tobacco commission examined these issues in detail it was the policy of the federal government to discourage consumption of cigarettes especially by oung pe ople on the grounds that they were addictive and harmful to human health yet to the extent americans reduce their consumption of tobacco products tobacco farmers were faced with shrinking market s federal public health policy worked to the disadvantage of tobacco farmers second it was federal policy for more than 60 years to balance us tobacco production with demand but at price that was substantially higher than the cost of production and also higher than the price of tobacco sold by foreign producers to th disadvantage of tob acco producers the high price of us tobacco caused it to be displ aced by less expensive foreigngrown supplies in both this country and worldwide this displacement was translated into declining marketing quotashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20802crs6 congress ultimately made dr amatic change in tobacco policy by terminating all federal price support and ma nagement of supplies afte r crop year 2004 under provisions of the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 title vi of pl 108357 compensation was to be made to both quot owners landowners and active producers farm operators from assessments on tobacco manufacturers and tobacco importers the quota owner payments were at the ra of 7 per pound of basic quota on each farm in 2002 the active producer payments were at the rate of 3 per pound on 2002 effective quota the payments totaling an estimated 96 billion would be ma in equal annual installments over 10 years beginning with the 2005 crop tobacco could be produced by any farmer in any location and in any qua ntity prices would be freely negotiated between producers and buyers and there w ould be federal income support for the farmers this legislation di d not alter the availability to tobacco growers of federally subsidized crop insurance which similarly was available to growers of most crops while tobacco manufacturers would be paying for the buyout program they also would be the direct beneficiaries of an ex pected reduction in prices for us produced leaf in addition the remaining phase ii payments of about 3 billion nded in 2004 because the buyout legislation imposed assessments on manufacturers beginning in the last quarter of calendar 2004 for more information crs report rs22046 tobacco quota buyout crs report rl31790 tobacco quota buyout proposals in the 108th
