assistant secretary of the navy john young announced that lockheed martin corp had won competition against sikorsky aircraft corp to develop the vxx presidential helicopter estimated at 61 billion th is program will replace todays 13 vh3d and eight vh60n helicopters approxima tely 16 billion has been budgeted since fy2004 to begin buying 23 he licopters initial ope rational capability is planned for 2009 the navy said the lockheed approach was chosen because it was the most likely to meet the needs on time and at lower cost among other factors some criticized the award to purchase lockheeds us101 partly because the winning team includes foreign companies from the united ki ngdom and italy sikorsky had stated it would build the vxx entirely in the united states ot hers report that sikorsky had higher performance scores1 some allege that the departme nt of defense dod awarded the contract to lockheed martins international team to reward italy and the uk for their support of the war in iraq dod denies this claimhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22103crs2 2 dod news briefing john young assistant secretary of the navy for research development and acquisition and thomas laux program

dod news briefing op citpotential issues for congress on february 1 2005 representative rosa delauro introduced hr 459 marine one made in american act on march 1 2005 sen lieberman intr oduced related bill s 486 as congress considers these bills and potentially other legislation on the vxx program several issues are likely to be raised first whether the competition was held fairly as dod asserts or whether there were procedural irregularitie s as critics contend second the possible impact the decision might have on the us defe nse industrial base third and relatedly the effect the decision could have on us trade the final issue pertains to compliance with existing buy american statutes fairness of the competition in january 28 news briefing navy officials stated that the vxx contract was awarded on best valu basis and that consistent with government rules the proposals were eval uated solely on technical past performance experience and cost factors2 some have questioned however the relative weight placed on these factors and whether the vxx needs to be procured on the time schedule dod desires urgency government officials have consistently maintained that principally owing to postseptember 11th security issues replacing the cu rrent marine one fleet is urgent it has been reported that white house officials urged dod to accelerate the vxx program proposing an initia l operational capability by 20073 some argue that by responding to this perceived urgency with an aggressive acquis ition schedule dod has pursued strategy that is unnecessarily ri sky navy assistant secretary john young commented on the risk associated with pursuing the vxx on an urgent time line the requirements of the program ar very demanding the volume of work to be completed in this program is substan tialhowever the need to improve the capability and security level provided to the president is urgent and demands that we move expeditiously4 dods director of operati onal test and evaluation re portedly disapproved of the vxx schedule calling it overly aggressive and inconsistent with fly before buy principles he reportedly found that the vxx test schedule was not executable5 the navy indicated that the lockheed streamlining proposal was selected because it was judged more likely to meet these government requirements on schedule with lesser risk and at lower costwe cant let the traditional acquisition process impede the need to meet the presidents security requirements now6 some believe however that one outcome of this schedule was to make the competition more favorable to lockheed martin and less favor able to sikorsky httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22103crs3 7 john m moran size guided copter choice hartford courant feb 9 2005 michael bruno after heated briefing

meetings with crs sept 28 2004 and feb 17 2005opponents of the contract award argue th at the vast majority of presidential helicopter flights are short eg from the white house to andrews afb or to camp david and take place in very secure airsp ace from their perspective regular combat air patrols by f16 aircraft and standard defensive counter measures should provide the president with adequate security regardless of the helicopter flow n if improvements to the presidents security are urgently needed critics ask what is being done to improve security until the vxx is fielded supporters of the navys position are likely to argue that key lesson of the terrorist attacks of september 11th is that tomorrows security challenges are difficult to predict and that the president urgently needs more capability to address scenarios outside the norm also some argue the consequences of not providing the president with improved capabilities are potentially dire such as ineffec tive crisis response or even discontinuity of government therefore they maintain that an aggressive schedule is warranted technical factors the issue of the relative weights placed on safety and cabin area features in this competition has arisen7 sikorsky officials argue that safety considerations were valued less in the competition than other factors such as cabin size8 according to press reports lockheed martins helicopter has expe rienced five class mishaps the most serious kind of aviation accident sikorskys helicopter s reportedly never experienced class mishap9 sikorskys helicopter has been faa certified more recently than the eh101 and therefore has had to comply with higher safety standards among the s92 safety features are fuel tanks external to the cabin area lockheed martin disputes claims that the us101 is less safe than the s92 unlike the s92 they say theirs is battle tested helicopter designed to military specifications further they say us101 is safer than the s92 because it has three engines rather than two in the january 28 news briefing however navy officials said they had da ta supporting the argume nt that helicopters with three engines are safer than those with two helicopter with three engines will cost more to operate than helicopter with two one source has estimated the h92 s hourly direct maintenance cost at 90000 and the eh101s at 15000010 industry sources agree that the us101 s larger cabin is an advantage over the s9211 but sikorsky supporters contend that too much weight was placed on cabin size some 60 of the technical score unfairly favoring lockheed martin they maintain the s92 met the vxx programs cabin size requirement with larger cabin than the helicopters it will repl ace considering that the amount of time that the president will spend in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22103crs4 12 dod news briefing op cit 13 dave ahearn marine one and buy american debate defense today nov 10 1004 14 the vxx contract is prestigious award by choosing helicopter that was designed and engineered by europeans sikorsky supporters argue the us navy is making vote of confidence in the us helicopter industryhelicopter is typically measured in minutes rather than hours some contend too much weight was placed on the cabin size decision criterion at the january 28 news briefing the cabin size factor was addressed j ohn young said that both cabins met the requirements so that wasnt total discriminating factor program executive officer thomas laux however said that the overall si ze of the 101 clearly was factor in terms of their capabilities12 subsequent to the january 28 press conference navy officials have denied that cabin size received any more weight in the vxx decision than other technical factors including safety us defense industrial base issues t h vxx decision may have implications for to the us industrial ba such as jobs and competitiveness jobs created or lost with in the united states the net effect of the vxx award on the number of jobs in the us helicopter industry is unclear va rious estimates put the number of new jobs created by the us101 program at approxima tely 1050 in new york and texas if sikorsky had received the vxx contract it may be that fewer new jobs would have been created in the united states because sikorskys s92 is already primarily built in the united states the eh101 upon which the us101 will be built is today primarily built in europe however sikor sky had said it planned to eliminate foreign suppliers and build the vxx entirely in the united states it is unclear how many us jobs may be affected if any due to reduced orders for the s92 following the vxx decision opponents of the us101 program say it will send offshore key aircraft design manufacture and support ac tivities and that new jobs created by the us101 will be assembly line jobs that do little to sustai n or nurture the u s industrial base13 future competitiveness one vxx issue frequently discussed is the potential for the award of this contract to influence other military helicopter competitions several new military helicopter contracts are expected to be awarded in the near term potentially up to 40 billion in value promin ent among these new programs is the air forces personnel recovery vehicle prv which will replace its hh60g combat search and rescue helicopters sikorsky and its supporters say that the vxx contract could harm the future competitiveness of the us he licopter industry they fear that the vxx will form the basis for the next generation of us medium helicopters just as h60 helicopters formed the basis for the last generation they also argue that the s92 is better positioned than lockheeds helicopter to compete internationally due in part to lower costs14 lockheed supporters dispute cla ims about negative effects the vxx award might have on the us helicopter industry in hi s january 28 briefing assistant secretary of the navy john young stated that the desi gn and performance demands of presidential transportation are fairly unique opport unity very different from other military requirements there is guarantee that the winner of the vxx helicopter

trade divisionwill win future military he licopter contracts they further argue that dods industrial capabilities report to congress found major industrial ba problems and dispute claims that the us is too dependent on foreign suppliers15 s92 supporters counter that requirements for military helicopters are fluid and it is unknown whether the vxx contract is unique since future helicopt er requirements could grow to mirror vxx requirements others argue that sikorsky is shoo in to win the prv award because after canceling the rah66 comanche helicopter dod would not risk sikorskys future by denying it the prv contract16 winner takes all contract like many other military procurements only one company was awarded contract for marine one while funding two or more contracts typically costs more than funding one in some instances increased cost has been justified to protect the industrial base some have suggested that awarding the vxx contract on shared basis between the two competitors would have helped preserve the us defense industrial base on the other hand sikorsky officials have re portedly said that they hold orders for the delivery of 59 s92 helicopters with options for another 3017 trade issues18 some suggest that the vxx decision may signal growing transatlantic industr ial cooperation and more open dod procurement policy concerning foreign suppliers only 41 of dod procur ement went to foreign contractors in 2003 on the other hand this decision could s pur some in congress to support additional restrictions on foreign defense suppliers some observers stat that if european suppliers are deemed good enough to make the presid ents helicopter then the rest of dod may be more inclined to consider foreign bids for range of military contracts doing so it could be argued may make ec onomic sense as foreign cont ractors increase the supply of contract bids presenting opportunities to keep down procurement costs and to take advantage of technology found in global market place it has been asserted that more open sourcing policy for foreign suppliers could also make foreign governments more willing to buy from us defense suppliers others suggest that the decision could fost er backlash against more open policy for defense procurement combined with th record us trade deficit in 2004 and the possible european unions lifting of its arms embargo on china some worry that the united states could become more dependent on foreign suppliers others argue that the us taxpayers who foot the bill for the st rongest military in the world should have the right to supply it still others raise cerns about the risk of losing proprietary technology by shipping sensitive blueprints ove rseas and the need to assure tight security for
