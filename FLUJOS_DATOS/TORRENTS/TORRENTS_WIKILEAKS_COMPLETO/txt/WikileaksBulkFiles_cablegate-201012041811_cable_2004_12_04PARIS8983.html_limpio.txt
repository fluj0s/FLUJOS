custody of four former detainees at guantanamo bay and charged them with terrorist conspiracy all four of the detainees remain in pretrial detention and trials are expected to begin in 2005 in october french and spanish authorities struck significant blow to eta terrorism in their arrest in france of two top eta leaders and in the seizure of significant arms and materials caches with these and number of other high profile arrests and convictions in 2004 it is clear that france continues its aggressive and effective antiterrorist policies despite robust usfrench cooperation on counterterrorism french officials continue to differ with the us on the impact of operation iraqi freedom on international terrorism with french officials suggesting that iraqs liberation has made the world less safe and increased international terrorism in 2004 four french nationals were identified as having been killed while fighting coalition and iraqi forces in iraq international activities france continues to be an active and engaged participant in the international war against terrorism on the military front its special forces participate in counterterrorist operations in afghanistan

peninsula at the political and diplomatic level france continues its engagement within the uns counterterrorism committee and the g8s counterterrorism action group france is party to all 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism in 2004 france expanded its cooperation in international judicial cooperation with the entry into force of the perben ii law france incorporated into its domestic legislation the provisions of the european arrest warrant and strengthened its already extensive judicial and police powers to combat terrorism for example the law

specialized 90person firefighting unit that would focus on combating nuclear radiological biological and chemical terrorist attacks also in may the french government simulated bomb attack on the paris metro to test the ability of emergency services to respond on terrorism financing france continues to develop the competencies and capabilities of tracfin the ministry of finances terrorism financing coordination and investigation unit tracfin has expanded the number of economic sectors it monitors within the french economy with particular emphasis on institutions nongovernmental organizations and small enterprises suspected of having ties to islamic terrorism at the level of the european union france plays an active role in the clearinghouse the unions terrorism financing coordination body france has designated as terrorist groups those that appear on the eu list of terrorist organizations as of yet it has not designated hamasaffiliated charities arguing that they have links to terrorism it also along with its eu partners has not designated lebanese hizballah as terrorist organization french authorities consistently condemn terrorist acts and have made public statements in support of terroristsupporting country on terrorism issue nevertheless france along with its eu partners retains diplomatic relations with all of the governments designated as state sponsors of terrorism with the exception of north korea in 2004 it cosponsored with the united states security council resolution 1559 which targeted syrian domination of lebanon and called for dismantlement of armed groups and militias in lebanon and extension of lebanese government control throughout lebanese territory to include areas under the facto control of hizballah domestic activities france is perhaps best known for its seasoned and aggressive counterterrorism police forces and judiciary within the ministry of interior the dst internal security service rg police intelligence dnat

services new terrorism coordination cell was created that will be based in the headquarters of the dgse frances external intelligence service and part of the ministry of defense personnel from the rg and the dst will be part of the coordination unit this new initiative adds another coordination body to an already crowded field other coordination mechanisms include uclat counterterrorism coordination unit with the ministry of interior the sgdn attached to the office of the prime minister the intelligence council and the council for internal security attached to the office of the president there is virtually legislative oversight of intelligence and security agencies terrorism investigations that may lead to criminal charges are handled by the counterterrorism section of the paris prosecutors office investigative judges who in the french system combine prosecutorial and judicial powers concentrate on islamicinternational terrorism basqueeta terrorism and terrorism linked to corsican separatist groups their mandate is extensive and includes terrorist acts on french soil and acts abroad that affect french citizens their powers are substantial and they are given wide freedom to investigate they cooperate closely with french police and security services under french law terrorism suspects may be detained for up to 96 hours before charges are filed in addition suspects can be held for up to three and half years in pretrial detention while the investigation against them continues there is general public acceptance of these measures olivier roy french terrorism expert told the associated press on december 7 that theres tradition in france of strong state and people want to have strong state8 barring the revelation of serious abuses there is little indication that french citizens would want to decrease the extensive powers given to french investigating judges police and security services french police and intelligence services within the interior ministry have extensive powers of surveillance monitoring and administrative detention these powers were enhanced with the march 9 passage of perben ii with entry into force on october 1 and include expanded detention up to four days before charges must be brought more authority for police to go undercover warrants for searches at night more leeway in granting document searches and increased authority to wiretap these expanded powers are to be used only in cases that involve investigation of organizations that imperil society8 such as the mafia drug traffickers and terrorist organizations even if government authorities are found to have misused their new powers any evidence they have found would still be accepted in court judicial and police investigations following the highprofile arrests in 2003 of german national christian ganczarski and moroccan national karim mehdi continued in 2004 ganczarski and mehdi who are suspected of ties to alqaida remain in pretrial detention in france the investigation into the activities of suspected terrorist djamel beghal concluded in late 2004 his trial as well as the trials of seven associates will begin january 3 2005 the beghal network is suspected of planning to commit number of terrorist acts including an attack on the us embassy in paris french police and judicial authorities arrested six suspected members of the moroccan islamic combatant group gicm on april 5 an investigation into their activities is ongoing the six suspects are being held in pretrial detention the gicm cell is thought to have provided logistical support to those who committed the attacks against madrid trains on march 11 french authorities also arrested five individuals in midnovember on charges of stealing one million euros from brinks delivery truck that restocked atm machines these individuals are suspected of having links with the gicm cell judicial and police investigations are also continuing in the chechen network8 loose grouping that is reported to have links with the beghal network and the frankfurt network which attempted in 2000 to attack cultural sites in strasbourg including the cathedral members of the chechen network reportedly were interested in using chemical agents to commit terrorist attacks french authorities arrested zinnedine khalid on june 14 one of the suspected members of the chechen network they also suspect that the chechen network may have links with possible asian network that included lionel dumont french citizen in custody who had lived previously in japan the trial of ten

laidouni was given 7 years while courtailler was given two years in jail along with suspended twoyear sentence following the july 27 transfer of four french citizens detained at guantanamo bay french authorities successfully argued in favor of their pretrial detention while judicial authorities are preparing cases that charge them with terrorist conspiracy these arguments have withstood multiple appeals by defense lawyers and the detainees remain in pretrial detention france has been one of the most aggressive and proactive countries in prosecuting its citizens formerly held by the us at guantanamo the french government publicly condemned acts of terrorism targeting civilians in iraq on multiple occasions in 2004 nevertheless throughout the year french government officials including president chirac continued to assert publicly that the liberation of iraq had made the world less safe and increased international terrorism these criticisms reflect broader usfrench divergences on iraq policy in general four french citizens have been identified in 2004 as killed while fighting in iraq amidst concerns that radical islamists with french citizenship were beginning to enter iraq to fight multinational and iraqi forces and commit terrorist acts in iraq the paris prosecutors office opened an investigation into possible network of islamists recruiting french citizens to fight in iraq that investigation is ongoing on october 8 an early morning bomb exploded in front of the indonesian embassy in paris one was killed although the bomb caused significant damage french authorities continue to investigate the bombing however responsibility for the investigation was transferred to the counterterrorism section of the paris prosecutors office signifying that the french government suspects terrorism as motive french and spanish authorities have jointly made significant progress in combating basque separatist groups including the eta in early october french police arrested mikel albizu iriarte and soledad iparraguirre two suspected eta leaders they also arrested at least sixteen other suspects and seized money and hundreds of pounds of explosives in 2004 the french and spanish governments have formed two joint investigative teams one focusing on alqaidarelated groups and the second focusing on basque separatist groups despite truce announced in november 2003 by the main corsican separatist movements the flnc union of combatants the island continues to experience lowlevel terrorist activities examples include the bombing of selected commercial and symbolic sites the machinegunning of local gendarmerie post in october and rocket attack against another gendarmerie post in may one was killed in these attacks most of which occurred at night according to french authorities there have been 76 explosions at police stations in corsica over the last three years french police arrested in november twelve of 14 suspected members of the clandestini corsi8 group which claimed responsibility for seven recent attacks targeting corsican residents of north african ancestry at the administrative level france continued its policy of expulsions for nonfrench citizens engaged in what the french government considered activities that promote hate in response to sermons from several muslim clerics determined to have threatened public order by calling for jihad parliament passed law in july stating that foreigner can be deported for publicly supporting acts of hatred discrimination or violence against any specific person or group of persons the highest profile expulsion in 2004 was that of muslim prayer leader abdelkader bouziane who was first expelled to algeria in april then returned to france after an administrative court suspended that ruling bouziane who had made widely publicized statements condoning wife beating was expelled second time on october 5 in addition midhat guler turkish mosque leader and accused leader of the extremist group kaplan8 was expelled on april 29 although expulsions have long been favorite tool used by french authorities in 2004 they gained more prominence interior minister villepin publicly stated he would make expulsion procedures faster and easier in june following the passage of law giving new regulatory powers to the conseil superieur daudiovisuel csa frances fccequivalent the csa began sanctions proceedings against almanar hezbollahaffiliated satellite television station and alalam satellite television station based in iran the csa accused both stations of antisemitic programming propaganda in favor of suicide bombings and the diffusion of hate the subsequent granting of limited broadcast license to almanar on november 19 was controversial and prompted prime minister raffarin to declare that almanar was incompatible with french values8 after reviewing almanar programming after it received its broadcast license the csa again petitioned the conseil detat frances highest administrative court to ban the station on december 13 the conseil detat agreed with the csa and ordered almanar off french airwaves in addition raffarin has asked the european union to weigh in on the issue of noneuropean8 media and their broadcasting of programs that are incompatible with european values concerning hate and antisemitism it is clear that for many inside and outside the government stations such as almanar and alalam pose direct threat to french values and in addition serve as rearguard action fighting the governments efforts to disseminate these values in february the french government banned satellite television station medya tv from broadcasting in france medya tv is affiliated with pkkkongra gel which is listed as terrorist organization by the european union worries over the rise of radical islam in france have prompted interior minister sarkozy followed by his successor interior minister villepin to propose number of steps to combat this threat some mentioned earlier focus on better coordination between the many french services that deal with terrorism other steps focus on the need to better integrate frances minority muslim population villepin stated december 7 that it was unacceptable that of the 1200 imams who practice in our country 75 percent are not french and onethird do not speak our language8 he proposed among other things the creation of foundation to manage money destined for muslim groups in france and offer greater transparency and oversight of overseas fundraising for muslim institutions in france according to the ministry of interior approximately 50 of 1685 muslim places of worship are considered to have ties to radical islam wolff
