housing and urban development hud to develop process for collecting data about homeless persons together with local communities hud began in 2001 to implement series of homeless management information systems hmis two categories of federal fund recipients are required to participate in hmis organizations that receive grants through the housing opportunities for persons with aids hopwa program and organizations that receive hud homeless assistance grants the hopwa program provides housing and supportive services for persons living with aids while the homeless assistance grants fund transitional and permanent housing as well as services for homeless individuals local jurisdictions called continuums of care cocstypically cities counties or combinations of bothare the entities that implement hmis homeless service providers in these cocs collect and store information about homeless individuals they serve and the information is aggregated in computer systems at the coc level hud anticipates that information about homeless individuals from cocs across the country will help it to better serve their needs hud released its third analysis of data from sample of participating hmis jurisdictionsthe third annual homeless assessment report aharin july 2008 the third ahar was the first occasion on which hud used data from an entire year to estimate the number of homeless persons the first and second ahars used three months and six months respectively the third ahar used hmis data from sample of 98 communities to derive nationallevel estimate of the number of homeless persons from october 2006 through september 2007 in addition to the ahar estimates using hmis data local cocs also conduct pointintime counts of homeless individuals on one day in january at least every two years hud has published these results as part of each ahar congress initially allocated funds for data collection regarding homeless persons in the fy2001 hud appropriations act pl 106377 and has conti nued to allocate funds in all hud spending bills from fy2002 to fy2008 local communities can then apply to hud for available funds that they may use to implement hmis community implementation of hmis increased between 2005 and 2006 according to the most recent hud progress report to congress regarding hmis 91 of local cocs were implementing hmis in 2006 meaning that they had established systems into which data are entered compared to 72 in 2005 approximately 9 of cocs had decided to implement an hmis and were in the process of planning the system compared to 20 in 2005 and 1 of cocs were not yet planning an hmis compared to 7 in 2005 this report describes the development of hmis reports on the continuing progress of hmis summarizes information released in the first second and

ascertain the number and characteristics of persons experiencing homelessness due to the transient nature of the population although attempts to count and describe homeless individuals have been made in recent decades1 beginning in the mid1990s for example the department of housing and urban development hud required its grant recipients to provide information about the homeless clients they served in addition comprehensive attempts to count homeless individuals were made in both the 1980s and 1990s first via census data and then through national collaborative survey called the national survey of homeless assistance providers and clients however systematic method for tracking homeless persons has existed until now in response to directive from congress in 1998 hud began in 2001 to develop system to track homeless individuals the processes of data collection organization and storage systems which take place at the local level have been termed homeless management information systems hmis in july 2008 hud released results of its third analysis of hmis datathe third annual homeless assessment report ahar this crs report describes the development of hmis the results of the first second and third ahars and previous attempts to count homeless individuals

homeless management information systems hmis are databases established at the local level through which homeless service providers collect organize and store information about homeless clients who receive services hud is implementing the hmis initiative through local continuums of care cocs which acquire and process data from all participating local service providers cocs are local boards formed by communitiestypically cities counties or combinations of bothmade up of representatives from nonprofit service providers advocacy groups local government and other interested organizations 2 local boards identify the needs of homeless persons in their communities and try to ensure that they receive the appropriate mix of preventative assistance emergency services transitional housing supportive services and permanent housing local homeless services providers submit requests for funding to their local coc boards which each in turn submit single consolidated applications to hud as of fy2008 there were approximately 468 cocs including those in the territories 3 two types of organizations are required to participate in hmis those that receive funding through the housing opportunities for persons with aids hopwa program and those that receive homeless assistance grants the hopwa program enacted in 1990 pl 101625 1 as defined by the mckinneyvento homeless assistance act pl 10077 homeless person is 1 an individual who lacks fixed regular and adequate nighttime residence and 2 an individual who has primary nighttime residence that isa supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations including welfare hotels congregate shelte rs and transitional housing for the mentally ill b an institution that

development of the hmis network hud began efforts to collect information about homeless clients served in the communities that receive hud homeless assistance grants beginning in the mid1990s about the time that the continuum of care system developed hud required applicants for homeless assistance grants to include in their applications information about the number of persons receiving assistance and the type of assistance they received initially this was done in narrative form however by 2003 the grant application required coc applicants to complete housing activity chart that included pointintime count of homeless individuals and families receiving services though hud did not specify when this count should take place 7 the 2003 application also asked applicants to categorize subpopulations served including the number of chronically homeless indi viduals veterans those with severe mental illnesses those with hivaids and victims of domestic violence some cocs used database systems similar to hmis to keep track of homeless individuals who were served these predecessor systems are sometimes referred to as legacy systems8 the 2005 hud pointintime count of homeless persons marked the first time that hud required all cocs to conduct count of both sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals and to do it at particular time of year hud directed cocs to conduct onenight count during the last week of january of both clients who used homeless services and those who were on the street9 hud continues to require cocs to conduct pointintime counts every two years though some cocs choose to conduct counts every year for example in 2006 61 of cocs voluntarily conducted counts10 the most recent pointintime count in which all cocs participated occurred in january 4 for more information on the hopwa program see crs report rl34318 housing for persons living with hivaids by libby perl 5 pl 10077 is codified at 42 usc 1130111435 6 for more information

congress instructed hud to count homeless persons and gather data about both their characteristics and use of homeless assistance services the fy1999 hud spending bill pl 105276 set aside up to 1 of the total appropriation for homeless assistance grants for systems to track those persons experiencing homelessness specifically congress directed hud to produce an unduplicated count of homeless persons and to collect information about homeless individuals surveyed such as age race sex disability status health status and income the types of services that homeless clients received and client outcomes such as length of stay in transitional housing success in acquiring permanent housing and employment status 11 congress concluded that this information would allow hud to better assess the quality of service programs supported with federal funds12 congress provided further direction to hud in the hud appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106377 the law made supportive housing prog ram funds available for local cocs to implement management information systems13 congress directed hud to work with local jurisdictions to develop system to collect data and to be ready to analyze the data within three years of passage of the appropriations bill14 congress also requested that hud provide congress with report on its findings containing an unduplicated count of homeless persons and descriptive profile of the population15 the fy2001 appropriations act once again allocated funds to pay for data collection this time setting aside 15 of the total appropriation for homeless assistance grants of 102 billion congress has continued to allocate funds for homeless data collection in spending bills from fy2002 to fy2008 11 see house committee on appropriations department of

nature of much of the information that homeless service providers must collect some groups that provide services to domestic violence victims raised privacy concerns to hud after its release of proposed data and tec hnical standards but prior to release of final standards in 2004 these organizations requested that information about domestic violence victims not be included in hmis 22 at the time hud acknowledged the sensitivity of certain information but concluded that cocs could collect the information in such way that would protect the identity of those in the system to this end hud included privacy and security standards in the data and technical standards that all organizations must follow however on january 5 2006 president bush signed the violence against women and department of justice reauthorization act p l 109162 which included provisions to 1 amend the mckinneyvento homeless assistance act to prevent victim service providers from disclosing personally identifying information through hmis and 2 permit disclosure of nonpersonally identifying information only after public notice and comment period on march 16 2007 hud released notice regarding hmis and the amendments to mckinneyvento made by pl 109162 23 in the notice hud confirmed that it would require disclosure of nonpersonally identifying information only after going through notice and comment period until hud does so it has instructed organizations that provide services to domestic violence victims not to input information about their clients into hmis

persons the first aspect is whether data collection system has been established at the coc level and the second is the degree to which homeless service providers within coc are participating in the system although almost all cocs have established an hmis system into which data may be entered the extent to which data are actually entered into these systems remains incomplete on average once established comprehensive hmis network is meant to improve the ability of communities to provide services to homeless persons as well as to help hud determine how best to allocate resources 24 20 ibid

communities are entering data although this goal was not accomplished by 2004 the number of cocs participating in hmis has increased in every year since 200125 between 2005 and 2006 the percentage of cocs that had implemented an hmis meaning they were actually inputting data increased from 72 to 9126 from 2005 to 2006 the percentage of cocs that had decided to implement an hmis but were still in the planning stages decreased from 20 to 9 and the percentage that were not yet planning an hmis dropped from 7 to 1 27 at the local level cocs have several options for implementing and maintaining their hmis databases not all cocs are implementing their own hmis some are collaborating to create multijurisdictional hmis with two or more cocs others are planning to make individual coc data accessible at the state level while 19 states have decided to implement statelevel hmis 28 local initiatives also differ in their methods of incorporating service providers into hmis local cocs may use one central hmis into which all service providers input client information another option is to allow service providers to use different database systems but to have technical specialists available at the coc level to merge all data into one unified system third option is to use sidebyside systems where individual service providers enter data into their own systems and also enter data into cocwide hmis g18g138g155g157g146g140g146g153g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g561g18g155g152g159g146g141g142g155g156g561g146g151g561g10g15g11g21g561 even where cocs have successfully implemented hmis coverage of homeless service providers may be incomplete hud uses the term bed coverage to describe the rate at which local service providers within coc participate in hmis the term refers to the percentage of available beds in coc that are actually accounted for in hmis if not all service providers within coc participate in hmis then bed coverage may be low issues with bed coverage may arise in cases of domestic violence shelters that are reluctant to report data due to confidentiality concerns or where service providers do not receive hud funds and are not required to participate in hmis in addition even when service providers report data to hmis they might not include all clients served which could result in another limitation on the usefulness of the data 29 hud keeps track of bed coverage rates both by the type of shelter provided such as emergency shelter transitional housing and permanent housing and by household type such as homeless individuals and homeless families from 2005 to 2006 the average number of beds across cocs that were included in hmis increased in all categories30 hud reports bed coverage as an average ratethe average of all cocs bed coverage rates 25 us department of housing and urban development report to congress sixt h progress report on huds strategy for homeless data collection reporting and analysis

persons in the country as well as to describe their characteristics although the specific methods used in the studies have varied in most researchers surveyed sample of the homeless population and used the sample to estimate the total number of homeless persons in the country the time periods covered by these counts vary some are pointintime counts that estimate the number of homeless people on single night during the year others estimate the number of persons who are homeless during longer periodsa week or span of months researchers have also used samples to estimate the total number of persons who are homeless at some point during the year 31 the hmis initiative differs from these previous efforts to count homeless people and gather information instead of sampling only certain co mmunities or counting homeless individuals on only single night cocs gather information from all homeless assistance providers regarding all homeless individuals who use their services each day of the year eventually once communities have fully implemented hmis the network of systems is expected to provide an annual unduplicated count of homeless persons from each jurisdiction counting homeless populations on the street might continue to be important however as their use of services is unknown 32 hud released its first report to congress using hmis data the annual homeless assessment report ahar in february 2007 in march 2008 hud released the second ahar and in july 2008 hud released the third ahar because hmis is not fully implemented in all jurisdictions around the country the three ahars like previous efforts to count homeless persons rely on sample of jurisdictions this section describes several efforts to estimate the number of homeless individuals over the years these include coc pointintime counts that take place every two years estimates in the three ahars using hmis data and previous estimates from the 1980s and 1990s this section 31 for an explanation of how annual

2005 and 2007 hud required all cocs to conduct point intime counts of both the sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals in their jurisdictions in 2006 61 of cocs voluntarily conducted pointintime counts although currently most cocs conduct counts without using hmis 33 eventually hud expects the hmis initiative to be part of this pointintime collection of information bout homeless individuals as hmis programs develop cocs will be able to use the systems as part of the data collection process in estimating the number of sheltered homeless people34 the reliability of coc pointintime data vary by continuum particularly in the case of estimates of unsheltered homeless individuals unsheltered individuals are those living in places not meant for human habitation such as cars abandoned buildings highway underpasses and public parks although hud has published guidance on how to conduct street counts35 and provides technical assistance to cocs the task is complicated and not all cocs are able to conduct statistically reliable surveys of those individuals who are not sheltered36 during the pointintime counts hud also asks pa rticipating cocs to collect information about homeless individuals which is referred to as subpopulation information cocs are to ask homeless individuals whether they are chronicall homeless have severe mental illnesses substance abuse disorders or hivaids are veterans have experienced domestic violence or are unaccompanied youth cocs are not always able to gather this information and even when they do according to hud the subpopulation information is less reliable than the estimates of the number of homeless individuals 37 further in the required 2005 coc count it was optional for cocs to provide information regarding unsheltered homeless subpopulations information about homeless subpopulations is available on huds website38 g344g342g342g347g561g5g152g5g561g5g152g158g151g157g156g561 in 2005 hud directed all cocs to

meant for human habitation as result the three ahars also reported data collected from cocs during their onenight counts of homeless persons in january of 2005 2006 and 2007 each of which included individuals and families who were on the street or similar location in the coming years the ahar is expected to include data from larger number of service providers cover nonresidential populations

shelter for families transitional housing for individuals and transitional housing for families could participate in the ahar 48 as result data from 64 rather than 80 sample communities were used to

estimate of homeless individuals using various means to arrive at result these included surveying persons knowledgeable about homelessness in randomly selected metropolitan areas asking service providers to estimate the number of homeless individuals in their area and assessing the results of various homelessness counts that had been conducted in local areas 72 through this process hud estimated that between 250000 and 350000 individuals were homeless at given point in time two more recent comprehensive estimates are described below
