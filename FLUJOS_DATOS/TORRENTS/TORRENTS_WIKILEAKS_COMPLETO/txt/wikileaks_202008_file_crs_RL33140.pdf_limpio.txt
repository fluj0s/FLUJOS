finance division june 20 2007 abstract conventional economic analysis suggests that the cause of the current account deﬁcit is insuﬃcient national saving because the us saving rate is too low to ﬁnance national demand for physical capital investment the united states must borrow from abroad to bridge the gap the conventional policy prescription for reducing the current account deﬁcit has been to boost the national saving rate by reducing the budget deﬁcit and encouraging higher rates of private

capital inflows because us investment rates exceed us saving rates the gap must be financed by foreign borrowing net capital inflows have grown over recent years to record 66 of gross domestic product gdp in 2006 economists have long argued that the low us saving rate which is much lower than most foreign countries is the underlying cause of the trade deficit and that policies aimed at reducing the trade deficit should focus on boosting national saving the most straightforward policy would be to reduce the budget deficit which directly increases national saving in an oftencited speech in early 2005 ben bernanke now the chairman of the federal reserve argued that the underlying cause of the trade deficit was not insufficient domestic saving but rather global saving glut he argued that there was too much saving worldwide and not enough investment demand and that the united states was the natural destination for this excess saving as result of the global saving glut the trade deficit increased interest rates remained low demand for capital and residential investment rose and the incentive to save decreased in the united states he argued that because the trade deficit was not made in the usa policy steps to reduce the budget deficit or raise private saving were unlikely to significantly reduce the trade deficit until the global saving glut ended the conventional view and the global saving glut view are not necessarily mutually exclusive to an extent the difference between the two is tautologicalthe conventional view stresses that us saving is too low relative to foreign saving and the global saving glut view stresses that foreign saving is too high relative to us saving it is important to acknowledge foreign causes for international capital movements but in doing so changes in domestic conditions should not be neglected although neither view leads to any hard conclusions about whether the trade deficit is good or bad the global saving glut implies that reducing it is largely out of american hands contrary to the global saving glut hypothesis data show that world saving is close to its lowest level in decades however low interest rates although not unusually low by historical standards suggest that worldwide investment demand is probably low as well data also show that the rise in saving in the developing world notably among oil producers and east asian countries over the past few years has gone handinhand with the significant accumulation of official foreign exchange reserves at the same time there has been decrease in government saving in the united states since the 1990s in recent years large fraction of us net capital inflows have been the result of foreign reserve accumulation by other countries rather than coming from private sources which suggests that global imbalanc are not primarily the result of decisions by private investors and that because of the fall in us government saving the trade deficit to great extent may indeed have been made in the usa this report will be updated as events warrant

trade deficit2 the current account deficit rose from 13 of gross domestic product gdp in 1997 to recordhigh 66 of gdp in 2006 by definition the current account deficit equals the foreign capital flowing into the country on net in other words american purchases of imports can exceed foreign purchases of us exports only if the united states borrows from abroad congress is concerned that trade deficit of this size may not be sustainable and could disrupt the smooth functioning of the us economy conventional economic analysis suggests that the cause of the current account deficit is insufficient national saving 3 because the us saving rate is too low to finance national demand for physical capital investment the united states must borrow from abroad to bridge the gap the conventional policy prescription for reducing the current account deficit has been to boost the national saving rate by reducing the budget deficit and encouraging higher rates of private saving in march 2005 ben bernankethen governor of the federal reserve fed system and now fed chairmanmade an oftencited speech arguing that the conventional view was wrong instead he located the principal causes of the us current account deficit outside the countrys borders in the global saving glut 4 the global saving glut view implies that conventional policy prescriptions may have little success in reducing the current account deficit whether the source of the growing trade deficit is domestic or international it could nevertheless be cause for concern the counterpart to larger us trade deficit is larger trade surpluses among certain trading partners in the april 2007 world economic outlook the international monetary fund imf notes that particular concerns for the outlook include the low probability but high cost risk of disord erly unwinding of large global imbalances5 this report compares and analyzes the conventiona l view with the global saving glut view and discusses the implications of each for the us economy g22g145g142g561g5g152g151g159g142g151g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g24g146g142g160g561 the conventional view among economists attributes the cause of the us current account deficit to the countrys low national saving rate as seen in table 1 the united states has lower national saving rate than any of the regional groupings in the world the united states saving 1 the author gratefully acknowledges research assistance provided by justin murray 2 technically the current account deficit is the sum of the trade deficit net investment income and net unilateral transfers however net investment income and net unilateral transfers are typically small compared with the trade deficit so the current account deficit and trade deficit are similar in size

calculations based on data from imf w orld economi c outlook april 200 7 i mf world economic outlook database although us investment rates are lower than the rates of other regions the disparity is smaller than for saving rates as seen in table 1 the united states was the only economy whose investment rate significantly exceeded its national saving rate in 2006 as result large foreign capital inflows which come to the country in the form of current account deficit are needed to bridge the gap although other countries have current account deficit none of the regions in table 1 has an aggregate current account deficit except the united states economic theory predicts that capital will flow to the country where it can earn the highest real rate of return although some economists are concerned by the scale of us borrowing most believe that international capital flows are generally mutually beneficial they allow the borrowing country access to more capital than domestic saving would allow and they allow the lending country to earn higher rate of return than could be earned at home if rates of return adjusted for risk 7 were higher in the united states than abroad then capital would flow into the united states and current account deficit would result rates of return might be higher in the united states than abroad for several reasons first the united states has enjoyed an increase in productivity growth since the mid1990s that has not been experienced widely abroad as result us economic growth has tended to consistently outpace growth in most other industrial countries in the past 10 years at least in the short run this productivity boom might be expected to raise us rates of return above foreign rates 6 national saving consists of household saving business saving and public saving government budget deficits reduce public saving 7 although some countries particularly developing countries offer higher rates of return than the united states they may still not attract significant international capital flows b ecause their investment opportunities are too risky to appeal to investors the united states on the other hand has often been viewed as safe haven for investors and may be able to attract capital with lower ra tes of return than other countries

supply of national saving and the demand for investment spending because saving rates are so much lower in the united states than abroad one would expect higher interest rates in the united states third demand for us investment spending is being crowded out by budget deficits that are competing for the same pool of private saving which increases interest rates8 because the budget deficit pushes up interest rates which attract fo reign capital inflows the budget deficit and trade deficit are often referred to as twin deficits9 fourth economic theory suggests that additional investment is subject to diminishing returns for example adding second machine at factory would be expected to yield less additional output than the first machine for given labor force ma ny countries have higher investment rates than the united states therefore rates of return may be lower abroad because of diminishing returns this assumption would be less applicable to developing countries because their capital stocks are so much smaller than those of industrial coun tries for example despite persistently low economic growth and low rates of return during the past decade japans investment rate was still roughly 4 percentage points of gdp higher than americas in 2006 with investment rates so high perhaps it is of little surprise that the japane would prefer to invest their remaining saving in foreign assets g22g145g142g561g9g149g152g139g138g149g561g21g138g159g146g151g144g561g9g149g158g157g561g24g146g142g160g561 although bernanke does not deny that the low us saving rate and large budget deficit contribute to the current account deficit his emphasis lies elsewhere he argues that the current account deficit is not primarily made in the usathe result of domestic conditions or policiesbut rather the result of what he calls global saving glut as table 1 illustrates the counterpart to large us trade deficits is large foreign trade surpluses particularly in east asia and among oil producers situation that is often to referred to as global imbalances bernanke argues that world saving is so abundant because foreign saving rates in the industrialized world are high and investment demand is low as result of its rapidly aging populations however to explain the change in current account balances in the past few years the relevant measure is the change in global saving the increase in global saving he argues is the result of the developing worlds shift from net borrower to net lender this has occurred he believes for several reasons first the series of financial crises in the developing world in the late 1990s eg mexico southeast asia turkey and argentina reduced the developing worlds ability to borrow as result capital that was previously flowing in the developing world needed new destination these crises also motivated developing nations to improve their fiscal position through less borrowing lower budget deficits and higher fo reign exchange reserves an accumulation of foreign exchange reserves by the central bank is form of capital outflows lending abroad and corresponds to an increase in the current account surplus accumulating foreign reserves represents form of national saving that is undertaken by the central bank rather than private 8 see crs report rl31775 do budget deficits push up interest rates and is this the relevant

building war chest to make it less vulnerable to future financial crises10 finally the rise in oil prices has caused sudden increase in income and saving because the increase in income has not immediately been spent for many developing countries that are oil producers11 between 2002 and 2005 the imf estimates that revenue that oil producers earned from oil exports increased by 437 billion and only about half of the increase was offset by higher imports whereas the other half was saved 12 some of that additional saving has been invested in us assets bernanke does not dispute that the us national saving rate has fallen in recent years and contributed to the rising current account deficit instead he argues that the global saving glut has in large part caused the decline in us saving according to bernanke the rise in foreign capital inflows pushed up us equity and other asset prices in the late 1990s making americans wealthier similarly after the stock market crash foreign capital inflows resulted in lower interest rates which in turn boosted us housing prices 13 he argues that in both cases americans responded to increased wealth by saving less and consuming more why did this global saving glut come to the united states causing the current account deficit in bernankes view conditions in the united states were ideal to attract the foreign capital14 in the 1990s the hightech boom led to productivity gains and profit growth that sustainable or not made the united states highly attractive to foreign investors furthermore the united states has deep diverse and wellgoverned capital markets that made it more attractive investment destination than other countries 15 the united states has often been viewed as safe haven for 10 gruber and kamin provide econometric evidence supporting this argument they show that including financial crisis variable in their regressions helps better explain the shift to current account surpluses in asia in recent years their results should be viewed with caution however since their model predicts large current account surplus in the united states presumably because it does not take differences in saving rates into account as they note even if their model can explain why current account surpluses have increased in east asia it cannot explain why that capital has been overwhelmingly invested in the united states joseph gruber and steven kamin explaining the global pattern of current account imbalances federal reserve board of governors international finance and discussion papers 846 november 2005 11 likewise oil consuming countries such as the united states could have r eacted to higher oil prices by reducing their saving rate which would all else equal widen their current account deficits 12 international monetary fund oil prices and global imbalances world economic outlook april 2006 chapter 2 according to the imf oil producers have mostly invested their trade surpluses in portfolio investments in recent years unlike the 1970s when they invested their trade surpluses mostly in official reserves and bank deposits study from the new york fed estimated that oil revenues to oil exporters increased by 670 billion between 2002 and 2006 and those revenues have been split about evenly between imports and foreign investments matthew higgins et recycling petrodollars current issues in economics and finance federal reserve bank of new york vol 12 9 december 2006 13 bernanke does not explain why the global saving glut did not prevent the stock market from crashing since in his view us assets were highly desirable to foreigners 14 note that bernankes views on trade deficits in which cap ital seeks out the country with the highest rate of return are identical to the conventional view the difference is that the conventional view focuses on what makes us rates of return higher whereas bernanke focuses on what makes foreign rates of return low 15 similarly caballero describes the developing world as having shortage of financial assets in which to invest relative to its high saving creating high demand for us assets that pushes up their price and drives down us interest rates he believes the global saving glut will persist until developing countries strengthen their financial systems enough to become more attractive investment destinations richard caballero on the macroeconomics of asset

points to the dollars unique role as the international reserve currency in particular many asian countries sought to limit their currencys movements against the dollar in recent years by accumulating dollardenominated foreign exchange reserves16 although the united states was the primary recipient of the worlds global saving glut in bernankes view it was not the only one he believes the global saving glut is also responsible for the deterioration in the current account balances and rise in asset prices and household wealth of france italy spain australia and the united kingdom two notable exceptions to this trend are japan and germany which still have large current account surpluses and little asset price appreciation in spite of both running large budget ficits likewise us budget surpluses in the late 1990s did not prevent the current account deficit from rising differing perspectives on the cause of the current account deficit have different implications for policy options to reduce it in the global saving glut view the us current account deficit is due to global forces largely beyond our control for this reason bernanke argues that eliminating the budget deficit although desirable in itself wo uld probably have only modest effect on the current account deficit he points to research that finds 1 decline in the budget deficit would reduce the current account deficit by less than 020 17 likewise he argues that policy measures to induce higher household saving although desirable would most likely be ineffective as long as interest rates are low and housing prices are high he argues that the global saving glut is unlikely to diminish until capital begins flowing on net intorather than out ofthe developing world g3g151g138g149g162g156g146g156g561 the debate between the conventional view and the global saving glut view cannot be settled by looking at absolute levels of saving worldwide there is such thing as too much or too little saving in an absolute sense as table 1 indicates regions of the world are capable of widely disparate saving and investment rates high savinginvestment rates are found in both economically dynamic china and stagnant japan countries rather the debate centers on relative saving rates fundamentally the conventional view and global sa ving view can be thought of as two different ways to say the same thing to paraphrase the conventional view can be stated as the trade deficit is caused by the united states saving too little compared to the rest of the world whereas the global saving glut view can be stated as the trade deficit is caused by the rest of the world saving too much compared to the united states what is indisputable even tautological is the observation that saving rates are lower in the united states than abroad and that current account imbalances allows more convergence in countries investment rates than their disparate saving rates economists call these positive statements or statements of fact as

states should save more to bring its saving rates into line with the rest of the world the global saving glut view implies that the rest of the world should save less consume more and become more similar to the united states despite being based on the same positive statement the conventional and global saving glut views differ because economists have only ex post data on the economy one can observe after the fact that for some reason us investment rates significantly exceeded domestic saving rates and that the difference was bridged by the large current account deficit however theory and analysis are needed to describe the underlying factors leading to those results in the conventional view the saving and investment rates are likely to be thought of as determined by domestic factors and the foreign capital flows current acco unt deficit are likely to be thought of as the residual variable that equilibrates the other two in the global saving glut view the foreign capital inflows are the predetermined variable and the domestic saving and investment rates must adjust to accommodate them although the world saving rate has been rising since 2002 it was still below its historical average as share of gdp in 2006 as shown in figure 1 18 as the imf has argued these data contradict the underlying premise of the global saving glut view unless the saving glut is taken to mean dearth of global investment opportunities worldwide saving and investment must be equal19 if so then global imbalances may subside when investment demand in the rest of the world increases the figure also shows that the decline in saving by industrial countries has been sharper than the decline in world saving whereas saving by developing countries has been rising since the 1980s corporate saving has recently risen in industrial countries but not enough to offset the decline in household and government saving 18 even when the united states is excluded from data on saving worldwide evidence of

real inflationadjusted interest rates are anothe r piece of evidence that might help determine what is driving saving and investment patterns nominal interest rates are lower than in recent decades because of the decline in inflation however this information is not useful by itself because saving and investment behavior is influenced by real not nominal interest rates20 the conventional view would predict that the foreign capital inflows would be attracted to the united states by high and rising interest rates caused by the falling supply of national saving due to rising budget deficit or lower private saving and the rising demand for investment spending in contrast the global saving glut view would predict that the abundance of saving or dearth of investment demand abroad would cause w and falling interest rates worldwide as seen in figure 2 real interest rates as measured by the 10year us treasury bond yield have been low and falling compared with recent years 21 longterm interest rates have also been unusually low relative to shortterm rates since the fed tightened monetary policy despite an uptick in 2006 interest rates remained below rates in the 1980s and 1990s the same broad pattern has been seen in longterm government bond yields for the other major industrial economies this pattern would support the global saving glut viewalthough global saving is currently at low levels perhaps global investment demand is even lower however in the 1960s and 1970s real interest rates were lower than present that pattern would also hold true if the chart included rates from earlier years suggesting that in the longterm current interest rates are not unusually low and therefore do not provide clear evidence of saving glut 22 arguably 20 ideally real interest rates would be determined by ex expectations of inflation at the time saving and investment decisions were taken economists can reliably measure real interest rates only with ex post inflation data as result if inflation were higher than anticipated it may appear that real interest rates were lower than individuals believed at the time they made their saving and investment decisions this factor may explain why real interest rates were periodically negative during the 1970s 21 the imf estimates that capital inflows have lowered 10year treasury rates by 086 percentage points as of may 2005

asiaby more than 10 percentage points of gdpbecause of the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s for the world as whole only china saw large increase in investment spending so world investment rates fell these data support the saving glut hypothesis only if the glut is defi ned in terms of weak investment demand as can be seen in the table case for global glut due to excess saving can be made only for china other emerging markets and the oil producing region which all have seen significant increases in their saving rate since 1997 in chinas case the large increase in the saving rate was accompanied by large increase in the investment rate so the increase in its current account surplus was smaller however those saving increases were offset by saving declines in the other regions of the world so that world saving fell the decline in saving was particularly pronounced in the united states which supports the view that the current account deficit was made in the usa and not the result of greater foreign demand for us assets and japan in many regions the change in the saving rate over this period was driven more by changes in public saving the government budget balance th an private saving this observation casts doubt on the global saving glut argument that the imbalances are being driven by market forces seeking out the highest rate of return if foreign governments had not begun saving more and the us government saving less 23 then global current account imbalances might have been much smaller this evidence is consistent with the conventional view and its twin deficits prediction and inconsistent with the global saving glut view that the fall in us saving is primarily the rational response of private individuals to higher house values because the budget

large increases in foreign exchange reserves as shown in figure 3 25 when country accumulates foreign reserves its trade surplus increases or trade deficit decreases and its currency appreciates less

the market from sending signal to americans to save more or invest less29 the effect on the us economy is the same whether capital inflows come from private or official s ources however the motivation is quite different and the global saving glut view is meant to explain the motivation if asian governments are motivated to accumulate foreign reserves primarily to boost the competitiveness of their export industries then this casts doubt on the inevitability of the us current account deficit stressed in the global saving glut view had foreign governments not intervened in foreign exchange markets private foreigners might have raised domestic investment rates or lowered their national saving rates thereby preventing any foreign saving glut from emerging 30 the fact that large share of foreign capital inflows have taken the form of official purchases of us government bonds as opposed to private investors buying private us assets suggests that recent capital flows have not been primarily motivated by rate of return considerations g8g158g157g158g155g142g561g18g155g152g156g153g142g140g157g156g561 many observers are concerned whether the presence of global imbalances large us

movements are low and capital is more mobile on the other hand larger and more mobile capital flows create the potential for more significant economic disruption if they were to reverse economic theory cannot predict how much country should borrow abroad at low levels but if borrowing were becoming burdensome one would expect net investment income payments abroad to be large despite being the worlds largest debtor country the united states earns more abroad on its foreign assets than it pays out to foreign lenders although its liabilities exceed its assets the united states is earning more on its assets than it is paying on its liabilities as long as this is the case it is difficult to see why the current account deficit is not sustainablealthough it is implausible that the united states could borrow limitlessly without foreign debt payments becoming unsustainably large bernanke points out that one potentially troubling feature of the current situation is that so much investment has been residential which is unlikely to increase the nations productive capacity and reduce the burden of paying back foreign debt in the future so far global imbalances have not disrupted economic activity and have arguably been mutually beneficial since they have allowed low saving economies like the united states to increase their investment rates and high saving economies like japan to earn higher rate of return thus the mere existence of current account imbalances cannot be seen as problematic per if one were to argue that the current account deficit were harmful to the united states it would have to be on the grounds of its future rather than current economic effects the most widely cited worstcase scenario is if foreigners became unwilling to lend further to the united states causing the current account deficit and the dollar to suddenly plummet this event would presumably cause unrest in financial markets leading to broader economic disruption the gap

domestic saving and lower domestic investment which would require sharp rise in interest rates to occur if on the other hand the current account deficit and dollar were to decline slowly there would be little reason to expect it to cause economic disruption because the decline in investment spending would be offset by higher production in export and importcompeting industries domestic investment would have to fall and domestic saving would have to rise to restore equilibrium to financial markets higher interest rates would be the channel through which these changes would occur and how much interest rates rose would depend on how sensitive saving and investment are to interest rate changes this would be true in both the conventional view and the global saving glut view the worstcase scenario is presumably based on an assumption that recent lending to the united states has been irrationally high if financial market participants act rationally there is little reason to think that foreigners would be lending the united states too much right now and suddenly stop lending money in the future related concern is that large capital inflows have stoked asset bubbles in us stock or housing markets which could also be ruled out if market are rational nevertheless if bubbles were present it could make the effects of potential reversal in capital inflows more damaging to the overall economy both the conventional and global saving glut views are based on an assumption of market rationality and therefore cannot directly address this concern nonetheless the saving glut view may be more reassuring than the conventional view the saving glut view stresses that foreign capital is flowing into the united states because it has nowhere else to go and assumes that domestic saving would rise relatively quickly to take its place were interest rates to begin to rise some economists have argued that global imbalances will persist because the countries particularly in east asia lending to the united states are just as dependent as the united states on maintaining them in order to sustain domestic economic growth 32 by contrast the conventional view stresses that the united states has put itself in positionthrough its low household and government saving rateswhere it is reliant on foreign capital inflows and would presumably find it painful to replace that foreign capital were it to dry up how long global imbalances persist depend on number of factors that could be either temporary or permanent differences in the business cycle at home and abroad are one temporary factor the united states is further into the current economic expansion than some other industrial countries which likely means that consumption and investment demand are stronger in the united states than abroad at the moment the us economy may be slowing in 2007 bringing its business cycle more closely in line with foreign economies some of the factors identified as causing the glutincluding the decline in investment rates in east asian economies outside of china the desire by east asian central banks to increase their foreign exchange reserves and the desire by other developing countries to reduce their foreign borrowingcould be temporary or permanent government intervention to reduce exchange rate appreciation in east asia has also had an effect on current account balances worldwide in the long run real exchange rates cannot be permanently depressed because of price adjustment but adjustment could take several years and trade flows do not respond to exchange rate changes immediately the disparity in saving 32 michael dooley et an essay on the revised bretton woods system national bureau of economic research working paper 9971 september 2003

accounts future movement the imf recently estimated what would happen to the us current account deficit under variety of different scenarios based on historical data 34 according to their estimates if the us saving rate rose by one percentage point of gdp the current account deficit would fall by 05 percentage points in three years this estimate is much higher than the one cited by bernanke if the federal reserve raised shortterm interest rates by two percentage points over three years the us current account deficit would decline by only 01 percentage points if gdp growth in japan or the large continental european countries were to rise by 05 the us current account deficit would fall by 02 percentage points and the japaneseeuropean current account surplus would fall by 03 percentage points over three years if the investment rate in indonesia korea malaysia the philippines and thailand rose by five percentage points of gdp which would still leave them with lower investment rates than before the asian crisis the us deficit would fall by 075 of gdp in three years if the oilproducing countries raised their investment rates by five percentage points of gdp the effect on the us deficit would be similar continuing trade surpluses in oilproducing countries will depend on whether high oil prices persist and if so whether oil producers respond by increasing consumption if oil producers increase their imports by 150 billion initially and 350 after five years the us current account deficit would decline by nearly 075 of gdp after five years but the decline in saving by oil producers would increase world interest rates by 04 percentage points 35 these examples point to both domestic and foreign causes of the us current account deficit and suggest that single change in conditions would eliminate it similarly economist sebastian edwards runs regressions based on historical data to estimate whether faster economic growth abroad would significantly reduce global imbalances he estimates that if countrys gdp growth rises declines by one percentage point above below trend then the current account would deteriorate improve by one quarter of percentage point since japan and the euro area are the economies that have been growing below trend and running trade surpluses he looks at what would happen to global imbalances if they grew faster for 33 see zanny minton beddoes the

its trade surplus would fall by 27 billion and if the euro areas economy grew 1 faster its trade surplus would fall by 13 billion as result the us trade deficit would fall by 23 billionless than onetenth the overall deficit36 g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the difference between the conventional view and the global saving glut view is mainly one of perspective the conventional view focuses on the low level of us saving relative to the rest of the world the global saving glut view focuses on the high level of world saving relative to the united states the two theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive they are different interpretations of the same set of facts developing countries outside of china have seen large increase in their current account balances in recent years due to higher saving rates and lower investment rates china has also seen large increase in its current account balance because saving has risen faster than investment two main forces seem to be driving the shift first oil producing countries have chosen to reinvest rather than consume significant portion of their increased oil revenues second many east asian countries have responded to the financial crises of the 1990s by increasing government saving and official foreign reserve accumulation these have been important factors in recent years driving international capital flows traditionally neglected by the conventional view with its focus on domestic causes of the us trade deficit nevertheless the global saving glut has likewise neglected an important domestic cause of the trade deficit the large decline in domestic savingparticularly government savingin recent years this decline makes the united states far from the passive actor in the movements of international capital that it appears to be in the global saving glut view casting doubt on the global saving glut view are data that show that global saving is close to fourdecade low at present the recent decline in real interest rates suggests that global investment demand may currently be low as well however real interest rates are not particularly low by historical standards the risk that the record current account deficit could lead to economic disruption for the united states is still considered small by most economists but potentially dangerous raising national saving through policy changes such as reducing the budget deficit remains the best defense against this risk at worst those measures would prove ineffective as the global saving glut view predicts but would still have salutary effect on the us economy in their own right 36 sebastian edwards on current account surpluses and the correction of global imbalances national bureau of economic research working paper 12904 february 2007 edwards points out that faster growth would not necessarily reduce trade surplus for example if the source of faster growth were higher exports the trade surplus would likely increase
