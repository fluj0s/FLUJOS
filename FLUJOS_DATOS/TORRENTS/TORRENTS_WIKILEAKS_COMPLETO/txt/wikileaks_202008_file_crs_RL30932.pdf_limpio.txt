microenterprises businesses operated by the poorest of entrepreneurs have been targets of us foreign assistance for many years microentrepreneurs face number of obstacles to improving their productivity and standard of living including lack of accounting and managerial skills and an inability to obtain financial services savings and credit while more research is needed existing studies have found positive impacts on business and household income education and employment especially among women when assistance is provided to give better access to savings and credit in fy1999 roughly 154 million was used by the agency for international development usaid to assist microentrepreneurs in us aid recipient countries foreign aid has played major role in the development of microfinance institutions that have emerged in large numbers since the late 1970s many of these institutions seek to operate on business principles charging rate of interest that might cover costs because the poor cannot provide collateral these institutions often require entrepreneurs to form solidarity groups to take on each others obligations their repayment rate is often above 97 although many other bilateral and multilateral donors have contributed to the development of microfinance institutions usaid has been the leader in financing and developing programs supporting microenterprise congress has strongly endorsed this effort in appropriation bills by directing specific level of funding in the fy1988 1992 period and recommending support in report language thereafter some members collaborated with usaid in the development of microenterprise initiative announced in 1994 in october 2000 the 106th congress approved the microenterprise for selfreliance act of 2000 authorizing microenterprise support programs pl 106309 in fy1999 more than two thirds of usaid funding for microenterprise went toward technical assistance and capital for microfinance institutions fiftyeight percent of such funds supported poor people who received poverty loans mostly loans in amounts of 300 or less and 69 of clients were women congress has authorized 155 million funding level for fy2001 and 2002 but achieving that goal depends in part on the overall foreign aid account as well as amounts made available for economic growth objectives versus other priorities sharing the same pot of funds some argue that funds should be dedicated to poverty lending ie aimed at the very poorest of the poor microentrepreneurs by keeping loan levels low others argue that the most positive benefits from microfinance accrue to those near the poverty line not well below it number of challenges face microenterprise implementors including making programs sustainable while broadening their outreach

assistance introduction microenterprises businesses operated by the poorest of entrepreneurs have long been an object of us foreign assistance policy and subject of continuing public and congressional interest efforts to assist people to overcome poverty through participation in the private sector appear to have widespread appeal to americans on all points on the political spectrum anecdotal accounts of successful microenterprise assistance programs in the developing countries appear regularly in the media and efforts have been made some benefitting from the experience of the us agency for international development usaid to replicate these programs in the united states in close collaboration with members of congress of both parties the clinton administration launched microenterprise initiative in mid1994 to make microenterprise prominent part of usaids economic growth strategy since 1987 congress has periodically approved legislati on supporting microenterprise and in october 2000 it enacted formal authorization of such programs in the microenterprise for self reliance act of 2000 this report looks at the features that characterize microenterprises and at the us foreign assistance programs that support microenterprise development it examines three issues of potential congressional concern funding of microenterprise programs conflicting policy priorities and the challenges now faced by program implementors microenterprise background what are microenterprises microenterprises are the very smallest of nonfarm busine sses owned and operated by only one person or family and staffed in the most generally accepted definition by ten or fewer employees microentrepreneurs are the flower sellers the carpenters shopkeepers bakers and craftspeople who occupy what economists call the informal sector of the economy the part of the economy that is not easily captured by economists seeking measurements of production output and tax flows microenterprises may be parttime or seasonal incomegenerating activities and many are based in the home microenterprises are the economy of the poorest working segment of society estimates of the numbers of such enterprises vary widely from onethird to onehalf of the worlds businesses perhaps several hundred millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30932crs2 1 estimates suggest that microfinanc institutions reach about 125 million poor people worldwide microfinance practitioners say that the global microfinance market exceeds 500 million people cgap report 2000 p 10 consultative group to assist the poorest world bank 2 1999 survey of 1065 reporting institutions of 1600 approached found 236 million clients countdown 2005 microcredit summit campaign vol 3 issue 23 julyaugust 2000 in 1996 world bank report estimated outstanding loans at 33 million in survey of 209 institutions out of its inventory of 900 that have over 1000 clients and three years of experience worldwide inventory of microfinance institutions sustainable banking with continuedobstacles and solutions to the growth of microenterprise microentr epreneurs face several impediments to improving their productivity and standard of living lack of skills and market access legal barriers and an absence of financial servic especially capital range of efforts often assisted by international donors have been made to overcome these obstacles lack of skills and access entrepreneurs at the micro level often lack accounting managerial marketing and technical skills that might help them successfully manage and expand their businesses and boost productivity they may also be unconnected to markets outside their cities or country and to other business people in the same field local organizations and donors have responded to these concerns with an array of training and other business development services programs bds associations of similar businesses have been established to provide training offer advice and promote regulatory reform networks between businesses exporters and importers have helped to expand markets legal barriers microentrepreneurs and the institutions that serve them often encounter laws and regulations that discourage growth and consequent entry into the formal sector of the economy business license requirements for example can take months and multiple forms and visits to government offices government restrictions on interest rates have hindered bank lending to microbusiness donors have support ed research and analysis on government policies affecting microenterprise development provided policy advisers to governments and encouraged the advocacy activities of local associations of business people absence of financial services the greatest focus of public attention and donor programs during the past two decades has been the inability of microentrepreneurs to obtain financial services credit and savings with which to develop their businesses by funding larger retail inventory or necessary equipment microentrepreneurs rarely possess sufficient collateral to satisfy traditional banks and they require too small loan to make the transaction seem profitable to lending institutions one report suggests that only 25 of the worlds potential microclients have access to financial services other than money lenders1 in the late 1970s number of institutions emerged in different parts of the world whose purpose was to offer the credit that banks would not provide today there are thous ands of such institutions serving millions of people2 the brac ruralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30932crs3 2 continued the poor may 1996 3 some object that donorassisted programs should charge the poor an unsubsidized interest rate but the rate is often much lower than other options available to the poor local loan sharks often charge more than ten times the bank rate in addition to helping make the lending institution financially selfsustaining in the long run realistic rate of interest gives microentrepreneurs better sense of what is required of them as businesspeople in terms of determining prices earning profit and keeping records 4 for more on the grameen bank see david bornstein the

example claims 2 million borrowers and the bank rakyat indonesia bri has 25 million borrowers and 25 million with savings accounts the most wellknown of these institutions and still model for microenterprise credit support operations throughout the world is the grameen bank in bangladesh it has lent roughly 3 billion to date through 1128 branch offices it currently serves 24 million active borrowers as developed during the late 1970s by its founder mohammed yunus the grameen bank possesses several features in common with many but not all microenterprise credit institutions it seeks to operate on business principles charging an interest rate for its loans as high or higher than commercial banks in an effort to cover costs3 in lieu of collateral grameen requires that entrepreneurs form solidarity groups of five fellow loan seekers all of whom take on each others loans as collective obligation the effect is to eliminate frivolous loans and to encourage timely repayment many microcredit institutions boast repayment rates above 97 matching major banks in the formal sector4 there are numerous variations of the microfinance concept for instance in place of solidarity groups many institutions establish village banking system in which perhaps 30 or more people set up their own financial institution which in turn obtains capital from another source credit unions have for many decades provided credit as well as savings facilities some institutions include business training or health dimension in their programs some serve particular types of entrepreneurs many nongovernmental organizations ngos which have made up the vast majority of microfinance institutions are beginning to diversify and operate in commercial fashion providing loans on an individual basis offering savings accounts and even expanding to more complex financial services such as insurance some are even transforming themselves into licens ed forprofit financial institutions established commercial banks looking for new markets and impressed by the example of successful microfinance ngos are increasingly entering the micro sector impact of microenterprise support dozens of studies have been undertaken or are underway examining the economic and social impact of microenterprise support programs the bulk on microfinance the variability of programs borrowers and business and socialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30932crs4 5 general conclusions noted in this section are mostly based on studies carried out under the auspices of usaids aims assessing the impact of microcredit services project see aims publications in httpwwwmiporg 6 access to savings services allows the poor to cover food and other needs during low income perio ds prepare for retirement or disability invest in childrens education and housing construction have an alternative to credit and get return on their depositenvironments has led to an array of study conclusions that describe varying impacts for many in the international community the key impact question is whether and how these programs can reduce poverty the consensus at the moment appears to be that such programs are not magic bullet in the war against poverty but can be highly useful in combating it most studies suggest that provision of credit to people previously unable to obtain it on reasonable terms and the opportunity to establish savings accounts can have positive ramifications for the poor especially women5 microfinance often raises borrower income it may help stimulate growth of the borrowers enterprise and it may generate new employment raising the income of others increased income may be used to directly benefit the families of entrepreneurs studies generally support the view that credit programs promote higher household income and increased family welfare including improved nutrition and education among children these social impacts are possibly connected to the fact that the largest proportion of microcredit borrowers are women many microfinance institutions target women and some like grameen bank now lend exclusively to women due to the positive social impact of such lending practices many microfinance institutions seek to promote social welfare directly in addition to trying to boost incomes one approach is to offer savings services as the indonesian bri and others have done with great success6 the solidarity groups formed by borrowers offer an opportunity to educate borrowers some socially oriented microcredit institutions introduce discussions on family planning or sanitation the grameen bank provides vaccinations through its groups groups have been motivated to organize day care centers and clinics in response to problem solving discussions donor support from the beginning many microenterprise support institutions have been in large part dependent on outside donors for financial and technical assistance funds from bilateral and multilateral donors as well as from private foundations have provided the initial capital for loans funds to cover operating losses equipment such as computers to track loans technical experts to advise on methodology and train staff in banking practices and instructors to provide training to the microentrepreneurs themselves in basic business accounting marketing and other skills in recent years there has been growing commitment to

activities both in the united states and abroad has been stimulated by apparent widespread support within the development and relief community of ngos in february 1997 an international microcredit summit attended by nearly 3000 people from 1500 institutions and 137 countries initiated campaign to insure that microcredit reaches 100 million of the poorest people by the year 2005 the summit was organized by results hungerfocused lobbying group that has had substantial impact on the congressional microenterprise debate for more than decade the ongoing campaign that emerged from the summit has sought to educate us and foreign publics and to excha nge information on issues of mutual concern among microenterprise practitioners the campaign is encouraging microcredit programs to reach the poorest people to reach women and to become financially selfsufficient and have measurable positive impacts on the lives of its clients10 us assistance to microenterprise congress and microenterprise since the mid 1970s the united states has been leading donor in financing and developing programs supporting microenterprise nevertheless in 1987 bipartisan group of members of congress backed largely by charitable private voluntary organizations pvos and results began advocating greatly strengthened microcredit effort specifically they wanted an increase in the amount of funding for the program and an increase in funds used for actual loans rather than training or technical assistance to insure that funds would benefit the very poorest members ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30932crs6 11 in their versions of the fy2001 foreign operations appropriation s both house hr 4811 and senate s 2522 bills required that at least half of funds for microenterprise be used for poverty lending purposes defined by the house as loans under 1000 in europe 400 in latin america and 300 elsewhere and by the senate as loans under 300 the house committee report hrept 106720 recommended that microenterprise funding be the same as in fy2000 and best effort should be made to reach 152 million the senate made funding recommendation the conference report on hr 4811 did not make reference to microenterprise fundingthe population an approach known as poverty lending they called for an increase in numbers of loans under 300 and redefinition of microenterprise to mean those with 4 or fewer employees later modified to 10 authorizing legislation to accomplish these ends was introduced and adopted by the house in 1987 and in subsequent years was adopted in various forms either in the house or senate without however ever becoming law congress recommended several of these features in appropriations legislation at first through legislative earmark for microenterprise beginning in fy1988 for 50 million and increased to 75 million from fy1989 to fy1992 and later through program guidelines in both bill and committee report language practice which continues to this day11 renewed congressional and executive branch interest in microenterprise was reflected in the development of usaid microenterprise initiative formulated with the close cooperation and support of house and senate members of both parties as well as consultation with the microenterprise coalition us pvo community advocacy group with thenusaid administrator brian atwood these congressional members signed charter outlining goals principles and commitments on june 22 1994 under the initiative usaid committed itself to strengthen usaids capabilities in microenterprise to maintain and increase funding to facilitate work with us pvos and to increase its emphasis on reaching women and the very poorest the initiative was formally renewed in july 1997 microenterprise for selfreliance act of 2000 until the adoption of the microenterprise for self reliance act of 2000 signed into law as pl 106309 on october 17 2000 microenterprise development activities had been carried out under usaids broad enabling legislation the foreign assistance act of 1961 through this new specific authorization language the 106th congress expressed both its strong support for microenterprise programs as well as its policy preferences with regard to the implementation of those programs the legislation adds new section sec 131 to the foreign assistance act authorizing the use of grant assistance for credit business service and policy reform activities it requires that half of all assistance target the very poorest those living in the bottom fifty percent below the poverty level in programs that provide financial services with loans in 1995 dollars of 1000 or less in europe and eurasia 400 or less in latin america and 300 or less in the rest of the world and can cover their costs in reasonable time period poverty assistance

objectives in country objectives such as empowe rment of women increasing incomes and democracy building while usaid provides range of assistance to the microenterprise sector most funds are used to support the development and strengthening of actual microfinance institutions one aspect of this work funded by both usaidwashington and missions abroad is the strengthening of usbased intermediary organizations such as accion and finca that deal with multiple finance institutions throughout the world usaid funds helped accion develop its methodology for assisting microfinance institutions move toward sustainability for example by exposing accion staff to the successful indonesian bri and by providing capital grants to enable accions affiliate institutions to make their first loans in 1999

funds have been used to encourage positive changes in government policy affecting microenterprise for example in bolivia usaid assisted with the drafting of legislation providing for new class of specialized financial institution that might assist microentrepreneurs elsewhere it has encouraged the deregulation of small business interest rates previously set at level that discouraged the creation of microfinance institutions usaid business development services include providing training courses in business skills and efforts to link specific microbusiness sectors with larger markets

satellite service centers in neglected communities micro and small enterprise development program msed msed projects funded centrally in washington and initiated and supported by usaid field missions target financial institutions including commercial banks directly begun in fy1994 but with antecedents back to 1983 the msed employs us government guarantees and to lesser extent direct loans to encourage developing country banks to open lending windows to both small and micro businesses for fy2001 15 million was appropriated to cover subsid costs for guarantees which can be made on up to 50 of loan at as much as 20 to 1 ratio of us funds to actual value of guarant ees small appropriation can leverage considerable resources18 with half the risk carried by the united states indigenous banks are more willing to loan to small and micro businesses the msed also employs additional grant funds to train bank managers in this form of lending although it has been instrumental in the development of microcredit the msed chiefly benefits small business of nearly 29 million in outstanding loans as of september 2000 only 3 went towards loans under 1000 for fy2001 usaid had proposed the consolidation of its credit programs including msed into one development credit authority program which would fund its guarantees by drawing on transfers from other accounts rather than direct appropriations usaid argued that this would save money on administration and insure that appropriated funds were used only for the most beneficial loanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30932crs11 19 during debate on the issue in 2000 usaid staff noted that micro programs could still be protected if congress directed that portion of the consolidated program be used for this purposecongress however rejected integration of msed with other credit programs partly because of concern that micro funding would be adversely affected if it had to compete with other development objectives19 microcredit programs however can now be funded under both msed and the separate development credit authority program issues for congress funding levels for more than decade us supporters of microenterpr ise programs both in and out of congress have argued for increased funding levels to insure that sufficient funds were spent on microenterprise programs congress in the foreign operations appropriations earmarked 50 million in fy1988 and 75 million from fy1989 through fy1992 under the microenterprise initiative usaid agreed with members of congress to provide 130 million in fy1994 140 million in fy1995 and 135 million for each year from fy1996 to fy2000 levels not always achieved but sometimes surpassed due to use of multiple year obligation authority availability of local currencies and fluctuations in appropriated accounts the microenterprise for selfreliance act of 2000 authorizes level of 155 million for each of fiscal years 2001 and 2002 although pressure to raise spending levels is likely to continue the pvo supported microenterprise summit in 1997 sought an additional 75 billion in donor funding by 2005 of which 3 billion would be loans from mdbs continued increases may be difficult to achieve in view of limited funds and competing priorities congressional cuts in foreign aid in the mid1990s made it difficult for usaid to live up to its microenterprise commitments then and aid levels would have to rise broadly in the future for microenterprise funding to increase popular earmarks favoring objectives such as child survival further limit the amounts available for microenterprise in the case of nepal the need to utilize child survival funds reportedly squeezed out microenterprise development entirely as part of the usaid mission strategy on the other hand favoring microenterprise with an appropriation earm ark or strong funding recommendation would limit other objectives such as environmental protection and democratization should congress seek to earmark microenterprise spending in the appropriations bill it will find it complicated exercise because funding for this activity comes from numerous spigots four appropriations accounts and local currencies generated by sales of goods funded under these accounts and pl 480 title ii programs this is one reason why in recent years appropriators have chosen to recommend target funding levels in report languagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30932crs12 assistance strategies and priorities supporters of microenterprise development have varied priorities and objective s for example some argue that funds should be dedicated largely for poverty alleviation purposes while others want to focus on approaches that more effectively stimulate economic growth some favor funding for microloans rather than business services or policy reform such differences in approach are discussed below poverty lending poverty lending programs are those aimed at the poorest of microentrepreneurs proponents of this approach argue that to reach the very poorest those in the lowest half of the population living below the poverty level programs should make relatively small loans often in amounts of less than 300 the extent to which programs are directed at women is also considered by some measure of poverty lending for many years report language accompanying house and senate foreign operations bills has recommended that half of microenterprise spending be for poverty lending and in its microenterprise initiative usaid agreed to ensure that at least half of its microenterprise lending would go for loans under 300 1000 in europe and that women would be the chief beneficiaries of microfinance programs the microenterpris for selfreliance act of 2000 requires that half of all assistance be targeted at the very poorest but bends to arguments long made by usaid and many microfinance implementors that there is fundamental problem with the insistence on 300 average loan level and that degree of flexibility is needed to address the poor these critics point out that microenterprises especially successful ones move on to incrementally larger loans that will raise the average loan amount provided by microcredit organizations further the greater profits derived from lending to these larger micro and small businesses help microfinance institutions to subsidize more numerous smaller loans for the poorest so mix is recommended by many support organizations finally 300 average loan level is possibly sufficient for the very poorest in india but has little utility in europe and some other parts of the world where the cost of doing business is higher if the objective is to help people do more than increase their inventory of retail items such as buying an oven for bakery or sewing machine for tailor shop then larger sums may be necessary the act allows poverty loan levels to rise to 1000 in europe and eurasia 400 in latin america and 300 in the rest of the world some pove rty lending advocates are dissatisfied with the level of usaid assistance they point out that while 58 of usaid microfinance program funding may go to poverty lending only 40 of total microenterprise development funding including bds and policy reform is used for this purpose they question the value and cost effectiveness of business development services as tool to help the poorest as compared to

antipoverty modalities but the question of whether it is the best or the most efficient has rarely been investigated in bolivia we find it to be an efficient and lowcost method of reducing poverty down to about 75 of the poverty line but poor and expensive method of reducing extreme poverty other approaches in particular investment in social and physical infrastructure and expansion of the

1998 and microfinance and poverty reduction susan johnson and ben rogaly oxfam 1997the poverty lending approach to microfinance is not universally esteemed some argue that concentration of funds on the very poorest would miss large number of potentially productive recip ients that also cannot obtain credit such as larger microenterprises as well as many small businesses these somewhat larger enterpris have in the view of many better chance of creating employment and achieving graduation into the formal sector some skeptics suggest that enthusiasm for microenterprise assistance as solution to poverty is unfounded they point to research suggesting that the most beneficial results from microcredit accrue to those just below the poverty line not those well below it20 one critic also argues that women do not necessarily benefit from loans disbursed in their names21 others note that the poorest often lack the education skills and confidence to start viable business while acknowledging that microfinance alone may not be the solution to world poverty usaid expert maintains it does provide service for which there is clear demand from the poor loan programs vs other assistance since the 1980s some have sought to insure that the lions share of us microenterprise assistance was used to fund the loan programs of microcredit organ izations while this strategy is longer as strongly argued the microcredit act recognizes the importance of other interventions such as business services as ways of helping the poor there remain disparate views of where assistance funds might best be used according to some financi support is not the first preference of many entrepreneurs it is business training planning support and marketing advice others suggest that financial services other than credit savings and insuranc would help alleviate the vulnerability of the poor to job loss disease or natural disasters still others believe that changes in government economic policies and regulations would have broader and more dramatic impact on the livelihood of micro entrepreneurs than does credit usaid currently supports each of these activities but to lesser extent than loan

development usaid march 2000roughly 13 million in fy1994 to 37 million by fy1998 but dropped to 31 million in fy1999 congressional and us interest group support for centrally funded mechanisms was partly based on the fact that funds particularly those funneled through the office of private and voluntary cooperation tend to go directly to us ngos such as accion freedom from hunger and finca further the office of microenterprise development is perceived as having considerable expertise and supporting more cuttingedge projects and research into best practices on the other hand some suggest that usaid missions are in the best position to identify indigenous innovative groups in the field for supporters of central funding there may be new reasons to be concerned the dropoff in funding noted above may represent lack of commitment to the funding targets for the microenterprise office and pvc established in the 1990s it also reflects 1998 change in usaid procedures by which the microenterprise office longer had its own pool of funds all of its funding came from usaid regional bureaus and had to be channeled to projects in those regions22 contributions by the different bureaus have been uneven in fy1999 more than half of funding came from the africa bureau alone currently as result of the new procedure the asia and europe regions receive few grants from the microenterprise office new challenges for microenterprise support programs as microenterprise programs have spread throughout the world donor agencies and implementing organizations have moved from the simple introduction of credit programs to set of related concerns centered on how to make these programs more effective widespread and lasting future congressional interest may focus on progress on these issues reaching the poor research suggests that current programs do not answer many of the problems of active or potential microentrepreneurs especially the very poorest23 microenterprise practitioners are exploring various avenues of activity that might lead to provision of more effective services among the ideas being discussed are microfinance programs that provide shortterm emergency loans more accessible nonloan related savings services insurance programs and home improvement and construction financing new business development services programs could include efforts to establish leasing services and use of communication technologies including the internet making programs sustainable leading question since the introduction of microenterprise credit support programs has been whether any of them would be viable without regular infusions of donor financing it was thought that micro loan organizations even charging market rates of interest and with their high incidencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30932crs15 24 maximizing the outreach of microenterprise finance an analysis of successful microfinance programs robert peck christen elisabeth rhyne robert c vogel

commercial banks to cover their costs because of the voluminous number of small loans involved and the consequent expense of paperwork these organizations also had enormous difficulty getting funding from private capital markets usaid has long sought to facilitate sustainability by financing research and testing methodologies that might lead to it24 although the road to selfsufficiency is difficult one implementor estimates that of the thousands of microfinance institutions only 200 have the capacity to become sustainable growing number of microcredit organizations have achieved it in the usaid 1998 microcredit report eleven percent of reporting microfinance institutions claimed financial sustainability in its 1999 report 42 percent said they had achieved it accion international reports that 14 of its 19 latin american institutions are financially selfsufficient25 despite this success several concerns remain one is that donors will give insufficient time to helping microfinance organizations reach sustainability international experience according to usaid shows that successful institutions have achieved financial selfsufficiency defined as covering all administrative costs loan losses and financing costs at nonsubsidized rates from client revenues within five to ten years but some experts think that it could take more especially in difficult environments like africa usaid guidelines however say it should take seven years to reach sustainability leaving some wondering if assistance will be cutoff before organizations are ready for those targeting assistance to the poorest of the poor the achievement of sustainable microfinance is not completed task sustainability is often seen as being at odds with efforts to reach the very poorest microfinance institutions have found that mix of income levels in the loan portfolio helps to generate additional revenue as well as cut costs through economies of scale how to achieve both sustainability and serve the poorest remains challenge further there is much more for donor agencies to do to insure sustainability one is helping organizations to make linkages with private capital markets that will supplant donors as source of funds as noted above the msed and microent erprise office grants have been used for this purpose on number of occasions another is helping organizations deal with the exponential growth rates that successful organizations have already experienced and must continue to experience if the large field of microentrepreneurs is to be served and if non subsidized lending is to be costeffective in the view of usaid officials even financial or technical assistance to the organizations that have achieved full operational sustainability should continue in some cases to help them do something they havent done yet such as expand deeper into the lower income levels of the poor or provide new service such as insurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30932crs16

world mayada m baydas douglas h graham and liza valenzuela august 1997 usaidcommercialization as ngos demonstrate the potential sustainability and profitability of microfinance commercial banks are increasingly stepping into the field26 usaid has facilitated this trend by working on changing the policy and regulatory framework that often discourages bank entry by providing loan guarantees to make entry financially more attractive and by offering technical expertise some credit commercial banks with introducing new financial services and technological innovations while the commercialization of microfinance promises to meet the objective of making such services more widespread it may not solve the problem of reaching the poorest perhaps because banks are primarily seeking profitability they tend to serve the upper reaches of the micro and small entrepreneurs bank loan sizes tend to be larger than those of ngos one impact of commercialization therefore may be that ngos are left with the poorest clients making it difficult for ngos to achieve financial sustainability if commercial banks squeeze out the ngos one loss would likely be the social objectives that many ngos support as adjuncts to microfinance including literacy and health programs another would be the loss of innovative approaches that ngos have historically brought to this field geographic challenge reaching the poor in some cases is geographic challenge micro programs tend to concentrate in urban areas because of the ease and costeffectiveness of serving dense population although usaid microfinance programs in latin amer ica and asia have done good job of helping rural clients elsewhere rural populations are underserved whereas 66 of the population of sub saharan africa lives in rural areas only 44 of microfinance clients do in the near east the figures are 42 and 7 respectively and in europeeurasia 33 and 3 for africa in the seeds of hope act of 1998 pl 105385 sec 102 congress directed usaid to use credit assistance to help smallscale farmers and small rural entrepreneurs the proportion of rural clients has risen in recent years and usaid is encouraging the spread of programs to the hinterlands by providing incentives to institutions to expand their operations and by demonstrating new ways of delivering services to rural areas new technologies new technologies may transform current microenterprise practices for example pilot project in nigeria is using smart card technology in which the account is maintained on the card allowing loan officers and borrowers the security of not having to carry cash providing better downloadable information to the ngo or bank and permitting farmers to make payments in excess of what is due in order to build savings elsewhere loan officers are using palm pilots to recor d transactions usaid is exploring the use of innovative technologies to make microfinance services more affordable

language in the microenterprise act of 2000 that authorizes creation of microfinance loan facility that would help institutions avoid bankruptcy in the event of natural or other crises while the problem faced by most microfinance institutions in these situations is shortterm liquidity crisis it may not be in the interest of the us assistance program to resolve an actual default caused by the failure of clients to repay their loans the damage done to the reputation of the institution in such an event could be irreparable preventing it from ever becoming selfsustaining27 the hivaids epidemic poses another challenge to microfinance institutions with loss of staff and clients and greater loan delinquency among the possible effects policy analysts have begun to consider and test numerous approaches to dealing with these concerns including allowing healthy member of household to replace sick client provision of death insurance and development of prepaid medical payment programs as preventative measure usaid currently supports the integration of health education with microfinance programs28
