over time the report further analyzes the potential eﬀect on workers were congress to amend the equal pay act so that it requires equal hourly pay for equal work regardless of fulltimeparttime status and were congress to require that employers cover parttime workers under their fringe beneﬁt plans eg health insurance and retirement beneﬁts it closes by considering whether skill diﬀerences between underemployed workers ie parttime employees who want to work fulltime hours and full time workers in conjunction with the nature of job growth might account for some of the rise in involuntary parttime employment reference is made to legislation that deals with parttime employmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98695congressional researchservice the library ofcongresscrsreport for congress received

over the causes and consequences of nonstandard jobs is likel to continue as long as employers treat them differently from traditional jobs in terms of job security as well as compensation levels and
