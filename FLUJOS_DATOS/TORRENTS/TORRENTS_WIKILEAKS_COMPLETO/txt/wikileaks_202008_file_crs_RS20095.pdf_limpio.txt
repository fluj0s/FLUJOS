consideration of budgetar legislation instead number of laws and congressional rules contribute to the federal budget process with two statutes in particular forming the basic framework the budget and accounting act of 1921 as codified in title 31 of the united states code established the statutory basis for an executive budget process by requiring the president to submit to congress annually proposed budget for the federal government it also created the bureau of the budget reorganized as the office of management and budget omb in 1970 to assist him in carrying out his responsibilities and the general accounting office gao renamed the government accountability office in 2004 to assist congress as the principal auditing agency of the federal government the congressional budget and impoundment c ontrol act of 1974 pl 93344 88 stat 297 established the statutory basis for congressional budget process and provided for the annual adoption of concurrent resolution on the budget as mechanism for facilitating congressional budgetary decision making it also established the house and senate budget committees and created the congressional budget office cbo to provide budgetary information to congress independent of the executive branch g22g145g142g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g5g162g140g149g142g561 the president is required to submit to congress proposed budget by the first monday in february although this budget does not have the force of law it is comprehensive examination of federal revenues and spending including any initiatives recommended by the president and is the start of extensive interaction with congress within six weeks of the presidents budget submission congressional committees are required to submit their views and estimates of spending and revenues within their respective jurisdictions to the house and senate budget committees these views and estimates along with information from other sources is then used by each budget committee in drafting and reporting concurrent resolution on the budget to its respective house other information is gathered by the budget committees in reports and hearing testimony that information includes budget and economic projections programmatic information and budget priorities and comes from variety of sources such as cbo omb the federal reserve executive branch agencies and congressional leadership although it also does not have the force of law the budget resolution is central part of the budget process in congress as concurrent resolution it represents an agreement between the house and senate that establishes budget priorities and defines the parameters for all subsequent budgetary actions the spending revenue and public debt legislation necessary to implement decisions agreed to in the budget resolution are subsequently enacted separately 1 article i section 8 provides that the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises and section 9 provides that money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20095g22g145g142g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g4g158

annual actions that must be completed before the beginning of new fiscal year on october 1 changes in direct spending3 or revenue laws may also be part of budgetary actions in any given year when these changes are directly tied to implementing the fiscal policies in the budget resolution for that year the reconciliation process may be used reconciliation typically follows timetable established in the budget resolution other budgetary legislation such as changes in direct spending or revenue laws separate from the reconciliation process changes in the public debt limit or authorizing legislation are not tied directly to the annual budget cycle however such legislation may be necessary part of budgetary actions in any given year the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 pl 99177 99 stat 1037 established the sequester 4 as means to enforce statutory budget limits amendments to this act were designed to use sequesters to control direct spending and revenues through the payasyou go or paygo process and discretionary spending through spending caps under these mechanisms the budgetary impact of all legislation was scored by omb and reported three times each year preview with the presidents budget submission an update with the midsession review of the budget and final report 15 days after congress adjourned if the final report on either the paygo or spending caps mechanism indicated that the statutory limitations within that category had been violated the president was required to issue an order making acrosstheboard cuts of nonexempt spending programs within that category those mechanisms expired october 1 2002 5 currently both the house and senate have rules commonly referred to as paygo rules that limit the consideration of direct spending and revenue legislation however they are enforced through points of order rather than presidential sequester order6 g22g145g142g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g20g142g156g152g149g158g157g146g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g20g142g140g152g151g140g146g149g146g138g157g146g152g151g561 the budget resolution represents an agreement between the house and senate concerning the overall size of the federal budget and the general composition of the budget in terms of functional categories the amounts in functional categories are translated into allocations to each committee with jurisdiction over spending in process called crosswalking under section 302a of the congressional budget act legislati on considered by the house and senate must be consistent with these allocations as well as with the aggregate levels of spending and revenues both the allocations and aggregates are enforceable through points of order that may be made during house or senate floor consideration of such legislation these allocations are supplemented by nonbinding assumptions concerning the substance of possible budgetary legislation that are included in the reports from the budget committees that accompany the budget resolution in each house 2 discretionary spending is that spending not mandated by existing law and therefore is made available in such amounts as congress chooses through the appropriations process 3 direct spending also referred to as mandatory or entitleme nt spending is that spending directly controlled through eligibility requirements and benefit payments ma ndated in laws other than appropriations 4 sequester was an executive order canceling budgetary resources in accordance with the provisions of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended 5 these mechanisms were first established under the budget enforcement act of 1990 title xiii of pl 101508 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 originally enact ed with sunset date of fy1995 they were extended twice through fy1998 title xiv of pl 10366 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 and

instructions reconciliation instructions identify the committees that must recommend changes in laws affecting revenues or direct spending programs within their jurisdiction in order to implement the priorities agreed to in the budget resolution all committees receiving such instructions must submit recommended legislative language to the budget committee in their respective chamber which packages the recommended language as an omnibus measure and reports the measure without substantive revision reconciliation bill would then be considered and possibly amended by the full house or senate in the house reconciliation bills are typically considered under the terms of special rule in the senate reconciliation bills are considered under limitations imposed by section 305 310 and 313 of the congressional budget act these sections limit debate on reconciliation bill to 20 hours and limit the types of amendments that may be considered g22g145g142g561g3g153g153g155g152g153g155g146g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561 the annual appropriations process provides funding for discretionary spending programs through regular annual appropriations bills congress must enact these measures prior to the beginning of each fiscal year october 1 or provide interim funding for the affected programs through continuing resolution by custom appropriations bills originate in the house but may be amended by the senate as other legislation the house and senate appropriations committees are organized into subcommittees each of which is responsible for developing an appropriat ions bill appropriations bills are constrained in terms of both their purpose and the amount of funding they provide appropriations are constrained in terms of purpose because the rules of both the house rule xxi and the senate rule xvi generally require authorization prior to consideration of appropriations for an agency or program 7 constraints in terms of the amount of funding exist on several levels for individual items or programs funding may be limited to the level recommended in authorizing legislation also between fy1991 and fy2002 the discretionary spendi ng provided in appropriations acts were limited by discretionary spending caps these spending caps are described below finally the allocations from the budget resolution made to the appropriations committees under section 302a of the budget act provide limits that may be enforced procedurally through points of order in the house and senate during consideration of the legislation in the absence of final agreement on concurrent resolution on the budget the house or senate may adopt deeming resolution to establish provisional enforcement levels 8 section 302b of the budget act further re quires the house and senate appropriations committees to subdivide the amounts allocated to them under the budget resolution among their subcommittees these suballocations are to be made as soon as practicable after concurrent resolution on the budget is agreed to because each subcommittee is responsible for developing single general appropriations bill the process of making suballocations effectively determines 7 authorizations are legislation that establish continue or modify an agency or program and authorize the enactment of appropriations for that purpose authorizations may be temporary or permanent and their provisions may be general or specific but they do not themselves provide funding in the absence of appropriations actions although house and senate rules generally prohibit unauthorized appropriations both provide exceptions in their respective rules and the prohibition itself may be waived 8 crs report rl31443 the deeming

level of revenues but not for their composition legislative language controlling revenues is reported by the committees of jurisdiction the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee the revenue level agreed to in the budget resolution acts as minimum limiting consideration of revenue legislation that would decrease revenue be low that level in addition article i section 7 of the constitution requires that all revenue meas ures originate in the house of representatives although the senate may amend them as other legi slation revenue legislation may be considered at any time although revenue provisions are often included in reconciliation legislation the budget resolution also specifies an appropriate level for the public debt that reflects the budgetary policies agreed to in the resolution any change in the authorized level of the public debt must be implemented through statutory enactment 9

years were part of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended between 1990 and 2002 the act provided two separate mechanisms spending caps in section 251 designed to limit discretionary spending to designated level and the paygo process in section 252 designed to limit changes in the level of revenues and direct spending by new legislation in both cases the mechanism was enforced by presidential sequester order after the end of congressional session if legislation were enacted that would violate the limits established under either of these mechanisms the president was required to issue an order for an acrosstheboard spending cut of nonexempt spending programs within that category althoug h formal enforcement of these mechanisms was through presidential order by enforcing the allocations and aggregates for spending and revenues provided in the budget resolution consistent with these limits congress was able to use points of order to enforce them as well although these statutory limits expired at the end of fy2002 congress continues to use the concurrent resolution on the budget and points of order to establish and enforce budgetary limits g20g142g149g138g157g142g141g561g5g20g21g561g18g155g152g141g158g140g157g156g561 crs report 97684 the congressional appropriations process an introduction by sandy streeter crs report
