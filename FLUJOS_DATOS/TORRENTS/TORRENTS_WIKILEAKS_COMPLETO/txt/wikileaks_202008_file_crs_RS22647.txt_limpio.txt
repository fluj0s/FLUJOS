suicide attempt data it is estimated that for every completed youth suicide there have been many attempts3 according to the selfreported 2005 youth risk behavior survey yrbs conducted by the centers for disease control and prevention in the previous 12 months 169 of high school students indicated they had seriously considered suicide 13 reported making plan to attempt suicide 84 reported 1 lubell

1990s surgeon general david satchers call to action for suicide prevention5 in 1999 was followed by the release of the national strategy for suicide prevention6 in 2001 this was followed in 2002 by the institute of medicines reducing suicide national imperative7 and in 2003 by the presidents new freedom commission report achieving the promise transforming mental health care in america8 suicide reduction also has been included in the us department of health and human services hhs healthy people 2010 public health objectives with one of the two suicide objectives being to decrease the annual suicide attempts of adolescents requiring medical attention from 26 as reported in the 1999 yrbs to goal of 10 in 2010 this report discusses three issues raised by the availability of federal funds through the garrett lee smith memorial act and other substance abuse mental health services administration samhsa appropriations to carry out screening programs 1 is screening either alone or in combination with other measures an effective suicide httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22647 prevention strategy 2 what are the practical considerations of obtaining active parental consent for screening 3 does the federal government promote screening youth for suicide in order to address these questions the report first presents data on the efficacy of screening for suicide then reviews the practical considerations in light of federal recommendations for screening adolescents vulnerable to suicide and concludes with options based on the public health approach and available evidence many research studies are currently ongoing in the field as new developments emerge this report will be updated as warranted is screening effective in preventing suicide screening program per is not intended to

commission on mental health achieving the promise transforming mental health care in america 2003 available at httpwwwmentalhealth commissiongovreportsfinalreporttochtml crs3 in order to prevent suicide an individual who has positive screen will need to see mental health professional and receive appropriate care there are number of issues with schoolbased screening programs ability to effectively identify all students who may be suicidal these issues are outlined below first when screening program is implemented in school setting it misses large section of the youth population including youth who are in the juvenile justice system those who miss school on the day of the screening and those who have dropped out these youth who are not screened are believed to be at higher risk for suicidal behavior second screening programs provide information about childs suicidal ideation9 on the day of the screen they miss child who was considering suicide in the days prior to the screen or child who develops suicidal thoughts during the days following the screen third screening tools vary in their performance as measured by screens sensitivity10 and specificity11 preliminary research findings question the feasibility of screening tool being sensitive enough and specific enough to be costeffective in the general population12 screening tool that has high sensitivity tends to have low specificity in other words while it may capture all those individuals who have significant mental and emotional problems it will give false positive result to many other individuals who do not have such problems conversely screening tool with high specificity but low httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22647 sensitivity will miss many individuals with significant problems list of tested screening

responds to schools notice and gives permission passive parental consent involves screening child unless parents send response denying permission to the school to screen their child in general most communities have accepted screening programs conducted with active parental consent however it has been observed that requiring active parental consent leads to screening 5060 of youth requiring passive parental consent leads to screening 8090 of youth requiring active consent lowers the screening rate primarily because of youth not showing notice to their parents mental health in general and psychological testing specifically are cultural issues due to privacy concerns and stigma around mental illness some parents and groups are reluctant to allow schools to screen their children for suicidal ideation aside from addressing these concerns proponents note that screening program that requires active consent builds community support for the issue and builds the necessary infrastructure to ensure that child who screens positive receives followup care moreover community ownership and involvement reportedly increase the chances that program will be sustained after initial grant funds are exhausted13 some parents also are concerned about unnecessary medication of children with psychotropic drugs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22647 due to the limitations caused by the selection bias and the screening tool itself some experts question the usefulness of screening programs that are not part of comprehensive public health approach to suicide prevention such an approach involves recognizing and decreasing risk factors enhancing protective factors and providing mental health services and followup care to individuals who screen positive for suicidal ideation does the federal government promote screening of youth for suicide the federal government does not mandate mental health screening for children however recent presidential commission on mental health recommended targeting screening in highrisk settings with active parental consent samhsa funds youth suicide prevention programs including screening through the garrett lee smith grants and makes grants to local education systems to evaluate and identify evidencebased practices for facilitating treatment for atrisk youth presidents new freedom commission on mental health in its july 2003 report the presidents new freedom commission on mental health concluded that the us mental health care system is fragmented and inadequate and beyond simple repair14 the commission recommended wholesale transformation of the nations approach to mental health care one involving consumers and providers policymakers and both the public and private sectors while early detection of mental illness is one of the goals of transformed mental health system the commission did not recommend mandatory screening of all children 13 lodl k et coalition sustainability longterm successes lessons

report dhhs pub sma033832 rockville md 2003 the report is available at httpwwwmentalhealthcommissiongov crs5 to identify those at risk of mental health problems because it believed the research on screening for children to be inadequate15 dr michael hogan chairman of the new freedom commission reiterated the commissions position on mental health screening in letter to the washington times16 the commission did not call for mandatory universal mental health screening for all children recognizing the need to balance suicideprevention and access to medical care with the rights and responsibilities of parents and being aware of the devastating impact of youth suicide the commission proposed broad screening only in settings where many children are known to have untreated behavioral problems beyond this the commission promoted programs that provide voluntary screening only with parental consent the commissions final report includes the following language relating to mental health screening for children the commission supports implementing systematic screening procedures to identify mental health and substance use problems and treatment needs in all settings in which children youth adults or older adults are at high risk for mental illnesses httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22647 recommendation 43 clearly school mental health programs must provide any screening or treatment services with full attention to the confidentiality and privacy of children and families recommendation 42 in this final report whenever child or children is used it is understood that parents or guardians should be included in the process of making choices and decisions for minor children this allows the family to provide support and guidance when developing relationships with mental health professionals community resource representatives teachers and anyone else the individual or family invites footnote to executive summary the commission cited columbia universitys teenscreen program as model for early intervention teenscreen identifies and connects children suffering from mental illness or who may be at risk for suicidal behavior with treatment providers in their area the program is used in variety of settings including juvenile detention facilities high schools juvenile shelters and youth dropin centers to screen children who are at high risk for suicide17 garrett lee smith memorial act of 2004 smith act18 samhsa uses funds available through the smith act to provide grants to states and colleges for suicide prevention programs neither samhsa nor the smith act mandates screening youth for 15 screening for depression in adults was recommended in 2002 by the us preventive services task force uspstf the uspstf recommended screening adults for depression in clinical practices that have systems in place to assure accurate diagnosis effective treatment and follow up the uspstf concluded however that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening of children or adolescents for depression further information on these recommendations is available at httpwwwahrqgovclinicuspstfuspsdeprhtm 16 hogan m longterm study needed washington times october 21 2004 17 information on teenscreen is available at httpwwwteenscreenorg 18 pl 108355 crs6 suicide however many grantees screen youth using one or both of the most popular screening programs columbia teen screen and signs of suicide all grantees are required to obtain active parental consent before screening child the smith act has received total of approximately 92 million over the last three fiscal years fy2006 fy2008 appropriations in fy2005 both the house and senate appropriations reports for the first time included language that specifically addresses mental health screening the house report did not include specific dollar amount for screening but noted that samhsa is overseeing very promising pilot study utilizing evidencebased19 screening techniques and tools to screen and identify teenagers who are at risk20 the house report urged samhsa to evaluate the effectiveness of the study and report on concrete steps being taken to promote early screening and detection programs available in schools the senate report also recognized the pilot study adding that several promising screening techniques to identify youth at risk exist but they need further testing unlike the house the senate included 45 million for testing the use of screening mechanisms and identifying evidencebased practices21 the fy2005 conference report provided 2 million to make grants to local educational systems to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22647 further test the use and identify evidencebased practices for facilitating treatment for teenagers suffering from mental emotional or behavioral disorders22 in fy2006 the house and senate appropriations reports included level funding to continue testing these programs23 in fy2007 the appropriations committees recommended that samhsa use its suicide prevention funds to continue developing and testing evidencebased interventions including screening24 in fy2008 the appropriations committees recommended that samhsa strengthen its efforts to assist local educational systems and nonprofit entities to implement mental health screening programs25 conclusion federally funded screening programs currently require active parental consent on the one hand this policy may decrease the number of children who are screened on the other hand involving parents before the screening program makes it more likely that child who screens positive will receive followup care from mental health professional implementing an effective schoolbased screening program requires careful consideration of the issues outlined above while observers generally acknowledge the value of early identification referral and treatment of suicidal child there are also concerns about the effectiveness and costefficacy of relatively lessfocused effort instead of universal screening program recent studies have recommended selective screening program that targets children who are known to be at high risk for suicide 19 in its 2001 report crossing the quality chasm the institute of medicine defined evidence based practice as the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values 20
