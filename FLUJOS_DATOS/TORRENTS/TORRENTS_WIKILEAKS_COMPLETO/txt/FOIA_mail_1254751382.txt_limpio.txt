still working on response having to contact the russians to get some more site details takes time several things in all this are ludicrous as you point out yamal is one site and isnt in most of the millennial reconstructions it isnt in mbh crowley moberg etc also picking trees for temperature response is not done either the other odd thing is that they seem to think that you can reconstruct the last millennium from few proxies yet you cant do this from few instrumental series for the last 150 years instrumental data are perfect proxies after all 1httpwwwamericanthinkercom200910un_climate_reports_they_liehtml this one is wrong as well ipcc 1995 didnt use that silly curve that chris folland or geoff jenkins put together cheers phil at 0259 05102009 you wrote david this is entirely off the record and i do not want this shared with anyone i hope you will respect this this issue is not my problem and i await further developments however keith briffa is in the climatic research unit cru and i was director of cru for many years so i am quite familiar with keith and with his work i have also done lots of hands on tree ring work both in the field and in developing and applying computer programs for climate reconstruction from tree rings on the other hand i have not been involved in any of this work since i left cru in 1993 to move to ncar but i do think i can speak with some modicum of authority you say re dendoclimatologists they rely on recent temperature data by which to select recent tree data my emphasis i dont know where you get this idea but i can assure you that it is entirely wrong further i do not know the basis for your claim that dendrochonology is bankrupt approach it is one of the few proxy data areas where rigorous multivariate statistical tools are used and where reconstructions are carefully tested on independent data finally the fact that scientists in any field do not willingly share their hardearned primary data implies that they have something to hide has logical basis tom david schnare wrote tom briffa has already made preliminary response and he failed to explain his selection procedure further he refused to give up the data for several years and was forced to do so only when he submitted to journal that demanded data archiving and actually enforced the practice more significantly briffas analysis is irrelevant dendrochonology is bankrupt approach they admit that they cannot distiguish causal elements contributing to tree ring size further they rely on recent temperature data by which to select recent tree data excluding other data and then turn around and claim that the tree ring data explains the recent temperature data if you can give principled and reasoned defense of briffa see the discussion on watts website then go for it id be fascinated as would rather large number of others none of this of course detracts for the need to do research on geoengineering david schnare on sun oct 4 2009 at 850 pm tom wigley wigleyucaredu mailtowigleyucaredu wrote dear all i think it would be wise to let briffa respond to these accusations before compounding them with unwarranted extrapolations with regard to the hockey stick it is highly unlikely that single site can be very important mm have made similar accusations in the past and they have

ccnet scientific scandal unfolds gene ive been following this issue closely and this is what i take away from it 1 tree ringbased temperature reconstructions are fraught with so much uncertainty they have value whatever it is impossible to tease out the relative contributions of rainfall nutrients temperature and access to sunlight indeed single tree can and apparently has skewed the entire 20th century temperature reconstruction 2 the ipcc peer review process is fundamentally flawed if lead author is able to both disregard and ignore criticisms of his own work where that work is the critical core of the chapter it not only destroys the credibility of the core assumptions and data it destroys the credibility of the larger work in this case the ipcc summary report and the underlying technical reports it also destroys the utility and credibility of the modeling efforts that use assumptions on the relationship of co2 to temperature that are based on brittas work which is of course the majority of such analyses as corcoran points out the ipcc has depended on 1 computer models 2 data collection 3 longrange temperature forecasting and 4 communication none of these efforts are sitting on firm ground nonetheless and even if the unep thinks it appropriate to rely on wikipedia as their scientific source of choice greenhouse gases may at an ever diminishing probability cause significant increase in global temperature thus research including field trials on the leading geoengineering techniques are appropriate as backstop in case our children find out that the current

29 september 2009 32httpwwwtheregistercouk20090929yamal_scandal by andrew orlowski scientific scandal is casting shadow over number of recent peerreviewed climate papers at least eight papers purporting to reconstruct the historical temperature record times may need to be revisited with significant implications for contemporary climate studies the basis of the ipccs assessments number of these involve senior climatologists at the british climate research centre cru at the university east anglia in every case peer review failed to pick up the errors at issue is the use of tree rings as temperature proxy or dendrochronology using statistical techniques researchers take the ring data to create reconstruction of historical temperature anomalies but trees are highly controversial indicator of temperature since the rings principally record co2 and also record humidity rainfall nutrient intake and other local factors picking temperature signal out of all this noise is problematic and dendrochronology can differ significantly from instrumented data in dendro jargon this disparity is called divergence the process of creating raw data set also involves selective use of samples choice open to scientists biases yet none of this has stopped paleoclimataologists from making bold claims using tree ring data in particular since 2000 large number of peerreviewed climate papers have incorporated data from trees at the yamal peninsula in siberia this dataset gained favour curiously superseding newer and larger data set from nearby the older yamal trees indicated pronounced and dramatic uptick in temperatures how could this be scientists have ensured much of the measurement data used in the reconstructions remains secret failing to fulfill procedures to archive the raw data without the raw data other scientists could not reproduce the results the most prestigious peer reviewed journals including nature and science were reluctant to demand the data from contributors until now that is at the insistence of editors of the royal societys philosophical transactions b the data has leaked into the open and yamals mystery is more from this we know that the yamal data set uses just 12 trees from larger set to produce its dramatic recent trend yet many more were cored and larger data set of 34 from the vicinity shows dramatic recent warming and warmer temperatures in the middle ages in all there are 252 cores in the cru yamal data set of which ten were alive 1990 all 12 cores selected show strong growth since the mid19th century the implication is clear the dozen were cherrypicked controversy has been raging since 1995 when an explosive paper by keith briffa at the climate research unit at the university of east anglia asserted that that the medieval warm period was actually really cold and recent warming is unusually warm both archaeology and the historical accounts briffa was declaring were bunk briffa relied on just three cores from siberia to demonstrate this three years later nature published paper by mann bradley and hughes based on temperature reconstructions which showed something similar warmer now cooler then with briffa and mann as chapter editors of the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc this distinctive pattern became emblematic the logo of global warming ipccs assessment report from 2001 with the error bars in grey emphasised hokey hockey sticks mann too used dendrochronology to chill temperatures and rebuffed attempts to publish his measurement data initially he said he had forgotten where he put it then declined to disclosed it some of manns data was eventually discovered by accident on his ftp server in directory entitled backto_1400censored tree data was secondary in importance to manns statistical technique which would produce dramatic modern upturn in temperatures which became nicknamed the hockey stick even using red noise similarly all the papers that used the yamal data have the same point to make all suggest recent dramatic warming having scored global hit with combination of flawed statistics and dubious dendrochronology the acts repeated the formula late 20th century warmth is unprecedented for at least roughly the past two millennia for the northern hemisphere wrote the two authors of global surface temperatures over the past two millennia published in geophysical research letters in 2003 mann and phil jones of cru for example briffas 2008 paper concludes that the extent of recent widespread warming across northwest eurasia with respect to 100 to 200year trends is unprecedented in the last 2000 years the same authors in 2004 it continues to this day study purporting to show the arctic was warmer now than for 2000 years received frontpage attention last month led by northern arizona university professor darrell s kaufman and including dendro veteran mann this too relied heavily on yamal and produced the signature shape now heres yamal and when yamal is plotted against the wider range of cores the implications of the choice is striking comparison of yamal rcs chronologies red as archived with 12 picked cores black including schweingrubers khadyta river yamal russ035w archive and excluding 12 picked cores both smoothed with 21year gaussian smooth yaxis is in dimensionless chronology units centered on 1 as are subsequent graphs but represent ageadjusted ring width the majority of these trees like the graybill bristlecones have prolonged growth pulse for whatever reason starting in the 19th century wrote canadian mathematician steve mcintyre on his blog on sunday when onesize fits all age profile is applied to these particular tries the relatively vigorous growth becomes monster growth 8 sigma anomalies in some of them mcintyres determination to reproduce the reconstructions has resulted in the yamal data finally coming to light all the papers come from small but closely knit of scientists who mutually

33httpnetworknationalpostcomnpblogsfpcommentarchive20091001r ossmckitrickdefectsinkeyclimatedataareuncoveredaspx by ross mckitrick beginning in 2003 i worked with stephen mcintyre to replicate famous result in paleoclimatology known as the hockey stick graph developed by us climatologist named michael mann it was statistical compilation of tree ring data supposedly proving that air temperatures had been stable for 900 years then soared off the charts in the 20th century prior to the publication of the hockey stick scientists had held that the medievalera was warmer than the present making the scale of 20th century global warming seem relatively unimportant the dramatic revision to this view occasioned by the hockey sticks publication made it the poster child of the global warming movement it was featured prominently in 2001 report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc as well as government websites and countless review reports steve and i showed that the mathematics behind the mann hockey stick were badly flawed such that its shape was determined by suspect bristlecone tree ring data controversies quickly piled up two expert panels involving the us national academy of sciences were asked to investigate the us congress held hearing and the media followed the story around the world the expert reports upheld all of our criticisms of the mann hockey stick both of the mathematics and of its reliance on flawed bristlecone pine data one of the panels however argued that while the mann hockey stick itself was flawed series of other studies published since 1998 had similar shapes thus providing support for the view that the late 20th century is unusually warm the ipcc also made this argument in its 2007 report but the second expert panel led by statistician edward wegman pointed out that the other studies are not independent they are written by the same small circle of authors only the names are in different orders and they reuse the same few data climate proxy series over and over most of the proxy data does not show anything unusual about the 20th century but two data series have reappeared over and over that do have hockey stick shape one was the flawed bristlecone data that the national academy of sciences panel said should not be used so the studies using it can be set aside the second was tree ring curve from the yamal peninsula in siberia compiled by uk scientist keith briffa briffa had published paper in 1995 claiming that the medieval period actually contained the coldest year of the millennium but this claim depended on just three tree ring records called cores from the polar urals later colleague of his named f h schweingruber produced much larger sample from the polar urals but it told very different story the medieval era was actually quite warm and the late 20th century was unexceptional briffa and schweingruber never published those data instead they dropped the polar urals altogether from their climate reconstruction papers in its place they used new series that briffa had calculated from tree ring data from the nearby yamal peninsula that had pronounced hockey stick shape relatively flat for 900 years then sharply rising in the 20th century this yamal series was composite of an undisclosed number of individual tree cores in order to check the steps involved in producing the composite it would be necessary to have the individual tree ring measurements themselves but briffa didnt release his raw data over the next nine years at least one paper per year appeared in prominent journals using briffas yamal composite to support hockey sticklike result the ipcc relied on these studies to defend the hockey stick view and since it had appointed briffa himself to be the ipcc lead author for this topic there was chance it would question the yamal data despite the fact that these papers appeared in top journals like nature and science none of the journal reviewers or editors ever required briffa to release his yamal data steve mcintyres repeated requests for them to uphold their own data disclosure rules were ignored then in 2008 briffa schweingruber and some colleagues published paper using the yamal series again in journal called the philosophical transactions of the royal society which has very strict datasharing rules steve sent in his customary request for the data and this time an editor stepped up to the plate ordering the authors to release their data short while ago the data appeared on the internet steve could finally begin to unpack the yamal composite it turns out that many of the samples were taken from dead partially fossilized trees and they have particular trend the sharp uptrend in the late 20th century came from cores of 10 living trees alive as of 1990 and five living trees alive as of 1995 based on scientific standards this is too small sample on which to produce publicationgrade proxy composite the 18th and 19th century portion of the sample for instance contains at least 30 trees per year but that portion doesnt show warming spike the only segment that does is the late 20th century where the sample size collapses once again dramatic hockey stick shape turns out to depend on the least reliable portion of dataset but an even more disquieting discovery soon came to light steve searched paleoclimate data archive to see if there were other tree ring cores from at or near the yamal site that could have been used to increase the sample size he quickly found large set of 34 uptodate core samples taken from living trees in yamal by none other than schweingruber himself had these been added to briffas small group the 20th century would simply be flat it would appear completely unexceptional compared to the rest of the millennium combining data from different samples would not have been an unusual step briffa added data from another schweingruber site to different composite from the taimyr peninsula the additional data were gathered more than 400 km away from the primary site and in that case the primary site had three or four times as many cores to begin with as the yamal site why did he not fill out the yamal data with the readilyavailable data from his own coauthor why did briffa seek out additional data for the already wellrepresented taimyr site and not for the inadequate yamal site thus the key ingredient in most of the studies that have been invoked to support the hockey stick namely the briffa yamal series depends on the influence of woefully thin subsample of trees and the exclusion of readilyavailable data for the same area whatever is going on here it is not science i have been probing the arguments for global warming for well over decade in collaboration with lot of excellent coauthors i have consistently found that when the layers get peeled back what lies at the core is either flawed misleading or simply nonexistent the surface temperature data is contaminated mess with significant warm bias and as i have detailed elsewhere the ipcc fabricated evidence in its 2007 report to cover up the problem climate models are in gross disagreement with observations and the discrepancy is growing with each passing year the oftenhyped claim that the modern climate has departed from natural variability depended on flawed statistical methods and lowquality data the ipcc review process of which i was member last time is nothing at all like what the public has been told conflicts of interest are endemic critical evidence is systematically ignored and there are effective checks and balances against bias or distortion i get exasperated with fellow academics and others who ought to know better who pile on to the supposed global warming consensus without bothering to investigate any of the glaring scientific discrepancies and procedural flaws over the coming few years as the costs of global warming policies mount and the evidence of crisis continues to collapse perhaps it will become socially permissible for people to start thinking for themselves again in the meantime i am grateful for those few independent thinkers like steve

20 years that would not mean that manmade global warming is longer catastrophic it was tough case to make and it is not clear mr latif succeeded in presentation to world climate conference in early september mr latif rambled somewhat and veered off into inscrutable language that is now embedded in million blog posts attempting to prove one thing or another sample it may well happen that you enter decade or maybe even two you know when the temperature cools all right relative to the present leveland then you know i know whats going to happen you know i will get you know millions of phone calls you know whats going on so is global warming disappearing you know have you lied on us you know so and therefore this is the reason why we need to address this decadal prediction issue the decadal prediction issue appears to be combination of computer model problems the unpredictability of natural climate variation and assorted uncertainties making all this clear to the average global citizen will not be easy and climate scientists need to be able to make it clear said mr latif we have to ask the nasty questions ourselves all right or some other people will do it all this is still swirling around the global climate issue today but now along comes another problem canadian data buster steve mcintyre has spend most of the last three years deconstructing the ipccs famous claim that the last couple of decades of the 20th century were the hottest in thousand years using what was called the hockey stick graph the ipcc claimed to have the smoking gun that showed sharp run up in global temperatures through to 1997 the validity of the ipcc data began to crumble when mr mcintyre and ross mckitrick of guelph university found serious data problems that raised doubts about the graph and the claims of record high temperatures as ross mckitrick explains in his oped steve mcintyre has uncovered another data distortion that further undermines the original graphic claim that the world has set temperature records in recent years if world temperatures may have been just as hot in the past as they have been recently and if the the next two decades could be cooler than they have been recently the theory of climate change becomes an even tougher case to make the ipcc is now on wobbly legs at all four corners its models are inadequate and need overhaul data integrity is at

this headline on new york times story about the difficulties confronting people alarmed about global warming note the word plateau it dismisses the unpleasant to some people fact that global warming is maddeningly to the same people slow to vindicate their apocalyptic warnings about it the difficulty the intricate challenge the times says is building momentum for carbon reduction when global temperatures have been relatively stable for decade and may even drop in the next few years that was in the timess first paragraph in the fifth paragraph few years became the next decade or so according to mojib latif german prizewinning climate and ocean scientist who campaigns constantly to promote policies combating global warming actually latif has said he anticipates maybe even two decades in which temperatures cool but stay with the timess decade or so by asserting that the absence of significant warming since 1998 is mere plateau not warmings apogee the times assures readers who are alarmed about climate change that the paper knows the future and that warming will continue do not despair bad news will resume the times reported that scientists all of them say the 11 years of temperature stability has bearing none on longterm warming some scientists say cool stretches are inevitable others say there may be growth of arctic sea ice but the growth will be temporary according to the times however scientists say that trying to communicate such scientific nuances to the public and to policymakers can be frustrating the times says shortterm trend gives ammunition to skeptics of climate change actually what makes skeptics skeptical is the accumulating evidence that theories predicting catastrophe from manmade climate change are impervious to evidence the theories are unfalsifiable at least in the short run and the short run is defined as however many decades must pass until the evidence begins to fit the hypotheses the post recently reported the theory of university of virginia professor emeritus who thinks that many millennia ago primitive agriculture burning forests creating methaneemitting rice paddies etc produced enough greenhouse gases to warm the planet at least degree the theory is interesting even more interesting is the reaction to it by people such as the columbia university professor who says it makes him really upset because it might encourage opponents of legislation combating global warming warnings about cataclysmic warming increase in stridency as evidence of warming becomes more elusive recent report from the united nations environment program predicts an enormous 63 degrees fahrenheit increase by the end of the century even if nations fulfill their most ambitious pledges concerning reduction of carbon emissions the us goal is an 80 percent reduction by 2050 but steven hayward of the american enterprise institute says that would require reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the 1910 level on per capita basis it would mean emissions approximately equal to those in 1875 that will not happen so we are doomed so why try america needs national commission appointed to assess the evidence about climate change alarmists will fight this because the first casualty would be the carefully cultivated and mediareinforced myth of consensus the bald assertion that reputable scientist doubts the gravity of the crisis doubts being conclusive evidence of disreputable motives or intellectual qualifications the president however could support such commission because he is sure theres finally widespread recognition of the urgency of the challenge before us so he announced last week at the climate change summit where he said the threat is so serious and urgent that unless all nations act boldly swiftly and together time is running out we risk irreversible catastrophe prince charles agrees in march seven months ago he said humanity had 100 months until july 2017 to prevent catastrophic climate change and the unimaginable horrors that this would bring evidently humanity will prevent this charles moore of the spectator notes that in july the prince said that by 2050 the planet will be imperiled by the

this principle of burden sharing into hard actions and targets the protocol in its first phase sets fixed percentages by which countries reduce their emissions by 2012 below 1990 levels many of the industrialized countries have not moved on trajectory to achieve the targets for 2012 part of the discussions in the talks have been to set higher level targets for the second phase of kyoto protocol between 20122020 but the us not keen to take on any commitments in the midterm has always shown interest in disbanding with kyoto protocol and instead taking on series of actions that are decided by countries on their own say energy efficiency targets and merely presented to the forum india and developing countries have pointed out that would make the targets incomparable and render it impossible to figure out if any significant reductions have been made in emissions to prevent climate calamity other industrialized countries too have so far shown little interest in offering credible and robust targets for the second phase of the protocol the offers so far on the table from the industrialized countries if implemented would only bring in reductions in the range of 1118 by 2020 below 1990 levels india and other developing countries have demanded that the industrialized countries follow the recommendations of the climate science panel ipcc and take cuts in the range of 2540 below 1990 levels by 2020 which would put the world on trajectory to avoid temperatures reaching dangerous levels in the decades to come copyright 2009 toi 6 cap and trade may sink opposition leader down under

back bench after staking his leadership on demand that they back his climate change strategy several mps immediately refused to do so if the partyroom refused to back his strategy of negotiating amendments to the governments emissions trading scheme mr turnbull said yesterday the coalition would literally be party with nothing to say party with ideas and that was not the party i am prepared to lead throwing down the gauntlet to his internal critics mr turnbull said i am asserting my authority as the leader of the liberal party and the leader of the opposition if the partyroom were to reject my recommendation to them that would obviously be leadership issue thats perfectly plain perfectly clear he told abc radio in adelaide i could not possibly lead party that was on donothingonclimatechange platform his critics were not cowed despite the fact that both mooted leadership alternatives joe hockey and tony abbott support mr turnbulls stance west australian backbencher wilson tuckey said mr turnbull has made the ets leadership issue and we will now treat it as such his leaders ultimatum did not alter his total opposition to an ets and to the suggestion that we might amend it victorian liberal senator julian mcgauran said he stood by his vow to vote against the ets in november matter what amendments were negotiated nationals senators also remain implacably opposed to the scheme he hasnt got the partyroom with him on this one we are going to stand up for what we believe in said senator ron boswell this is not just another issue this is not one we can let go through to the keeper said senator barnaby joyce mr tuckey appeared to suggest mr turnbulls deputy julie bishop as an alternative leader saying there were many good potential leaders in the liberal party and perhaps some people who have had their reputations tarnished by backgrounding from our side now deserve reconsideration for the top job full story at

1998 is the warmest year of the past millennium our case has been significantly bolstered over the last week with statistician steve mcintyre finally getting access to data used by keith briffa tim osborn and phil jones to support the idea that there has been an unprecedented upswing in temperatures over the last hundred years the infamous hockey stick graph mr mcintyres analysis of the data which he had been asking for since 2003 suggests that scientists at the climate research unit of the united kingdoms bureau of meteorology have been using only small subset of the available data to make their claims that recent years have been the hottest of the last millennium when the entire data set is used mr mcintyre claims that the hockey stick shape disappears completely 1 mr mcintyre has previously showed problems with the mathematics behind the hockey stick but scientists at the climate research centre in particular dr briffa have continuously republished claiming the upswing in temperatures over the last 100 years is real and not an artifact of the methodology used as claimed by mr mcintyre however these same scientists have denied mr mcintyre access to all the data recently they were forced to make more data available to mr mcintyre after they published in the philosophical transactions of the royal society journal which unlike nature and science has strict policies on data archiving which it enforces this weeks claims by steve mcinyre that scientists associated with the uk meteorology bureau have been less than diligent are serious and suggest some of the most defended building blocks of the case for anthropogenic global warming are based on the indefensible when the methodology is laid bare this sorry saga also raises issues associated with how data is archived at the uk meteorological bureau with in complete data sets that spuriously support the case for global warming being promoted while complete data sets are kept hidden from the public

mailtomaberrdhotmailcom 48mailtomaberrdhotmailcom mailtomaberrdhotmailcom dear benny recently there has been considerable discussion concerning the slight cooling of the earths overall climate since about 2005 the result of the cooling has brought some scientists into the forefront to be openly critical of the still prominent view that climate changes over the century or so have predominately been man caused the proponents of human initiated climate changes are of the opinion that the recent cooling is but temporary interruption in what soon again will be rapid climate warming i think one of the keys to alleviate some of this discussion is to attempt to determine the triggers for two other climate shifts in earlier times the first of these the little ice age is generally regarded by most scientists as resulting from reduced output of energy from the sun coinciding as it did with an interval of very little to almost sunspot activity time known as the maunder minimum many solar scientists suggest that as little as 025 decrease in solar output initiated this cold climate period similarily during the mid 20th century during the years from the end of the 1940s to about the mid 1970s the sun was in one of its quiet modes very few sunspots the cause for what was slightly cooler interval could logically be linked to decreased energy from the sun however the quite recent thirty year period is more commonly linked to increased dust in the earths atmosphere consistent with this view is the idea that perhaps the little ice age too was forced not by decrease in the suns output but by an increase in dust not that produced by man but by extraterrestrial dust from comet encounter more details of this particular scenario can be seen at the following website 49httpwwwbcclimatecom 50httpwwwbcclimatecom 51httpwwwbcclimatecom all of this raises the questions what drove both the little ice age and the thirty year interval in the middle of the last century it is possible that they were driven by the two different causes outlined it is vital i think that the reasons for the two climate shifts be determined this would go along way to settle the recent debate as to the importance of solar minima in initiating climate changes over more than just few years further to this the picture of the future will be clarified if for example decreases in solar output is proven to be of less importance during the past then surely the present climate downturn will be likely only temporary respite from the inexorable upward trend in temperatures worldwide if on the other hand the solar cycles accompanied by low sun activity over decades and even longer can be proven as significant then i believe we must reexamine the increased carbon dioxide scenario rodney

access to the hard numbers and more knowledge than i can do better proving or disproving the following argument about the eroei of nuclear power in the united states today 104 nuclear reactors supply 20 of the electricity used each year in the united states 1they have been doing this for approximately 25 years 2 many existing reactors have now been approved to operate for 60 years while the initial costs measured in energy use 25 years ago were high and construction often took 5 years i doubt that the construction process for all 104 reactors required greater energy than the equivalent of 20 of annual electricity used 25 years ago over 5 year period i include the cost of design obtaining permits fighting environmental lawsuits manufacturing parts and actual construction etc in the total energy cost today the annual operating costs of maintaining fuelling and repairing existing reactors are low compared to alternate sources of electricity except hydroelectric the nuclear waste from these reactors has been safely stored at the reactor sites without causing single human death conclusions assuming the generation of electric energy in the us since about 1985 has been and will be constant the eroei of nuclear power using 25 year old technology is greater than 12 twenty percent of all electric energy generated over 60 years divided by 20 of the same amount of preatomic electricity generated over 5 years given that total electricity use in the us has almost doubled in the last 25 years 3 the eroei may be greater than 24 more modern proposed reactor designs with greater standardization simpler fuel cycles fail safe features and increased automation can be expected to have higher eroei i have not included the cost of decommissioning reactors numbers i found online are often estimates and seldom given in terms of energy because fuel costs today and to be expected in the future are low ignoring the option of recycling used fuel is not significant factor in my calculations steven zoraster 1 55httpwwwneiorgresourcesandstatsnuclear_statisticsusnuclearpowerpl ants 2 56httpwwweiadoegovcneafnuclearpageanalysisnuclearpowerhtml reactors were being completed between 1957 and 1996 the first large commercial reactors date to 1968 the longest build time is 24 years some reactors have been closed after being built and have been ignored in my argument my use

electric cars and shut down coalfired power stations as part of planned recession to avoid dangerous climate change at the moment the uk is committed to cutting greenhouse gases by third by 2020 however new report from the tyndall centre for climate change research said these targets are inadequate to keep global warming below two degrees c above preindustrial levels the report says the only way to avoid going beyond the dangerous tipping point is to double the target to 70 per cent by 2020 this would mean reducing the size of the economy through planned recession kevin anderson director of the research body said the building of new airports petrol cars and dirty coalfired power stations will have to be halted in the uk until new technology provides an alternative to burning fossil fuels to meet government targets of not exceeding two degrees c there would have to be moratorium on airport expansion stringent measures on the type of vehicle being used and rapid transition to low carbon technology he said prof anderson also said individuals will have to consume less for most of the population it would mean fairly modest changes to how they live maybe they will drive less share car to work or take more holidays in britain more than 190 countries are due to meet in copenhagen in december to decide new international deal on climate change speaking at an oxford university conference on the threat of climate change prof anderson said rich countries will have to make much more ambitious cuts to have any chance of keeping temperature rise below four degrees c if we do everything we can do then we might have chance he said copyright 2009 tdt ccnet is science policy network edited by benny peiser to subscribe send an email to listserverljmuacuk
