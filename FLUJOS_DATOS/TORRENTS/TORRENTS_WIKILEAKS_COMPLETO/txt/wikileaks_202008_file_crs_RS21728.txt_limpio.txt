provisions addressing the regulation of payday lending this report provides information on the practice of payday lending and an overview of federal regulation and legislation this report will be updated as events and legislation warrant background the payday loan industry became popular source of funds for cashstrapped borrowers in the 1990s payday loans were originally offered through check cashing outlets and pawnshops the market for this financial product soon produced standalone payday loan businesses today the industry includes large regional or national payday loan businesses some providers are multiservice offering range of financial services for example money orders and check cashing as well as payday loans nationwide payday loan offices increased from approximately 300 in 1992 10000 in 2000 to almost congressional research service the library of congress crs2 22000 in 2003 the total dollar volume of payday loans in 2003 was approximately 40 billion1 in payday loan transaction the lender makes small advance typically 100500 to its customer agreeing to hold personal check for the loan amount plus fee until the customers next payday sometimes the advance is made in exchange for the authorization to debit electronically the customers checking account for the loan amount plus the fee the borrower receives cash immediately fees charged can range from 15 to 30 on each 100 advanced2 although the typical fee is at the lower end of that range the fee may seem modest when presented as dollar amount but when calculated as an annual percentage rate apr3 the cost is relatively high charge of 15 to borrow 100 for 14 days amounts to an apr of 391 survey by consumer advocates found aprs on 14day payday loans ranging from 390 to 8714 loan can become even more expensive for the borrower who does not have the funds to repay the loan at the end of two weeks and obtains rollover or loan extension an additional fee is attached each time the loan is extended through rollover transaction if payday loan of 100 for 14 days with fee of 15 were rolled over three times it httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21728 would cost the borrower 60 to borrow 100 for 56 days while this is still an apr of 391 this example demonstrates how the loan fees can quickly mount and could eventually become greater than the amount actually borrowed consumers can also become trapped in backtoback transactions in these cases the customer pays off the first loan but immediately borrows again to meet financial needs if the borrower defaults on the loan serious financial consequences can occur the lender can deposit the customers personal check which would result in additional fees from the bank for insufficient funds if it did not clear the borrowers checking account and could result in the consumer being identified as writer of bad checks payday lenders found significant demand for these small loans from customers who found themselves unable to meet their current living expenses these borrowers would have personal checking accounts but cushion of savings to meet unexpected expenses or financial emergencies in addition they might not have easy access to credit elsewhere for example they may not qualify for low interest credit card or they may have found that their bank does not offer loans for small amounts of credit payday lenders do not check borrowers credit history or look into his or her ability to repay the loan they only require identification proof of income and ownership of checking account critics of payday lenders consider payday loans to be abusive in their terms and in relation to borrowers ability to pay consumer advocates argue that the industry targets vulnerable consumers that the practice encourages chronic borrowing and that

uniform in their treatment of payday lending currently 10 states do not have specific payday lending legislation or are unfavorable to the industry because of interest rate ceilings the remaining 40 states and the district of columbia have laws that address payday lending most of which both limit finance charges and set maximum loan amount5 some payday lenders sought arrangements or partnerships with banks and thrifts6 that might allow them to circumvent state restrictions or prohibitions consumer advocates spoke out against this practice calling it rentabank payday lending trade association

standards apply only to members and do not have the force of law httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21728 federal regulatory response by the late 1990s consumer advocates were asking federal regulators state legislators and congress to address what they viewed as inadequate consumer protections for the rapidly expanding operations of payday lenders some called for an outright ban against payday loans

the federal regulators of banks and thrifts on march 24 2000 the board of governors of the federal reserve system published rule that added section to the staff commentary on regulation z the truth in lending act tila the tila requires creditors to disclose the cost of credit as dollar amount and in terms of the apr the commentary revision 8 clarified that payday loans are within the definition of

an effort to avoid the state and local laws that would restrict the operations of payday lenders certain federal preemptions of state law are granted by regulators to banks and savings associations9 so partnership could facilitate the payday lenders circumvention of states usury laws or other restrictions the terms of individual agreements vary in an example situation the payday lender would use
