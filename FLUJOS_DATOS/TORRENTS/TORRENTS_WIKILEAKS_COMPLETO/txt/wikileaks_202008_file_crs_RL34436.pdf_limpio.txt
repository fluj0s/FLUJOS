science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436the role of offsets in greenhouse gas emissions capandtrade program potential benefits and concerns summary if congress establishes greenhouse gas ghg emissions reduction program eg capandtrade system the treatment of ghg emission offsets would likely be critical design element if allowed as part of an emissions program offsets could provide cost savings and othe r benefits however offs ets have generated concern an offset is measurable reducti on avoidance or sequestration of ghg emissions from source not covered by an emission reduction prog ram if allowed table 1 compares offset treatment in proposals from the 110th congress including s 2191 s 1766 and s 3036 offs et projects could generate emission credits which could be used by regulated entity eg power plant to comply with its reduction requirement offsets could include various activities agriculture or forestry projects eg conservation tillage or planting trees on previously nonforested lands renewable energy proj ects eg wind farms energy efficiency projects eg equipment upgrades nonco2 emissions reduction projects eg methane from landfills including offsets would likely make an emissions program more costeffective by 1 providing an incentive for nonre gulated sources to generate emission reductions and 2 expanding emission compliance opportunities for regulated entities some offset projects may provide other benefits such as improvements in air or water quality in addition the offset market may create new economic opportunities and spur innovation as parties seek new met hods of generating offsets the main concern with offset projects is whether or not they represent real emission reductions for offsets to be credible ton of co2equivalent emissions from an offset project should equate to ton reduced from covered emission source such as smokestack or exhaust pipe this objective presents challenges because many offsets are difficult to measure if illegitimate offset credits flow into an emissions trading program the prog ram would fail to reduce ghg emissions another concern is whether the inclusion of offsets would send th appropriate price signal to encourage the developmen t of longterm mitigation technologies policymakers may consider balance between price signal and program costs if eligible in us program international offsets are expected to dominate in early decades because they would likely offer the lowestcost options domestic sectors such as agriculture and forestry might benefit if international offsets are excluded some object to the use of interna tional offsets due to concerns of fairness the lowcost options would be unavailable to developing nations if and when they establish ghg emission targets howeve r some offset projects may promote sustainable development on the other hand international offsets may serve as disincentive for developing nations to enact laws or regulations controlling ghg emissions because many projects would longer qualify as offsets httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436contents introduction 1 f f s t s n v r v i w 2 f f s t t p s n d x m p l s 4 b i l g i c

change poli cy evolving views on cost competitiveness and comprehensiveness by larry b parker and john blodgett 4 in this way offsets would complement the more traditional emissions trading that can occur between two covered sources for exampl covered source eg power plant can make reductions beyond its compliance obligations and then sell these reductions as credits to other covered sources this type of transaction represents the trade component of capandtrade program the role of offsets in greenhouse gas emissions capandtrade program potential benefits and concerns introduction variety of efforts to ddress climate change are cu rrently underway or being developed on the intern ational national nd subnational levels eg individual state actions or regional partnerships1 these efforts cover wide spectrum from climate change research to mandatory greenhouse gas ghg emissions reduction programs2 in the 110th congress members have introduced number of proposals that would establish national ghg emi ssions reduction regime ghg emissions reduction programs both ongoing and proposed vary considerably the primary variables ar scope and stringency which emission sources are covered by the program and how much emission reduction is required3 these factors largely determine the impact s of an emissions reduction program but other design details can ve substantive effects one such design element is the treatment of offsets an offset is measurable reduction avoidance or sequestra tion of ghg emissions from source not covered by an emission reduction program if capandtrade program includes offsets regulated entities have the oppor tunity to purchase them to help meet compliance obligations4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436crs2 5 an emissions cap might require only co2 emission reductions but still allow co2e offsets from projects that involve nonco2 ghgs 6 although congress could address ghg emissions with alternative policies eg by enacting carbon tax or setting emission limits for each source type commandand control the option to use offsets is generally discussed in the context of capandtrade regime offsets could be component of carbon tax framework eg as tax credits but that discussion is beyond the scope of this report 7 for instance if covered source reduced its emissions beyond its compliance obligation the source could sell the reductions as credits to other sources subject to the cap this financial opportunity would create the incentive for sources to find and make reductions beyond their compliance obligations these type of exchanges represent the foundation of the capandtrade system offsets have generated debate and controversy in climate change policy if congress establishes federal program to manage or reduce ghg emissions whether and how to address offsets would likely be an important issue because most current and proposed programs allow offsets see table 1 offset projects will probably play some part in an emissi ons reduction program the first section of this report provide s an overview of offsets by discussing different types of offset pr ojects and describing how the offsets would likely be used in an emission reduction program the next section discusses the supply of offsets that might be available in an emission tr ading program the subsequent sections examine the potential offset benefits and the potential concerns associated with offsets the final section ffers considerations for cong ress in addition the report includes table comparing the role of offsets in selected emission reduction programs proposals in the 110th congress us state initiatives and international programs offsets an overview offsets are sometimes described as project based because they typically involve specific projects or activities whose primary objective is to reduce avoid or sequester emissions because offset projects can involve different ghgs they are quantified and described with standard form of measur either metric tons of carbonequivalents mtce or metric tons of co2equivalents mtco2e5 to be credible as offsets the emissi ons reduced avoided or sequestered must be additional to businessasusual ie what would have happened anyway this concept is often called add itionality if congress tablishes ghg emission cap andtrade program only sources not cove red by the cap could generate offsets6 emission reductions from regulated sources eg coalfired power plants would either be required or spurred by the emissions cap7 in contrast if agricultural operations were not covered under an emissions cap proj ect that collects methane emissions from manure digester would likely be an additional ghg emission reduction httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436crs3 8 for comparison purposes eg estimating the quantity of offsets and potential offset benefits this report generally assumes that emission sources and sequestration activities will either not be regulated in any fashion or they will qualify as offsets however there are alternative means of addressing emission sources and sinks that are often considered good candidates for offsets see the text b ox on p 8 policy alternatives to offsets 9 for more information see crs report rl 34150 climate change th eu emissions trading scheme ets gets ready for kyoto by larry parker 10 the credits are called certified emission reductions cers or emission reduction units erus depending on whether they originate from the clean development mechanism cdm or from joint implementation projects respectively the cdm is the kyoto protocol compliance mechanism which has been used widely in the euets that allows for developing nations to generate offsets and sell them to regulated sources in developed nations the cdm was established by article 12 of the kyoto protocol for more information on the kyoto protocols f lexible mechanisms see httpunfcccint kyoto_protocolmechanismsitems1673php 11 although the credits are equivalent to allo wances in environmental and economic terms they are not interchangeable for more on the eu ets see crs report rl33581 climate change the european unions emi ssions trading system euets by larry parkerif offsets are allowed as compliance option in an emissions trading program eligible offset projects coul d generate emission credits which could be sold and then used by regulated entity to comply with its reduction requirement8 this approach is part of the european uni ons eu emission tr ading scheme ets which eu members use to help meet their kyoto protocol commitments9 under the eu ets regulated entities can purchase emission credits that are created from approved offset projects10 regulated entities can then apply the credits towards their individual emission allowance obligations11 for example regulated entity may consider purchasing offsets if the offsets are less expensive than making direct onsite emission reductions assuming the offset is legitimate ie ton of carbon reduced avoided or sequester ed through an offset project equates to ton reduced at regulated source the objective to reduce ghg emissions is met from global climate change perspective it does not matter where or from what source the reduction occurs the effect on the atmosphe ric concentration of ghgs would be the same offsets increase emission reduction oppor tunities when offsets are not allowed incentives to reduce emissions or sequester carbon are limited to the covered sources and there is little motivation to improve mitigation technologies for noncovered sources including offsets in capandtrade program would expand these incentiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436crs4 12 if the source was subject to an emissions cap reductions beyond compliance obligations would be sold directly as emission creditsvoluntary offsets although this report focuses on the use of offsets in mandatory ghg emissions reduction program offsets are ge nerating interest nd debate in other contexts in the united states nd around the world growing number of businesses interest groups and individua ls are purchasing offsets and claiming that all or part of their ghgemitting activities eg travel or specific events are carbon neutral the motivation for these purchases can vary some businesses may be seeking to enhance their public ima ge others may hope to take credit for the offsets in future ghg reduction program the exchanges represent voluntary market for offsets because there is requirement for the parties to curtail their emissions the quality of the offsets in the voluntary market varies considerably largely because there are commonly accepted sta ndards some offset sellers offer offsets that comply with the more explicit standards of the kyoto protocols clean development mechanism other sellers offer offsets that meet the sellers selfestablished guidelines which may be considered pr oprietary information and thus not publicly available due to the lack of common standards some observers have referred to the market as the wild west this should not suggest that all offsets are low quality but that the consumer must adopt buyerbeware mentality when purchasing offsets for more information see crs report rl34241 voluntary carbon offsets overview and assessment by jonathan l ramseur offset types and examples offsets could potentially be generated from an activity that emits ghgs or that would remove or sequester ghgs from the atmosphere this section discusses offsets in four categories each categor is discussed below with project examples for each group some of the categories and examples listed below may be limited by location if us law or regulation other than an emissions cap governs specific emission source eg methane from coal mines th at sources emission reductions would not qualify as domestic offsets unless the re ductions made went further than the regulations required12 for example if the source is required by law or regulation to reduce methane emissions by 50 reduc tions up to this threshold would not qualify as offsets but reductions in excess of 50 might qualify as offsets as more nations establish mandatory caps or require specifi c technological contro ls or practices at emission sources the universe of potential offsets would shrinkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436crs5 13 for more information on agricultural activities see crs report rl33898 climate change the role of the us agriculture sector by renee johnson 14 see crs report rl34560 forest carbon markets potential and drawbacks by ross w gorte and jonathan l ramseur 15 this comparison does not account for the externa lities associated with fossil fuel combustion air pollution environmental degrad ation health problems linked to emissions etc 16 in addition some may argue that nuclear ergy could be considered renewable energy this debate is beyond the scope of this reportbiological sequestration trees plants and soils sequester carbon removing it from the earths atmosphere biological sequestration projects generally involve activities that either increase existin g sequestration or ma intain the existing sequestration on land that might otherwise be disturbed and re lease some or all of the sequestered carbon this offset category includes sequestration that results from agriculture and forestry activities and is sometimes referred to as land use land use change and forestry lulucf projects example of these projects include planting trees on previously nonfore sted land ie afforestation planting trees on formerly forest ed land ie reforestation limiting deforestation by purchasing forested property and preserving the forests with legal and enforcement mechanisms setting aside croplands from ag ricultural production to rebuild carbon in the soil and vegetation and promoting practices that reduce so il disruption eg conservation tillage and erosion control13 compared to the other offset categories discussed here biol ogical sequestration projects particularly forest ry projects offer the most potential in terms of volume however this category is arguably the most controversial because several integrity issues are typically or perceived to be associated with biological sequestration projects14 these issues are discussed in more detail in later sections of this report renewable energy projects historically renewable energy eg wind solar biomass has been more expensive source of energy than fossil fuels15 renewable energy offset project could provide the financial support to make renewable energy sources more economically competitive with fossil fuels renewable energy sources generate fewer ghg emissions than fossil fuels particularly coal wind and solar energy produce zero direct emissions use of renewable sources would avoi d emissions that would have been generated by fossil fuel combustion these avoided emissions could be sold as offsets potential renewable energy offset projects may include16 constructing wind farms to generate electricity adding solar panelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436crs6 17 the digesters capture the methane which can be used for energy purposes 18 see crs report rl33846 greenhouse gas reduction capandtrade bills in the 110th congress by larry parker and brent d yacobucciretrofitting boilers to accomm odate biomass fuels and installing methane digesters at livestock operations17 domestic renewable energy projects are not likely to qualify as offsets in national emissions reduction program in carbonconstrained context project developers would be hardp ressed to demonstrate that renewable energy project would not have happened anyway in an economywide capandtrade emissions program energy sector emi ssions would likely be capped18 the cap would make fossil fuels more expensive and renewable ergy sources more attractive in fact none of the congressional proposals see table 1 that allow offsets specifically allow the use of renewable energy offsets however renewable energy projects may still create credible offsets in nations w ithout ghg emission controls on their energy sectors energy efficiency more energy efficient product or system requires less energy to generate the same output im provements in energy efficiency generally require financial i nvestment in new product or sy stem these capital investments likely pay off in the long run but the payback period may be too long or capital financing may be constraine d particularly for small bus inesses or in developing nations examples of possible energy efficiency offset projects include upgrading to more efficient machines or appliances supporting construction of more energy efficient buildings replacing incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent bulbs similar to renewable energy offsets domestic energy efficiency offset projects would likely face substantial hurdles in proving their additionality in carbon constrained regime as the price of carbon increases and raises energy prices both outcomes expected with an emissions cap the incentive to reduce energy use through energy efficiency improvements will increase offset ownership is another potentia l challenge regarding some energy efficiency offsets energy efficiency imp rovements may occur at different location than the actual reduction in emissions for example business that runs its operations with purchased electricity will use less electricity if energy efficiency improvements are made but the actual emission reductions will be seen at power plant thus the reductions may be counted tw ice first as an ener gy efficiency offset and second as direct reduction at the power plant one way to address this potential dilemma is to restrict energy efficiency projects to only those that reduce or avoid on site combustion of fossil fuels this appr oach is used in the few congressional proposals that specifically allo w energy efficiency offsets as with renewable energy projects there could be energy efficiency projects in nations that do not limit ghg emissions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436crs7 19 gwp is an index of how much ghg may contribute to global warming over period of time typically 100 years gwps are used to compare gases to carbon dioxide which has gwp of 1 for example methanes gwp is 25 and is thus 25 times more potent ghg than co2 the gwps listed in this report are

market pr ice for offsets see michael wara measuring the clean development mechanisms performance and potential working paper 56 stanford continuednonco2 emissions reduction multiple sources emit nonco2 greenhouse gases these emissions ar often not controlled through law or regulation these sources primarily agricultural industrial and waste management facilities mit ghgs as byproducts dur ing normal operations in many cases the individual sources emit relatively small volumes of gases however there are large number of individual sour ces worldwide and many of the gases emitted have greater gl obal warming potential gwp than carbon dioxide19 offset projects in this category would generall provide funding for emission control technology to reduce these ghg emission s examples of emission reduction opportunities include the following methane ch4 emissions from landfills livestock operations or coal mines gwp 25 nitrous oxide n2o emissions from agricultural operations or specific industrial processes gwp 298 hydrofluorocarbon hfc emissi ons from specific industrial processes such as hfc23 emissions from production of refrigerant gas gwp of 14800 sulfur hexafluoride sf6 from specific industrial activities such as manufacturing of semiconductors g wp 22800 this offset category is broad as it i nvolves many different industrial activities as such some offset types in this category are generally considered high quality and others that have generated controvers for example methane reduction from landfills or coal mines has reputation as high quality offset these projects are relatively easy to measure and verify and in many cases would likely not occur if not for the financing provided by an offset ma rket therefore the challenge of proving additionality is easier to overcome offsets involving abatement of hf c23 emissions from production of common refrigerant20 have spurred controversy of the offset types certified through the kyoto protocols clean developm ent mechanism cdm hfc23 offsets represent the greatest percentage 50 of the certified emission reductions cers have come from hfc23 abatement projects21 controversy has arisen because the production facilities can potentia lly earn more money from the offsets destroying hfc23 emissions than from selling the primary material22 this creates perversehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436crs8 22 continued center for environmental science and policy 2006incentive to produce artificially high amounts of product to generate more lucrative byproduct policy alternatives to offsets policymakers have altern ative methods of addre ssing the emission sources and sinks that are often consider ed to be candidates for offsets emissions cap congress could expand the scope of the emissions cap to include emission sources that were previously excluded the rationale for initially excluding these sources is that they are large in number and they individually generate relatively small quantity of emissions therefore an offset program is arguably more costeffective means of achieving reductions from these sources however including certain sources while excluding others may raise issues of fairness for example some may ques tion why specific sources are capped while other sources can generate financial ga in through the offset market this discussion is beyond the scope of this report emissions standards instead of allowing offsets from noncapped sources congress could establish sectorspeci fic emission performance standards or technological requirements this approach is sometimes described as commandandcontrol such policy c ould be applied to both emission sources and sequestration activities if congress sets baseline requirement reductions or sequestration beyond th minimum requirement could qualify as offsets setaside allowances one possible design elem ent of an emission control program is for policymakers to allot specific percentage of emission allowances setasides from the overall emissions cap to nonregulated entities ie parties not subject to the emissions cap in carbonconstrained context the setaside allowances are essentially currency because they could be sold to regulated facilities to help meet compliance obligations setasides can be allocated to parties to promote various objectives in cluding support for activities that reduce avoid or sequester emissions the allowances may also be distributed for other purposes such as transition assistance to specific economic sectors or financial support to lowincome households thes groups may pay proportionately higher costs in an emission reduction regime although both setaside allowances nd offsets would address emissions in sectors not subject to the cap their impacts on regulated sources would differ substantially setaside allowances are within the emissions cap offsets represent compliance options from sources outside of the cap neither offsets nor setasides would alter the ghg reduction goal of the program the cap would remain the same however offsets would incr ease the emission reduction opportunities available to regulated sources setaside allowances would nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436crs9 23 commandandcontrol program may require for example that certain technologies be installed to control emissions from landfills or an imal waste or that specific practices eg conservation tillage be performed in agricultural operations 24 if they would have occurred they would not be additional to businessasusual and thus not qualify as offsets 25 epa epa analysis of the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2008 2008potential benefits of offsets the inclusion of offsets in capand trade program could potentially provide multiple benefits perhaps the primary benefit would be improved costeffectiveness the ability to generate offsets which could be sold as emission credits would provide an incentive for nonregulated s ources to reduce avoid or sequester emissions the inclusion of offsets could expand emission mitigation opportunities likely reducing compliance costs for regulated entities many offset projects have the potential to offer environmental benefits as well developing countries in particular may gain if the united states includes international offsets in ghg emission program in addition the offset market may create new economic opportunities and spur innovation as parties seek new met hods of generating offsets these issues are discussed below in greater detail costeffectiveness central argument in support of offset s is that their use makes an emissions reduction program more costeffective wide range of activities could be undertaken that would generate offset s many of these individual activ ities would likely generate relatively small quantity of offsets in terms of tons but in the aggregate their climate change mitigation potential is substantial arguably direct regulation of these sources either thr ough capandtrade program or regulatory commandandcontrol provisions23 may not be costeffective because of the administrative burden by allowing these sources to generate offsets and sell the offsets as emission credits to regulated entities several benefits are achieved first emissions are reduced avoided andor questered at sources that may not have otherwise occurred24 second the offsets generated in crease the compliance options for regulated entities covered facilities can either make direct onsite reductions or purchase emission credits generated from offsets the increased reduction opportunities provided by offsets are expected to lower the cost of compliance this impact ultimately affects cons umers because they are exp ected to bear the majority of an emission programs costs

up on among other things the current and proposed species of plants andor trees policymakers would likely enc ounter projects that offer tradeoffs for example they offset ghg emissions while imposing an unwanted outcome such as increased water use reducing availability downstream31 epa found that the more aggressive offset opportun ities afforestation and bi ofuels production are more likely to present the most distinct tradeoffs32 potential benefits to developing nations most observers would agree that developing nations are unlikely to limit and reduce ghg emissions on schedule on par with developed na tions with less regulated emission sources the universe of eligible offset opportunities would be much larger in developing nations offset types such as renewable energy andor energy efficiency projects which could face substantial hurdles to qualify as offsets in the united states would be eligible ffsets from developing nations these types of projects would likely provide envi ronmental benefits beyond ghg emission reduction improvements in local air quality by displacing or avoiding combustion of fossil fuels offset projects in developing nations ve the potential to promote sustainable development such as creation of an energy infrastructure that is less carbonintensive and more energy efficient in fact this was one of the objectives in establishing the clean development mechanism cdm whether this objective is being met is subject of debate howeve r recent projections suggest that offset activities that promote sustainable development will account for larger percentage of emissions credits in the coming years in general renewable energy and energy efficiency projects contribute more to sustainable development than the offset projects that have dominated the cdm so far figure 2 as comparison between figure 2 and figure 3 indicates the proportion of renewable energy and ener gy efficiency projects in the cdm is expected to more than double by 2012 this pr ojected shift would likely improve support for sustainable development objec tives however offset projects primarily hfc and n2o reduction from industrial ac tivities that provide fewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436crs12 sustainable development benefits are still expected to account for approximately 50 of emission credits issued source for figure 2 and figure 3 prepared by crs

entities and ultimately consumers 34 see ken buesseler et alocean iron fertilization moving forward in sea of uncertainty science vol 319 2008 162 and whether or not international offsets are allowed if international offset projects are included in the program some us business sectors may benefit from the transfer of technology andor services to support pr ojects in other nations if international offsets generally the lowestcost options are excluded the offset projects from the domestic agriculture and forestry sectors would likely gain greater share of the offsets market thus generating bus iness opportunities in these sectors33 another potential benefit that is often highlighted is the ability of an offset market to encourage innovation as th carbon price provides an incentive for regulated entities to find onsite emission reductions eg through efficiency improvements or developmen t of new technologies th offset market may spur parties to find new ways to reduce avoi d or sequester emissi ons from nonregulated sources however there is some concer n that the drive to find creative offset methods may encourage offset projects that yield unknown unintended and possibly harmful environmental effects frequently cited example in this regard is ocean fertilization which seeks to stimulate phytoplankton gr owth and ultimately improve co2 sequestration by releasing iron into certain parts of the surface ocean 34 potential concerns although offsets have the potential to provide benefits under an emissions trading program several issues associated with offsets have generated concern and some controversy perhaps the primary concern regarding offsets is their integrity to be credible an offset should equa to an emission reduction from direct emission source such as smokestack or exhaust pipe this issue is critical if offsets are to be used in an emissions trading program however implementing this objective would likely present challenges this and other concerns are discussed below supplementarity supplementarity refers to the idea that the role of offsets in an emission reduction program should be secondary to reduction effo rts at regulated emission sources the term comes from the text of the kyoto protocol which states that emissions credits or offsets must be supplemental to domestic actions for the purpose of meeting quantified emissi on limitati ons and reduction commitments article 17 em phasis added integrity concerns if offsets are to be included in an emissions trading program offset integrity ie whether or not the offsets represent real emission reductions is criticalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436crs14 35 see world resources institute the greenhouse gas protocol for project accounting 2005 at h ttp wwwghgprotocolorg 36 the emissions data may not be direct meas urement but an estimate calculated by using related data such as fuel consumptionseveral issues need to be addressed when evaluating offsets some of these issues may present implementation challenges which if not overcome could damage the integrity of the offset these issues are discussed below additionality additionality means that the offset project represents an activity that is beyond what would have occurred under business asusual scenario in other words would the emission re ductions or sequestra tion have happened anyway additionality is generally considered to be the most significant factor that determines the integrity of the offset in the context of an emissions control program test of additionality would examine whether the offset project would have gone forward in the absence of the program an additionality determination would likely consider the following questions does the activity represent common practice or conforms to an industry standard is the offset project required under ot her federal state or local laws would the project generate financia l gain eg be profitable due to revenues from outside the offset market35 offset credits allow regulated tities to generate ghg emissions above individual compliance obligations if pr oject developers are able to generate emission credits for projects that would have occurred regardless ie in the absence of the trading program the influx of th credits into the program would undermine the emissions cap and the value of other legitimate offset projects additionality is at the crux of an offsets integrity but applying the additionality criterion may present practical challenges for instance it may be impossible to accurately determine what would have happened anyway for some projects assessing projects additionality may i nvolve some degree of subjectivity which may lead to inconsistent additionality determinations measurement reliable ghg emissions data are keystone component of any climate change program if congress allows offsets as compliance option offset data emissions reduced avoided or sequestered should arguably be as reliable as data from regu lated sources from pr actical standpoint however achieving this objective may be difficult it is generally much simpler to measure and quantify an emission reduction from direct source than from an offset project indeed the more difficult measurement may be the main reason such reductions are not required by control program regulated sources determine their comp liance by comparing actual ghg emissions data against their allowed emissions36 in contrast project developers determine offset emission data by comparing the expected reduced avoided or sequestered ghg emissions against projected business asusual scenario sometimes referred to as counterfactual scenario httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436crs15 37 see crs report rl34059 the carbon cycle implica tions for climate change and congress

largescale deforestation proceedings of the nati onal academy of sciences vol 104 2007 65506555 to accomplish this task offset project managers must establish an emissions baseline an estimate of the businessasusual scenario or the emissions that would have occurred without the project if pr oject managers inaccurately estimate the baseline the offsets sold may not ma tch the actual reductions achieved for example an overestimated baseline would generate an artificially high amount of offsets baseline estimation may present t echnical challenges in addition project developers have financia l incentive to err on the high side of the baseline determination because the higher the projected baseline the more offsets generated requiring thirdparty verifi cation as some proposals do would potentially address this specific concern biological sequestration ffset projects may present particular challenges in terms of measurement the carbon cycl in trees and soils is only partially understood37 variations exist across tree speci ages soil conditions geographic locations and mana gement practices38 estimates of carbon uptake and storage are frequently considered imprecise or unreliable further changes in vegetation cover may have nonemission effects on climate such as how much of the suns energy is reflected or absorbed by the earth recent study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences stated latitudespecific defo restation experiments indicate that afforestation projects in the tropics would be clearly beneficial in mitigating globalscale warming but would be c ounterproductive if implemented at high latitudes and would offer only marginal benefits in temperate regions39 doublecounting to be credible when an offset is sold it should be retired and not sold again or counted in other contexts however opportunities for double counting exist for example regulated entity may purchase offsets generated through the development of wind farm in nation that has not established ghg emissions targets the us buyer woul d count the offsets which may have been purchased to negate increased onsite emissi ons at the regulated source in addition the nation in which the wind farm is locat ed would likely see an emissions reduction due to the wind farm if this decrease is reflected in the nations ghg emissions inventory the offset proj ect wind farm might replace other reduction activities that the nation might have take n to meet its target some may argue that doublecounting is ss of problem if the offset project occurs in nation with only voluntary ta rget as opposed to nation subject the kyoto protocol however the impact w ould be the same if the nation eventually establishes mandatory target and takes credit for the earlier reductions associated with the offset project by taking cr edit for an earlier reduction the nation might need to make fewer reductions to be in compliance with the new mandatory

system that follows international offset trading the latter would require at minimum cooperation with the nations hosting the offset projects permanence with some offset projects there may be concern that the emission offsets will be subsequently negated by human activity eg change in land use or natural occurrence eg forest fire disease or pestilence this issue is most pertinent to biological sequestrati on projects specifically forestry activities although many observers expected forestry offsets to play large role in the cdm this has not been observed in practice th is result is partially due to concerns of offset permanence in developing nations41 offset buyers need some assurance that the land set aside for forests and carbon sequestration will not be used for conflicting purpose eg logging or urban development in the future although natu ral events fires or pests are hard to control human activity can be constraine d through legal documents such as land easements in addition an offset could come with guarantee that it would be replaced if the initial reducti on is temporary permanen ce may be more difficult to monitor at international projects leakage in the context of climate ch ange policy ghg emissions leakage generally refers to situation in which an emissions decrease from regulated ie capped source leads to an emissions increase from an unregulated source epa states that leakage occurs when economic activity is shifted as result of the emission control regulation and as re sult emission abatement achieved in one location that is subject to emission control regulation is diminished by increased emissions in unregulated locations42 leakage scenarios may involve emi ssion sources from the same economic sector but located in differe nt countries many voice concern that if the united states were to cap emissions from specifi c domestic industries eg cement paper these industries would relocate to nations without emission caps and increase activity and thus emissions to compensate for the decreased productivity in the united states thus global net emissions w ould not decrease and affected domestic industries would likely see employment losses in the context of offsets leakage ma occur in an analogous fashion the opportunity for leakage exists when an offs et project decreases the supply of good in one location leading to greater produc tion of the good somewhere else compared to other offset types forestry projects particularly those that sequester carbon byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436crs17 43 nicholas institute for

restricts timber harvesting at specific site may boost logging at an alternative location thus reducing the effectiveness of the offset project44 preventing or accounting for leakage from these projects poses challenge delay of technology development as discussed above the inclusion of ffsets would likely lower the overall cost of compliance although many consider this desired outcome some contend that the price of carbon needs to reach levels high nough to promote the longterm technological changes needed to mitigate climate change offsets also can delay key industries in vestments in transformative technologies that are necessary to meet the declin ing cap for instance unlimited availability of offsets could lead utilities to build highemitting coal plants instead of investing in efficiency renewables or plants equipped with carbon capture and storage45 transaction costs transaction costs generally refer to the costs associated with an exchange of goods or services in an offset mark et transaction costs may encompass the following searching for offset opportunities studying andor measuring offset projects negotiating contracts monitoring and verifying re duced avoided

requires project velopments to meet certain provisions additionality measurement verification mon itoring to maintain the integrity of the offset allowed as compliance alternatives concerns in developing nations some argue that offset use particul arly unlimited access to international offset opportunities raises questi ons of fairness most of the worlds ghg emissions especially on per capita basis are gene rated in the develope d nations while most of the lowercost offset opportunities are in developing nations many observers expect the developing nations to tablish mandatory ghg reduction programs several years if not decades after veloped nations emission programs are underway the developed nations are likel to initiate the lowercost projects and retire the offsets thus rem oving the lowhanging fruit if and when the developing nations subsequently establish ghg em ission caps the lowercost compliance alternatives would not be available to them48 some have described this as form of environmental colonialism49 another concern is that international offsets may serve as disincentive for developing nations to enact laws or regulations limiting ghg emissions for instance if developing nation establishe d emission caps or crafted regulations for particular emissions sources reductions from these sources would longer qualify as offsets developing nations may be hesitant to forego the funding provided by offset projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436crs19 50 this attribute also creates critical challenges for policymakers for instance if one nation invests in emission reductions any resulting benefits eg decreased atmospheric ghg concentration would be shared by all nations in cluding those that continue to increase their emissions this dynamic has led some to refer to climate change as the ultimate global commons pollution problem because it discour ages unilateral emission reduction see henry lee 2001 us climate policy factors and constraints in climate change science strategies solutions eileen clausen editor considerations for congress from climate change perspective the location of an emission activity does not matter ton of co2 or its equivalent in another ghg reduced in the united states and ton sequestered in another nati on would have the same result on the atmospheric concentration of ghgs more over unlike many air pollutants eg acid rain precursors sulfur dioxide and n itrogen oxide particulate matter and mercury localized increase or decrease of co2 emissions does not directly impart corresponding local or regional c onsequences this attribute of co2 emissions the primary ghg allows for offset opportunities50 if allowed as part of an emissions re duction program offsets have the potential to provide various benefits the ability to generate offsets may provide an incentive for nonregula ted sources to reduce avoid or sequester emissions where these actions would not have occurred if not for the offset program expand emission mitigati on opportunities thus reducing compliance costs for regulated entities offer environmental cobenefits for certain projects support sustainable development in developing nations and create new economic opportunities nd spur parties to seek new methods of generating offsets the main concern with offset projects is whether or not they produce their stated emission reductions to be credible an offset ton should equate to ton reduced from direct emission source such as smokestack or exhaust pipe if offset projects generate emission credits for activities that would have occurred anyway ie in the absence of the emission tradin g program these credits would not satisfy the principle of additionality for many offset projects determining additionality will likely pose challenge other offset implementation issues baseline estimation permanence accounting monitori ng may present difficulties as well if illegitimate offset credits flow into the trading program the cap would effectively expand and credible emissions reductions would be undermined the program would fail to meets its ultimate objective overall ghg emissions reductions offset projects vary by the quantity of emission credits they could generate and the implementation complexity they present for instance domestic landfill methane projects are comparatively simple to measure and verify but offer relatively small quantity of offsets in contrast biological sequestration activities particularly forestry projects offer th most offsetgenerating potential but many of these projects pose multiple implementation challenges this may create tension forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34436crs20 51 national commission on energy policy 2007 energy policy recommendations to the president and the 110th congress policymakers who might want to include the offset projects that provide the most emission reduction opportunities while minimizing the use of offset projects that pose more implementation complications addressing these challenges may require independent auditing andor an appreciable level of oversight and administrative support from government agencies report from the national commission on energy policy stated proposals that expect to achieve significant 10 percent compliance through offsets in the near term will be obligated to create substantial enforcement bureaucracy or risk an influx of illegitimate credits51 if concerns of legitimacy can be resolved the next question for policymakers may be whether the potential benefits provided by offsets would outweigh any potential harm one debate may involve whether including offsets would send the appropriate price signal to encourage the development and deployment of new technologies such as carbon capture nd storage policymakers may consider striking balance between sending strong price signal and reducing the costs of the emissions reduction program another debate may focus on the possible effects of offsets in the developing world assuming international offsets are allowed in federa l program on one hand many of the offset projects may offe r significant benefits more efficient energy infrastructure improved air quality to local communities on the other hand some maintain that if developed nations use all of the lowcost offsets in developing nations the developing na tions will face higher compliance costs if and when they establish ghg emission reduction re quirements moreover there is some concern that international offsets may serv as disincentive fo r developing nations to enact laws or regulations limiting ghg emissions because they would lose funding from the offset market whether to include international offsets in federal program raises other considerations as well the ability to use international offsets for compliance purposes would substantially expand emi ssion reduction opportunities compared to only allowing domestic offsets th more emission mitigation opportunities available the lower the carbon price th is highlights the debate over the balance between overall program costs and price signal for tec hnological development if eligible in us program inte rnational offsets from countries without binding reduction targets are likely to dominate in early decades because of their comparatively lower costs certain domestic economic sectors primarily agriculture and forestry if eligible as offsets would benefit if international offsets are excluded however the inclusion of internationa l offsets may benef it other us economic sectors
