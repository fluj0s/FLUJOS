05 kiev 4590 c kiev 1081 classified by ambassador reason 14 bd 1 c summary while the results of ukraines march 26 parliamentary and local elections are not yet final and negotiations to form majority rada coalition have not yet concluded it is already clear that the elections highlighted number of winners and losers as well as trends in ukraines developing political landscape fundamentally voting for the verkhovna rada reinforced the results of the ultimate orange win in the 2004 presidential election with remarkably similar aggregate numbers majority of ukrainians supported politiciansparties with overtly prowestern proreform orientations the 2006 results also confirmed substantial shifts in the electorate from the 2002 rada election besides westernoriented proreform ukrainians winners were first and foremost the tymoshenko bloc byut and secondarily party of regions and the socialists plus the democratic initiatives polling firm and newly empowered locally elected authorities the biggest losers were rada speaker lytvyn as an individual and president yushchenkos peoples union our ukraine as party secondarily orange splinter forces like kostenkos ukrainian peoples party porareforms and order poraprp and yuri karmazins bloc as well as prorussian hard oppositionists natalya vitrenko the spduo and the communists comment with only five parties in the rada and vitrenko forced to reprise her role as streetprotest gadfly the ukrainian political scene may actually be more stable than many had feared leading up to the election even though the same intraorange squabbling and orangeblue battles are almost guaranteed to continue in 2006 and beyond end summary and comment the real winners ukraine those who were on the maidan 2 c while election tables from the 2006 rada elections will show that regions received 32percent plurality the real winners of the march 26 election were ukraine and the ukrainian people themselves which pulled off the most successful election among former soviet republics outside of the baltics along with majority of ukrainians who had embraced fundamentally prowestern proreform future in 2004 by voting for yushchenko and then taking to the streets to prevent yanukovych and the kuchma regime elements from stealing victory despite incompetence and intraorange squabbling by the maidan team in office significantly lower growth figures and disillusionment among ordinary ukrainians in 2005 voters on march 26 delivered remarkably similar percentage of votes to the parties who stood together on maidan as they had to yushchenko in 2004 just over half the voters voted for orange parties or similarly oriented forces in the december 2004 presidential revote yushchenko received 52 of the vote to yanukovychs 44 note with 9995 percent of precincts reporting the orange forces of byut our ukraine and the socialists will have 243 seats in the rada or 54 percent party winner byut 3 sbu based on expectations heading into the election the runaway winner march 26 appears to be byut which most preelection polls for months had predicted would finish third with around 15 of the vote in the competition for maidan votes byut bested our ukraine handily some 22 to 14 byut won pluralities in 13 central and western ukrainian oblasts plus kiev compared to only three for our ukraine byut also more than tripled its 2002 rada vote 72 furthermore byut built organizations in eastern and southern ukraine often running second to regions only byut and the socialists can currently lay claim to being truly national parties byut may have benefited from being out of government tapping into voter discontent as well as being led by the most charismatic of ukrainian politicians yuliya tymoshenko but byuts effective grass roots organization and focused campaign tactics deserve great deal of credit ref that leaves byut and tymoshenko herself wellpositioned for future election cycles 2009 presidential 2011 rada secondary winners regions and socialists 4 c while many western press stories immediately labeled yanukovych and party of regions the victors in the march 26 vote based on their plurality regions success is more nuanced regions did not aspire to be national party in kiev 00001261 002 of 004 this election cycle instead as yanukovych told us in early november 2005 regions was running to protect its base in the east and south against the communists and vitrenko ref b regions ran wellfinanced wellorganized campaign successfully consolidating that base which had largely voted communist in the 1998 and 2002 rada elections regions won the nine oblasts plus sevastopol that yanukovych carried in 2004 securing slightly more than twothirds of the support yanukovych received then employing american consultants rather than kremlin operatives to advise it on tactics and outreach to the media and western interlocutors regions also partially rehabilitated an image tarnished by its attempts to steal the 2004 election regions challenge looking forward will be to develop strategy that appeals beyond its base 5 sbu the socialists spu can also be considered secondary winner in the 2006 cycle even if they aspired to more than the 57 they received in their predicted fourthplace finish the socialists expanded nationwide party structure and polled nearly evenly across the country the only such ukrainian political force to do so they confirmed party leader olexander morozs 2004 presidential firstround thirdplace support 58 which pushed them past the communists for the first time as ukraines leading leftist in traditional european terms force ref b while the socialist niche is modest it is welldefined with generally forwardlooking positive political agenda its economic ideas however remain antediluvian the spu succeeded despite that fact that it being in power deprived it of the chance to tap into the protest vote which had contributed to the spus 69 showing in the 2002 rada elections democratic initiatives and the exit poll consortium 6 sbu the widely respected democratic initiatives di polling firm should also be considered one of the winners of the 2006 election cycle alone of ukraines major polling firms di captured the crucial dynamic of the campaign end game byut surging and our ukraine slipping in its final published poll march 10 note ukrainian law bans polls two weeks prior to elections while the institute of social and political psychology of the ukrainian academy of pedagogical sciences showed byut ahead of our ukraine in its final march 10 poll it did not have track record of previous polls all other polling firms showed our ukraine holding onto the 34 lead over byut it had enjoyed since midjanuary democratic initiatives combined with the razumkov center and the kiev international institute of sociology to run an exit poll march 26 that accurately predicted the final results of the election within their stated margin of error local and regional elected officials 7 sbu the winner in the kiev mayoral race leonid chernovetsky shocked everyone in besting not only incumbent mayor omelchenko but also exwbc heavyweight boxing champion klychko running on the poraprp ticket chernovetsky ran stealth campaign which clearly managed to secure larger share of the antiomelchenko vote than klychko 8 sbu finally other winners in the march 26 elections but which received little attention internationally are the oblast town and district councils that were elected along with mayors under constitutional reform and the delayed administrative reform which will serve as counterpart to changes in governance at the national level in kiev these provincial and local bodies will receive more resources and authority in the coming years the elections under proportional representation clarified allegiances to voters previously faced with many unaffiliated local strongmen improving accountability the election also gives the councils clear democratic mandate in negotiating with the center including the unelected governors appointed by kiev the big losers lytvyn and our ukraine 9 sbu the biggest individual loser of the 2006 election cycle was undoubtedly rada speaker lytvyn whose eponymous bloc failed to reach the 3percent threshold for the rada leaving lytvyn out in the cold lytvyns bloc spent more money on advertising than any other party but regions according to official central election commission cec figures and lytvyn commanded 63 mps in the current rada 15 overall lytvyns campaign suffered from fatal flaws however it lacked any real organization beyond collection of names at the national and local district level many of whom were tainted with the kuchmaist label note lytvyn kiev 00001261 003 of 004 served as kuchmas chief of staff prior to becoming rada speaker in 2002 the lytvyn bloc had real message for voters beyond proposing itself and lytvyn as referee to reunite ukraine between warring orange and blue factions in the end lytvyns vote total barely topped 600000 the number of members his party claimed to have 10 c the biggest party loser was yushchenkos peoples union our ukraine puou the core of the our ukraine election bloc which defied preelection polls to slump into third place and below 14 on election dayxxxxxxxxxxxx had told us in late january that puous organization was in complete shambles would stagger to the election and would need to rebuild from the ground up afterwards preelection provincial visits confirmed xxxxxxxxxxxx gloomy assessment our ukraine had visible effective organization outside of lviv and several other western provinces relying primarily on slick expensive tv campaign and orange revolution nostalgia voters did not respond 11 c our ukraines disappointing performance which has been characterized by many as defeat for yushchenko is also reminder that yushchenkos electorate in 2004 voted for him out of several motivations not just in favor of yushchenko one early 2005 survey indicated that only 37 percent of those who said they had voted for yushchenko had done so primarily because they supported yushchenko personally 34 percent did so primarily to protest kuchmaism and 29 percent did so primarily to defend their right to choose puous party leadership is currently dominated by the same unpopular orange oligarchs poroshenko zhvaniya tretyakov chervonenko who yushchenko was forced to jettison in the september 2005 government shakeup but who still form yushchenkos kitchen cabinet our ukraines poor organization for the 2006 election cycle does not bode well either for yushchenkos presumed run for reelection in 2009 or for the next rada cycle in 2011 unless it follows xxxxxxxxxxxx advice and rebuilds its organization the orange splinters repeating the mistakes of the 1990s 12 sbu two of the more organized party elements of the initial fiveparty our ukraine bloc that won 236 plurality in the 2002 rada elections yuri kostenkos ukrainian peoples party upp and the reforms and order party prp decided to run independently from the our ukraine bloc in 2006 primarily because of disagreements with yushchenko and his entourage in doing so they repeated the mistake both made in 1998 when they ran separately and failed to reach the threshold while both factions will enter variety of city and provincial councils with their modified blocs kostenkoplushch poraprp their vote totals in the rada race 19 and 15 respectively along with that of our ukraine mp yuri karmazin who ran separately 07 were lost prorussian hardliner opposition marginalized for now 13 sbu regions heavily prorussian campaign rhetoric prorussian language antinato prosingle economic space with russia belarus and kazakhstan undercut the appeal of two parties who made the trio of issues the center of their campaigns natalya vitrenkos peoples opposition bloc 29 and the ne tak bloc centered around the spduo 10 along with the communists 37 vitrenko ran vigorous street campaign falling just short of the threshold the spduo which received 63 of the 2002 rada vote bought extensive billboard ads throughout urban ukraine but had organization or street presence whatsoever the 2006 results and disappearance from the political scene confirmed the loss that it and its leader viktor medvedchuk suffered in 2004 as the most reviled force behind the excesses of the kuchma regime while the communists will have 21 seats in the next rada sitting their 2006 showing is but shadow of the 20 they received in 2002 they ran nearly invisible campaign their dedicated electorate is dying off and regions has effectively taken the eastern and southern antikiev protest vote that voted communist in 1998 and 2002 14 c it would be mistake to write off the prorussian marginalized opposition completely however vitrenko has proven staying power on the streets of ukraine with many observers suspecting she receives financial support from russia if regions ever transforms itself into more westernlooking reformoriented force part of its disgruntled protest electorate will likely turn elsewhere to voice its discontent with the communists dying and the spduo disappearing vitrenko may well finally make it into kiev 00001261 004 of 004 the rada as the next protest vehicle 15 u visit embassy kievs classified website at wwwstatesgovgovpeurkiev herbst
