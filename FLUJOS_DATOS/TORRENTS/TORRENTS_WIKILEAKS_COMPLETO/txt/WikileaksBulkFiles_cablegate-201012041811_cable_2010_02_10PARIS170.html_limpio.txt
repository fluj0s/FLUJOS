00000170 0012 of 004 classified by alexander vershbow asdisa reasons 14 bd ref usnato 56 1 snf summary secretary of defense robert gates secdef was hosted by french minister of defense herve morin for working lunch during an official bilateral visit to paris on february 8 2010 secdef and morin agreed on the basic themes to be included in natos revised strategic concept on missile defense secdef refuted morins contention that european missile defense system is both unwise and unnecessary but pledged to give france and other allies better information on the costs and command and control structure of the us proposal both morin and gates agreed that irans rejection of an engagement track meant that the time for pressure had arrived but both noted concern over chinas opposition to new security council resolution unscr on afghanistan secdef praised french contributions and highlighted ongoing trainer shortfalls secdef raised us concerns over the sale of mistralclass helicopter carrier to russia as sending mixed signal to both russia and our central and east european allies morin refuted this idea arguing that the sale was way to send message of partnership to russia at critical time morin requested that the upcoming us air force request for proposal rfp for new inflight refueling tanker aircraft be unbiased secdef told morin that he had full confidence that the rfp would be as fair as possible end summary nato strategic concept 2 snf morin welcomed secdef to france and asked about us positions regarding the revised nato strategic concept morin noted frances interest in document that would inject new ideas be adopted with great momentum and define natos roles and missions it should not just be restatement of the conventional wisdom 3 snf secdef told morin he favored short document that was perhaps three to five pages in length the strategic concept should move nato from traditional defensive alliance to security alliance that can address wide range of global threats secdef said that the strategic concept must better align resources with natos level of ambition it must lay out comprehensive approach to civilmilitary cooperation and enhance partnerships with the eu and other international organizations secdef concluded that above all financial and broader structural reform must be pursued either as part of the strategic concept or in parallel 4 snf morin agreed on length and the need for nato to take on new missions but he wondered what types of missions members had in mind cyber attacks terrorism proliferation missile defense morin also stated his belief that nato needed to bring some clarity to its area of operation so that nato did not end up extending to the pacific he added that in his view extending the alliance to georgia would weaken article 5 secdef stated his preference for nato to focus its efforts in the euroatlantic area perhaps extending into the mediterranean he concurred with morin that bigger alliance posed challenges 5 snf morin told secdef that the uk mod had proposed drafting joint frenchuk proposal on nato reform to then present to the us noting that the objective was to overcome blockages from those countries that had underwhelming general staffs morin asked whether secdef thought it would be better for europe to build consensus at home and work its own ideas or for europe and the united states to develop joint proposals secdef replied that he thought it best not to have two proposals but that he would consult with secstate he also said he hoped that the senior officials group would come up with some concrete and viable ideas for reform missile defense 6 snf morin having expressed strong reservations to new us and nato missile defense md plans at the nato ministerial in istanbul reftel said he wanted to explain how france sees md and raise some questions first he believes that the shift from theater missile defense tmd to defense of populations and territory will give publics false sense of security since the sword was ultimately stronger than the shield for france security came from strong defense and deterrence second morin asked what threat the system aims to counter nuclear states or rogue states third morin asked about funding and how european countries would participate in command and control c2 decisions morin summarized his own personal opposition to md by asserting that the us and europe have differing mentalities on defense spending he said the us has true resiliency with paris 00000170 0022 of 004 infinite means while in europe defense spending has collapsed in every country but the uk and france as result any development needing common funding will dilute the already weak european defenses morin concluded by stating that it was folly to assume that md would give us added security 7 snf secdef refuted morins arguments pointing out that md contributes to deterrence secdef explained to morin that the system was aimed at nations with handful of nuclear weapons and limited but growing missile capability to launch them noting iran fits that profile secdef said that md provides good deterrent against limited attacks 8 snf secdef agreed with mod morin that the us owed nato answers on c2 costs and the role of common funding he pledged to provide more details on these issues as well as on how altbmd and the us phased adaptive approach paa fit together however secdef said it was important to move ahead with the md study that was endorsed at the 2009 nato summit since it would provide some of the answers france was seeking secdef reminded morin that potus will want to obtain decision affirming the alliance role in md at the lisbon summit in late 2010 9 snf responding to secdefs discussion of md morin asked why there was need to shift from theater to population defense secdef said the systems the us was deploying have broader applications for example the thaad system which the us had deployed to hawaii as measure against north korean threat protects both the theater and the population gates offered the aegis shipborne sm3 which was used to shoot down defunct satellite as second example of system that could also have broader applications and deter iran from holding us hostage by threatening missile launches 10 snf recalling that russian prime minister putin once told him iran was russias greatest threat secdef noted that russia could plug into the new system secdef highlighted two russian objections to the former system first the radar in the czech republic would have been so powerful that it could see into russia second russia believed that the threestage groundbased interceptor could have been converted easily to an offensive weapon the sm3 missiles in the new approach can only be defensive in nature however for these reasons the us believed partnering with russia is once again potentially possible note following the meetings morins critical comments on missile defense were disavowed by senior officials at the mod and the mfa who said that his views were his own and that the us should essentially erase what he had just said end note iran 11 snf shifting from missile defense to iran secdef noted that russia is now of different mind on iran because of tehrans persistent rejection of international proposals for negotiated solutions and its concealment of the qom facility secdef believed russia would be supportive of new unscr although it may have different views on the severity of sanctions but he expressed concern about china secdef said that russia could perhaps help on china but that securing the support of other nonpermanent security council members was also an issue in this regard secdef told morin he had been blunt with turkish prime minister erdogan telling him that if iran developed nuclear weapons we were facing two scenarios nuclear proliferation in the middle east or regional war or perhaps both 12 snf morin asked secdef if he believed israel had the capability to strike iran without us support secdef responded that he didnt know if they would be successful but that israel could carry out the operation secdef told morin that he believed conventional strike by any nation would only delay iranian plans by one to three years while unifying the iranian people to be forever embittered against the attacker 13 snf mod morin agreed that china could be problematic on the unscr and queried secdef how the us believed we could ensure their vote especially in light of the upcoming dalai lama visit and the us weapons sale to taiwan secdef told morin that because of congressionally mandated rules the us was required to provide defensive weapons for taiwan he observed that every time the us makes the sales to taiwan the chinese suspend militarytomilitary relations but only for the short term pakistan 14 snf morin expressed doubt about the willingness of the pakistani paris 00000170 003 of 004 government to fight extremists at home he noted that karzai had told the french that if the pakistanafghanistan border were closed it would largely solve issues in afghanistan secdef replied that he had told the pakistani government two weeks earlier that qaeda was helping the pakistan taliban to destabilize pakistan secdef highlighted the dramatic changes in pakistan over the past 18 months especially in swat and bajaur provinces which offered some hope of progress secdef said that there was increasing coordination between us and pakistani forces across the border afghanistan 15 snf turning to afghanistan mod morin began by stating that although he had announced an additional 80 trainers france had also sent nonofficial contribution as well note morin was referring to classified deployment of french special forces that have limited mission to find two kidnapped french journalists end note france had also sent an additional deployment of engineers to work exclusively on the counteried mission morin underscored that france had significantly increased its contributions in afghanistan in the past 18 months from 2700 troops to nearly 4000 16 snf secdef said the us understood the domestic situation and that he would not have pressed france publicly for more forces until after the march elections however secdef requested that france strongly consider substantially increasing military and police trainers secdef said that while he would publicly praise french troops which us troops consider terrific fighters he was fine with keeping these discussions close hold 17 snf shifting topics morin questioned the decision to specifically name mid2011 as the start of withdrawal which morin thought would simply make the taliban wait it out secdef noted that whether to set date for transition had led to one of the most protracted debates in washington in recent months secdef had come to the conclusion however that the afghans needed to be put on notice that they would need to take responsibility for their own security he pointed out that there is end date for us involvement july 2011 is just the beginning of process potus was very clear that the transition would be conditionsbased morin agreed with this and urged that clear benchmarks be set that could reassure public opinion secdef concurred and observed that the us public will not tolerate prolonged stalemate russiamistral 18 snf secdef expressed us concerns about the mistral sale to russia he told morin that because of sarkozys involvement in brokering ceasefire in georgia which russia was not fully honoring the sale would send the wrong message to russia and to our allies in central and east europe 19 snf morin told secdef pointedly that he had pushed hard for the sale he conceded that it was indeed warship for power projection but morin asked rhetorically how we can tell russia we desire partnership but then not trust them morin told secdef that he understood the us position on considering central and east european allies concerns about the perceived threat from russia morin argued however that this single ship would not make any difference with respect to russian capabilities as russias naval production ability was severely degraded 20 snf secdef replied that us concerns were not about military capacity but about messaging some allies because of their past experiences are still very concerned with russia and are not sure how much to trust the west secdef observed that russian democracy has disappeared and the government was an oligarchy run by the security services president medvedev has more pragmatic vision for russia than pm putin but there has been little real change kcx tanker rfp 21 snf morin told secdef he had one final but major topic to raise the us contract tender for new tanker plane he asked that the rfp be issued so that competition was equal for both companies and there was bias morin stressed that it was important for our market economy to be twoway street he told secdef that if the terms of competition are unequal eads would not submit bid 22 snf secdef stated his belief that the rfp would be fair he paris 00000170 004 of 004 told morin that the air force had established the requirements he noted that since the previous competition he had fired both the civilian and military leaders of the air force and that there was new person in charge of the pentagons acquisition policy secdef said that it would be disappointing if eads did not submit proposal 23 u secdef has cleared this cable drafted by osd staff rivkin
