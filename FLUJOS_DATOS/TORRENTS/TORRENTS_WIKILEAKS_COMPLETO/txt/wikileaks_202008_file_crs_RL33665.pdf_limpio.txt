from time to time as revenue was needed but the changes were generally m oderate tariff polic during this period generated little controversy since the primary goal of tariff policy was to raise revenue rather than import protection the most heated debates during this peri od were over the use of internal revenue sources excise and direct taxes th federalists wanted to wield the taxing powers provided in the constitution in 1791 an excise tax on distilled spirits was enacted while revenue from this excise tax never amounted to much it was widely unpopular and touched off the whiskey re

abolish excise and direct taxes by 1811 tota l internal revenue amounted to about 2000 or about 001 of to tal federal revenues the war of 1812 brought new demands fo r revenue the tariff schedule was doubled in 1812 but customs revenue fell as in ternational trade wa s curtailed by the war and probably by the tariff gross imports fell by 71 between 1812 and 18132 in 1813 congress approved set of excise nd direct taxes the taxes however were as one historian notes clearly devoted to prosecution of the fighting and they were just as clearly designed to end as soon as the crisis ended3 internal revenue accounted for almost 30 of federal reve nue in 1815 and for less than 1 by 1819 the reduced import competition during the war of 1812 contributed to the development and expansion of us manufacturing after the war debate over tariff policy shifted from raising re venue to protecting the oung manufacturing industries the tariff act of 1816 has been described as the beginning of protectionist era in us trade policy in truth however th tariff act was only m oderately protective and less protective than ma ny manufacturers had hoped4 while there was some support for protective tariffs in congress there appears to have been little public support for protection until the financial crisis of 18181819 internal revenue excise and direct taxe s was negligible source of federal revenue for the next 40 years often amounting to less than 500 annually the major source of revenue was customs du ties accounting for about 85 of total revenue see figure 1 protectionist pressure was

tariffs and low tariffs between 1832 and 1842 ther was gradual reduction in tariffs only to be followed by strongly protectionist period to 1846 the tariff act of 1846 reduced tariffs and tariffs were ag ain reduced by the tariff act of 18576 the other significant source of federal revenue during this period was sales of public land on average revenue from pub lic land sales was qual to about 14 of

when the federal government budget was in surplus the income tax was briefly reestablished in 1894 but was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court in 1895 on the ground that it was direct tax

drawn into world war i the most controversial measure was the excess profits tax as result of the tax increases internal revenues primarily excise and income tax revenues accounted for 72 of total federal revenue in 1917 and 88 by 1918 total federal revenue increased by almost 500 between 1917 and 1919 the harding administration elected in 1920 moved to reduce the war time taxes the reason behind the changes in the tax code was not only to reduce taxes but also to thoroughly revi the revenue act of 191815 however the resulting legislation the revenue ac t of 1921 pleased almost one and was subsequently described as merely collection of patches on an old act by former commissioner of internal revenue16 the act reduced the rates of the income surtax eliminated the excessprofits tax and increased various exemptions and deductions throughout the 1920s tax rates were re duced and tax loopholes were added in the midst of the depression however the revenue act of 1932 imposed new excise taxes raised income tax rates and reduced income tax exemptions the reason for this contractionary economic po licy was to close the growing budget gap despite the 1932 tax hikes and subsequent increases in 1933 and 1934 income tax revenue actually fell until 1935 the economic recovery contributed to rising income tax revenues beginning in 1935 the re peal of prohibition in 1933 brought in revenue from the excise tax on alcohol taxes which had remained on the books during prohibition the social security act of 1935 created the social security program and imposed payroll tax to pay for social s ecurity benefits see the area marked social insurance in figure 1 between 1929 and 1941 tax revenues increased from 29 billion or 28 of gdp to 73 billi on or 57 of gdp the increased tax revenues were almost entirel due to increased income tax rates the introduction of the payroll tax and the economic recovery17 taxes were increased significantly and the tax base greatly expanded during world war ii the number of individual taxpayers increased from 175 million in 1941 to 426 million in 1945 furthermore total tax revenues reached 423 billion or 19 of gdp in 1945 although income ta xes were reduced after the end of the war tax revenues still am ounted to 13 of gdp in 1950 over twice the percentage before the war the growth in federal revenues af ter 1935 was to fund the new
