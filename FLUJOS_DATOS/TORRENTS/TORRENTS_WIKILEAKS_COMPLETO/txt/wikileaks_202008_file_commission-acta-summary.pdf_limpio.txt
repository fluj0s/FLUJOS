european commission directorategeneral for trade brussels 30092009 ref 58809 llliiimmmiiittteeeddd acta negotiations attached acta internet chapterthis is to inform ms about the stateofplay of the internet enforcement chapter that should be discussed at the next acta negotiating round in seoul korea on 2224 september dg trade participated in the euus ipr working group which took place in washington in side meeting with the ustr us lead negotiators on acta at their request the us colleagues informed us about the progress in the preparation of draft text of the future internet chapter of acta us reported that they have been working on draft text since the end of the 5th round end of july and that this was basically finalised however they are still involved in internal consultations with other government agencies and number of private stakeholders bound to strict confidentiality clauses therefore they were not willing to share with com or even to show us the text at this stage ustr indicated that these internal discussions were sensitive due to different points of view regarding the internet chapter both within the administration with congress and among stakeholders content providers on one side supporters of internet freedom on the other consequently they have to delay the release of the initial text longer than initially expected us expects the text to be circulated within the next 2 weeks com noted that if the text is received only 4 weeks before the next round this will not be sufficient to conclude internal eu discussions and therefore to present written counterproposals if any in seoul us acknowledged the issue this being said the us nevertheless provided detailed oral description of the text below is report of such description it is stressed that this report is provided as an advancewarning and preliminary indication of the content of us proposal but since it results from an oral presentation it may not fully reflect the final draft and should be analysed accordingly the draft internet text is around 3 pages long and it was generally modelled on the respective section of the recently concluded uskorea free trade agreement korus1 chapter 18 however in simpler and shorter manner it consists of the following sections section 1 baseline obligations inspired by article 41 trips imposing adequate and effective legal remedies as provided in relevant sections of acta civil penal for internet infringements section 2 acta members have to provide for thirdparty liability section 3 safeharbours for liability regarding isps based on section

interests of internet service providers isps and rightholders see also korus chapter 181030 according to us the language proposed is somewhere in the middle between the wipo internet treaties korus and the dmca which probably means that it is more detailed than the first but not as specific as the latter isps are defined as in section 512 k of dmca3 on the limitations from 3rd party liability to benefit from safeharbours isps need to put in place policies to deter unauthorised storage and transmission of ip infringing content ex clauses in customers contracts allowing inter alia graduated response from what we understood the us will not propose that authorities need to create such systems instead they require some selfregulation by isps this section 3 should also contain broad provisions regarding noticeandtakedown mechanisms section 4 will focus on technical protection measures tpms language inspired by usjordan freetrade agreement article 4134 as well as by the wipo internet treaties articles 11 wct and 18 wppt parties to provide adequate civil and criminal remedies that are specific to tpm infringements ie treat these as separate offenses form general copyright infringements tpm infringements would be i prohibition of circumvention of access controls and ii prohibition of manufacture and trafficking of circumventing drm devices there will be exceptions to these prohibitions available to acta members fair use will not be circumscribed there will be obligation for hardware manufacturers to ensure interoperability of tpms section 5 will focus on rights
