functioning of the natural gas market in 2007 appeared relatively stable and infrastructure development continued at an appropriate pace tighter demandsupply balance for 2008 however s generated more upward spot price movement in this latest period from the beginning to the end of the 20072008 heating season the average wellhead price rose more than 30 according to energy information administration estimates in the foreseeable future weather and economic performance appear most likely to influence prices natural gas provided about 22 of us energy requirements in 2007 it will continue to be major element of the ove rall us energy market for the foreseeable future given its environmental advantages it will likely maintain an important market share in the growing electricity generation applications along with other clean power sources as congress seeks to address energy security issues the increasing importation of liquefied natural gas lng is also matter deserving careful attention in 2007 lng imports reached record high and plans are to increase this fuel source this report provides an update to congress on recent natural gas market developments and trends that have implications for important energy policy considerations such as prices natural gas use for power generation and liquefied natural gas imports from 2006 to 2007 the average wellhead price reported to the us energy information administration eia remain ed essentially unchanged at 639 per thousand cubic feet mcf down 001 the average citygate price increased about 3 to 698 per mcf dome stic production grew up about 08 trillion cubic feet and domestic consumption increased more than 1 trillion cubic feet this was the first increase in enduse consumpti on since 2004 according to eia natural gas use for electric power ge neration increased in 2007 by 105 and for the first time became the largest sector for natural gas consumption in the period covered by eia records residential us increased 82 with weather as major factor commercial and i ndustrial consumption also increased by 6 and 2 respectively the industrial growth re versed decline of 15 from 2005 to 2006 on the supply side onshore production in areas such as the rocky mountains and the barnett shales of texas grew and liquefied natural gas lng imports increased lng imports reached r ecord level of 08 trillion cubic

momentum in 2008 this report examines current conditions and trends in the us natural gas markets key market elements examin ed include prices consumption production imports and infrastructure expectations about the future as reflected in recent official forecasts are also incorporated here natural gas remains an important and environmentally attractive energy source for the united states its share of the pow er generation market has grown domestic supply has remained stable and even incr eased in recent months new developments in alaska increase the likelihood that pipeline from the north slope will proceed the natural gas industry continues to ttract capital for new pipeline and storage infrastructure liquefied natural gas l ng imports hit record level in 2007 even as import facilities tinue to have low utilization ra tes weather and the economy remain important factors in natural gas prices as well given the generally adequate functioning of natural gas markets congressional interest in the near term is likely to focus on unexpected price volatility or importation or other supply issues in the longer term industry pressure for increased access to public lands for ex ploration and production is expected to continue receiving congressional attention this report reviews key factors likely to affect market outcomes these factors include weather the economy oil pri ces and infrastructure development tables a1 to a4 in the appendix present selected highlight statistics that illustrate current market status briefly important developments in natural gas markets include the following the growth in natural gas for power generation has contributed to increased cons umption and reduced seasonal variation in use because gasforpower peaks in summer versus the total natural gas use winter peak in 2007 for the first time the power generation sector used more natural gas than any other sectorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34508crs2 1 energy information

working gas storage was at 1234 billion cubic feet the lowest level since april 30 20043 this may indicate that slack in the supply side is decreasing the united states had record lng imports in 2007 and increased lng imports appear likely natural gas infrastructure deve lopment continued to advance with many pipeline and st orage projects successfully completed in 2007 and more underway in 2008 including lng import facilities industrial natural gas us had small rebound in 2007 background unlike the global oil market natural gas markets remain generally regional with global trade in lng growing for the most part north america has continentwide market that is integrated through pipeline network that connects the lower48 states the most populous provinces of canada and parts of mexico prices throughout this integrated market are influenced by dema nd which may be influenced by weather economic conditions lternative fuel prices and other factors supply and the capacity available to link supply sour ces and demand loads transmission and distribution systems the us natural gas market is the major component of the north american natural gas market it accounts for about 81 of north american consumption and about 69 of north american supply the key price point in rth america is henry hub henry hub is major pipeline hub in erath louisiana that is us ed as the designated pricing and delivery point for the new york mercantile exchange nymex gas futures contract andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34508crs3 4 ibid p3 5 the citygate is the transfer point from hi gh pressure natural gas pipeline to local distribution companyother transactions the pr ice difference between other locations and henry hub is called the basis differential when there is spare capacity available to move natural gas from henry hub or the gulf of mexico region in general to the relevant price point area the basis differential tends to be low approximating the costs of fuel used to move the gas to the location when capac ity availability is tig ht basis differentials can grow because the driving force can become the value of the natural gas at the delivery point rather than the cost of getting the natural gas to that point natural gas prices also incorporate costs for distributing the gas from the wholesale marketplace to retail customers these rates are generally determined by state regulators and involve both 1 the appr oval of costs and rate s of return and 2 the allocation of costs among customer classes eg residential commercial industrial although the north american natural ga s market remains distinct regional market it is increasingly connecting to global gas marketplace through international lng trade oil prices still affect us natural gas prices and this relationship is changing market conditions the key elements of the market are prices consumption and supply this section provides highlights from recent market developments relating to these factors prices prices remained

was electric power deliveries to electri c power customers increased by 615 bcf more than 45 of the consumption growth for the year for the first time electric power use of natural gas became the largest enduse sector for natural gas15 perhaps even more striking is the relative increase in electric generator use of natural gas during winter in 2007 fercs division of energy market oversight

these factors have uncertainty associated with them as discussed next weather weather affects natural gas consump tion through both the significant space heating loads in the residential and commercial sectors and the cooling load served by gasfired power generation eia inco rporates national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa weather forecasts in its short and long term forecasts to the extent that actual heating degree days exceed the temperature scenario from noaa that w ill tend to increase demand for natural gas in the relevant heating seasons and increase prices for natural gas during those periods similarly if the actual cooling degree day requirements exceed those incorporated in the eia scenario then this will increase natural gas use in the cooling season via increased gasfired power for air conditioning and in crease the price for natural gas in the relevant cooling season oil prices natural gas prices and oil prices have long had correlation as the extent of oilgas fuel switching has declined this linkage has changed during 2007 as crude oil and petroleum product prices increase d relative prices for natural gas became lower than the historical pattern in the recent past natural ga s and oil product price competition tended to exhibit itself most clearly around the new york metropolitan area where there remained fair amount of fuel switching capab ility this fuel switching capability tended to keep natural gas prices at the new york citygate in range bounded on the high side by distillate fu oil prices and on the low side by low sulfur residual fuel oil prices in 2007 th relevant natural ga s prices tended to be below this range see figure 2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34508crs13 19 eia natural gas weekly april 10 2008 p 3source ferc division of market oversight office of enforcement oe energy market snapshot national version december 2007 data january 2008 p 23 the shift to outside this fuel price range suggests that the consumers had done all the fuel switching to natural gas that remained feasible then as oil prices moved above the relevant range gasongas co mpetition could have become the market force determining the natural gas prices economy economic growth affects consumers demand for natural gas and their ability to purchase it eia appears to have in corporated an economic outlook for 2008 that expects less growth than in its recent forecasts given the relative stability in the residential and comme rcial sector demand any chan ge in economic outlook would most likely affect industrial natural gas use most direc tly but it could also affect commodity prices and world oil prices recent developments since the end of 2007 several noteworthy developments have occurred in the natural gas markets eia
