prepclearing lecture given on 13 february 1962 thank you thank you and this is the 13th of feb ad 12 isnt it audience yes what do you know got it right without telling word all right now listen here youve just heard or seen demonstration of what happens with an incomplete list did you begin to realize that was the case did you did any of you realize that was the case audience yes the liability of letting pc go ahead and write list themselves without bleeding it down all right but that doesnt matter but the symptom i just learned something you could probably tell you know every time i said one was in or out you know i got the same fall did you notice that audience hmhmm i said it was in or out and then the fall would interrupt the next read so i couldnt tear along on the thing the way i ordinarily do at all i was having slow go of it and then of course i had pc who was helping she was helping with the session and of course she very badly wanted to get an item to show you how good that was you see and then she tells afterwards that well she thought data gatherer or what was it knowledge gatherer was it and actually when she talked to about the list one morning at breakfast i blurted it out quite automatically she was counting on my item now thats an incomplete list but i learned something there myself and that was you probably get surge of that particular type if you got an incomplete list i mean i thats not equivocal because we havent proven the list is incomplete but would seem that was likely interesting wasnt it huh yeah of course you realize giving demonstration like that under pressure is little bit hard on the pc but i was quite fascinated just from the standpoint of all of sudden what was i looking at here you know well i was looking at something that wasnt usual or ordinary well i was looking at an incomplete list was what i was looking at because you ask her are any of those is the item on that list female voice i dont think so well is it or isnt it do you know that it was did you have the feeling that it was at any time female voice not really not really female voice i cant wrap my wits around the enforced inflow myself how do you like that see i think thats pretty good thats good example when i first asked her if you remember the other day she said the list was complete but now she doesnt believe that she could enforce her wits around the enforce of the inflow on self of course its been invalidated now to the degree that ive nulled it all out but that is not vanished list because of rudiments out that you should realize rudiments were in if the item had been on the list it would have showed what im showing you is it was heavily charged the subject was charged see that we had bzzz every time we charged the subject okay all right well now you see that if i can miss them occasionally on completing list why you neednt feel so blushing sometimes and dont you ever fake one just because see you want to make the pc look good or something like that dont ever fake one you know say well it was reading little bit you know it was the last one in something like that doesnt work that way if you dont find an item dont find an item you hear it would have been very simple for simply to have kicked it with my thumb and said its in of course thats very embarrassing you know in front of all of you experts you know i thought that was quite fascinating just from the standpoint ive about halfway through the session i suddenly realized i was looking at charged subject that the subject was charged but that i wasnt getting any action on any item like that surge that i was getting every time i said one was in or out now the tossup is this do you stop and invalidate the pc across the boards and say well this list is good were gonna have to do another list or do you null it out to nothing and add some items and so forth itd just be what made the pc unhappy well you wouldnt do that youd do what the pc is happy on and so on pc is not upset i dont think because we didnt find an item female voice id rather have the right item yeah she wasnt saying that just for your benefit but the fact that shed rather have the right item rather tends to indicate that she knew there wasnt one on the list see tends to indicate it well all that 3d criss cross to the contrary let us get into something that is very vital to you lets get into security checking disappears and prepchecking rises newly born in the first place the word security checking has never been very popular with the public and it renders itself very bad to understanding were not checking people because of security see were actually preparing cases for clearing and so if you called it prepchecking it sounds slightly onomatic onomatopoetic that will be shilling apiece please for that one slightly onomatopoetic you didnt think i could say it twice did you so well call it prepchecking if thats all right with you what do you think about that audience i agree all right and then we will call the operation of not the operation covered in this bulletin the subject matter that im taking up in this lecture is hco bulletin of february 12th 1962 which i believe you have but not because it isnt covered in this bulletin yet but because i havent given you all the dope on it and wont give you the dope in this particular lecture on how you do it weve got whole subject here and we could call this prepclearing prepchecking prepclearing we got whole subject here its subject thatll take lot of the snarls out of your wits on how you do this now ive been trying to teach you here and across the world for very long time how to do security checking and auditors have been missing withholds and auditors havent learned it very well so we have to understand that this is probably something that is very very hard to do now instead of blaming everybody and trying to make you all guilty see thats usual you see the fellow whos standing up with his thumbs in his braces you know and saying im the big i am and i know it all will naturally try to make you guilty and say well youre just ignorant and stupid well there must have been something missing in security checking must have been something missing and its some element or another missing so instead of blaming you across the boards i have been working since the first of the year very hard on this subject now of course ive worked on this subject of overts for more than decade but there must have been something something missing in the whole subject of pulling withholds and there must have been something missing about withholds there must have been something unknown about the subject otherwise one could have articulated it well enough so that you could do it easily now ive done some remarkable things in pulling withholds and ive caused some cases to have some fantastic gains in pulling withholds here and there and now and then but i might not have been doing it all you know there might be better way to pull withholds and there might be more to the mechanism of what withholds are all about and all of that sort of thing well anyway ive been working very intensely here for period of about well since the first of the year certainly and since the first of the year ive been aware of the fact that if i couldnt teach you how to do this so that youd get resurgent gain every session and every time you did that there must be bug there must be bug here someplace either it is hard to relay or its hard to do or theres some accidental there must be something here because theres variable and so i made up my mind to get rid of the variable and the first time you saw that was when i started jawing at you about missed withholds and apparently if you restimulate somebodys withholds if you restimulate withhold and then you dont pull it you have the sole source of arc breaks now for gods sakes when i learned that when i looked at it when i proved it out and i had it proved out by about ten days two weeks ago totally to my satisfaction you have the source of all of your arc breaks of all of the yapyap against the organizations of all the yap yap against scientology of all of the nyayaknyaknyaknyanyanyanya of all the pcs that are going into propitiation and anger and upset and so forth youve got the lot in missed withhold it restimulates the withhold you dont pull it your pc gets mad at you you know pc in the hgc goes out into the field and all of sudden goes nya nyanyanyanyanyanya well somebody missed withhold on that pc thats all because listen this is the proof you get hold of them and you bring them in and you set them down and dont do blessed thing with them but ask them what withhold has been missed on them in some fashion or another ask them effectively and they give it to you youll find it and they say the organization is fine and youre wonderful and they go off and all of sudden they get case resurgence and case gain that they didnt have at the time they left interesting isnt it hahaha now theres something to be known about this theres lot to be known about this and somehow or another ive got to get you to get good reality on this but i made two tests right here we had two auditor blowups two auditorpc blowups see two pcs blew up and the auditor kind of blew up one auditor didnt blow up the auditor grabbed the pc around the legs and hung on like grim death and you know that both of those incidents were traced back to having missed withholds and we went ahead and we got them afterwards the auditor had missed withhold and you had big pc blowup now i dont know how many times i have to tell you this but you might as well accept it because im just going to keep on telling you this this thing is this thing is not one of these variables its not variable this is not susceptible to difficulty it isnt true that every time you miss withhold you get an arc break that is not necessarily true at all but it is true that every time you have an arc break youve had missed withhold now thats whats true see so youve gotten away with it for years without recognizing what you were getting away with so some pcs had arc breaks and some pcs didnt you see and on both of them you could have missed withholds its not invariable that because you miss withhold the pc is going to blow up to the roof but it is invariable that if the pc blows up to the roof youve missed withhold now as scientologists for gods sakes get reality on this mamie gulch from sad bottom is saying oh the central organization is terrible and it chews everybody up and it ruins everybody and its just death trap because if you go near the place and so forth and you know that i heard and so forth and so on nyanyanya fast mumbling and they come around and theyre talking to you like this and if i catch one of you explaining to them that that is not what the central organization is about ill ill ill ill ill revoke portion of your thetan fast mumbling now listen the effective thing to do is just reach for an meter because listen theres nothing under the sun moon or stars you can do but reach for an emeter now let tell you this its fact its fact please get some reality on it this character is going on and on and on saying central organizations charge too much money besides besides i had brother once and so on and so on and so on and the registrar wrote letter and do you know what it said nyanyanya youve got business whatsoever trying to explain it to them or trying to heal the arc break honest honest ive tried and it just doesnt work it just doesnt work they just go on you can overwhelm them you can shoot them you can theres various things you can do but look man has been overwhelming them and man has been shooting them and man has been trying to punish them into line now for the last 200 trillion years and it hasnt worked that is the unworkable phenomena so all of your controlpunishment phenomena stems from this one fact that man did not have the technology to pull the missed withhold so why should we keep on punishing them if we know whats wrong with them now this is whats turned up in the last few weeks very intensive study on this ive been burning the midnight ron laughter and i finally got this thing sorted out as an invariable it isnt true that every time you miss withhold somebodys going to blow up the universe you can have lots of withholds missed on you and on somebody else and nothing much might happen but where dynamite has begun to explode where the fuses are burning where this and that is happening that is what happened withhold has been missed now this means this that you havent any business whatsoever sitting in an auditing chair letting pc chew you up trying to handle the arc break or be nice about it you just havent any business doing that the pc is chewing you up you should immediately equate what has happened because nothing else has happened you missed withhold thats all what are you sitting there letting the pc yapyap for see because theyre going to yapyap from there till the end of session one way or the other and youre just going to blow the session up look at pcs arc break and think in terms of missed withholds thats all dont think in terms of criticism of your own auditing and criticism of what youre doing and that sort of thing because youre doing all right you understand this now the withhold that you missed is most likely to have been right in the session youre running thats the most likely thing because its much more important to person that he dropped match on his toe minute ago than to have an elephant step on his head trillion years ago you understand present time things are much more important than past time things so its the probability is its right in the session youre running youre looking right at it and if thats not the case it must have been in one of the recent sessions you ran on the pc and it took that long to blow up and if thats not the case its back down earlier on the auditing track probably with some other auditor as far as sessions go or somebody should have known something about them in the last day or two you know its an out of session thing that youre looking at but by the way that isnt really going to make them mad at you thats just going to give them pt problem now where the missed withhold occurs monitors or what its composed of monitors what rudiment goes out now all rudiments go out because of missed withholds all rudiments go out because of missed withholds now all the rudiments processes are true and everything is fine about rudiments and youve got now i think about ten rudiments could have processes connected with them beginning and end rudiments and all those things are perfectly true and you could handle them all with the rudiment that is right there that youre reading but the truth of the matter is is back of each rudiment if you look back of each rudiment youll find missed withhold so outrudiments are caused by missed withholds and im going to make further study on it and find out just what type of missed withhold causes what rudiment to go out but each one of them is traceable and ive been tracing back outrudiments to missed withholds here until i dont know why were processing problems i dont know why were processing arc breaks i dont know why were processing any of these other things see all you have to do is find the missed withhold present time problem is missed withhold in life not in the session an arc break is withhold in the session invalidation of the emeter or something like that is withhold missed withhold on the subject of the meter theres something going here you see theres missed withhold back of each one of these ten rudiments all right so we look down the rack of these things and we find out that theres different types of missed withholds and these missed withholds are all very intriguing but theyre all missed now missed withhold is special thing it is not withhold its shouldhaveknown and if we stop calling them missed withholds we might get over the semantic mess that we get into when we say well we walk into this staff see walk into the hgc and the auditors there perfectly good auditors everythings fine and we say all right now pick up the missed withholds on this pc and so the auditor goes into the auditing session and he knows what hes supposed to do and he says to the pc are you withholding anything oh and you say now look i mean missed withholds see get the missed withholds and so forth and he says okay yeah well all right thats what i was doing you know and he goes back into session and he says and what are you withholding what are you withholding what are you withholding and youll get hold of him and you just back him up against in the hall and you say now look look were talking about missed withholds the withholds that have been missed thats what were talking about the withholds that have been restimulated and missed and he says okay okay i you neednt get so mad about it ill go back in and do something about it so he goes back in and he says to the pc he says now what are you withholding well you can go round and round on this mess you see semantically the thing is disoriented yes it means missed withhold but missed withhold is not withhold and he says oh well you dont have to pull withholds anymore you can miss them or lord knows what kind of scramble youre liable to get into but its not going to be pleasant call them shouldhave knowns now im not going to keep calling them shouldhaveknowns ill keep calling them missed withholds im giving you the explanatory thing you know you say well what i mean by missed withhold is the should haveknowns you find out what you should have known and what the organization should have known and what his auditor should have known and what ron should have known and what other people should have known about him at various times now you pick up all those shouldhaveknowns you understand the fellow isnt on the subject of withholds now is he he completely moved off it actually what hes picking up is missed withholds see youve explained this by shouldhaveknowns the auditing command you understand it doesnt communicate well so in an academy talk to students about shouldhaveknowns and so forth as your side explanation you can call them shouldhaveknowns if you want to i will continue to call them missed withholds because theres more direct appellation that you could possibly assign to it than withhold that has been missed just because this is hard to relay at first is reason why we should abandon the whole thing the fellows withholding something and somebody didnt find out and thats the whole study now right along with this right along with this discovery i found out that you had gone into quantitative quantitative thinking have i mixed you up some way when i say missed withholds and missed withholds and so on you understand what i mean audience yes well go on and call them missed withholds im just showing you oh my god you explain this to some new auditor on the subject youd better say now what i mean by missed withhold is shouldhaveknown you see and it explains quickly you say just go in and find out from that pc what you should have known about him what he should have known what i should have should have he should have known about doesnt seem to make any sense to but ill go in well what should you have known about i mean what should should i have known about you and the pc says well well you should have realized you should have realized that ive always been pervert and you didnt find it out haha haha and you should have known well you should have just known lots of things you should have known i didnt want to be here and you should have known processing wasnt doing any good and i was just pretending that it was doing some good and this auditor has all of sudden become citizen right on the spot hes been sitting there processing this pc and all of sudden theres this whole bank of mystery that has been going on that he didnt know anything about and he realizes something now lets look little bit further on this lets look further shouldhaveknown simply is an unknown and were back to unknown sec checking the sec checking of the unknown and ive pulled out of that quick as bunny because auditors were putting people into engrams and trying to run the engrams with them and it wasnt running well they were running unknown on engram and although people were getting their first glimpses of backtrack and that sort of thing it was too much and i wasnt about to teach auditors at this stage of the game all auditors who come along how to run engrams with notknow you see so i pulled out of that even though that was very successful that was few months ago remember that was very successful process you really could turn the bank upside down thats all youre doing when youre pulling withhold is youre curing an unknownness the whole subject of withholds equates into notknow and unknown its just missed withhold is halfknown halfunknown so you get halfknow halfunknow and evidently theres enough charge just in having everybody notknow while you know or in you knowing only half and your reactive bank is an unknow of the other half dont you see that it causes polarity of some kind or another that sets up godawful agitation in the bank so things that are half known known to but not to you known to you but not to known to you analytically partially but half unknown to you analytically you see so that youve got an unknown reactive and known analytical and it raises all the devil with you and that tells you all that is wrong with the reactive mind its an unknown area now youll greet this headon when you start processing these items youre finding so happily with 3d criss cross we wont go into that just now but unknow plays very very heavy role in this now the notknow that is most important is the shouldhaveknown that is what is the most important aspect it that is the tense that is the most important ive been looking for that for long time its should haveknown that itself is regret and that is what bunches the bank i refer you to tremendous amount of material on the subject of regret of many years ago and thats very good material but shouldhaveknown is what gives you regret see you didnt know it then you know it now so that youve got the time track now with the upper part of the track is know and the lower part of the track is notknow and youve got these two things notknow and know and they come into godawful disagreement and collision do you see how that would be so you get your distress in the bank and your distress from elements and so forth from this halfknown halfunknown factor however this traces down electronically were not as interested as we might be because it certainly is observable halfknown fact is about the wildest thing that anybody ever had to do anything with we hear twig fall in the quiet and hostile forest we hear this twig you know we hear it go clatter and then we hear it go snap and then we theres maybe little thud immediately afterwards and person just freezes where is the bear see we half know there is bear there but we dont know theres bear there we know something is going on but we dont know what is going on and its freezer you see so that is very good example of your half know half notknow you see now this mechanism of regret is what turns 3d criss cross valence into ball this is what loops the time track now the mechanism of the looped time track is totally due to just one thing and that is shouldhave known and that is the swan song that the thetan is singing if he only knew then what he knew now and you get as result of this you get looped track so thats what makes black ball bunches all the pictures up and smashes everything into one time zone of valence thats how valence gets in to be round ball circuit thats the exact mechanic of it its the regret its the shouldhaveknown regret isnt strong enough word shouldhaveknown we dont care what he should have known he should have known better he should have known about her he you know he should have known about parents if hed only known about the outcome of the battle he wouldnt have engaged in it in the first place and of course all this thing adds up to is feeling that one shouldnt have confronted one shouldnt have done one shouldnt have confronted one shouldnt have experienced so the prior pictures of having experienced are invalidated at once so he just tries to say they never happened and then we get the occlusion of the whole track see nothing happened is what the final analysis is he should have known he didnt know you see what hes saying about the past all the time is that he didnt know didnt know didnt know you know hes saying at the same time that he should have known should have known should have known didnt know didnt know didnt know should have known should have known should have known we didnt realize when we took off that morning for germany that you know here we go here we go when i walked up the aisle with that brute i did not realize that and of course the storybooks of life are filled with nothing but what follows in view of the fact that it most of its invented and created we then get all kinds of loopy factors going on in valences and dubins and all sorts and you can explain all other all types of phenomena with this shouldhaveknown now thats apparently the most important button in the bank because its the only one that out of hand can but look an arc break is the only thing that can prevent pc from getting results yet that not only prevents him from getting results but reduces his profile that reduces his gain and the only thing that creates an arc break in the final analysis is shouldhaveknown so add it up yourself if the arc break is so deadly that auditing cant even not only cant exist but shouldnt have existed you see the not have the shouldhave known must be more powerful than the arc break because you can remedy arc breaks by running shouldhaveknown do you see this well thats the equation by which weve worked this out and by which we can demonstrate these phenomena at any time but its the shouldhaveknown that is the main thing that youre knocking on the door of now at the same time i worked that out some time ago articulated it little bit better in the last few days so i can tell you what i was thinking about but another thing came up your quantitative thinking on the subject of withholds is just this quantitative button that this universe has it isnt the number of withholds you get nor is it the bigness of the withhold you get nor it is it the gruesomeness or the antisocialness or the newspaperheadlineness of the withhold you get it is just the thoroughness with which you get withhold its the quality of your auditing and the thoroughness of pulling withhold one withhold well thoroughly pulled will give you tremendous case gain and thousand withholds indifferently pulled will give you case retardation now whats the answer well right up there in that auditing room where you see the thing ive started to audit in that room just to get practice on it and so on i turn on all the screens and everything and go ahead and audit the pc i ran session the other night that old papa freud would have been standing around with his eyes bugged you could have knocked them off with cricket bats he was always looking for tremendous resurges you see on the part of pcs he was pretty much of onebutton man i respect this guy but he was pretty much of onebutton man if he could just get this one thing on the bank you see youd get this tremendous resurgence the drop out of the psychosomatic illness and so on he must have done it two or three times he actually must have or he wouldnt have had such faith in it and if he could just just hit that one thing that just that little hidden something there if he could just get fingers on that something and produce this well he couldnt do it invariably and he never taught anybody to do it by the way he must have done it himself few times and he never taught anybody how to do it but he must have had some success with it he was looking for withhold thats all he was looking for and you can cover the whole of freudian analysis on the looking for withhold and in his particular case because he was operating to large degree with jewish patients he had tended to follow that mores pattern nothing wrong with that its just that it colored his work by having grouped too tightly so he was looking for that particular type of aberration and he was looking for it to have occurred in childhood and so he circumscribed the dynamic and he circumscribed the area of the track so seriously that he must have made mess out of things here and there he kept looking in childhood when it was the seventyyearold man you see and the incident happened when he was sixtyeight hes been nuts ever since you know and so he would not look in that area so much he would look back in childhood all the time you know and maybe there was nothing there what he was looking for was withhold of some kind or another and he didnt quite know what he was looking for but the few times that this had happened was sufficient to give psychoanalysis the springboard which pushed it out across the world and that it happened occasionally accidentally elsewhere you know other psychoanalysts had accidentally pulled withhold one day and not quite known what theyd pulled and then theyd go over the hills and far away that was what put freudian analysis up in lights just that one little factor look how what tiny amount is known about it i mean you read freudian analysis you find theres very little known they dont know very much they didnt know even know how to pull one and yet they could get resurgences once in blue moon and freud must have had pretty good luck at it now what was he doing well ill tell you one thing he was doing he was restimulating enough withholds to make lot of patients commit suicide and kill freudian analysis analysts or try to because youve never heard so many people get so mad at freudian analysts as patients do and the only way they handle this is by overwhelming the patient dont ever adopt those tactics because all you have to do now that youve got the technology theres reason to punish the person just find the should haveknown just find out what shouldhaveknown youve restimulated you see pull it and hell cease to be angry with you its very funny when you get very expert at doing this its very quick trick its just bingbing to keep pc from having an arc break the pc has an arc break what should i have known about you well he says well you should have known ive been uncomfortable for the last ten minutes you say thank you very much do you have an arc break youve got arc break you can have pc raving at you telling your auditing yapyapyap yapyapyapyapyap and you should have and wowwowwowwowwowwowwow just say has somebody missed withhold on you and he says as matter of fact they have all right and its liable to pull that quickly but on the other hand on the other hand there are many of them that wont pull that quickly you can get the moment that they werent pulled and flip it and knock out the arc break but then it gets flipped again and once more youve got missed withhold because the basic withhold has not been pulled so there would be two ways you could handle this situation one is with the dress parade the queens guard riding down holding up all the traffic outside of buckingham palace everything you know and lets really break it out see lets troop the colors and the lot you know lets spread this thing all over the place you see lets do with the whole thing or youre lets just knock out the keyin see youve got two choices that you can go either you can knock out all the shouldhaveknowns on that subject in this lifetime or you can and this lifetime is just keyin or you can knock out the last keyin that happened now when you want to get rudiment in fast knock out the last keyin and then dont take the rest of it and you knock that out with lightly shouldhaveknown just light twoway comm shouldhaveknown bang if that doesnt work youve got dress parade to go on now when we talk about this dress parade were talking about hcob of february 12 1962 and were talking about specific system called the withhold system and were talking about something which runs off just about like you pull the levers on the slot machine and it comes out except in this particular case if you pull the levers on the slot machine often enough it empties thats not true of all slot machines you know i dont know if youve ever had that experience i like to own slot machines myself you see and when i play them i go around to the back of them you know and fix the number of give and take you see on the thing fix that up so that its 110 percent you know that gives great deal of satisfaction but after while i have to put more money in it so i can keep winning well you can almost run with terrific regular you can with this withhold system you just pull the levers of the slot machine and the money keeps pouring out i mean thats as far as thats concerned now the reason i mentioned papa freud is because if you work this system that has nothing to do with it this is just your added bonus you see if you work this system youd be absolutely fascinated to discover that all the basic buttons that you and everybody else have been searching for on this case and the things the case had been worried about and so forth are just going to roll out on the rug thats your added gain now in prepchecking the only thing youre trying to do and thats the whole system is youre trying to get in the rudiments so that they never go out during 3d criss cross and that is the mission of prepchecking now we go into that later but you do this withhold system and something very funny happens if you do this thing exactly according to the book by the numbers and dont get fancy with it and dont get careless with it and you be very careful with it and handle every withhold that comes up with this with this little system all of sudden the pcs bum ear and other things of this particular type are all of sudden going to straighten out youre going to get yourself some fantastic gains people will look at you like you are wizard or something well of course this is nothing compared to what you can do with 3d criss cross but its fantastic it is darn well worth doing and thats whats most fascinating about it is you straighten up the case so the rudiments will stay in while you do 3d criss cross voilà marvelous good oh and at the same time you get all these extra bonuses you see of the persons arthritis and that sort of thing tends to disappear dont get too hopeful itll all come back on again while youre doing 3d criss cross but itll make life livable for the person its not an impermanent gain because it straightens up their present time environment for them to very marked and marvelous degree and you get all these resurgences that papa freud got two or three times so remarkably oh maybe more than that certainly more than that and that freudian practitioners get maybe twice in their career see and you get these things as routine about every five hours of processing if youre doing this thing hot and right see the pc really knows hes going someplace and all youre doing is straightening out the person so he can be run on 3d criss cross thats the only thing youre interested in now prepchecking is the system of getting each rudiment in with crunch that gets each rudiment in so its more or less permanently in during the auditing in 3d criss cross and thats prepchecking that is different system than the one were taking up here in hcob of february 12th but it uses exactly the same elements so this withhold system is applicable to any and all withholds and it has very broad application this exact system were going to use it in the narrow confines of prepchecking now you could do joburg form 3 with one of these things and ill give you just rapidfire example of how you would do form 3 question we have five parts in this system now the zero is the difficulty youre handling thats your zero now the reason its zero is thats what youre trying to tape in thats from what you are departing so it doesnt have 1 because its the place youre departing from and that would be any question any question that appeared in the form 3 on broad thing have you ever robbed bank thats not even form 3 question but have you ever robbed bank see thats giving you an example thats what youre trying to clear on this pc have you ever robbed bank so you would write that in for your zero all right youve got fall on that so you say all right whats that and he says well i broke open piggy bank once and took the money out of it all right thats what his withhold was you see now you can write that down or not that doesnt matter youve got your what now your what what about that piggy bank now for gods sakes write that on the auditors report what about that piggy bank if you were doing form 3 this way you would just take this other question thats the question youre working on and you just work off the form but this number 1 youve got to write down because that is your test question what about that piggy bank or what about robbing that piggy bank we dont care what the wording of it was but its wording that matches up to the withhold now the pc says i robbed piggy bank once i broke it and your question then would be the most close approximation you could get to this with what what about robbing and breaking that piggy bank and thats what youd write down in your auditors report now thats your number 1 that is your what now the way to handle this system is to memorize it on this basis of its what when all who all right now you say what about robbing and breaking that piggy bank and it gives you reaction of course he can say something else but we dont care what he says we frankly really dont care for what he says from here on as long as he keeps talking and giving us data now i call to your attention that pc never refuses to talk to the auditor he never refuses to give up the withhold but he often doesnt know what it is and its the auditors job to get him to look and i dont care how harsh an auditor has to be to get pc to look but i dont want to ever see an auditor harsh because the pc wont tell him that is idiocy the pc will tell him if the pc is even basically even vaguely insession he can think of the gummiest slimiest horriblest most antisurvival data and hell tell the auditor but he very often cant find out what it is so your job is to keep him looking because it may be so frightening and so horrifying and so charged that he wont go on looking you know he doesnt want to look he and so on you can be as histrionic as you like from that point on but get him to look and never start chopping the pc up because the pc wont tell you because youve told him hes out of session the only thing you want the pc to do is look the pc says oh i dont know anything more about that and im going and you get fall on the meter ah you say theres great deal more about this now look at it now just look at it and give some more about this i dont care how positive you get about it the only mistake you can make is telling the pc well now youve got to tell you know that you know all about it oh that would be horrible mistake because youre admitting the pc wont talk to you and of course he goes out of session the games condition enters at once and the whole thing goes up the spout and you dont get any further and so forth so you never admit that point that point never comes into the session the pc will always tell you if the pc can find out and your job is to get the pc to look and the pc to find out and the pcs sitting there all fugged up one way or the other and blooey he says blooey blah oh thats just all there is to it theres thats all i just know that must be all there is to it because there isnt anything else to it and so on you see all right now look its still falling on the meter here now is it falling because of an arc break i dont get any reaction from that i tell you theres more to it look what is there you tell whats there now you just look oh well its soandso and soandso and soandso and well huh you say good fine but in this particular system we can be insistent but we take anything the pc gave us as the answer to the question youre getting data the whole while so you say what about robbing and breaking that piggy bank of course thats going to fall he just told you and it is not going to be released thats for sure but if you say it and it now doesnt react you havent got number 1 have you so youll have to ask him for another one wont you to get number 1 you say well have you ever robbed bank and that doesnt react now youve cleared the question that was it so he broke piggy bank once so robbing banks registered and he phrased it and he gave it to you and you cant get any more read and youve had it you understand thats why number 1 the whole system is dependent on number 1 must be cleared and eventually number zero must be cleared but the 1s must all be cleared and eventually zero will be cleared all right now lets say what about robbing and breaking that piggy bank and it fell all right we immediately go into when when was that now you dont have to hit that very precisely the first time the more times you hit it and the more times you go over it the more precise youre going to get until you could finally take meter and spot it into within fifteen second interval in the middle of some precise day and month and year and so forth and the position of the planets you know i mean you could really zero that thing in with an emeter if you had to but ordinarily when was it you see but the more often you have to ask that go over it the first time you say when was it he says well that was when i was little boy thats perfectly good enough next time you go over it well how old were you see when was it see well i mmmmmm get it down to the year you know next time you have to go over it again youd better be suspicious that there must be something wrong with the when if its not cleared yet so youve its very very precise so the more times you go across when the more precise you get on spotting it you see the idea if you had to cross it once you can do it loosely twice little more precisely three times little more precisely four times man you better start zeroing that thing in you better be getting on the emeter by this time and really finding out if it was earlier than 1936 or later than 1936 you see lets spot it in all right and of course 1 fell or we wouldnt be going on with it you see what about robbing and breaking that piggy bank so were going to do 2 3 and 4 in rotation every time that we find 1 reacting we dont do thing about 1 but run 2 3 and 4 thats all we do about 1 is run 2 3 and 4 until 1 longer registers and at that moment we go back to our zero and see if its registering and if its registering we get another what well we could get another little withhold we dont care what the withhold is as long as he gives us withhold and whatever he gives us withhold on we run back to it but right now were involved in clearing up this piggy bank all right when it occurred is that all of it is there any more to it now we find out well he says i was i was just little kid the answer he gave us we dont care by the way what 2 3 and 4 do on the meter were not really very close to meter here we only care about zero and 1 on the meter unless were dating for 2 and we can actually pull our head out of the meter and talk to the pc on 2 3 and 4 straight every time and hell much more tend to hold insession that we dont care what the meter reactions are 2 3 or 4 were always going to cover them regardless of whether they react or dont react we dont care we only want to care if 1 reacts so when we get back when weve done 4 then we get our nose back into the meter again and we say all right what about robbing and breaking that piggy bank and we dont got much reaction here except we might get something on robbing because its still hot but we dont get anything on the whole question the whole question is not reacting so we desert it and we go back to the zero and we say have you ever robbed bank you always leave these things with the same line that you get into them which is why you wrote this what question down on your auditors report wed much rather have the what question on the auditors report than all the gruesome details so as long as we get 1 reacting as whole question of course we keep on doing 2 3 and 4 and 2 3 and 4 and 2 3 and 4 as long as we got it reacting we always do if weve done 2 if 1 reacts we do 2 if we do 2 we do 3 if weve done 3 we do 4 you see and then if weve done 4 we test so its matter of 2 3 4 test 2 3 4 test 2 3 4 test 2 3 4 test 2 3 4 test test its clean cheers all right now we go back have you ever robbed bank thats the difficulty see have you ever robbed bank its clean and we find another withhold difficulty to monkey with we cant get any more reaction on that one we go elsewhere we get another difficulty you see how this works now its very precise by the way and it is not any strain to amount to anything on you and its quite magical because 2 3 4 are the three elements necessary to blow withhold from here to halifax so nobody will ever hear of it again all right let give you very rapid little rundown example of this robbing the bank all right we say to the pc have you ever robbed bank we got reaction you say all right come on give the pc has had chance to answer before we start plaguing him and he says whahehha yuhuh huhhmm i robbed robbed and broke piggy bank once and you say good what about robbing and breaking piggy bank that is your what and you write that down on your auditors report what about robbing and breaking piggy bank now here we go you say when was that is that all there is to it and who should have known about it who didnt find out about it who should have found out about it and didnt of course you remember that should is much more important than the didnt but you can play this for variation you see and so he says well soandso it doesnt matter what the pc says the pcs talking to you thats all part of the session see pcs giving you dope and you can run back up here to 1 and you say what about robbing and breaking piggy bank and it goes what about robbing and breaking piggy bank clank you say good now just exactly when was that oh how old were you i was six all right good enough is that all of it well actually as matter of fact i hid the pieces afterwards and so forth and so on and you say well who should have known about that and he tells you and you go back and you say what about robbing and breaking piggy bank clank and you say all right now how old were you at that time well i was six my little brother was six i was twelve i was twelve and you say well is that all of it well it was my little brothers piggy bank well all right good now who should have known about it and didnt find out well my mother and father should have ive been saying before that they should have known about my robbing the piggy bank but they should have known about the fact that i beat my little brother up when he said hed tell them hahahaha i prevented them from finding out about it well good good all right fine now what about robbing and breaking that piggy bank click all right now just exactly when was that now you say that was you say you were twelve lets see what year would that be and lets just ride it right in on the emeter as matter of fact we find out he was sixteen and his little brother was eight heh heh hehheh and its beginning to put greater and greater complexion on this thing that would be horrible thing to have happen to him you see now all right thats good now lets find out well now is that all of it not all well as matter of fact they found the pieces later and i said my little brother had done it and they beat him laughter and i said i said id seen him do it laughter oh all right thank you all right now who should have known about that well they should have known i was lying because all i did when i was little kid was lie lie lie morning noon and night you know laughter i never told them the truth i never told them the truth from the day i was born practically and so forth and made liar out of my little brother too all right thats fine and you say good now what about robbing and breaking piggy bank and the thing is just as quiet as it can be so we go back to we say all right have you ever robbed bank now if have you ever robbed bank still falls we might compartment the question into have you ever robbed have you have you ever robbed bank and suddenly find out that robbed is still hot now we might have found in the what question that robbed was hot so we just dropped that you see so it just went at robbed but it didnt go on the whole question you understand so we drop here back to and we say well have you ever robbed anything but remember remember if weve done that that the question have you ever robbed bank is now null and we are working on new difficulty derived from compartment and our zero question is now have you ever robbed anything and he says well nothing much filling station once you see all right now what about robbing filling station that got reaction all right and you write that on your auditors report and then you just go 2 3 4 test 2 3 4 test 2 3 4 test test is null go back to your difficulty have you ever robbed anything null we got it scrub it get something new to clear okay now thats that withhold system and i think you will find it works like dream but its more important now get this it is more important to handle one little cottonpicking withhold well than to handle thousands indifferently it is not the quality of the withhold that counts it is how much of it is submerged how much of it has dropped out of sight thats what counts it isnt that the pc has blown up the whole southwest quarter of the universe if he knows hes done that and theres more to it and the 2 3 4s produce reaction on that whatsoever that isnt whats wrong with the pc matter how inviting it is to blame his condition on having blown up things and we find out one day he was walking down the street and he kicked parson in the shins and out of this little stupid incident we suddenly run back wild dissertation of stuff of things the pc actually did that you really recover recollections on that is all gone now you bring them back to view we plow them all out we square them around the pc confronts that fact and there we go and the way you get him to do all these things is just your the zero difficulty that youre trying to clear which at the moment to you would be called any sec check question itd be very good thing for you to pick up any sec check question that person has given you recurrently he has given the same withhold to several pcs auditors just put that down as your difficulty and get your what from thereon because your what will probably be the same as your difficulty in that case and clean the living daylights out of it and youre going to find something that will practically blow your head off its only half known or it wouldnt be recurrent see and it must be missed withhold thats all and any difficulty could be handled that way its fundamental its fundamental question well lets say this way the guys got bad head lets just go into it lets clear up difficulty pcs got bad head well you say have you this is our difficulty have you ever done anything to head our terminology at that point might be better but the question the fundamental question was have you ever done anything to head not what have you done to head thats our fundamental thats what were trying to clear up thats his difficulty and weve got to put it in some kind of an overt tense so he says well not really except well there was punching little boy in the head once you say what about punching little boy in the head and youve got your 1 now you treat it from there on out you could treat psychosomatic you could do all sorts of wild things with this it has enormously wide application what i want you to learn and those that are leaving here on friday certainly have very little time to learn this what i want you to learn is just the simplicity of the little drill and what it produces now the fact that you dont have to read except when youre dating 2 3 and 4 on the meter you give your undivided attention to the pc the pc can really talk to you he can really tell you things he tends to stay insession and so forth and you only go back and test that see bang if its still alive well you just got 2 3 4 2 3 4 and youd be surprised what you will plow up now for little while on any one of these lines youre liable to be find that youre somewhat plowing bum ground that is to say theres cognition theres nothing much happening you clear withhold and nothing happens at all and you go back to your difficulty and you find the difficulty is still alive and you get another withhold and you get another what and you clear all that up arduously and arduously and you clear it all up and it didnt amount to anything and you go back and your difficulty is still registering your zero is still registering so you find another withhold on this subject and you clear all that up with great ardure and arduousness and so forth and you do your 2 3 4 2 3 4 and it doesnt amount to anything and it comes out noplace and the pc is looking gray and beaten cognitions or anything and you go back to your difficulty and you get another withhold on this particular subject and all of sudden the pc says da aaaahhhhh i didnt know that you know it did you know its true and you go through your 2 3 4 and wow what do you know wow and your 2 3 4 and your 2 3 4 and you can just see your difficulty your zero blow you can see the whole thing blow out as charge nothing will fall on an emeter that is not significantly charged and nothing will fall on an emeter that is not unknown in part to the pc interesting eh and if you get an emeter registry there must be something unknown you saw session today which tended to demonstrate that there was an unknown item on the list because every time we said one was in or out we got surge so there must be something unknown about the list see how easy it is to read an emeter if you said an emeter registers every time the pc only knows in part or not at all about something he only partially its an unknown the meter registers unknowns thats all as long as an emeter registers theres something unknown about it all right it becomes very simple if you handle it that way i want you to become very adept at this zero 1 2 3 4 and the only thing youre going to get into difficulty with seriously is converting the zero to the what and then holding the what constant for test now youre not going to have any difficulty with it because i have already gotten ahead of you you didnt show this difficulty i showed you all right see its victory for you on it you dont vary 1 you dont vary 1 you dont vary zero you can become little bit yappy on 2 3 4 but try to stay somewhere close to the wording stay close to the spirit of the thing you could actually do it by rote but you wont hold your pc very well insession but the variation im asking for is well is there anybody else who didnt know anything about it at all well should they have known about it you see thats variation of wording well now are you sure youve told all about that have you recalled all there is to know about that well theres this little scrap all right thats fine so what youre actually doing is using the emeter just to test zero and 1 and you dont vary 1 and what we call varying the question is point you have never been able to cope with easily weve always had difficulty some of you can cope with it quite well but on the majority they dont cope with it in varying the sec check question so as to get it out well this gives you the system by which you vary the sec check question so there is further difficulty about varying the question because the question is the same question on 1 every time just for test and the variation on 2 3 and 4 is practically microscopic its just so as not to get monotonous well its just have you thought of anything more about that have you remembered anything else about it now is that all there is to it you get that as variation all right just about when did that occur thats variation on when see see your variation is microscopic you have to stay on that sense you try this you work with it and i think youre going to produce some interesting looking miracles i think they will be very minor now theres one thing i must tell you even though it is very late theres one thing i must tell you is you go out of this lifetime with this thing and you accept past life answer from anybody using this system and ill have the other part of your thetan past lives at all nothing to do with past lives were not invalidating past lives pc says ooooooh all this stems from the fact it stems from the fact when i was pogo dancer on the top of southwest pyramid and you say good thank you im very glad about that now in this lifetime you hold him in this lifetime because pcs will duck into the unreality of yesterday to avoid the withhold in this lifetime or or theyre trying to run the whole bank on it and this process wont run the whole bank so whether theyre just trying to duck or trying to audit the whole bank with this withhold system we dont care youll find it will all register in this lifetime if youve got registry its in this lifetime now what youre doing is keying out the time to take up past life is with 3d criss cross not with the withhold system and youll find out that if you let them go into past life youll miss all the gain of the withhold system they duck back and they start to clean it up well they dont know enough about it and frankly you couldnt even reach it with this system this system does not have the strength or power to reach back into the past and that much occlusion and that much unknown it just isnt that isnt that strong system terrific system for this lifetime its the greatest system ever developed for this lifetime as far as thats concerned so it would be valueless on past track what you need on past track is 3d criss cross and all your withhold system does is put the pc into some kind of shape so that you can run 3d criss cross on him and then is the time to take up the past track okay so theres the limitations of the system there are its purposes and there is its use now anytime you strike withhold if youre going for the dress parade if youre going to do it lightly find out who should have known about it see thats just the light punch thats to get the rudiment in or something like that but if youre going to clean up withholds and youre straightening up the case you break out the queens guards drawn sabers troop the colors you got it and thats the system thats all brrrrrpbrrrrpbrrrrpbrrrrrp grind it out and youll find out youll get there now undoubtedly youre going to find some holes in this system but i dont think you will find any holes in the system itself i think you will find that by doing some additives you can make it clumsy or unworkable now thats between you and your conscience and your use of it i want you to get good reality on this not just good reality on missed withholds because this of course takes care of missed withholds from the word go okay all right thats it sorry we were late tonight thank you very much
