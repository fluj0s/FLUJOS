the role of judges and juries in making factual determinations upon which sentences are made there has been increased congressional interest in federal sentencing one aspect of federal sentencing includes recidivism statutes that provide longer sentences for repeat offenders on such statute the armed career criminal act acca requires imposition of 15year prison sentence for an individual with prior serious drug or violent felony convictions under the acca nonjury juvenile adjudications qualify as prior convictions the use of these nonjury juvenile adjudications raises several constitutional due process questions and continues to spark debate among courts at the federal and state levels opinions vary in part because of conflicting in terpretations of the us supreme courts jury trial jurisprudence stressing the constitutional requirement of juries rather than judges making factual determinations upon which sentences are based this report summarizes the competing views

term of imprisonment for unlawful possession of firearm in violation of 18 usc 922g by an individual with three prior serious drug or violent felony convictions1 the acca defines conviction to include finding that person has committed an act of juvenile delinquency involving violent felony2 defendants have begun to challenge with mixed results the courts ability to use nonjury juvenile adjudications as prior conviction under the acca opinions vary in part because of conflict ing interpretations of the us supreme courts recent jury trial jurisprudence as well as the the nature of juvenile court proceedings in series of cases the us supreme court has held that given the sixth amendment right to trial by jury judges cannot impose sentences beyond the prescribed statutory maximum unless the facts supporting such an increase are found by jury beyond reasonable doubt 3 in jones v united states 4 the court struck down the federal carjacking statute that enhanced the maximum prison sentence that nathaniel jones could receive depending upon the amount of bodily injury that accompanied the carjacking in jones it was the sentencing judge not jury who found the victims incurred serious bodily injury and imposed prison sentence of 25 years the jones majority held that under the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the sixth amendment any fact ther than prior conviction that increases the maximum penalty for crime must be charged in an indictment submitted to jury and proven beyond reasonable doubt 5 apprendi v new jersey apprendi 6 reaffirmed jones by holding that other than the fact of prior conviction any fact that increases the penalty for crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt7 in apprendi the court struck down new jerseys hate crime law which allowed judge to increase sentence to double the statutory maximum if he or she found by preponderance of the evidence that the defendant acted with purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race in reversing the lower courts decision the court declared that the jury trial and notification clauses of the sixth amendment and the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments embody principle that insists that except in the case of recidivists judge could not on his own findings sentence criminal defendant to term of imprisonment greater than the statutory maximum assigned for which he had been convicted by the jury the apprendi court specifically held that its prior conviction exception was narrow one 8 1 18 usc 924e 2 18 usc 924e2c 3 see jones v united states 526 us 227 1999 apprendi v new jersey 520 us 466 2000 ring v arizona

g561 the narrow prior conviction exception from the general rule that all facts going to punishment must be found by jury is based on assumptions regarding the reliability and fairness of the procedures available to the defendant at the time his or her prior convictions were entered9 the us supreme court first addressed sentence enhancement based upon recidivism as jury trial issue in almendareztorres v united states 10 where in 54 decision it held that judge rather than jury may decide the fact of defendants prior conviction for purposes of determining whether sentence should be imposed in excess of the statutory maximum11 the court set forth three principal reasons for reaching its conclusion first recidivism has been traditional basis for sentencing courts increase in an offenders sentence12 second recidivism should be treated differently from other sentencing enhancement factors because the introduction of evidence of defendants prior crimes risks significant prejudice 13 third although factor may trigger an increase in the maximum permissive sentence as opposed to an increase in the mandatory minimum sentence as seen in mcmillan v pennsylvania 14 that factor should not automatically require greater burden of proof as it does not systematically or normally work to the disadvantage of criminal defendant15 as such the court held that the factor of recidivism need not be included in the indictment nor proved beyond reasonable doubt even if that factor increases the criminal sentence beyond the prescribed statutory maximum16 there is doubt concerning the continued viability of almendareztorres the four almendarez torres dissenters and justice thomas have all expressed belief that almendareztorres was decided in error justice thomas the only member of the almendareztorres majority to join the apprendi majority renounced his vote with the majority in almendareztorres and declared that the decision was in error17 moreover the courts decision in shepard v united states18 appears 9 for example the defendant received jury trial or validly waived this right and facts upon which the sentence was based were found beyond reasonable doubt see jones at 249 explaining that using the fact of prior conviction to enhance sentence is constitutionally distin ct from the use of other facts and does not raise the same due process and sixth amendment concerns because prior conviction must itself have been established through procedures satisfying the fair notice reasonable doubt and jury trial guarantees 10 523 us 224 1998 in this case the court considered federal statute authorizing twoyear prison term for deportees who returned to the us without permission but authorizing prison term of up to 20 years for aliens whose deportation was subsequent to felony conviction the question before the court was whether the statute defined two separate crimes in which case the prior conviction must be mentioned in the indictment or simply authorized an enhanced penalty in which case the prior conviction is not an element that must be charged 11 id at 22527 12 id at 231 13 id at 235 14 477 us 79 1986upholding pennsylvanias

almendareztorresan error to which i succumbedwas to attempt to discern whether particular fact is traditionally or typically basis for sentencing court to increase an offenders sentence for the reasons i have given it should be clear that this approach just defines away the real issue what matters is the way by which fact enters into the sentence if fact is by law the basis for imposing or increas ing punishmentfor establishing or increasing the prosecutions entitlementit is an element to put the point differently i am aware of continued

shepard the court addressed whether sentencing court acting pursuant to the acca can examine police reports or complaints to determine whether prior guilty plea to burglary counts as prior conviction of violent felony19 in reading the prior conviction exception narrowly the court concluded that the judicial inquiry under the acca as to whether guilty plea to burglary is violent felony is limited to the terms of the charging document the terms of plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant or some comparable judicial record of this information 20 it would appear that requiring that recidivism in the shepard context be proved beyond reasonable doubt calls into question the distinction between traditional sentencing factors such as recidivism and elements of the offense however it should be noted that shepard was decided on statutory grounds invoking the doctrine of avoiding constitutional doubt

juvenile adjudications have been the focus of debate following the almendareztorres and apprendi decisions two conflicting views have arisen as to whether juvenile adjudication constitutes prior conviction for the purpose of enhancing an adults sentence the legal issue with using juvenile adjudications as sentence enhancers is not the constitutional validity of the adjudication itself but instead the constitutional validity of the adjudications subsequent use in an adult criminal court historically prior juvenile criminality was not us ed as sentencing factor because records of juvenile adjudications were confidential and often expunged 21 the ninth circuit was the first to publish an opinion on the matter in united states v tighe 22 the defendant pled guilty to bank robbery being felon in possession of firearm and interstate transportation of stolen vehicle the government argued that the defendants sentence could be enhanced because of prior adjudication as juvenile of reckless endangerment firstdegree robbery and unauthorized use of motor vehicle23 however the court found that the juvenile adjudication could not be used for continued historical basis for treating as nonelement fact that by law sets or increases punishment when one considers the question from this perspective it is evident why the fact of prior conviction is an element under recidivism statute indeed cases addressing such statutes provide some of the best discussions of what constitutes an element of crime one reason frequently offered for treating recidivism differently reason on whic h we relied in almendareztorres is concern for prejudicing the jury by informing it of the prior c onviction but this concern of which earlier courts were well aware does not make the traditional understanding of what an element is any less applicable to the fact of prior conviction 18 544 us 13 2005 19 id the acca mandates 15year minimum sentence for any person found to have committed certain federal firearms violations if that person has three prior convictions for violent felonies the term violent felony includes burglary and the court in taylor v united states 495 us 575 59899 1990 held that the accas use of the term burglary encompasses only generic burglary 20 id at 1263 21 david s tanenhaus the evolution of juvenile courts in the early twentieth century beyond the myth of

adjudication was not tried by jury trial thus evidencing significant constitutional differences between adult convictions and juvenile adjudications24 the court held that the prior conviction exception to apprendi s general rule must be limited to prior convictions that were themselves obtained through proceedings that included the right to jury trial and proof beyond reasonable doubt25 in united states v smalley 26 the eighth circuit rejected the ninth circuits reasoning in tighe the court in employing broader interpretation than the ninth circuit found that the question of whether juvenile adjudications should be exempt from apprendi s general rule should not turn on the narrow parsing of words but on an examinati on of whether juvenile adjudications like adult convictions are so reliable that due process of law is not offended by such an exemption27 the court reasoned that as juvenile courts apply beyond reasonable doubt standard the juvenile bench trial was procedurally adequate to constitute prior conviction 28 states have also adopted different approaches for allowing the use of juvenile adjudications as sentence enhancers one approach used by some states eg indiana and kansas allows courts to consider prior juvenile adjudication as part of defendants criminal history29 the majority of states that have addressed the constitutionality of such provisions have found that as long as juveniles receive all the process they are constitutionally due in the juvenile system an adult court can treat juvenile adjudication as sentence enhancer30 however in state v brown 31 the louisiana supreme court adopted the minority view and held that courts cannot use juvenile adjudication to enhance sentence32 the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of robbery and jury found him guilty under separate count of armed robbery after his conviction the state charged the defender under its habitual offender law and enhanced his sentence based on prior juvenile adjudication33 he challenged the sentence and argued that the trial courts use of his juvenile adjudication for sentence enhancement violated apprendi the louisiana supreme court distinguished civil adjudications from criminal convictions noting that juvenile courts afford juveniles less due process which results in proceeding that is more civil in nature than criminal34 the court decided that
