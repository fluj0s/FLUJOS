r3m how to find goals lecture given on 19 march 1963 well good evening good evening wei havent seen you for while and you lookyou look better you look better all right this is the what this is the 19th male voice 19th nineteenth of march ad 13 saint hill special briefing course lecture well im glad youre here and in the old daysin the old daysit was much tougher at saint hill the new starrating systemrating system on bulletins tapes and so forthwill make an enormous difference because it takes off the equalized importance of all books and tapes permits you to get through many more tapes and bulletins and acquaint yourself with material that you might not get acquainted with and puts the stress and emphasis on exactly the material which you are using and you will find that is very handy so we expect we expect all these new studentswe expect all of you new students to get up into z unit at the end of about the fifth week and quickly bypass the remainder of those who are now in v and x units and yes so do that for will you all right now the lecture this evening has to do with how to find goals i think youll find thats very important lecturehow to find goals but before we go into that why i would like to give you i would like to give you little brief rundown on whats happened in clearing i just had telex from london ray is holding the fort she only has one class iv i think at the moment and shes having terrible time because people are finding goals and items in an awful rush and they had one girl who has been stuck at 50 ta and thereve been telexes back and forth between and london concerning this girl and so on and they finally found her goal so thats the end of that and so on actually nothing worked on her you know 212 didnt work and nothing worked real sad tomato the whole way well they found her goal well anyway ray is in bad trouble because shes so much on the qui vive checking out other peoples goals and there are several people right on the verge of firstgoal clear you see and shes keeping an eye on these people and so forth and shes got supervisoritis see and she hasnt had any time to worry about her own case or get any auditing on it and this is bothering her considerably and this state of affairs actually is happening in great many places south africa doesnt seem to be worried about clears at the present time and sssssss south africa melbourne melbourne is having spate of enthusiasm here on the subject of clearing also sydney and also perth and theyre being just little bit enthusiastic every once in while one of you guys out in z or something weve just blown joes second goal haha you havent even found all the items in the first goal you see weve just blown the second goal mary sue gets one about every three or four days dear mary sue we have just blown my second goal the auditor found it it rocket read twice and so forth and then it blew so thats my second goal well it isnt done that way if you cant present line plot that looks like the march 13th line plot to accompany each goal blown it hasnt blown line plot just like that by the way the items can have different names well permit that they can be different goals but dont you vary from that line plot so we take these twogoals things with bit of reservation do you understand we take that with bit of reservation but nevertheless we have to congratulate them actually what happened is is we finished training up ross turnbull and denny was already holding the fort out there and ross turnbull has been straightening up things in melbourne very nicely and doing beautiful job and he went up to sydney and all in space of about an hour and half or something like that found about forty or fifty items goals got all kinds of people auditing again it was the most fantastic record you ever saw i mean an hour and half it was several days but he really did job see and thats the immediate result of that pretty good huh melbourne hgc pcs now they have new idea in melbourne they have new idea in melbourne i want to call to your attention theyre starting to give good auditing on clearing to hgc pcs and i would like to recommend this as new and novel policy well allowing for the fact they havent even found all the items in the first gpm we know theyre doing it right because we trained ross up pretty well so there you are there you are what have you got to say about that huh i think thats gooda good sendoff down there in view of that fact that theyve just had lot of upsets and troubles of one kind or another why to get technical up like that that wouldtook quite lot of doing and now of course were changing academy programs so that with this new bulletin rating system works in these academy programs similarly to saint hill theyll be graduating students around there next thing you know clearing is going to be great reality you know this is the darkthe dark time for scientology actually you probably dont recognize that because it all looks bright from where you sit but as we go forward the mere fact of having made the grade puts in stable datum that causes tremendous amount of confusion theres the foolish drug administration in washington dc knocking the spots off of all scientology in the united states theyve even stolen our last ability out of the mails in the post office and copied the names and addressesoff of it interesting isnt it something like that and then their fda agents at vast expense are going all over the country visiting all the scientologists in this country asking them to make incriminating statements about the amount of polio money that they get you know of course we dont do any of these things so it must be very disheartening to them but i think they can probably invent enough to cause us trouble in australia our firm of solicitors in australia rylah and rylah because we dont dare mention solicitors names you know the implicating you know slander and that sort of thing anyhow this firm rylah and rylah who are related to the attorney general of victoria failed to ask for an extension for the filing of hasi limited understand limitedhasi limited it is not in business in australia and actually isnt in business in active trading in other parts of the world to amount to anything and they were supposed to ask for an extension and the accountantsour accountants down there told them to ask for an extension and they didnt do it and now theyve resigned off the case because were going to be sued for not having asked for an extension i think that stinks theyll be sued of course but that permits the newspapers to come out hasi big swindle see ah its nonsense of course we sue the newspapers here stateside in the states weve got plenty of suits coming straight up against papers and that sort of thing were in for fight but the main thing thats wrong is scientologists are being hit individually not anything happening to them theyre just being questioned and mauled around and of course one doesnt really care to associate with government investigator i mean you knowsmell you know and so forth and the difficulty with this whole thing its commotion just commotion doesnt mean any real trouble in australia i mean what can they do in the final analysis they could fine hasi or something like that hasi limited it isnt even trading in australia it hasnt committed any crime we havent done any of the things that the food and drug administration of the united states says weve done you see they are actually doing us big favor but itbecause they are suing us for things they cant prove now the food and drug administration can lose suits thats an interesting too they just lost one in florida in federal court which had been two years in length and is food against dextra sugar and dextra had claimed that sugar contains vitamins which act as food supplement and the food and drug administration sued them and thats been going forward for two years and all this sugar is still seizedwas still seized in warehouses and finally the judge says you guys are nuts you know he said it in some legal language or another but hein essence he said you guys are nuts and gave dextra back its sugar and that was that in other words fda can lose in federal court now that suit that they brought was far more convincing than the suit they brought against us and were very very active about this and were going to have few heads but understand at this time just at the time clearing actual clearing has emerged on earth after having been sighted diffidently twentyfive hundred years ago first time why heres all this organizational commotion going on some of the principals involved like denny gogerly blames himself for not having run out items out of his back which he found which made him wide open for motivators of being sued well thats all right you neednt blame yourself for it weve all got these things the sooner we get rid of them the less motivators were going to collect thats for sure but look heres the technology the organizations are still there excellence of technology and clearing people and getting right down to it and really doing fine technical job is the only thing thats going to beat this rap because you think thats justthats just two activities going on in the world dont you think therell be others yes indeed there will be others and we had better be strong enough and good enough to meet them therefore our technical has got to be up and our technical is our only saving grace and thats the only thing thatll save our bacon and were running race right now between the commotion and enturbulation which can be generated in highly psychotic world and of course both of these suits in australia and the united states are suits brought by psychotics i say that advisedly because they arent even at the firm that is doing the business how much more psychotic can you be than that theyre going to squash scientology by suing some scientology organization or issuing warrants against one which doesnt exist thats just one of the things but look if we dont get ahead technically and if we dont just get right down to it and every pc we audit bang bang bang bang clear them nonsense about this just clear themwhy this enturbulance that we generate by putting this stable datum in the world could actually swamp us i say that advisedly these are actually the dark days of scientology i see them from where i sit you dont see them from where you sit if you did every session you gave would not be some session wherein you hoped ron was right or that 3m worked it would be session for blood man if we dont operate in that operating climate we can be heard of more this is touch and go all right so its very appropriate in that atmosphere dont let worry you dont let worry you but dont sit around so darn complacent about the whole thing and when you give somebody session and you dont get any win for the pc and hes not any closer to clear by the end of that session realize youre playing with fire i dont care what pc it is or why youre auditing the pc that pc is closer to clearing at the end of that session then at the beginning youre playing with fire you havent got that time to burn thats all you just havent got that time to burn next time you sit down in front of pc here on course do the usual in the direction of clear things happenthings happen in your sessions aaaah fft psft an auditor does adoes an ri oppose list and he gets to flat spot hes got twentyfive items rr hes got tone arm action nothing he goes back he takes an rs and starts nulling forward and doesnt bother to do anything goes right over this flat spot and nulls on down into the rest of the listthis with 3m aw for god sakes lets take the next to the last rr on the list and walk forward from there i mean down the list from there and if we havent found dr that we can drill that we can put the big mid ruds on and get to firetheres something on that list firing because the list rred and if we havent found dirty needle or something that we can get to fire in just those few short items were wasting time the way you people overlist these daysaaah what are you doing what are you doing do you know how long 3m list is huh do you know really how long 3m list should be oh about absolute outside aboutthis is not source list because you only do one of those on case and that can be nineteen twenty pagesyour ordinary 3m list is something on the order of sixty items fifty items what you doing man theres little short list and bang there it is and whats the matter with you that you keep going bykeep going by items do you realize that you take terminalyoure trying to find the opptermyou overlist from that terminal you not only go past the oppterm you go into the next terminal and can go into the next oppterm and can go into the next terminal do you realize that well what have you done youve just lost about four items for the pc just like that what are you doing all this overlisting stuff for its nonsense you know nonsense bypassed itemsyou wont clear any pc that way youre just there to find items you get down to your fundamentals and you find out that your fundamentals are very simple theres nothing much to these fundamentals theyre very simple youre supposed to sit there and do list and when you see the meter rocket read or rs when the pc says an item you mark the item and you go down here actually what youre trying to do is get the read off the question youre answering the pc and get the item you want on the list thats what youre trying to do you make give you all sorts of mechanical rules by which to do this but in essence thats all youre trying to do youre trying to list something down long enough so theres read left on the question who or what would oppose screameror who or what would screamer oppose using that line plotand youre just listing until theres read left on that question and until youve got an item that reads and do you know that by the time you get to the third bank that can be as few as four or five items what are you doing with these fiftypage lists man what are you trying to do its incredible get on the ball use some of your native initiative what are you trying to do youve got question here and youre just trying to list this question down until you get an item on that list thatsthats all youre trying to do youre trying to list the question until it doesnt read that it stops reading is guarantee youve got the item on the list because it may take you three or four more items before it goes down and youre not trying to bypass opptermyou findfind terminal on list on which youre supposed to get an oppterm do you know the oppterm is on that list youve just gone by it youve got to go back and pick it up its an rr item earlier on the list and you itll only tick now youve got to tiger drill it youve got to get the big mid ruds in on the thing and itll fire again what are you doing losing the pcs items for him its overlisting youre just going down the line fifty pages hundred pages thousand pages and so on what are you trying to do i dont know what youre trying to do actually all youre supposed to do is find the exact pattern of items that i gave you in hcob march the 13th now how do you go about doing that well youd better go about doing that the simplest way you can to do that and do it the most accurately you can so get on the ball man i admit that it was patchup of bank but the other evening suzie found in fiveandahalfhour session nineteen items thats interesting isnt it well what you doing one item per week now look an item is thirtyfive minute proposition but im not berating you on the subject of items and ive given you lot of preliminary this lecture and youre probably all hanging on the railshow to find goals ive had remarkable breakthrough here on the subject of finding goals now there is the tough area thats the rough one finding somebodys goal because its an absolute necessity that you find this persons goal youve got to find this persons goal theres monkey business about this you cant go on finding items without finding somebodys goal youre going to shut off his rr and rs so ive been working on how to find goals its very easy to find goals but after youve found goalsafter youve found somebodys goalit is trick to clear him do you remember that squirrel process that we hadi talked to you about in washington you know the little girl was okay thats perfectly all right to use initiative on that line show you where these things wind up it took thirty hours to patch up the case she cleared in seven and half hours i think that was pretty good huh they found the rest of the items and straightened it up theyshed done keyout on these things so you can do foolish things with this but only when youre trying to shortcut and monkey up the basics and fundamentals of what youre trying to do now finding goals is the first step of 3m and your next step of course is simply finding the items in the gpm and getting those all listed up and the only way youre missing doing that is by overlisting year and half ago we beat everybody over the head consistently and continually because they allalways underlisted theyd have twelve items on the list and 3d criss cross they did nothing but underlist see and we beat everybody over the head for underlisting and screamed at them and so forth and gave infractions and raised the devil and now all they can do is turn us in hundredpage lists i think maybe we trained everybody too well something on that order but the truth of the matter is what does clearing consist of it consists of finding goal and listing it out to get the items in 3m oh yeah its notits not easy but it is just an action and if you could grip what youre trying to do youll do it fairly rapidly but if you dont get grip on what youre trying to do youre not going to do it rapidly now your biggest barrier has been in finding goals thats the biggest barrier and will continue to be the biggest and hardest job but people can find goals people have consistently been finding goals for long period of time now its become absolutely vital that we find goals rather fast and ive been studying this very hard ive been trying to get bulletin out on it for the last few days and its so easily and quickly said however that im sort of defeated at getting this bulletin out i try to list all the number of ways of finding goals and all that sort of thing seems rather arduous and i dont want to get out goals bulletin that just gives us just this one little piece of information id like to get out more embracive bulletin but the truth of the matter is goals is just another specialized method of listing and thats all it is and its listing against certain result and goals listing is far far far more difficult than listing items out of gpm thats simple theres nothing to it unless the auditor is just totally knuckleheaded and hasnt clue what hes doing goals though this is something else this is something else weve had various methods of goals listing one of the most easy and certain ways we had in the past to find goal was in 3ga3ga goals methods there we did something like who or what have you detested got list did represent of the resulting item and listed goals against that that was more complicated than we needed by the way all you had to do was say who or what have you detested and do list and list goals against the resulting item it was quite interesting to do this well that was one of the soundest methods but people have trouble finding rock slams and so forth on some cases and on some cases the goal well the rs and rr have already been shut off so that method is not particularly open so it is in many cases limited so how do you go about finding somebodys goal now thats the main trouble now youre making trouble out of finding items in the gpm you can make lots of trouble out of finding goals because its an infinitely harder operation more difficult its tough and the penalty for running the wrong goal is fry your scalp not my penalty its whatll happen to the pc if you run the wrong goal on him so this is very important technology now youve got in your bulletin and things almost anything you need towell youve got anything you need now to run with the issuance of the last bulletins to run 3m flawlessly making mistakes see this is easy i can tell you how to clean up gpm after youve found the items in it and how to patch it up and missing items and do various things like this and how to run clear tests and all various things like this but the technologys been released now well this isnt true of goals now you can learn to do that listing after youve got the goal but remember everything depends on the goal so youd better straighten yourself up on the subject of listing and get so that you can list just like that man and just get the item bang you know and know thats it and fill in your line plot bzzztbzztbzztbzztbzzt bangbangbang thats the end of that gpm see thats easy why you have guide you have guide and that guide is goal you know exactly where you are going oddly enough you only run into trouble when you run over the bottom border of the gpm into the next gpm as soon as you run over the border into the next gpm youre without goal so youre in trouble because you have guide you keep finding items in 212 you keep finding items just on and on and on in 3m without goal and you can do it too you can have the pcs goal for the first gpm and with great enthusiasm and unbeknownst to either you or the pc run right over into foreign gpm and start finding items in this foreign gpm and all of sudden nothing rocket reads and the pcs rocket read is gone and the pcs been all arc broke for the last couple of sessions and the auditor says well we just should keep on going because its just his meanness he is dramatizing some of the items well he might be dramatizing some of the items but what youve done is youve run into gpm without goal and youre finding items without the pcs goal thats the only thing that can really hang the case up is running items without goal and you can take that and mark it down in letters of fire inside your skull you find items without goal youre in trouble therefore goal is very important goal is very important activity so therefore there will probably be lots of work done on how to find goals i would say theres tremendous quantities of work we did lot of electronics work on this and dale just wrote and told that he had better method of reading an oscilloscope and he could read things with magnitude of about one to hundred with mark v thats pretty good he could read hundred times more sensitive than mark v thats fine im glad of it but that is not the zone of expansion that is zone of expansion be very valuable if we could do it that isnt what we need i dont care how sensitive an instrument youve gotif the pc has not told you his goal youre not going to get read on it now just figure that out oh itd be nice itd be nice you could probably detectit would be very useful dont let run it down but what you need is method of getting the pc to put his goal on list and ive been developing information along this line and ive been putting some things together with this and im quite cheerful about the whole thing seems to seems to that getting the pc to put his goal on the list is far far more important than any other activity that we could conduct now i expect to see goals finding move up into very fine art and very exact science and so forth and ive made breakthrough which puts it through in that direction weve got lots of methods of finding goals you understand that but you need some very positive methods of finding goals now one of the methods of finding goals is to takeill show you how just an adventure in goals finding method of finding goalsyou get the pc to do goals list and then you keep nulling goals on the goals list until the pc arc breaks and then go back through the last sessions auditing and find out which goals still tick and do represent on those goals until the pc gets the right goal you see hell arc break not because his goal is on the list but because near miss is on the list all right that would be method of goals finding im just showing you some adventurous lines of doing this youll use this by the way ive used it myself i find it quite fascinating if you go by near wording of the pcs goal on list the pc can be expected to arc break in the next session that or the next session see hell arc break on it well thats goals method show you how wild these methods could be youll use the method some time dont just laugh at it youll say well gee you know this pc has been all arc broke ever since the november 3rd session look at these folders you know look at the folder look at the auditors reports here look at these auditor reports been sad character and hasnt been reading on the meter and had upsets with the auditor ever since that session oh he was finding goals in that session and here are the goals list of that session and they all went out well yes they all went out but the auditor wasnt quite watching as closely as he might have been because one of them was still ticking and that was not the pcs goal that was near miss ill give you an idea the one of them the pc put on the list was to eat catfish and the pcs goal is to catch catfish and you go over the top of it the pcll arc break because you see its near miss its nearly found out and it acts just like any other withholdmissed withhold and the pc gets upset so its near wording of the goal i have actually had alooked back into this and this is fact this is fact we thought before and were defeated on this that wed gone over the actual goal we knew that was the case that always arc breaks the pc his goal is to catch catfish the auditor goes down the line to catch catfish you know to catch catfish anything on this goal been suppressed you know and the meter falls you know off the pin and the auditor says thats clean and goes on to the next goal hehhehheh heh sometime during the next half an hour the pcs going to say you know the way youre acknowledging is terrible your meter isyour hand on the meter is bothering this that criticism criticism and the next thing you know fullblown arc break that was the exact goal that was gone over but look its more intimate than that it is more intimate than that you can go over the goal to catch fish and the pcs goal is to catch catfish see and the pc will arc break well thats method of goals finding then isnt it i consider that fascinating it opens the door more ways than one it tells usalthough were never supposed to represent rock slamming itemyou can always write three or four or five goals after any goal were not representing it were trying to get various wordings of that exact goal thats interesting isnt it more goals are missed by not quite the right wording what happens when you take the pcs first gpm goalits all ready to be found you see and there it isand this gpm goal is to scream thats going to be the goal youre going to find and you get the goal to be screamer do you know when you tiger drill that thing it fires bang to be screamer is what youve found the actual goal is to scream see to be screamer bang rocket read bang then it doesnt rocket read the rocket read now disappears it rses rses to be screamerrs rs rs and sometimes you even get dwindling rs on goal that close youll get dwindling rs next thing you know it only goes tick tick tick where did it go that was the pcs actual goal it should have ticked then when drilled with the lefthand buttons suppressed careful of and failed to reveal should have given rocket read and then when prepchecked should have given much better rocket read on it should have kept on rocket reading thats the pcs goal see but this goal it didnt behave that way it goes bang bang tick well it ticked in the first place you drilled it it went rocket read rocket read rockrock rock rock rock slam rock slam rock slam narrower rock slam narrower rock slam narrower rock slam tick right in front of your eyes youve got goal there which is almost the wording but isnt quite so when you see that dont blow your brains out say give some other wordings for this goal and amongst them he will give you to scream and when he gives you that if yourlist on the meter see he gives you that that goal is going to go pschew itll be little bit suppressed however and itll only go that one fire maybe and then it doesnt fire and it doesnt fire and then you get the buttons in on it the lefthand buttons just the three of themsuppress careful of and fail to reveal just thoseand it just sits there and rocket reads from there on out interesting isnt it has your pcs goal been near miss huh have you nearly found it now theres one type of goal thats probably very easy to find and thats an axiom 10 goal lets say to impress people and it goes psheww psheww rrump tick rocket read tick tick tick tick slight blowdown reads with slight dr nothing can be done with this thing now you see to impress people to shoot people rocket read tick gone to drown people you can get off on the line of doing something to people dont you see actually its an axiom 10 type of goal if he was scientologist you say give some axiom 10 goals just do little list of axiom 10 goals you get something like to create effects bow it rocket reads every time you see see what youve been doing now therefore in finding goals you must maintain an outhard list and not spend the rest of your life tiger drilling something that only gives consistent tick you understand you get goalyou list goal i dont care now what method youre using you list the goal against the meter you take this list and null it by elimination take the last three or four in put in the lefthand buttons on them suppress careful of fail to reveal do prepcheck with those you know repetitive repetitive buttons not just fast check on those last three and one of them goes psshew well now youve got career now youve got career if yourif you dont care what happens to scientology and you dontit doesnt seem to matter whether we ever clear anybody up or not this is the course you will take oh well i saw it rocket read once i know because i myself have made this mistake see im not now talking without experience in this you can invest the next twentyfive or thirty hours on that damn goal you can you saw it rocket read wow cut my throat see you saw it rocket read ahhhaaa now just go on and prepcheck it give it another prepcheck you know then give it another prepcheck then you dont know what to do so give it another prepcheck see and then put in the session rudiments for all those sessions and give it another prepcheck it wont go out it now only ticks but it just wont go out you understand well just call that goal that goes out hard and you put it over here on the goalthatgoesouthard list and dont you spend more than about fifteen minutes on the thing thats the secret it rocket reads you polish it up cant get it to rocket read again but it still ticks it isnt going to go out so forth put it over here on this goalsthatwentouthard list john jones pc and put the date each one of them went out hard and when youre doing this list youre doing his lists matter what else youre doing keep that goalsthatwentouthard list you understand now if the goal was ever seen to rocket read also mention that on your goalsthatwentouthard list rocket read march the 3rd so forth see it doesnt mean anything that it rocket read beyond that its near miss you keep trying to find the pcs goal and every time you get one that when you put in the lefthand buttons on you cant get it to rocket read again but it did something interesting actually the whole definition is that you cant get it to disappear you put it over here on this list now of course if you find goal that not only wont disappear but sporadically every now and then rocket reads youve got the pcs goal so dont put it on the goalsthatwentouthard list understand you put that on your auditors report as the pcs goal found and then get it checked out by somebody and itll rocket read for that person too now if it doesnt rocket read for that person dont immediately assign the fact that the instructor or the auditing supervisor is suppressive the facts of the case are if it wont rocket read for the person who is checking it out it just belongs over here on the goalsthat wentouthard list you understand dont make career out of it theres how you fail to find goalsby making career out of those that go out hard put them on special listand ill show you the reason for that in momentput them over here on special list give any data about that goal the goal to catch catfish fired three times in tiger drilling and rsed of course youre complete knucklehead if you actually didnt do something else right there at that moment see it fired three times and rsed and finally dwindled and whuuuh probably the goal is to catch fish see its near its almost deadon see but its just enough off so that it doesnt keep rocket reading now therefore lets lay down few principles here first and foremost the pc does have goal that can be found relatively easily thats your first principle now its taken long time to learn that principle so itll take you long time to learn that principle too so that you get good subjective reality on it the pc does have goal that can be found thats an interesting principle to lay down with that amount of violence but you know the auditor that isnt used to finding goals he sits there and he says uhhhhu umwell i dont know whether thismaybe the pcs goal cant be found you know therefore he does limp and stupid things see his hope factor is very poor so he says well well give him another prepcheck on auditing and well do this and well do that and well do something else and well do something else now you know the goal is the only part of the case that is instantly findable if it is on list thats your next principle the goal is the only part of the case regardless of the condition of the case which is instantly findable when contacted you dont need huge electronics devices to find these goals common meter can find goal actually an old 1957 can find goal it would be very niceit would be very nice to have big electronic machine that did tell you more near misses you could probably trace it down easier but actually you dont need them little old mark v or mark iv is all you need thatll do you just fine it is the easiest thing to find on the case if the case is in shocking bad shape thats another one thats interesting too now heres another basic principle goals processing is the only processing that is totally unlimited you know just take all ceiling off you can always try to find goals there is ceiling on how many hours you can spend but there is ceiling on the number of hours you can spend finding items and there is actually ceiling on the number of hours of prepchecking you give the guy problems intensives and nothing but problems intensive s lets say hes twentyfive years oldwell let assure you by the time youve given him problem inlets say eight or nine or ten problems intensives about hundred and twenty hundred twentyfive hundred fifty hours worth of processing youre starting to hit limit whats going to limit you actually youre running prehav buttons called the mid rud buttons and they wont run forever will they they will run an awful long time theyll run so long that theres reason to stress it or mention it to people well for instance until you find goal and get bank clear you can get one of the mid ruds buttons on some subject stuck did you know that you can get anxiety for instancelets say anxiety you can always find answers on an itemanxiety on this item is there anything youve been anxious about pc can always answer that but actually youve run anxious about on the subject of since the last time i audited you is there anything youve been anxious about now you havent found the guys goal you havent got clear gpm so therefore theres limit on the number of times that question can be asked yes its very wide limit and its something youre not going to run into but there actually is limit along aboutif you dont find his goal and his first gpm ifyoud find out if you were auditing somebody for year or sowithout ever finding any gpm you understand or clearing thatthe one fine day hard mass would start to turn on by reason of your asking the since the last session is there anything youve been anxious about in other words its like any other prehav level its been overrun you understand that so its limited action its not something youre going to run into so stop worrying because youre going to clear this guy you see soon as you get gpm out of the way why the ceiling is off all of the prehav buttons are now completely free again and theyll all run to flat spots but im just telling you that even prepchecking of that particular type depending as it does on what were originally prehav level buttons has zenith but goals processing does not have you can always find goal now theres only one reservation is at any given time there is only one goal to be found so we reverse what we just said and say that it is unlimited im saying youre trying you see can be unlimited but it does have ceiling which is finding the pcs goal after youve found the pcs goal you wont be able to find the pcs goal you wont be able to stall anymore youll have to clear him now now take it over into overlisting take it out on him by overlisting bypassing items in the gpm thats all you can do after youve found his goal thats the only way thats mean of isnt it i actually have more confidence in you than that and im not sarcastic that way about your auditing his yes butyou know orand his yes but notnot yours okay youll go right on and clear him wont you all right thank you after youve found the pcs goal you cant find the pcs goal the only thing you can do from there on is clear him you got that that is the goal but there is point just short of finding the pcs goal which you can go on forever and its one of those thingsmary sue in instructing here and so forth has gotten very tired of this one in fact she id say every few weeks i hear this remark prepchecking it forever some pc is doing some hard sell you know my goal is to enliven space opera see and you know hellin there with the hard sell well it was seen to rocket read in 1961 early in the year once and they have now run up 275 prepchecking hours on this goal and the pc is turned over to new auditor and the new auditor starts to prepcheck this goal oh yes it happens now thats method of not finding the pcs goal prepchecking things that arent his goal that he merely hopes is so we get the next principle it is up to the auditor to find out if it is the pcs goal see thats up to the auditor to find it out it isnt the responsibility of the pc its the auditors responsibility now if you look over goals finding in these various lights you will find out that its rather simple activity providing youre in there trying to find the pcs goal now im working on routine 2gx and ill be talking to you about that later now that is prepcheck which possibly will make the pc spit his goal out and very possibly it will work and possibly it wont work but there is workable process now on the subject of goals which is relatively simple process and this can be run foreveruntil of course you find the pcs goal if youre unlucky enough to find the pcs goal of course you cant run this process anymore because the only way you can find the pcs goal again and do all that again is after youve gotten rid of the whole gpm that that goal is connected with which is seventeen twenty thirty items something like this and when youve gotten rid of that gpm see then you can go through it all over again but you have to get rid of this well you have to go to the work of getting rid of this gpm before you can go at the endless business of finding the pcs goal again see so itsbe happyim happy to be able to tell you that it doesnt completely end with the finding of one goal now how do you go about finding this goal well youd better find it well how do you find it take the oldest item valid invalid rumored thought of hoped for rocket read or rock slammed or was never even found on meterwe dont care what or under whose authority it was found or anything else we care nothing about these things found in some acc you see we dont care where lets get that one thats the first one ever found thats the first reliable item for goals finding as far as were concerned see probably doesnt even belong to the bank but it might who knows it doesnt now have to read other conditions attached to this thing we dont have to know if its terminal if its an oppterm anything dont have to know anything about this and we find this get the pc to tell us or get it out of his auditors reports we take that one we find the next item of this character and the next item of this anything ever found on this pc we dont care if it was dynamic assessment we dont know how it was found we dont care if somebody dreamed it up we dont care if it was what was found so we could run the rock we dont care if it was something an auditor got tick on so that he could one day run ow on it we dont care what it is its anything that was ever found on that pc and we put this on list we put these items on list as accurately as we can but regardless and without losing any get whole list of these things and bring it right on down to present time and include on it all r2 12 210 3ga criss cross whether gotten from rock slamming item or not we dont care in other words lets just pick up all this debris lets get the whole lot thats our first step in modernly finding goals our next step is an elementary one that is so elementary its horrible we take the meter and we put down sheet of paper and we take the first terminal and we simply list from the question what might the goal of whatever the item is be thats our question what might the goal of t you know lets say the first item ever found was rock what might the goal of rock be see get the idea and now how long do we list that well theres couple of youim kind of mad about overlisting so i wont make any bright cracks about it but if i catch you going nineteen twenty thirty seventy eighty ninety two hundred pages with that goals list off of the rock im going towell ill give you psychiatric consultation hows that because its little short list its little dinky list you know about so maybe two columns maybe two sheets of paper and look every few items the pc gives you youve got to learn this trick because its new trick in listing and its trick which is in goals finding and itll be trick in the later banks of the gpm and so forth not for the first one you can still count on your twentyfive for the first one twentyfive after the last rs or whateveror last rr but its the trick of reading question to see if it reads not tiger drilling it so it will read but seeing if the question will read what might the goal of rock be thats your question and youre only going to list goals until that question reads clean got it that doesnt absolutely guarantee that the goal if it is to be on that list is on the list theres absolute guarantee of it so do two three more you get the idea youll find out that if it reads the list is not complete but that it is clean does not mean the item is on the list yet its almost maybe do two or three more do few more beyond thisbeyond this clean point for that item and then knock it off youre through with that item until youunless you just have completely horrible bad luck now you listed these things on the meter didnt you and you watched this meter carefully for rrs and rses and you marked each one of those goals when they rsed and rred you got it what might the goals of rock be and you read that occasionally asking the pc the question you also read it on the meter dont you see you say what might the goal of rock be and you see that that doesnt read and so you say all right well give two or three more and ill end this list something like that and you do and make sure youthat you get the rrs and rses see and thenyou got that now you got that now you dont pick the rses and rrs off or do anything stupid like that you take this sheet of paper which is in front of you now and you simply put your meter right back where it was and you null that list by elimination pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa youll find its clean needle list just null them and any read of any kind that you get you leave it in you call each one three times remember the old three bark proposition maybe the pc didnt hear it the first time so you say to be catfish to be catfish to be catfish dont saydont scream it at the pc use fairly normal tone of voice to be catfish to be catfish to be catfish all right and dont bother to tell him it read or it didnt read you dont care anything about that now if it got read of any kindand theres big adjudications on this well lets see if it ticked once and then didnt tick twice then is it in or is it out you know well well hold some courts on that so that we can finally decide some findings concerning it i just tell you the thing has to be in actually if it reads two times out of the three its for sure in and if it reads on tick on the third one its probably in too but its adjudications of that character youll have to get used to now those things we take them down the line and we take themthe whole list weve done this item what might the goal of rock be weve done list on the thing against the meter those things are marked with rrs and rses we dont pay any attention to the rrs and rses all we do is null the whole list by elimination bang that leaves us maybewe go over it maybe twice and things go out and were left there with maybe three goals and on those three goals we put in the lefthand buttons of the big mid rudssuppress careful of and fail to revealand we do it more or less by prepcheck basis and simple this is real simple because if its ever going to rocket read its going to rocket read because you got those three buttons off of it you understand you can put in all the rest of it but thats after goal has proved itself up bit and youre curious about it all right and none of those three fired they didnt fire didnt respond didnt anything but also one of them didnt lose its tick got that didnt lose its tick never fired it falls occasionally it behaves peculiarly but you dont have rocket reads on it you transfer that goal over to the goalsthatwentouthard list say what item it came from that it did or didnt rocket read and so forth and you put it over there and then you take this whole sheet and you attach it to your goals folder for the pc and you forget about the rock you got it you just forget about that thats gone now thats gone and you take the next item in sequence that is the next oldest item the pc has had and you do exactly the same thing you got it and you exhaust all of the items youve got for that pc up to the time when you actually do find the pcs goal you got it now the only variation that happens is if you get one that rocket reads rock slams fires doesnt fire ticks get all the big mid ruds in on the thing again and see if it does anything else and if it just ticks you say this goal is awful close to it so you do little represent on that goal you got it you take another little sheet of paper see and you say all right now we have this goal here to be screamer can you state this in other ways or can you give the same sense in other ways and he finally says uhto listen to howl to screech uhto scream uhto yell uhto make noise to be noisy uh and so forth you say thats fine because of course in the meantime listing on the meter youve seen this thing to scream rocket read and you say all right now i want to give you this goal i want to give you these goals and you just do the same action youve done with the other goals in other words you go over them you null them and so on and youll see this goal to scream fire and you say all right and you null them out and now we three of them fire now one of them is firing to scream you say all right now on to scream remember today it isnt ever on the goal to scream or anything like that its on to scream has anything been suppressed you know is there anything youve been careful of is there anything youve failed to reveal and this thing is firing on its mid rud buttons and you say hahahaha its firing on its mid rud buttons and bang bang and then all of sudden it fires because of course its been suppressed by finding the near miss dont you see and itll fire and itll fire and itll fire and itll fire and itll fire and thats it and you take it and get it checked out and itll fire and itll fire and itll fire and the real goal on case is the only thing that just keeps on firing from there on out got that we do that to every item the guys got every item you can dig up on the case dont find new items because someday youll turn off his rr and rs what if the rr and rs has been turned off on the case by finding too many items by some eager beaver it doesnt matter the goal will still rr if you find it it will rr see its the only safe process there is actually is finding goals interesting isnt it now ive said its the only safe process there is let emphasize it just little bit further it is one of the best processes there is if you were never going to find goal it would be good auditing because every goal you find and everything you straighten out for this pc and every goal you get rid of for the pc and every goal the pc lists makes him read little better on the meter feel little better get rid of few more somatics one of theone of the rules that goes with thisthere arent very many rules there arent any beyond what ive told youthe pc turns on severe somatic or sen on goal why run the buttons run the buttons on the thing till it goes off but that can get you in trap the pc can sell you goal that way and it never rocket reads so clean it up as best you can actually you can practically cripple pc but also you can run goal like to create and almost take his head off it never rocket read but you just for some reason or other keep on drilling it and of course it is the pcs goalin the tenth gpm of course thats strong enough goal to blow his head off anyhow now you keep putting these goalsthatwentouthard over on this list and you dont forget that goalsthatwentouthard list because you probablyyou very well may havehis second goal or his third goal or his fifth goal for the gpm on that first list thats very interesting and one of the things that auditors are doing is finding the goal that belongs to the second gpm before finding the goal on the first gpm and therefore they dont get beautiful rocket reads and the pc just gets prepchecked forever and this is bunch of nonsense why well its the pcs goal all right and of course hell arc break if you tell him it isnt his goal because it is his goal but it belongs to the second gpm or the third or the fourth or the fifth you see of course it wont 90 out but it wont rocket read either and its sure not ready to run man if you were to run that youd plow him straight in because hes more ready to go into that second gpm than he is to jump off the empire state building with complete impunity thats too much for him so you keep that goalsthatgoouthard list and youll eventually find the pcs goal now this is terrific way to do an intensive terrific way to do an intensive now what about raw meat what about raw meat they dont have bunch of items do they well why dont you find some why dont you find some how would you go about finding these actually you dont have to do very much to find some kind of items you couldyou could find them as lousily and as sloppily and as stupidly as some items have been found in the history of scientology you know you could do that you could say well who havent you really liked and he says well i dont know i dont know dododododo oh aunt jezebel oh yeah sure hated her guts didnt rr doesnt rs doesnt do anything he hated aunt jezebel so you ask well whats aunt jezebels goal you ask why well you only need to look at the march 13th line plot to find out why the oppterm is far more likely you see to carry the pcs goal than the terminal and the older it is the earlier it was found on the pcs case the more likely it is to be an oppterm that carries the goal now what if you went through all these lists and all of these items suppose you only had five and you went through all of these and you didnt find them you didnt find anything you know the least productive lists and the lists thatll give you the least action were the terminals and the lists which gave you the most action were the oppterms thats interesting isnt it so you now could take this hatful of items that you found separate out those that didnt give anything that even whispered and call those things terminals and then list goals with another question what goal would failure be an overt against now you can almost take the very lowtoned sounding items and those too would probably be the endofbank terminals and you can run that question you run it the same way you do exactly the same things you just make little list here what goal would failure be an overt against and of course the pc gives you the proper goal for that youve got another crack at it with the same terminals you got the idea we just list them at first though and your most success will simply be treat them all as just items list them all with the same question what might be the goal of youll find that youll at least find the family of the pcs goals because eventually youll have them sitting over here on the goalsthatwentouthard list and that will give you the family of goals that the pc has i wouldnt depend too much on deduction of this sort of thing but anything i ever saw rocket read id get different versions of you follow that well now that is actually goals intensive and its not the action to find the pcs goal it is auditing to better the pc you see that its just auditing to better the pc hell get closer and closer to realizing his goal the more of this auditing you do the more goals you process the more goals you get rid of the more goals you straighten up the happier you make the pc in this the less you worry him the more likely he is to put his goal on the list so the action is to get the pc straightened up so that he will put his goal on the list you see that the biggest trouble in goal finding is the pc has not put his goal on the list you see that thats the trouble with goal finding why hasnt he well he isnt close enough to it yet how do you put him close enough to it get him to go through goals and drill them and straighten them up and hell have ball in other words goals intensive just sit down and audit him through finding goals and fortunately that has termination point because when you find the pcs goalas you willwhy you cant do any more goals finding youll have to run 3m and clear him im sorry but thats true because the only time you can do more goals finding and run this goals intensive on him of course is when youve gotten rid of all of the first gpm and now when youve gotten rid of that of course you can go back and give him some real auditing which is goals finding again the trouble is it gets interrupted after the first gpm the pcsyoure just about to go through this and list goals on the next oppterm that you found and the next bank and youre just all straightened out and he says my goal is to catch catfish and you aaaah damn nuts once in while though youll lay an egg pc puts hisputs his goal on the goalasanrioppose list thats the last item on the bank it doesnt fire on that list you go over the top of it the pc arc breaks you cant understand whats wrong you have to take it off the list before it fires again its very interesting it wont fire while on the list youve got to take it off the list to make it fire again little oddities of that character youll run into now what happens if the pc doesnt have any items at all and you dont care to go into any old 3ga or any action to get some items off the pc to list goals against there is still the oldest known goals method which is you just list whole bunch of goals list them on the meter just as you would watch for your rrs keep the pc listing goals keep him listing goals listing goals listing goals and eventually why tone arm action tends to go out of the thing and the thing fires and you explore around and follow the same rules i gave you for the other one you can then even find goals without finding any items this pc gets favorite goal he gets stuck on the goal you say well you can even move him off that by listing bunch of goals what goal would you have after the goal something had failed the one hes stuck on and hell move into the next bank and you got ta action back on your goals you can always restore ta action back on your goals by getting the bank before or the bank after the goal he is enamored with see and youll get all kinds of interesting combinations of things the point im making here is that goals finding is processing you had better treat it as processing and the better it is as processing the more likely you are to find the pcs goal that is the basic message in all this goals shouldnt be hectic screaming finding that only has result if you find the pcs goal it is actually processing it is good processing if it is well done the pc comes way up scaleeven when you havent found his goal you see if youre really doing it well and not annoying the pc the pc comes way up and all of sudden one day he says oh he says waaaah my goal is and youve got it more than one pc has done that you can actually bring the pc into frame of mind where hell present you with his goal if you just keep finding his goals efficiently and handling them efficiently and so forth now thats the biggest barrier in clearing people is finding peoples goals and the basic breakthrough on this thing is just simplification of how you do it and using the oldest items that pc has and listing them in that fact and nulling his list in little short lists and listing the questions clean getting enough goals to clean the question youll eventually find the pcs goal if you just keep this up and then you take those goals that went out hard you can actually go down the line and get different wordings for those goals that were seen to rr you can fool around with that list little bit and bang the pcll give you his goal you can find the pcs goal and finding goals is some of the most excellent processing there is and the most unlimited processing the pc can have id sail ahead with this because there isnt really too much trick as far as blowing goals is concerned goals are blown by finding the number of items or more which you find on the march 13th 1963 hcob line plot if you found those items and maybe few more and so forth and so on why somebody has blown goal but if you havent found the items for that goal like that then the pc hasnt blown goal and thats all you can say about that but finding goals is something youre going to have to do the more gpms you find the easier it is to find goals thats for sure finding the first one is the hardest but also it happens to be the best processing you can give the pc so you win in all directions okay all right thank you very much good night
