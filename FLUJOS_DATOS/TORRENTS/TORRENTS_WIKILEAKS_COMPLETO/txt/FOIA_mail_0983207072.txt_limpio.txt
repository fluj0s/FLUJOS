college in maine giving talk about the last 1000 years there were three others as well on other paleo aspects richard alley gary clow and wally broecker the latter briefly mentioned to that he had had something in last fridays science which was getting at the mann et series he didnt have copy so weve not seen it here yet i tried to get copy of science on the bookstand at logan airport last night i guess its not sold that way wally was going on about this 1500 yr cycle of bonds which seemed pretty flimsy i was showing all the various series in general talk and i used some of the overheads from the upcoming science paper this is due to appear in the issue for the last week of april it is all accepted now i will forward if youll all abide by the science rules both wally and alley seem convinced that the climate of greenland changed by 10 c in the space of 23 years at times in the past dryas etc i had long talks with both and they dont seem to have got their heads around spatial scales local changes and hemispheric also they dont seem to realise where we are coming from he has downer on trees believes all the multiproxy series depend exclusively on trees but he thinks ed cook is great scientist the latter is true but he might just think that because hes at lamont i did tell him that keiths paper on the age banding is out in jgr i should send him reprint and maybe ask that great scientist to go and explain it to him eds in nz at the moment also wally believes much more in glacier advancesretreats ill get keith to send him sarahs paper where the long tornetrask reconstruction is shown to agree with storglaciaren advanceretreat dates from moraine evidence also sarahs been working on similar glaciers in the swiss alps with long treering reconstructions one interesting thing was he didnt seem to realise that lot of the treering reconstructions use density seemed to think they were all ring widths and there had to be moisture changes we were not accounting for it is easy to respond to perspectives piece some of you did it with respect to one of mine im not sure it will achieve much it wont come out before the paper in the last week of april i need to wait to what he says our paper tim and keith clearly says that the mwp couldnt have been warmer for the nh average than the late 20th century another possible reason for not doing anything is that the ipcc report will be out soon the summary is written in pretty clear language the above is my first thoughts not having read the piece and just got off the flight back best to ignore woijcek all he seems to want to do is deflect us into responding cheers phil at 1147 250201 0700 mhughesltrrarizonaedu wrote dear all what mechanism does science have for repsonding to perspective pieces most of the answer to wally is contained within his own piece he comments on the ambiguity of the record which in various ways we have all done what he doesnt offer however is anything other than an anecdotal alternative as always he seeks to damn in this case with faint praise the records or work that dont serve his purpose and to elevate any scrap of evidence that does serve it i think it will be important for us to stick closely to what we have written in published papers cheers malcolm quoting michael mann mannvirginiaedu dear phil ray what do you guys think if were all on board than an appropriately toned high road response here might be appropriate we dont want to engage wally in personal battle but simply should correct the record where wally has muddied it again phil et do have science article in press that serves this purpose to some extent so im especially interested in what phil thinks phil mike at 0252 pm 22401 0700 mhughesltrrarizonaedu wrote dear mike et i think we should definitely let wojick stew in his own juice as mike pointed out to the other day he and his like have specific agenda and anything we write will be pressed into the service of that agenda im not so sure about wally i share toms disinclination to get into street fight with wally generally i take the view that lifes too short and uncertain for such activities on the other hand would we let such shoddy piece of workand editing go by if it were from another author there are so many holes in wallys argument and such selective choice of evidence that it should beggar belief one of the more obvious holes is that he writes of the great basin droughts of the 10th through 14th centuries as proof of warmer conditions then but doesnt explain why we dont have such conditions now interestingly larry benson dave meko and others have good evidence that these same multidecadal periods were marked by great excess of precipitation just few hundred miles north in northern nevada and california and southern oregon he just hasnt grasped that the methods that are appropriate for tracking the consequences of major changes in boundary conditions dont work in the late holocene ive been trying to figure out the issue of was there medieval warm period and if so where and when for decade or so and still have the impression that the records for the 9th through 14th centuries are extremely mixed but then i didnt come to the investigation with certain knowledge of the absolute truth and have had to misfortune to work with people who let careful analysis get in the way henry diaz ray and mike and others anyway the point of this rant is that i think we should give careful consideration to making measured response to wally cheers malcolm quoting michael mann mannvirginiaedu hi tom thanks for your quick reply i agree with you entirely i think its very unfortunate hes chosen to disinform the community rather than engage in constructive dialogue we tried the latter w him in series of emails last year but clearly to avail on the other hand think that war of words w broecker would be exploited by the skeptics and perhaps we should just try to let this thing die im not sure id appreciate knowing what others think mike at 1025 am 22401 0600 tom crowley wrote mike i was not aware of the broecker piece i am dismayed but not surprised i do not know what to do i personally cannot stand the combative personal approach broecker relishes but it does seem as if some rebuttal is called for maybe you ray phil i and malcolm could pen response we are heading to germany in week for month so i am not sure how much i can keep up on this but it seems as if some response is called for what think ye tom dear mike thanks for passing this along wojick of course completely misrepresents broecker and puts his conventional intellectually dishonest spin on this that having been said it is bit disappointing that wally continues to cling to some of his flawed beliefs which arent supported from either our best current understanding of the observations or of the results of careful modeling experiments my own perception is that the climate community modelers as well as observationalists simply dont take seriously anymore the idea that the history of climate change over the past 1000 years is part of an internal oscillation the sediment core evidence oft cited by broecker eg bond et for this is tremendously weak and i as well as the vast majority of my colleagues simply dont buy it for even second but people dont like to challenge broecker publically he can and will play hardball there is an odd irony broecker refused to accept the modeling evidence that the 100 kyr ice age pleistocene variations were part of an internal oscillation paced by insolation variations favoring instead the discredited notion that they were direct response to too weak eccentricity forcing until the evidence became insurmountable from my adviser barry saltzman may he rest in piece and people like dick peltier ironically broecker then took credit for the very proposition he had fought w tooth and nail broecker is even more wrong and unfortunately equally stubborn in this case and again the reason because his pet theory that climate variability is simple millennial oscillation is finally being challenged w hard data and hard facts broecker misrepresents the nature of that data that we and others have used and misunderstands the source of the muted hemispheric trends there is hemispheric medieval warm period and little ice age just not of the magnitude or the distinctiveness that broecker imagines individual regions in our reconstructions and phils and others vary by several degrees c ie the proxies we use have problem whatsoever in resolving highamplitude temperature variations in the past the problem is that when we look at the different regions we find that periods of cold and warm often occur at very different times in different regions and so in hemispheric or global average lot of purely regional variability cancels out the resulting trends are somewhat smaller i remained befuddled as to why wally doesnt understand this point its been explained to him time and time again maybe hes just not listening or doesnt want to listen in fact tom crowley has clearly shown that the observed millennial temperature reconstruction is precisely consistent w our understanding of forced climate change over the past 1000 years solar changes volcancic output and recent greenhouse gas concentrations there is simply put room for global millennial internal oscillation regionally such types of climate phenomena associated for example with changes in the north atlantic ocean circulation are supported by the observations this explains why for example european temperature variations are somewhat larger than those in other regions not effected so strongly by such climate processes other recent perspectives by ray bradley and myself provide far more balanced and nuanced and less dogmatic or defensive viewpoint im not sure written response to broecker is worthwhile this is afterall perspective and everyone understands that scientist may have flawed perspective if wally wants this to be his legacy so be it phil and others have review article coming out in the near future which also provides much more balanced perspective on the climate changes of the past millennium and will set the record straight once again good timing phil sciences embargo policy prevents from saying much more at this time but if phil or anyone else wishes to comment further id encourage it well ive still got some snow to shovel here in charlottesville happy weekend to all mike ps for those with electronic subscriptions broeckers latest piece can be found

show mike three wojick pieces on climate change ive been busy busy david first the latest issue of insight magazine includes pointcounterpoint between measly old and the great robert watson boy has he got credentials too bad hes wrong httpwwwinsightmagcomarchive200103143shtml symposium do scientists have compelling evidence of global warming yes rising sea levels worldwide and retreating arctic glaciers are ominous signs by robert t watson chairman of the intergovernmental panel on climate change chief scientist at the world bank and former chief science advisor to the clinton white house despite the overheated rhetoric there is new evidence of warming by david wojick covers climate policy for electricity daily and is science adviser to the greening earth society httpwwwgreeningearthsocietyorg as well as undereditor of the washington pest httpwwwwashingtonpestcom second the february 15 ecologic online has published the black hole of global climate government by david wojick my detailed attack on the framework convention on climate change it includes lot of the actual treaty language httpwwwecofreedomorgel20010202wojickshtml third here is draft electricity daily article of mine seems im not the only one who thinks the ipcc is nuts climate guru kicks the hockey stick by david wojick dwojickshentelnet global warming is natural and the recent warming is probably exception this is the controversial argument made by prominent climatologist wallace s broecker in todays issue of science broeckers bombshell bears the seemingly innocent title was the medieval warm period global it may seem esoteric but whether the apparent warmth reported in europe about 1000 years ago was global or simply local is becoming central issue in climate science what makes it contentious is the recent claims by the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change that the earth is warmer now than it has been for millennia and that therefore human carbon dioxide emissions are to blame broecker leading figure at lamontdoherty earth observatory columbia university questions both ipcc claims the focus of the debate is 1000year temperature reconstruction known in climate circles as the hockey stick produced in 1999 by m mann r s bradley m k hughes the long handle of the hockey stick shows global temperatures for the first 8 centuries as basically unchanging followed by the sharply uptilting blade of the last 150 years or so the mann et hockey stick is the central feature of the recently released ipcc working group one summary for policy makers which claims to embody the best of climate science broecker does not like the hockey stick nor the conclusions the ipcc draws from it he says recent widely cited reconstruction manns leaves the impression that the 20th century warming was unique during the last millennium it shows hint of the medieval warm period from around 800 to 1200 ad during which the vikings colonized greenland suggesting that this warm event was regional rather than global it also remains unclear why just at the dawn of the industrial revolution and before the emission of substantial amounts of anthropogenic greenhouse gases earths temperature began to rise steeply was it coincidence i do not think so rather i suspect that the post1860 natural warming was the most recent in series of similar warmings spaced at roughly 1500year intervals throughout the present interglacial the holocene broecker presents the evidence for global medieval warm period as well as for little ice age from around 1300 to 1860 when the present temperature rise begins he also argues that the proxy evidence used by mann et such as tree ring data is ill suited to the time period and temperature variation less than one degree c in question as he puts it in my estimation at least for time scales greater than century or two only two proxies can yield temperatures that are accurate to 05 c the reconstruction of temperatures from the elevation of mountain snowlines and borehole thermometry tree ring records are useful for measuring temperature fluctuations over short time periods but cannot pick up longterm trends because there is way to establish the longterm evolution in ring thickness were temperatures to have remained constant broecker acknowledges that the proxy evidence is necessarily somewhat murky but his conclusion is that climatic conditions have oscillated steadily over the past 100000 years with an average period close to 1500 years the swing from the medieval warm period to the little ice age was the penultimate of these oscillations the implication being that some if not all of the present warming is the natural swing out of the little ice age and that mann et as well as
