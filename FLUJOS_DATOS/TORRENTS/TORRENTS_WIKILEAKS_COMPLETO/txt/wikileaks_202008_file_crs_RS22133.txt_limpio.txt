new funding is available from the asdbs website5 policy issues are usually the first subject of discussion in mdb replenishment negotiations money issues are addressed at the end of the process the us representatives generally have number of policy issues on which they place high priority according to some leading officials there will be relationship between the amount they are willing to pledge for contribution by the united states and their success in achieving their policy goals for the record they say that the treasury department may consult with the office of management and budget omb beforehand relative to the amount which might be contributed and other budgetary constraints but the final figure takes into consideration the us delegations assessment of the needs of the organization and their success forwarding their policy goals during the replenishment negotiations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22133 other observers suggest though that the amount the united states can contribute will be determined in large part by omb in advance and the us representatives cannot stray far from that number in their final contribution pledge international development association results measurement according to the administration the us delegation had four main policy objectives during the ida 14 replenishment negotiations the first of these involved improvements in the world banks system for measuring the effectiveness of idas development policies and programs this is usually summarized in the phrase results measurement this has been us priority since the clinton administration major steps were take during ida 12 1998 at the urging of the united states to create mechanisms for country capacity and project outcomes the world banks country policy and institutional assessment cpia process was created as consequence of ida 12 additional steps were taken in 2002 during the ida 13 talks to strengthen and increase the scope of the cpia mechanism 2 for

agreement 1 expands the results measurement process adding 14 new country level indicators 2 adds new output measures to assess the contribution which ida programs make in the health education water supply and transportation sectors in recipient countries 3 creates new countrylevel institutional indicators and 4 adds more projectlevel indicators it also requires that all ida investment projects and development policy loans include indicators that will measure the performance of ida projects or programs according to predetermined numerical expectations or goals grants the ida 14 replenishment plan increases the share of ida resources which are allocated as grants in 2002 president bush said in preparation for the ida 13 replenishment negotiations that ida should allocate half of its assistance to the poorer idaonly countries ie 40 of its total aid on grant basis many other countries resisted this initiative as compromise the donors agreed that grants would comprise 18to21 of all ida 13 aid during the threeyear replenishment period the united states proposed during the new ida talks that the grant share should be increased substantially the new agreement provides that 30 of all ida assistance during ida 14 will be allocated as grants treasury notes that this means that 45 of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22133 ida aid to the idaonly countries would be grant aid nearly the presidents original goal the plan provides that 42 of the 62 idaonly countries will receive 100 of their ida aid in the form of grants and another 5 will receive part of their ida aid as grants private sector development the ida 14 agreement calls upon ida to work more closely with the international finance corporation ifc the arm of the world bank which helps promote private sector growth in developing countries and to take other steps designed to encourage private sector development this builds on initiatives begun in earlier replenishments the new replenishment plan also directs ida to expand its support for micro small and mediumsized enterprises through marketbased approaches and it directs ida to commit up to 225 million over three or four years for initiatives of this sort in africa more will be allocated for this purpose in other regions the agreement also requires ida to strengthen its analyticdiagnostic work in this area to expand the coverage of its investment climate assessments and to incorporate the diagnostic elements of these activities into its country assistance strategies for individual countries transparency congress passed legislation in 20036 directing the treasury department to seek changes in the multilateral development banks increasing the transparency of their operations and procedures this legislation is discussed in more detail below pursuant to that legislation and to policy objectives whose origins in the executive branch date back into the clinton administration the administration has pressed the mdbs for action along these lines7 6 section 581 of division d of the consolidated appropriations act fiscal 2004 pl 108199 7 in march 2005 the treasury department submitted report to congress discussing the efforts made and achievements realized in pursuit of the transparency goals embodied in section 581 see us department of the treasury report to congress achievement of certain policy goals with respect to transparency and accountability in the multilateral development institutions march 14 2005 the document is also posted on the treasury department web page at httpwwwtreasgovofficesinternationalaffairsmultilateral_bankscongressindexshtml crs4 the ida 14 agreement commits the world bank to full disclosure of the numerical ratings which countries receive under the cpia process this reaffirms decision reached previously in the ida 13 replenishment plan the ida 14 plan also calls on the world bank executive board to 1 publish board minutes 2 strengthen procedures for documenting the public consultation process 3 make the interim results of projects publicly available while those activities are still in the execution stage and 4 require an independent audit or assessment of internal management controls and procedures contribution level the administration is asking congress to authorize contribution of 285 billion over three years to the ida 14 replenishment it would be appropriated in annual allotments of 950 million the us contribution to ida 14 comprises 13 of the total the us share in ida 13 was about 225 depending how one looks at the numbers the dollar amount pledged for contribution to ida 14 is either the same or it is 100 million more than the us contributed to ida 13 the basic us contribution to ida 13 was 850 million annually however the administration pledged that the united states would contribute another 300 million if the world bank adopted several specified reforms the bank adopted the reforms but httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22133 congress appropriated only part of the additional funds it approved 60 million of the 100 million incentive contribution the administration asked for in fiscal 2004 but it provided none of the 200 million requested for fiscal 2005 the administration is treating the unappropriated portion of the extra 300 million as an arrears in dollar terms the amount the administration asked congress to appropriate annually during the ida 13 period basic plus incentive contributions is the same as the dollar amount requested for ida 14 ida replenishments are calculated in sdrs in sdr terms the dollar declined 11 in value between the end of the ida 13 talks and the announcement of ida 14 thus even though the dollar amounts are the same the purchasing power of the us contribution to ida 14 is 11 smaller than before the other donor countries the europeans in particular wanted the ida 14 replenishment to be 30 larger in sdr terms than was ida 13 in the end the new plan is 25 larger than its predecessor though only about 90 of the total has been subscribed previously when the other donors wanted larger replenishment but the united states said it would contribute more than certain amount they generally decided that it was more important to keep the us contribution share at about the same level it had been in the prior replenishment than it was to have the larger funding plan in this case however it seems they decided that increasing the size of the replenishment was more important than maintaining the relative size of the us share it is not easy to interpret this change on the part of other donors some would suggest however that it may mean that the european countries eu members control over 31 of the vote in the world bank may wish to exercise larger leadership role than before in the mdbs asian development fund policy issues the united states had many of the same basic policy objectives in the negotiations for the new 8th replenishment of the asian development fund asdf 8 that it did for the ida 14 the asdf had previously agreed that grants could comprise about 20 of the asian development banks asdb concessional aid during the years crs5 covered by the seventh asdf replenishment8 the united states sought major increase in the new replenishment and the other donors agreed to that grants would comprise 30 of the asian banks concessional aid in the years covered by the new funding plan the adb agreed to create new results management unit to oversee the integration of results measurement standards into all asian bank and asian fund loans and policy documents it also agreed to change the incentive system so that staff would be rewarded more for the quality of the development outcomes achieved by their projects than by the quantity of loans and grants approved the asian bank also agreed to adopt new standards for transparency and participatory disclosure which are equal to or in some cases the administration says are better than those of the other mdbs final draft of the new standard has been submitted for public comment the adb has taken steps with us support to strengthen the independence of its operations evaluation department oed as well as the inspection panel which reviews complaints by persons who believe they were hurt by asdb actions which violated bank rules the new replenishment also gives much more weight in the afdf aid allocation decisions to country performance and governance the methodology for calculating performance and governance have also been approved and made more transparent httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22133 starting in 2005 the bank will fully disclose each countrys performance ratings contribution levels the administration has proposed that the united states should contribute 461 million to the asian development fund over the four year term 20058 of the replenishment this would comprise 137 of the total japan has agreed to contribute 35 of the total funding for the replenishment while countries that are members of the european union have pledged separately to contribute shares which total 30 of the replenishment sum by comparison in the prior replenishment the united states agreed to contribute 412 million over four years of this amount as of fiscal 2005 about onequarter 102 million has not yet been appropriated in the seventh asdf replenishment the united states agreed to contribute 144 while japan subscribed 351 and 12 countries which are members of the eu pledged separately to contribute an aggregate 277 of the total african development fund policy issues as with the other two mdbs the united states pursued several specific policy goals during the negotiations which led to the african development fund afdf 10th replenishment as result of us efforts the afdf donor countries agreed that grant share of the institutions aid during the three years of the replenishment period 20057 would increase from about 20 to about 45 of the total according to the administration more than twothirds of the poorest countries in africa will receive all of their afdf aid in the form of grants the new replenishment provides that results 8 ida is legally separate international body though it shares staff and facilities with the world bank the asian development fund by contrast is an activity of the asian development bank and has separate standing thus policy decisions affecting the asdfs aid program also govern the loan program of the asdb the african development fund afdf is also legally separate body like the ida however it shares staff and facilities with the african development bank policy guidelines affecting afdf aid may or may not affect the afdb as well depending on the way their common executive board decides to implement those arrangements crs6 measurement indicators will be included in all afdf operations specifying the goals of the operation expected outcomes and the critical assumptions or risk factors to be monitored moreover all projects and strategy documents coming to the executive board after mid2006 must contain resultsbased management system as for transparency the african fund agreed that the cpia ratings of individual countries would be released to the public when ida does so still an unresolved issue and that the results indicators of projects would be released during execution and completion the afdb management also agreed to seek approval by its executive board for the public release of more documents prior to board review in other matters the new replenishment provides resources for the postconflict country facility multilateral effort to help postconflict countries clear their payment arrears to the african bank group management also agreed to implement new private sector development strategy to better integrate assistance for the private sector into afdf operations contribution levels the administration has asked congress to authorize us contribution of 407 million over three years to the afdf tenth replenishment according to the african development bank the new replenishment totals 54 billion 43 increase over the prior replenishment with the us share being 75 of the total in the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22133 previous replenishment the us contribution comprised 118 of the total in dollar terms the administration proposes that the united states increase its contribution by 15 over the level established for afdf 9 however in terms of purchasing power given the decline in the international value of the dollar since 2002 the proposed us contribution to afdf 10 is about 36 larger than the value of the us contribution to the prior replenishment current status of the legislation draft legislation to authorize us participation in the three mdb replenishments was submitted in early april 2005 the house financial services committee and the senate foreign relations committee are currently studying the proposals in anticipation of future hearings
