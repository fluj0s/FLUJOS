interest rates and expectations about the performance of national economies which means they can be quite erratic at times since the mid1990s the combination of strong grow th and low inflation in the us economy attracted foreign investors as indicated in figure 1 from 2002 to 2007 us direct investment abroad averaged more than twi ce the amount foreigners invested in the us economy reflecting the period of slower growth in the economy from 20012003 on the whole us firms are the most prolific overseas investors recent study by the united nations indicates that us firms are the largest foreign

their annual investments in developed countries pr imarily in western europe but th is tendency has increased since the mid1990s in the last half of the 1990s us direct investme nt abroad experienced dramatic shift from developi ng countries to the richest developed economies the share of us direct investment going to developing countries fell from 37 in 1996 to 21 in 2000 in 2006 us firms focused slightly gr eater percent of their investment funds on developing countries which r eceived 28 of the investment funds of us multinational firms patterns in us direct investment abro ad generally reflect fundamental changes that occur in the us economy during the same period as investment funds in the us economy shifted from extractive processing and manufacturing i ndustries toward high technology services and financ ial industries us inves tment abroad mirrored these changes as result us direct inve stment abroad focused less on the extractive processing and basic manufactur ing industries in developing countries and more on high technology finance and services industrie s located in highlydeveloped countries with advanced infrastructure and co mmunications systems us direct investment abroad during the 20002004 period increased about 56 investments in the finance and services sectors grew twice as fast on the whole as direct investment abroad overall during the 19962000 period within the ma nufacturing sector food processing chemicals and metals lagged in growth behind the industria l machinery electronic and transportation sectors us multinationals nations once hostile to american direct investment now compete aggressively by offering incentives to us firms debate continues within the united states however over the relative merits of us direct investment abroad some americans believe that us direct investment abroad directly or indirectly shifts some jobs to low wage countries they argue that such shifts reduce employment in the united states and increase imports thereby affecting nega tively both us employment and economic growth economists generally believe that firms invest abroad because those firms possess some special process or product knowledge or because they possess special managerial abilities which give them an advantage over other firms on the whole us firms invest abroad to serve the foreign cal market rather than to produce goods to export to the united states although some firms do establish overseas operations to replace us exports or production or to ga in access to raw materials cheap labor or other markets on average about 8 of aff iliate sales are to the us parent companies5 us multinational corporations mncs rank among the largest us firms according to data collected by the commerce departments bureau of

strengths to expand abroad between the 1980s and early 2000s the usbased parent firm s lost market positions at home in large part due to corporate downsizing efforts to improve profits us mnc parent companies share of all us business gross domestic product gdp the broadest measure of economic activity declined from 32 to 25 from 1977 to 1989 comprising 24 of total us private business output in 1998 the latest year fo r which estimates are available7 these mnc parent companies increased their share of all us business gdp in the services sector which rose from 6 to 8 of us gdp during the period from 1989 to 1998 the mnc share of all other i ndustries rose from 16 to 18 during the 10year period but they lost shares in th manufacturing sector from 62 to 58 at time when the us manufacturing sector as whole was shrinking as share of national gdp from 20 to 168 as us mnc parent companies were losing their relative market positions at home their cumulative amount of direct investment abroad doubled this increase did spur shift in some economic activity among the us mncs from the us parent companies to the foreign affiliates du ring the period from 1977 to 1997 the foreign affiliates increased their share of the tota l economic activity within us mncs the combined economic output of the us parent and the foreign affiliates from 22 to 249 employment one of the most commonly expressed c oncerns about us direct investment abroad is that us parent companies inve st abroad in order to send lowwage jobs overseas such effects are difficult to measure because they are small compared with much larger changes occurring within the us economy in addition cursory examination of the data seems to indicate that employment losses among parent firms occurred simultaneously with gains in foreign subsidiaries thereby giving the impression that jobs are being shifted abroad employ ment among us parent companies fell during the early 1980s but increased in the 19922000 period from 175 million to 239 million from 2000 to 2003 however employment among us parent companies fell by 12 to 211 million before rising after 2003 to reach 218 million in 2005 as us economic growth picked up em ployment among foreign affiliates also rose in 2005 by 26 to 103 million from 100 million in 2004 after employment losses in the early 1980s employment at bot h the parent

report rl32461 outsourcing and insourcing jobs in the us economy evidence based on foreign investment data by james k jacksonindustries in number of cases us parent firms and their foreign aff iliates lost or gained employment in many of the same i ndustries both the parent firms and the affiliates lost employment in the petroleum and finance sectors although both gained employment in the services and wholesale trade sectors furthermore employment gains and losses among mncs more likely reflect f undamental shifts within the us economy than any formal or informal effo rts to shift employment abroad some observers also contend that us direct investment abroad supplants us exports thereby worsening the us trade deficit and eliminating some us jobs most analyses indicate however that intracompan trade or trade between the us parent company and its foreign subsidiaries repres ents large share of us trade and that foreign investment typically boosts us expor ts more than it contributes to rise in imports or to loss of exports for instance american multinational corporations account for over 60 of us exports and 40 of us imports indicating that us parent firms tend to be more important source of s upply to their affiliates than the affiliates are to their parent companies conclusions american direct investment abroad has grown sharply since the mid1990s raising questions for many observers about the eff ects of such investment on the us economy these questions seem pertinent since american multinational corporations lost shares of us gdp over the last decade and their domestic employment had declined until the mid 1990s increased economic activity abroad rela tive to that in the united states increased overseas affiliate employment in some industries including manufacturing most of this affiliate activity however is g eared toward supplying the local markets in which they are located in 2004 95 of the sales of the fo reign affiliates of u s firms was accounted for by exports back to the united states10 although this share is nonetheless substantial some observers believe us direct investment abroad is harmful to us workers because it shifts jobs abroad there is conc lusive evidence in the data collected to date to indicate that current investment trends are substantially different from those of previous periods or that jobs are movi ng offshore at rate that is significantly different from previous periods11 there are instances when firms shift activities abroad to take advantage of lower labor costs however it is clear from the data that the majority of us direct investment abroad is in devel oped countries where wage s markets industries and consumers tastes are similar to those in the united states us direct investment in these developed countries is or iented toward serving the ma rkets where the affiliates are located and they tend in the aggregate to boost exports from the united states in addition foreign firms have been pouring reco rd amounts of money into the united states to acquire existing us firms to expand existing subsidiaries or to establish greenfield or new investments
