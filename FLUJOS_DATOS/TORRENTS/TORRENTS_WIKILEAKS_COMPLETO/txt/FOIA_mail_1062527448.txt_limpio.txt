from michael mann mannvirginiaedu to tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subject re reconstruction uncertainties date tue 02 sep 2003 143048 0400 cc scott rutherford srutherfordgsouriedu mannvirginiaedu hi tim thanks for sending this unfortunately i dont really have the time look into any of this in detail but let offer the following additional explanation which will hopefully clarify the nature of any differences between our results i fear that i may not have been clear enough in my previous explanation the reason that our uncertainty estimates reduce little fwith increasing timescale for the earlier networks is that the effective degrees of freedom are diminished sharply by the redness of the calibration residuals for networks prior to ad 1600 and earlier but unlike you wee do not model the residuals as an ar processthis may the source of some of the differences back to ad 1600 and later networks the calibration residuals pass for white noise and the estimates follow simply from the residual uncalibrated variance and the reduction of variance upon averaging follows standard sqrtn statistics prior to that the networks failed the test so we decomposed the calibration residuals into lowfrequency band all timescales longer than 40 years which are not distinguishable from secular timescales since i had roughly 80 years series and was evaluating the spectrum using multipletaper estimate with spectral bandwidth of 2 rayleigh frequencies we then estimated the enhancement of unresolved variance in the lowfrequency band relative to the nominal white noise level the enhancement was about factor of 56 or so for the earlier networks as i recall to get the component of uncertainty for the lowfrequency band alone timescales longer than 40 years i simply took that enhancement factor x the nominal unresolved calibration variance x the bandwidth of the lowfrequency band 0025 cycleyear this yields reduction in variance that is far less than the nominal sqrt n reduction applied to the individual annual uncertainties of course one could calculate the equivalent n effective temporal degrees of freedom that this implies in model of the residuals as ar1 red noise but we didnt take this approach we modeled it as simple stepincrease spectrum w the boundary at f0025 cycleyr modeling the residuals as red noise would my guess is generally yield the same result but it might have the effect of dampening the estimated enhancement of unresolved variance at the longest timescales in any case it should yield similar but it would be very surprising if identical results consistent w your observations my guess for the difference in the ad 1600 network is that based on the spectrum test we did not reject the white noise null hypothesis for the residuals so there was variance enhancement factor for that or subsequent networks it would appear that your method argues for significant serial correlation in that case not sure why we come to different conclusions in this case perhaps using different criteria for testing for the significance of redness in the spectrumserial correlation but thats probably the reason i hope that clarifies this please keep in the loop on this ive copied to scott who may have some additional insights here since weve been dealing w these issues now in the regem estimates scottdid we ever reject the white noise null hypothesis in the residuals for any of our proxybased nh reconstrucitions in the paper submited to j climate i dont recall thanks mike at 0433 pm 8292003 0100 you wrote hi mike after few bits of holiday here and there ive now had time to complete my initial approach to estimating reconstruction errors on your nh temperature reconstruction this is all based on the calibration residuals that you kindly sent few weeks ago my rationale for doing this was that i wanted uncertaintyerror estimates that were dependent on the time scale being considered eg decadal mean an annual mean 30year mean etc i didnt think you had published timescaledependent errors hence my attempt second reason is that i wanted to be able to model ie stochastically generate time series of the errors with appropriate timescale characteristics again i didnt think that i could get this from your published results the attached document summarises the progress ive made there are few questions i have and im concerned that the reduction in uncertainty with increasing time scale is too great perhaps one should be ultra conservative and have reduction with time scale yet surely there ought to be some cancelling of partly uncorrelated errors the document is not meant to form part of any paper on this i hope to use the errors in paper but the point of the paper is on trend detection not estimating errors it just seemed appropriate to write it up like this to inform you of what ive done so far any comments or criticisms will be very useful cheers tim dr timothy j osborn climatic research unit school of environmental
