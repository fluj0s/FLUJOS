history and executive branch views introduction the alien tort statute ats provides that district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for tort only committed in violation of the law of nations or treaty of the united states1 the ats is nearly as old as the united states itself but it was not until quarter of century ago that it captured the attention of human rights lawyers law professors and prospective litigants the 1980 decision in filartiga v penairala opened the door for the use of the ats for aliens to assert jurisdiction in federal c ourt for human rights violations and other violations of international law in that case the 2d circuit overt urned lower courts dismissal of an action for damages in case involving torture and wrongful death at the hands of foreign official in foreign country finding jurisdiction was authorized under the ats since 1980 the ats has been asserted in numerous cases with varying success involving issu ranging from environmental torts and expropriation to torture and genocide while human rights advocat and plaintiffs lawyers may see great promise in the ats as way to vindicate human rights worldwide others warn that it could easily spiral out of control resulting in deluge of foreign cases in federal courts to th possible detriment of us foreign policy interests of particular concern to many is the apparent rise in litigation against us companies operating abroad that are accused of complicity in human rights abuses committed by the governments of their host countries the us government interpretation of the ats has varied from administration to administration while the carter nd clinton administrations supported the federal courts jurisdiction ove r actions for certain human rights abuses that occurred abroad the reagan and bush administra tions supported narrower reading of the statute the george w bush administra tion has advanced an interpretation of the ats that it recognizes would render the ats superfluous and has sought to intervene more frequently than past admin istrations on behalf of us defendants the bush administration interpretation of the ats is set forth in an amicus

enactment the report provides historical overview of court decisions interpreting the ats followed by an analysis of the positions taken by the us government in published opinions of the attorney general and in court briefs related to ats claims the ats originated as part of the judiciary act of 1789 after the second circuits decision in the filartiga case scholars embarked on search for relevant legislative history but have for the most part come up emptyhanded consequently some have proceeded by interpreting the text of the ats in light of the eighteenthcentury understanding of inte rnational law or have posited that certain contemporaneous events might have made the first congress think it advisable to give federal courts jurisdiction over certain causes of action broug ht by aliens some stress that the ats was not intended to cr eate new cause of action available only to aliens but merely gave aliens the right to pursue cl aims involving international law in federal as opposed to state court in order to keep issues touching on foreign affairs within federal purvi ew speculation about the original intent behind the ats does not end the contemporary inquiry while some believe the ats should be applied to only those types of cases envi sioned in 1789 others argue the ats should be interpreted to evolve along with in ternational law the position taken by the filartiga court the debate about the at s spills over into the larger debate concerning the role international law plays in us law and the role national courts of all countries might play in enforcing international law legislative history 28 usc 1350 frequently referred to as the alien tort claims act acta is probably more accurately called simply the alien tort statute the former title implying that congress passed the measure as separate act in which case one would expect to find legislative documents from which congress intent might readily be divined such is not the cas however leading many legal scholars to begin their quest for the true meaning nd purpose of the statute from the intent of the constitutions framers and their envisioned interrelationship between the federal

constitutional convention in phila delphia the overriding issue was the tension between federalists who supported strong central government with an independent judiciary and antifederalists who were concerned that the draft constitution would allocate too much power to the central government leaving the states in much the same position as th thirteen colonies under british dominion3 in the area of the judiciary the tension played out in the debate as to whether to establish federal courts othe r than the supreme court and how judicial power was to be allocated among state and federal courts4 the delegates reached compromise under which the congress would be empowered but not obligated to provide for such inferior courts as it saw fit5 and could grant or restrict the jurisdiction of those courts through legislation6 it appears to have been ss controversial that observa nce of the law of nations necessity for fledgling nation hoping to maintain peaceful fo reign relations with respect to established military powers was fundamentally federal role7 the need to consolidate foreign affairs in the federal government rather than allowing states to conduct their own foreign policies was part of the impetus for replacing the articles of confederation8 it is less clear whether or how the framers intended to incorporate international law within the scope of judicial power of the united

addressing substantive rights second is the change from the atcas description of the claim as one for tort committed in violation of the law of nations to the new acts assertion of the substantive

relevance between this incident and the atssome theories on congressional intent most commentators regard the alien tort statute as product of the framers desire to give the federal government supremacy over foreign affairs and avoid international conflic t arising from disputes about us treatment of aliens30 scholars and judges have advanced seve ral theories to explain what sort of threat the statute was meant to avert protection of foreign diplomats focusing on limited number of offenses against the law of nations that were clearly recognized as such at the time of the first congress some theorists interpret the alien tort statute as means to protect the rights of foreign ambassadors31 presuming that in general international law was viewed in the eighteenth century as body of principles regulating states interaction with one another and not the rights of indi viduals they reason congress could not have meant to provide cause of action for individual aliens for suits against states however since only states were viewed as having the capacity to commit violations of law congress would not have presumed that individuals could be the targets of lawsuits for violations of international law except perhaps in the narrow category of offenses agai nst the law of nations that could at that time be committed by individuals blackstone listed three of these the violation of safe conducts or passports infringement of th rights of ambassadors and piracy32 to buttress this theory they point to highprofile incident involving an ambassador as the possible cat alyst for the alien tort statute in 1784 frenchman attacked french consul general marboi s in philadelphia causing diplomatic imbroglio with france who expressed indignance over the continental congress seeming impotence to address the matter33 the supreme court of pennsylvania eventually upheld the offenders convic tion for violating the law of nations34 several years after the socalled marbois affair there was similar infamous outrage against foreign diplomat this time committed by new york police officer who arrested servant at the hom of the dutch ambassador in violation of the diplomatic immunity that attached to the premises35 proponents of the ambassadorial protecti on theory behind the ats argue that these two incidents probably exemplified the need to enforce international law regarding the inviolabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32118crs9 36see randall supra note 7 at 2428 37see bradley supra note 35 at 642 381 stat 8081 1789 39see burley supra note 9 at

federalist 80of foreign diplomats and was at least one of the purposes for the inclusion of the ats into the judiciary act36 critics of this theory note that neither of theses case involve d claims for civil damages both were treated as criminal violations and although great deal of commentary was devoted to the legal issues involved one ever suggested that the proper remedy was to give amba ssadors civil right of action37 moreover the critics note while the incidents were undoubtedly fre sh in the minds of the first congress the first judiciary act gave original t hough not exclusive jurisdiction to the supreme court in cases brought by ambassadors38 these critics further doubt that the first congress would have used the broad term alien where it meant to limit the class of aliens meant to benef it from the provision to diplomats39 prize cases another type of cases implicating international law that would have been familiar to drafters of the judiciary act was cases involving the law of prize in which the wartime capture of merchant vessel is disputed while these disputes about rightful ownership of ized vessels and their cargoes would have been covered under admiralty jurisdiction clause some argue that the phrase tort only was meant to cover prize claims i nvolving damage or injury to property40 however the statute does not appear to have been invoked in many prize cases denial of justice it was apprehended that state courts deciding issues involving aliens presumably lacking in understanding for nationa l concerns related to foreign policy might render decisions biased in favor of their own citizens citizens of foreign countries would then have grounds to complain that they were denied the opportunity to seek redress in us courts in disregard for us responsibility under internationa l law giving their home country the right to seek diplomatic redress or in extreme cases pe rhaps the right to declare war there is evidence that this concern was motive fo r including the alienage provision of the diversity clause in article iii of the cons titution41 the alien tort statute would have been an incomplete remedy however because it is limited to cases in which an alien is plaintiff suing for tort that implicates international law denial of justice cases could arise as easily in contractual di sputes and cases where an alien is sued as defendant charged with crime even in cases not implicating international law the diversity jurisdiction clause in section 13 of the judiciary act filled some of this void by granting jurisdiction to federal courts in cases where the amount in controversy exceeded 500 and one party to the suit was an alien it has been suggested that the alien tort statute was compromise between those who advocated full diversityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32118crs10 42see randall supra note 7 at 2831 43see bradley supra note 9 at 619 44see statement third of foreign relations law 404 hereinafter restatement 45see

ate responsibility related to the denial of justice theory is the theory that the alien tort statute was meant to provide remedies for aliens injured by us citizens in ways that would implicate the responsibility of the united states for breach of treaty or violation of customary international law this would have been one way for the unite d states to fulfill its obligations under international law which generally leaves it up to states to implement means to fulfill those obligations and to remedy breaches at minimum states were said to be obligated to enforce treaties by enacting criminal statutes to penalize conduct by its citizens that would contradict international under this theory the aliens right to sue was intended to apply to cases in which the defendant is us citizen or alien residing in the united states jurisdiction for such cases would find constitutional support in the alienage clause of article iii43 however the ats does not specifically require that the defendant be us citizen moreover the ats has never been construed to imply wa iver of us sovereign immunity universal jurisdiction broader version of the state responsibility theory one that would not rest on lienage jurisdiction or require us connection to the tortious activity giving rise to suit pr esumes that the courts of all nations have jurisdiction to address certain breaches of the law of nations under this view the ats provides means to assert type of universal jurisdiction which defines category of crimes that are so egregious as to be the object of universal concern regardless of the situs of the offense and the nationalities of the offenders or victims44 the theory of universal jurisdiction is rooted in international law allowing any state to punish pirates and slave trad ers who have long been considered hostis humani generis enemies of all humanity45 universal jurisdiction is ordinarily associated with criminal prosecutions rather than civil suits however there is authority to support the view that civil suits providing redress for those crimes covered by universal jurisdiction is pr oper exercise of states jurisdiction46 legal experts continue to debate the extent to which the theory of universal jurisdiction is accepted by states with some arguing that international law may require nexus between the crime or accu sed criminal and the state that seeks to assert jurisdiction in order for that jurisd iction to be valid th controversy over the validity of universal jurisdiction recently gained prominence when the united states objected to belgian law that would

tort statute for treaty violation was the 1795 case bolchos v darrell 50 that case arose in the context of war pitting spain and great britain against france slaves at the time considered neutral property ordinarily not subject to capture by belligerent were mortgaged by spanish citizen to british citizen and placed on board spanish vessel captain bolchos french citizen captured the spanish vessel as prize and brought it to us port while the vessel was in port the defendant darrell acting as agent for the mortgagee seized and sold the slav bolchos brought suit against the agent for restitution of the slaves arguing that treaty between the united states and france mandated that the property of frie ndly nation found aboard an enemy vessel was to be forfeited the c ourt upheld jurisdiction under admiralty laws and based on the defendants violation of the treaty of amity and commerce with france on the alien tort statute and ordered the defendant to return the slaves or proceeds from their sale to the plaintiff notably the court did not require that the treaty in question provide for redress in the courts of the treaty parties and there was question as to whether the defendant wa s capable as an individual human being rather than state of breaching the treaty the second suit that succeeded in asse rting jurisdiction under the alien tort statute was brought in 1961 adra v clift51 was an international child custody case in which lebanese nationa l brought suit against his exwife and her husband us citizen for having used forged passports to bring the children into the united states tortiously interfering with his custody of the children the court found the interference to be tort and the passport fra ud to be violation of the law of nations the court appears to have presumed that the tort and the violation of the law of nations were separate elements but did not discuss its reas oning in another case the court suggested that illegal seizure removal and detention of an alien against his will in foreign country might be tort in violation of the law of nations 52 nineteen other cases asserting jurisdic tion under the alien tort statute

citizens resident in the marshall islands sued to enjoin the united states from conducting nuclear weapons testing in their midst although the plaintiffs amended their comp laint to ask for damages the court found the claim did not amount to tort and that international law did not extend private cause of action as to the alien plai ntiffs the court found that they had constitutional right to challenge the statute and that it was doubtful that the alien tort statute provided jurisdiction but did not explain that conclusion filartiga v penairala in 1980 the 2d circuit revived the ats after two centuries of near obscurity in filartiga v penairala 58 paraguayan dissident and his daughter after immigrating to the united states brought suit against former paraguayan official for the torture and wrongful death of joelito filartiga the teenage and brother of the plaintiffs the district court dismissed the filartigas complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction however the c ourt of appeals reversed recognizing the emergence of universal consensus that in ternational law affords certain substantive rights to individuals and may implicate states treatment of its own citizens59 the

ac tionable under the ats although official action was necessary to bring the conduct unde r international law and the ats the court declined to dismi ss the action under the act of state doctrine the court did not explicitly address the question of whether the ats provides private right of action however it cons trued the alien tort statute not as granting new rights to aliens but simp ly as opening the federal courts for adjudication of the rights already recognized by international law63 teloren the filartiga case raised the possibility that human rights litigation had finally breeched the barrier of sovereign immunity th at had precluded cases of this type the likelihood of this was soon dampened by the dc circuits dismissal of teloren v libya 64 plaintiffs in that case were victims or survivors of terrorist attack on civilian bus traveling on an israeli highway allegedly carried out by members of the palestine liberation organization plo with the assistance of libya in arriving at determination to dismiss for lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction the court issued three separate concurring opinions judge edwards concluded that the ats permitted federal jurisdiction over cases involving some violations by individuals of established intern ational law such as genocide slavery and systematic racial discrimination65 however he concluded terrorism was not one of those offenses noting that although terrorism is repugnant to many countries to some states acts of terrorism in particular those with political motives are legitimate acts of aggression and therefore immune from condemnation with respect to the plo he opined that allegations that its members committed torture did not implicate internati onal law because the plo is not state and it could not have committed the alleged offenses under color of law he would have followed filartiga to find that the ats does not require the plaintiff to allege cause of action specifically defined by congress or in in ternational law judge bork followed more statist appro ach inquiring into the intent of the framers of the ats to determine the original scope of the statute he concluded that in 1789 there was concept of internationa l human rights neither was there under the traditional version of customary international law any recognition of right of private parties to recover clearly in his view cases like filartiga and teloren were beyond the framers contemplation in the ab sence of express legislative enactments or clarifying judicial decisi ons judge bork was not prepared to hold that an alien had cause of action within the jurisdiction of us courts for terrorism on the ground that terrorism was an unknown phenomenon at the time of the ats creationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32118crs15 66id at

pursued actions under the ats more frequently than before although it has been noted that the number of cases is not so high as to validate opponents pred ictions that floodgate would open the primary issues in these cases seems to be wh ether particular tort violates the law of nations and whether the ats provides cause of action as well as jurisdiction over such cases many of the actions have been dismissed according to doctrines of judicial avoidance such as forum non conveniens sovereign immunity or the political question doctrine in few cases actions were dismissed on constitutional due process grounds because the defendant was not given adequate notice or lacked minimum contacts with the united states67 international torts in order for federal courts to hear case under the ats the

scholars have pointed out that the concept of cause of action did not enter the legal lexicon until 184891 and point out that ear lier cases did not require more than showing that the plaintiff d right under interna tional law and could allege facts that if true showed violation of that right they therefore consider it unlikely that congress would have intended to require dditional statutory provisions for cause of action before the ats could be invoked arguing that such an interpretation would have defeated the presumptive purpose for the ats some regard it as significant that the judiciary act being among the first statutes there were virtually provisions for any types of lawsuits on the books at th time if congress had really been motivated by the pressing need to protect the united states from liability for its actions abroad or those of its citizens that might have invited international objections they argue congress might have been expected to enact such causes of action with greater dispatch the issue of whether cause of action is necessary will likely remain at the center of the debate judicial abstention courts have dismissed ats cases for variety of reasons even when they found violation of international law could be actionable often invoking the doctrine of forum non conveniens which permits court to decline jurisdiction over case if it determines there is forum which is the more suitable for the ends of justice and which is preferable because pursuit of the litigation in that forum is more likely to secure those ends92 courts have also declined to

the enactment of the judiciar act the attorney general was asked to give his opinion regarding us jurisdiction over acts committed in 1794 by us citizens abroad the incident involved group of us merchant s who were alleged to have voluntarily joined conducted aided and ab etted french fleet in attacking the settlement in the british colony of si erra leone and plundering or destroying the property of british subjects on that coast because the united states was neutral in the war between france and britain the hostile actions were regarded as breaches against the united states and could be tried in us courts to the extent that the crimes occurred on the high seas the ttorney general opined that the federal courts lacked criminal jurisdiction to try acts committed by us citizens on foreign soil but noted that there can be doubt that the company or individuals who have been injured by these acts of hostility have remedy by civil suit in the courts of the united states jurisdiction being expressly given to these courts in all cases where an alien sues for tort only in violation of the laws of nations or treaty of the united states and as such suit may be maintained by evidence taken at distance on commission issued for that purpose the difficulty of obtaining redress would not be so great as in criminal prosecution where viva voce testimony alone can be received as legal proof110httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32118crs23 11126 us op atty gen 250 1907 112id at 253 113id at 252 114id at 253the attorney general went on to advi that the government does not seem bound to do more than has already been done by the president who by his proclamation of the 22d of april 1793 wa rned all citizens of the united states against all such proceedings putting them on notice that the diplomatic protection of the united states would not be available to offenders facing prosecution in foreign courts thus in 1795 it seems to have been the view of the executive that aliens could sue in us courts for actions committed abroad by us citizens in violation of neutrality laws and that further statutory basis for civil damages was required in 1907 attorney general charles j bonaparte was asked for an opinion regarding the available remedy for br each of the boundary convention between the united states and mexico by an american company111 the convention gave to the international boundary co mmission the exclusive jurisdic tion to decide disputes but not to adjudicate private rights and liabilities in cases arising from changes in the beds of the rio grande and colorado ri vers where they form the boundary line between the united states and mexico the american rio grande land and irrigation company was determined by the commission to have altered the course of the river violating us treaty obliga tions the attorney general took the view that treaty of the united states which is part of the supreme law of the land having been violated remedy exists to redress that wrong the united states owes the duty and has the right of vindicating the treaty it can hardly be doubted that in proper case calling for preventi on the united states may proceed by bill in equity to obtain an injunction and that in case like the present where the prohibited thing has been done the united states may proceed in the same way to obtain mandatory relief in some appropr iate form to compel the restoration of the status quo ante112 as to whether the mexi can citizens injured by the conduct could seek compensation from the company responsible the attorney general understood that such plaintiffs could sue under the alien tort statute113 he emphasized that the statutes thus provide forum and right of action i can not of course undertake to say whether or not suit under either the alien tort statute or the provision for diversity jurisdiction would be successful that would depend upon whether the diversion of the water was an injury to substantial rights of citizens of mexico under the principles of international law or by treaty and could only be determined by judicial decision114 thus in 1907 it appears to have been the view of the executive that redress for breaches of treaties was ava ilable in federal courts even though the treaty did not contain language providing for such redre ss the attorney general found the alien tort statute provided both forum and cause of action and did not look further for specific statutory cause of action he also appears to have had objection tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32118crs24 115memorandum for

the pl aintiffs action agai nst the defendant an exofficial from paraguay then living in new york whom plaintiffs also citizens of paraguay living in the united states allege d was responsible for the torture and death of their brother and joe lito filartiga the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss finding that nations treatment of its own citizens is not subject to international law the second circuit reversed finding that torture is among the narrow class of violations of international law that can be committed by state against its own citizens the government brief submitted jointly by the departments of state and justice argued that the term law of nations as used in the alien tort statute was meant to be interpreted as international law evolves rather than as it existed at the time of the first judiciary act115 while the government recognized that the district courts view would likely have been accurate at the onset of the twentieth century today nation has an obligation under international law to respect the right of its citizens to be free of official torture116 moreover the government noted the supreme court had recognized the evolutionary nature of customary international law as early as 1900 when it held that the period of hundred years which has elapsed since an earlier case the lower court had relied on for precedent is amply sufficient to have enabled what originally may have rested in custom or comity courtesy or concession to grow by the general assent of civilized nations into settled rule of international law117 to interpret section 1350 as limited to the subjects encompassed by the law of nations in 1789 leaving only the state c ourts competent to administer any rules of international law that might subsequently develop

argued that the evolution of international law has produced wide recognition that certain funda mental human rights are now guaranteed to individuals as matter of customary international law119 however it argued this did not mean that all such rights may be judicially enforced and recognized that only few rights have the degree of specificity and universality to permit private enforcement and that the protection of other asserted rights must be left to the political branches of government120 the government cited numerous sources of international law to support its contention that torture violated international law concluding with quote from state depa rtment report to congress that argued there now exists an international consen that recognizes basic human rights and obligations owed by all governments to their citizens there is doubt that these rights are often violated but virtually all governments acknowledge their validity121 in the governments view the prohibiti on against torture had achieved the status of customary international norm that is one that is accepted by all nations as binding legal obligation under international law122 moreover it argued the prohibition against torture was one of the few rights that could give rise to judicial remedy because it implicated the sphere of the minimum standard for the protection of human rights123 the government also argued that the customary rule that only states not individuals could seek to enforce rules of international law was an outmoded doctrine and cited evidence that interna tional law had long pr ovided for individual remedies in certain cases124 as result it argued in nations such as the united states where international law is part of the law of the land an

should be dismissed and turned over to th courts of paraguay the second circuit complied largely adopting the views expressed in the governments brief as its own teloren v libyan arab republic in 1985 the dc circuit dismissed case against the plo and libya arising from an act of terrorism against an israeli bus in which several us citizens as well as israelis and dutch citizens were injure d or killed the three judges of the dc circuit agreed that the case should be dis missed but could not reach consensus for the reason for dismissal plaintiffs petitioned for certiorari with the supreme court and the united states government was as ked for its views the department of justice advised the supreme court not to hear the case arguing that the separate concurring opinions from the dc circu it did not form precedent that would conflict with the second ci rcuit opinion in filartiga127 the most that could be discerned from the dc circuit opinions was that under the circumstances of the case the requirements for jurisdiction unde r the alien tort statute were not met128 furthermore it argued another dispositive reason for dismissing the case existed that had not been addressed in loren the district court f ound the plaintiffs had never obtained personal jurisdiction over libya and the plo by effecting service on them129 moreover with respect to libya there was disagreement that the foreign sovereign immunity act fsia did not waive libyas sovereign immunity precluding the court from deciding libyas liability130 the government agreed that the alien to rt statute might give rise to questions worthy of supreme court revi ew but argued essentially that teloren was the wrong vehicle for resolving them the government did not argue that the result in filartiga had been

be interpreted either to mandate the creation of federal common law of international tort or to authorize individuals to enforce in domestic courts private rights of action derived directly from customary international law and that the alien tort statute does not waive either the sovereign immunity of the united states or the official immunities of individual govern ment officials from alien tort claims arising out of actions in foreign countries132 marcos litigation after philippine president ferdinand marcos was deposed in 1986 several claims were filed against him in us federal courts133 in trajano v marcos 134 plaintiffs brought suit for wrongful death and torture allegedly committed in the philippines by government official ag ainst philippine na tional asserting jurisdiction on the alien tort statute the district court dismi ssed the claims based on the act of state doctrine which holds that the courts of one country will not judge the official acts of foreign government on appeal the 9th circuit asked the government for its views as amicus curiae the justice department filed brief urging the court not to reach the question of whether the act of state doctrine barred the suits arguing instead that the alien to rt statute does not give jurisdiction over suit against foreign government offici for acts that occurred in foreign country135 even if the statute did reach the conduct alleged the government argued the litigants had valid cause of action unde r federal law ce the alleged conduct did not break any law or treaty of the united states that gives private victims the right to sue in court the government argued that the alien tort statute is purely jurisdictional in nature and could not itself create private action enforceable by alien litigants in us federal courts even t hough the alleged conduct violated international norms the government brief argued that the lien tort statute in order to be valid under article iii of the

emphasis addedclause or the federal question clause the government argued that neither clause could support jurisdiction over the case the government noted that the background of the statute suggests that one purpos of the alien tort statute was to be small claims subset of alien diversity jurisdiction giving aliens who sue in diversity cases involving tortious violati ons of international law federal forum without regard to the 500 amount in controversy requirement at that time that would otherwise apply however it conc luded the ats does not on its face require diversity of citizenship so its legitimacy could not rest solely on the alien diversity clause of the constitution citing the marbois affair136 as probable catalyst of the define and punish clause of the constitution the government ar gued the purpose of that clause was to enable it to prevent the united states from becoming embroiled in war or other dispute with foreign nation that might be offended by breach of the law of nations attributable to the united states or an individual under its jurisdiction137 elsewhere in the constitution in the law of nations clause of article i congress was explicitly given the power which the national government lacked under the articles of confederation to fine and punish offences against the law of nations art 1s 8 cl 10 this suggests that the use of the identical phrase law of nations in the contemporan eously enacted alien tort statute was intended to give the federal courts subject matter jurisdiction insofar as cause of action is afforded by federal law of the united states enacted pursuant to the law of nations clause in order to def ine and punish violations of the law of nations that are the responsibility of the united states 138 addressing whether the ats might re ly on the arising under federal law clause of article iii of the cons titution the government conc luded that to the extent that it did it must be read to be limited to conduct congre ss was empowered to define and punish as offenses against th law of nations under article i section 8 clause 10 the government argued that congress intended in section 1350 to confer jurisdiction over torts committed in violation of the law of nations or treaty of the united states only insofar as the law of nations principle or the treaty pr ovision is part of federal law of the united states that regulates the alleged conduct and affords cause of actionthere is evidence that congress intended to grant the district courts jurisdiction over nondiversity cases such as the present ones where the subject matter and the parties are foreign to the united states and are not governed by the laws of the united states moreover the government argued the background of the alien tort statute supported

against its own nationals context in which the united states bears responsibility under the law of nations for either preventing the conduct or affording redress139 the government position in the trajano case is not easily reconciled with the prior administrations position in filartiga the 9th circuit reversed the dismissal and remanded the case to the district c ourt it did not adopt the governments interpretation of the ats plaintiffs eventually were awarded nearly two billion dollars against marcos estate140 the government did not appear to view the assertion of criminal jurisdiction over the marcos as problematical in 1988 ferdinand and imelda marcos among others were indicted in th southern district of new york for embezzlement theft and diversion of philippine

argued an alien may pursue an action under the alien tort statute even for transitory tort claims between individuals when federal court has pe rsonal jurisdiction and the claim involves violation of universally recognized norms of internati onal law and hence t he law of nations furthermore it argued the wording and hi story of the statute further make it clear that the alien tort statute may encompass violations of customary international law committed by nonstate actors noting that w hen the perpetrators of human rights violations are in control of territory and exercise authorities of governmental character they may be held accountable under international law even though the regime on whose behalf they act is not recognized and does not satisfy the requirements for i ndependent statehood144 however the government brief offered the view that the ats should not necessar ily be construed to provide jurisdiction over international norms outside the realm of human rights such as norms regarding the use of force the law of the sea or ocean dumping145 the government also argued that appellants could not proceed di rectly under treaties such as the geneva genocide and torture conventions because those treaties are not selfexecuting146 although they may serve as evidence that claimed right has become customary norm of international law alvarezmachain v sosa in alvarezmachain v sosa the justice department petitioned for rehearing of the case arguing that the 9th circuits opinion allowing suit against the united states under the ftca threatens to impair the

of sosa148arguing that the alleged violation of customary norm that every nation has exclusive jurisdiction over its own territory could not give rise to an individual action under the ats and that only mexico c ould have standing to assert violation of its sovereignty by requesting statetostate remedy for similar reasons the government argued the plaintiff may not rely on treaty provisions

internationa l human rights law under the ats149 the government argued that sosa s alleged conduct could not amount to prolonged arbitrary detention because it sted less than 24 hours and was authorized pursuant to an arrest warrant issued in the united states however the government brief did not argue that the premise underlying filartiga was faulty instead the government cautioned the court against xpanding the alien tort statute to permit individuals to complain of violations of international norms governing relations between sovereign states whic h may have dang erous international consequences for the united states this danger the government argued could occur because in pursuit of its legitimate foreign policy objectives the united states occasionally may take actions that some would say violate its international obligations this could include actions alleged to violate the territorial sovereignty of another state in order to effectively carry out its legitimate policies the united states may violate international law150 doe v unocal and doe v exxon the bush administration takes position with respect to the ats similar to the reagan administrations views filed in conjunction with the marcos litigation the department of justice filed brief as amicus curiae151 seeking to overturn filartiga arguing that in recent years the ats has been commandeered and transformed into font of causes of action permitting aliens to bring human rights claims in united states courts even when the disputes are wholly between foreign nationals and when the alleged injuries were incurred in foreign country often with connection whatsoever with the united states the government warns that us asserti on of jurisdiction over such cases could have foreign policy reperc ussions for the united states moreover it argues although often asserted against rogues and terrorists these claims are without bounds and can easily be asserted against allies of our nation152

statutes would have created implied ca uses of action under the ats at the timegrounds that us foreign policy may be harm ed and because of the detrimental effect the continued litigation could have on us efforts in the war against terrorism154 the justice department charged that the 9th circuit had made several fundamental analytical errors in construing statute th at on its face merely confers subject matter jurisdiction as also affo rding an implied private right of action155 moreover it argued it is clearly error to infer right of action to enforce unratified or nonselfexecuting treaties and nonbi nding united nations general assembly resolutions156 the justice department also argued that the extraterritorial application of the alien tort statute was erroneous because it would extend the causes of action recognized under the ats to conduct occurring wholly within the boundaries of other nations involving only foreign sovereigns or nationals and causing direct or substantia l impact in the united states the justice department objected to this new view of the ats which has given federal courts the role of discerning and enfo rcing through money damage actions norms of international law157 the government argued that congress could not have intended for the courts to play such role pointing to the tvpa as demonstrating that when c ongress wants the courts to play such role it enacts specific and carefully crafted rules158 noting that filartiga did not expressly find that the ats created cause of action the government argues that later cases in the 9th circuit finding an implied cause of action were mistaken instead the government urges the court to interpret the ats in light of its probable purpose that is to avoid international conflagrations brought about by any us denial of justice with regard to aliens159 in the governments current view congress intende d to cover only torts arising under acts of congress incorporating principles of th law of nations into the laws of the united states or under treatie s of the united states th government finds further support for its historical interpretation in the fact that congress one year after

sandoval 161 the government argues that courts will longer find implied private rights in statutory language including statutes as old as the ats moreover it argued finding an implied right of action to enforce nonbi nding agreements and statements runs against 9th circuit precedent limiting the ats to international norms that are specific universal and obligatory162 instead if the united states refuses to ratify treaty or regards resolution as nonbinding or declares treaty not to be selfexecuting163 the court should not infer cause of action to enforce the norms embodied in those materials this is s it argues even where customary norm of international law is held to be part of federal common law164 noting that modern human rights treaties have been declared by the president and the senate not to be selfexecuting the government argues that these treaties neither create causes of action nor provide rules that court may properly enforce in legal action brought by private party165 according to the government labeling the purported rights as jus cogens does not give them any more legitimacy in support of an implied private cause of action166 the courts inte rpretation cannot the government argues be squared with the nguage of the ats which refers to bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32118crs34 167id at 17 168id at 20 169id at 2122 citing the alvarezmachain and odah in which plaintiffs brought suit against the united states on behalf of detainees held at guantánamo bay to underscore the danger of the courts interpretation this poi nt may appear to litigants as contradiction the position the government took in trajano in which it was asserted that the intent of the ats was to provide redress for international law violations that implicate the responsibility of the united states and its nationals 170id at 27 arguing the presumption against extr aterritoriality serves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and t hose of other nations which

726 f2d at 812 that continuedtreaties of the united states and the law of nations167 the role of courts in interpreting the law of nations is in the governments view confined to cases properly before the court unde r some other explicit grant of jurisdiction otherwise the government seems to believe constitutional separation of powers could arise because matters that implicate international ffairs are the quintessential example of context where court may not infer cause of action permitting such implied causes of action under the ats infringes upon the right of the political branches to exercise their judgment in settin g appropriate limits upon the enforceability or scope of treaties and other documents168 moreover it notes under the approach of the 9th circuit ats actions are not limited to rogues and outlaws as mentioned above such claims can easily be asserted against th is nations friends including our allies in our fight against terrorism plaintiff merely needs to accuse defendant of for example arbitrary detention to support such claim169 the government argues that the cour t has compounded its erroneous reading of the ats by ignoring the presumption against extraterritoriality of us statutes170 the government points out that early cases as well as incidents thought to have served as catalyst for the ats had to do with domestic occurrences and that the attorney generals opinion in th sierra leone issue described supra stated that as the transactions complained of originated or took place in foreign country they are not within the cognizance of our courts171 it may be recalled however that in 1795 the attorney general d concluded in that opini on that while the conduct at issue could not be prosecuted under domestic criminal law there could be doubt that the injured parties could bring suit in tort under the ats against the wrongdoers in sum the government argues given that the point of the ats was to avoid international conflict the court should overrule its earlie r interpretation of the ats that held that conduct occurring abro ad could be challenged under the ats172 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32118crs35 172continued those who drafted the constitution and th judiciary act of 1789 wanted to open federal courts to aliens for the purpose of av oiding not provoking conflicts with other nations broad reading of section 1350 runs directly contrary to that desiregovernments brief does not ddress the specific facts of doe v unocal so it does not discuss what foreign policy complications might arise if the court decides the case on the merits it may be argued th at the involvement of the burmese military raises foreign policy questions yet the suit was dismissed as to burmese officials based on the act of state doctrine give n that the defendant is us corporation there would appear to be us nexus to the case conclusion it may never become clear what the first congress intended to accomplish when it enacted the alien tort statute it appears that the 108th congress may be asked to clarify its intent by passing new legislation to amend or repeal it multinational corporations are likely to argue that the ats unfairly subjects them to liability for the conduct of host governments over which they may have little influence in the view of some the use of the ats to interfere with corporations operating oversees is an attempt by human rights activists to pl ace economic sanctions on repressive regimes by treating the corporation as proxy they predict that if the lawsuits succeed the people whose rights are alleged to be viol ated will sink into deeper poverty as jobs are lost and constructive engagement with foreign corporations is longer possible little evidence is currently available to ev aluate the extent to which us economic interests might be harmed by ats lawsuits human rights advocates dispute the notion that corporations are targetted unfairly arguing that some multinational corporations are actively participating in the human rights abuses sometimes paying local military and paramilitary groups to use violent means to suppress local dissent and union activism for example victims have local recourse to fair and impartial judicial system they argue and the united states has an interest in adjudicating and enforcing international hum an rights standards on the part of its corporations that conduct operations overseas they will likely urge congress to strengthen the ats or at least let it stand in its present form
