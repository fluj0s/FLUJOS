from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to pjonesueaacuk tom wigley wigleycgducaredu subject re hadcrut2v date tue dec 13 130732 2005 cc ben santer santer1llnlgov dear all attached is plot of the monthly anomalies from the only box with nonmissing data in the bottom row of phils grid centred at 875 s this is from hadcrut2v that i picked up from the cru data store in june this year clearly the dates tom listed are missing in my version too furthermore the values from 19711975 are abnormal they are not all identical but are all near zero perhaps multiplied by 01 similar problems are apparent in hadcrut and crutem2v too but crutem2 has gaps and abnormal periods at the south pole so perhaps crutem2 is fine tom if its urgent you could extract the south pole time series from crutem2 and use it to overwrite the other 3 data sets until phil corrects them regarding the weighting issue given that the grid doesnt have equalarea boxes there are always going to be compromises with weighting even if you do something to sort out the problem at the s pole how about the isolated boxes around the coast of antarctica which will be given much less weight than an isolated box in the tropics which might also have only 1 station in this is partly reasonable because of differences in spatial correlation of temperatures between tropics and high latitudes but im sure that they dont compensate exactly specifically for the poles putting the temperature data into single box will clearly underweight its contribution in area averages is it significant from practical point of view once you get to hemispheric or global scales though replicating it into all boxes in the bottom row will on the other hand gives it too much weight if the area weighting is calculated simply as coslatitude then the south pole data will be given this weighting 72cos875 314 whereas one box on the equator or just off will be given this weighting 1cos25 100 so if replicated around all boxes at 875 s the south pole would have three times the weight of single tropical box compared with 23 times less weight if south pole data appears in only one box perhaps put it in every fourth box giving weighting of 079 bit less than tropical which is reasonable for spatial correlation reasons cheers tim at 0411 13122005 pjonesueaacuk wrote tom in nz at the ipcc meeting will be here until dec 17 when i get back im off to switzerland for christmas on dec 21 the south pole shouldnt be missing i have all the data for amundsenscott from 1957 i put the data in at one 5 degree grid box so it doesnt get overweighted the south pole should be at the last grid box 2592 in the 72 by 36 array putting the data in all 87590s boxes would overweight the spole stations there isnt any data at the n pole maybe tim could check on the missing spole data i reckon it should be there in all the datasets crutem2 and hadcrut2 and the v versions cheers phil phil why is there so much missing data for the south pole the period jan 75 thru dec 90 is all missing except dec 81 july dec 85 apr 87 apr sept 88 apr 89 also from and including aug 2003 is missing also more seriously but correctable the s pole is just represented by single box at 875s n pole ditto i suspect this screws up area averaging it would be better to put the s pole value in all boxes at 875s i have had to do this in my code but you really should fix the raw gridded data for area averages the difference is between having the s pole represent the whole region south of 85s and having as now it represent one 72nd of this region it is pretty obvious to what is better this affects the impression of missing data too of course tom
