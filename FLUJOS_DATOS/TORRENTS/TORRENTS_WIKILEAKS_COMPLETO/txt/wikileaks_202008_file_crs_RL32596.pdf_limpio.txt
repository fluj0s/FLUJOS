divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596sick leave usage rates and leave balances for employees in major federal retirement systems summary fulltime federal civilian employees receive 13 days of sick leave each year and may carry over an unlimited amount of unused si ck leave from year to year at the time of retirement employees in the civ il service retirement system csrs those hired before 1984 receive credit in the com putation of their civil service retirement annuities for any unused sick leave they have at the time of retirement in contrast employees in the federal employees retirement system fers those hired after 1983 and others who transferred to fers generally receive credit for unused sick leave at the time of retirement as result some believe that fers employees will use more of their sick l eave as they approach retir ement resulting in productivity losses than their csrs counterparts the conference report for the legislation creating fers in 1986 urged the offi ce of personnel management opm to examine this issue fers employees comprise an increasing percentage of the federal workforce and by 2014 virtually all federal employees are expected to be in fers in 2004 crs obtained data indicating th at fers retirees and fers employees in that group who were eligib to retire or approaching eligibility used substantially more sick leave and had much lower sick leave balances than comparable csrs retirees and employees in 2006 opm s imilarly concluded that fers employees who were eligible to retire or were nearing eligibility used more sick leave than their csrs counterparts but conc luded that to make sick leave creditable under fers would cost several times more than the pot ential productivity savings in april 2008 the treasury inspector general for tax administration concluded that the lack of compensation for unused sick leave was cau sing fers employees in the internal revenue service to use more sick l eave than their cs rs counterparts in march 2008 representative jim mora n introduced hr 5573 which would permit fers employees who satisfied the age and service requirements for immediate or early retirement to receive lumpsum payment equal to 15 of the hourly rate of their basic pay for each hour of unused sick leave balance over 500 hours with the total payment capped at 10000 union and federal manager organizations supported the legislation but opm said greater sick leave use by fers employees could be caused by factors unrel ated to differences in fers and csrs policies in july 2008 the house of representatives passed the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act h r 1108 which included section that would permit fers employees to receive service credit for unused sick leave in 2004 all except five state government s provided some type of compensation to employees for unused sick leave at retir ement usually either as cash payments service credit in the computation of annuities or payment of health or life insurance premiums the states generally limited these payments in some way eg capping the number of hours of sick leave payable this report will be updated wh additional or more cu rrent data on sick leave use become available or if other changes in federal sick leave policies are proposedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596contents introduction 1 background 3 f d r l s i c k l v e4 c s r s n d s i

the csrs or fers plans for more thorough discu ssion of these two plans see crs report 98810 epw federal employees retirement system benefits and financing by patrick purcell 2 fers annuities are generally smaller than in csrs because they are only one component of the system more detailed description of the two systems is provided later in this report 3 the fers normal retirement age increases for employees born in 1948 or later and eventually reaches age 57 for employees born in 1970 or later sick leave usage rates and leave balances for employees in major federal retirement systems introduction pensions for nearly all federal civilian employees are provided through one of two retirement programs the civil serv ice retirement system csrs or the federal employees retirement system fers1 most federal civilian workers hired before january 1 1984 are covered by csrs whereas those hired after that date are covered by fers as are employees w ho voluntarily switched from csrs to fers during open seasons held in 1987 and 1998 csrs and fers are similar in several respects in both retirement systems employees annuities are function of age length of federal service and final average pay2 the normal retirement age wit hout reduction of annuity under both csrs and fers is 55 for employees born before 1948 who have at least 30 years of service3 both retirement systems also allow normal retirement at age 60 for employees with 20 or more years of servi ce and 62 for employees with at least five years of service also employees in both systems receive 13 days 104 hours of sick leave each year and may carry over an unlimited amount of unused sick leave from year to year therefore an employee who carries over an average of nine days 72 hours of sick leave each year dur ing 30year career would accumulate 2160 hours of unused sick leave by the time he or she is eligible to retire one of the many ways in which csrs and fers differ is in how accumulated sick leave is accounted for at the time of retirement in the csrs system retiring employees receive service cr edit in the computation of their annuities for any unused sick leave they had at the time of retirement for example retiring csrs employee with 30 years of service and one year 2087 hours of accumulated sick leave wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs2 4 the congressionally mandated number of hours in work year is 2087 only full years and months are counted in the annuity comput ation for example if fulltime employee worked 30 years and had 835 hours four months and 24 days of accumulated sick leave at the time of retirement the employee would be credited with 30 years and four months of service the 24 additional days would be dropped 5 fers employees who transferred from csrs receive credit for sick leave balances at the time of the transfer or at the time of retirement whichever is smaller 6 see for example sick leave and fers leave abuse justifiable cheating flexible ethics in fedsmithcom available at httpwwwfedsmithcomarticles articlesshowarticledbphpintarticleid1143 and fers and sick leave federal times april 24 2006 p 20 7 for example in testimony before the senate committee on governmental affairs on february 4 2004 the president of the national league of postmasters said we also need to address the issue of sick leave for fers employees currently they get credit for unused sick leave at retirement we need to change this rule so they could sell back sick leave or get credit at retirement 8 deborah funk and stephen losey sick leav abuse managers prescribe cure for useor lose rules federal times april 17 2006 p 1 9 for example in the sick leave and fers article mentioned above 56 of the respondents to an unscientific survey said it was not ethical for federal employee to use sick leave without having an authorized medi cal reason for using the leave one respondent said if you were hired under fers then you should go by the rules and the csrs rules are not your concernbe considered to have 31 years of serv ice for purposes of annuity computation4 in sharp contrast fers retirees generally r eceive service credit or other type of compensation for their accumulated sick leave5 as result some observers suggest that fers employees will be on sick leave more frequently than csrs employees particularly as they approach retirement age thereby resulting in reduced productivity increased personnel costs or both reports of fers employees actually carrying out this use it or lose it behavior periodica lly appear in press articles6 to discourage this phenomenon from occu rring some observers have advocated changing fers to provide some kind of value for unused sick leave eg allowing full or partial service credit to be used in annuity calculations or providing full or partial lumpsum cash payments for such leave7 for example in april 2006 coalition of federal manage ment groups the federal managers association the senior executives association the fe deral aviation admin istration managers association the national council of social security management associations and the professional managers association called for change in federal sick leave policy eg allowing fers employees to apply portion of their unused leave toward postretirement health care policies8 others however believe that the csrs sick leave benefit is excessively ge nerous and that fers should not replicate that generosity opponents of policy ch ange and even some proponents also point out that use of sick leave for unauthorized reasons is inappropriate and that fers employees knew or should have known about this policy when they agreed to the terms of employment9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs3 this report provides data that crs obtained on sick leave usage rates by many employees and recent retirees in the csrs and fers retirement systems in 2003 and 2004 it also discusses study of federal sick leave use in 2005 and 2006 by the office of personnel management opm and provides information on unused sick leave policies in private sector and othe r public sector organizations eg state governments first though the repor t provides some background information on csrs and fers trends and federal sick leave policies in general background as figure 1 below shows because all new federal employees for more than 20 years have been put in fers the numbe r of fers employees in the federal workforce has increased substantially wh ereas the number of csrs employees has declined by september 1996 more federal employees were in fers 818650 than in csrs 809098 as of septembe r 2007 nearly 13 million federal employees were in fers compared with about 335000 in csrs at the rate of decline in the csrs population since 1990 by about 2014 vi rtually all federal employees are expected to be in fers source us office of personnel management central personnel data file data include fulltime permanent employees figure 2 shows the number of employees who were eligible to retire retirement eligibles in both the csrs and fers retirement systems from september 2000 until september 2007 alth ough the number of csrs retirement eligibles at the end of this period still ex ceeded the number of fers eligibles the difference between the two retirement systems has been steadily narrowing in recent years

use of five days 40 hours of sick leave each year to care for family members or for bereavement purposes employees wanting to use more than five days had been required to maintain sick leave balance of at least 80 hours however in 2006 opm issued final regulations that removed this requirement see us office of personnel management absence and leave 71 federal register 47693 august 17 2006 source us office of personnel management central personnel data file data are for fulltime permanent employees federal sick leave sick leave benefits provi paid time off while an employee temporarily cannot work due to nonworkrelate d illness or injury as noted previously all federal civilian employees receive four hours of si ck leave each biweekly pay period for total of 104 hours 13 days each year empl oyees must request sick leave within such time limits as their agencies may require and agencies may grant sick leave only when supported by evidence they cons ider administratively acceptable for absences in excess of three days or for lesser period when determined necessary by the agency an agency may require medical certificate or other administratively acceptable evidence before approving sick leave requests the federal sick leave program has been expanded several times allowing the benefit to be used for purposes other than personal medical attention for example the federal employees family friendly leave act of 1994 pl 103388 permitted employees to use up to 13 days of sick leave each year to provide medical or personal care to family member or to make arrangements for or to attend the funeral of family member10 115296136573140213 139214 137206136100 108366128396 2592230608 361794291351255 6012269933 80800 020000400006000080000100000120000140000160000 sept 2000 sept

management sick leave for family care purposes final rule 65 federal register 37234 june 13 2000 until 2006 to use the full 12 weeks of leave employees had been required to maintain sick leave balance of at least 80 hours however in 2006 opm issued final regulations that remo ved this requirement see us office of personnel management absence and leave 71 federal register 47693 august 17 2006the treasurypostal service ppropriations act for fy1995 pl 103329 permitted the use of sick leave to pursue activities related to the adoption of child in 2000 the federal sick leave program was again expanded allowing employees to use up to 12 weeks of sick leave per year to care for family members with serious health condition11 according to opm federal sickleave usage rates increased during this period from an average of 859 days of sick leave used per year in 1994 to 952 days in 2001 one possible explanation for this ove rall increase in sick leave use could be the changes in policy that allowed additional uses for sick leave as explained more fully later in this report though another possible explanation could be the increasing number of fers employees who were approaching retirement eligibility from time to time congress attempts to broaden or otherwise change federal sick leave policy even further for example in the 110th congress one of the provisions in hr 2200 would if enacte d exempt federal employees who are undergoing medical treatment for comb atrelated disability sustained while member of the armed forces from the requirement in the federal leave sharing program that they exhaust their annual and sick leave before using any transferred leave s 1649 in the 110th congress would among other things require opm to establish program to allow federal empl oyees serving as caregivers to dependents of members of the armed forces deployed overseas to use their sick leave in the same manner as annual leave is used note subsequent legislative developments section of this report disc usses broader proposed change in federal sick leave policy csrs and sick leave the civil service retirement act of 1920 pl 66215 created csrs to provide pension bene fits to federal employees csrs is defined benefit retirement plan in that the benefit is paid as lifelong annuity based on years of service and average salary in the last few years of employment csrs employees accrue benefits equal to 15 of their hi ghest three consecutive years of base pay often called the employees highthree pay for their first five years of service 175 of their highthree pay for each year in years 6 through 10 and 2 of their highthree pay for each subsequent year therefore csrs employee who retires with 30 years of service would receive an annuity equal to 5625 of the employees highthree pay csrs annuities are adjust ed annually for inflation and are financedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs6 12 see crs report rl30023 federal employee retirement programs budget and trust fund issues by patrick purcell 13 cited in us general accounting office federal workforce retirement credit has contributed to reduced sick leave usage gaoggd8677br june 1986 14 gaoggd8677br specifically gao reported that retirees in 1968 had an average of 642 hours of unused sick leave retiree s in 1984 averaged 884 hours and retirees in 1985 averaged 940 hours about 38 and 46 higher respectively than the average retirees leave balance in 1968by contributions from both employees and the government although the csrs system is currently not fully funded12 until 1969 csrs employees forfeited any unused sick leave at the time of their retirement at that time the civil service commission now opm estimated that about half of all re tiring federal employees had zero sick leave balances and the other half had an average of about 44 da ys 352 hours of sick leave that were forfeited at retirement also house post office and civil service committee report noted that retiring employees used an average of 40 days 320 hours of sick leave during their last year of employment13 in 1969 congress enacted legislation p l 9193 to permit csrs employees to receive service credit for unused sick l eave in the computati on of their retirement annuities this change in policy made unused sick leave highly valuable for example as noted previously an employee retiring with 30 years of service and year of unused sick leave would get cred it for 31 years of service for purposes of annuity computation if this empl oyees highthree salary was 50000 the additional year of service would increase hi s or her pretax retir ement annuity by 2 or 1000 per year therefore even before indexing for inflation if the employee received the annuity for 20 years the unused sick leave would be worth about 20000 to pay for this and other changes in the retirement system the law increased employee and agency contributions to the civil service retirement fund from 65 to 70 of pay this change in policy was expected to reduce federal employees use of sick leave and to grant limited recognition to those who prudently utilized their sick leave in 1986 the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office examined the implementation of this change in policy and reported that employees who retired in 1984 and 1985 had si gnificantly higher sick leave balances than employees who retired in 1968 before the law was changed14 specifically the average sick leave balan ces for employees who retired in 1984 and 1985 were 38 and 46 higher respectively than the estimated average balance of 1968 retirees gao concluded that the changes made in 1969 had contributed to reducing the overall usage of sick leave and increasing th unused sick leave balances of retiring federal employees httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs7 15 fers employees who have at least 20 years of service and who work until at least age 62 earn 11 for each year of service theref ore an employee who retires at age 62 with 30 years of service will accrue pension benefit equal to 33 of his or her highthree average pay 16 for example if the amount of inflation is more than 3 the annuitant would receive an adjustment equal to the amount of in flation minus 1 percentage point 17 employees age 50 and older can also make catchup contributions of up to 5000 per year csrs employees can contribute to the tsp but they receive government matching contribution 18 retiring employees who transferred to fers receive service credit for the amount of continuedfers and sick leave the federal employees retirement sy stem act of 1986 pl 99335 created fers with three basic elements 1 social security 2 fers basic annuity and 3 thrift savings plan tsp the social security component is based on wages earned while federal employee employees may begin receiving reduced social security benefits at age 62 but may receive portion of that amount in the form of fers suppl ement as early as age 55 the fers basic annuity is fined benefit plan in which employees retiring below age 62 accrue benefits at the rate of 1 of their highthree average pay per year of service therefore fers employee retiring at age 58 with 30 years of service will accrue pension benefit equal to 30 of his or her highthree average pay15 like csrs fers annuities are funded by contributions from employees and the government but unlike csrs fers benefits must be prefunded according to their full actuarial costs fers annuitant s over age 62 receive annual costof living adjustments but those adjustments may be less than the amount of inflation16 the tsp is patterned after the 401k savings plans available in the private sector and encourages employees to save for retirement by making contributions pretax and by making interest earned on these contributions nontaxable until they are withdrawn the government contributes 1 of pa for all fers participants and provides whole or partia l matches for up to 5 of pay contributed by fers employees the maximum annual employee contribution is 1550017 in contrast to the approach taken w ith regard to csrs employees in 1969 congress did not authorize fers employees to receive service credit for unused sick leave except for leave carried into the system by employees who transferred to fers from csrs18 the legislative history for the 1986 act creating fers doeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs8 18 continued unused sick leave they had at the time of transf er or the time of retirement whichever is less 19 committee on post office and civil service us house of representatives committee print 998 99th congress second session june 12 1986 p 127 20 telephone discussions with the confidentia l assistant to the director and chief administration office of congressiona l relations opm mayjune 2004 21 these percentages include employees in federal retirement systems other than fers or csrs eg employees in the foreign service retirement system not explain why congress took this approac h however in the conference report for the act the conferees noted that fers employees unused sick leave generally could not be used in the computation of their annuities and urged opm to examine sick leave usage by fers employees the conferees went on to say that they were concerned that without an incentive to save sick leave the us of sick leave may substantially increase19 opm did not conduct this study until 2006 and the study is described and analyzed later in this report opm representatives told crs that their office had not conducted the study pr eviously because the agencys central personnel data file doe s not contain data that would allow comparison of sick leave usage rates or sick leave balances by employees in different retirement plans20 indications of great er sick leave use by fers employees there have been indications for some time that fers employees may be using sick leave more often than their csrs c ounterparts particularly as they approach retirement as noted previously averag sickleave usage rates for all federal employees increased by more than 10 from 1994 to 2001 rising from 859 days per year in 1994 to 952 days per year in 2001 one possible explanation for this increase is the additional uses for sick leave that were allowed during that period eg to care for sick family members or to adopt child however another explanation could be the increasing numbe rs of fers employees in the federal workforce and the fact that they receive benefit for accrued sick leave at retirement the percentage of fulltime permanent federal civilian employees in fers increased from about 46 in 1994 to about 62 in 200121 also may 2004 survey suggested that fers employees may be more likely to use sick leave as they approach retir ement than their csrs counterparts fpmi solutions inc human resources services staffing and training company primarily for federal agencies conducted an unscientif ic online poll of its subscribers current and retired federal employees regarding si ck leave usage of the more than 2300 participants in the poll 51 said they were under csrs and 49 said they were under fers although both groups of particip ants said they were strongly in favor of sick leave conservation the groups diverg ed regarding sick leave use in the last year before retirement whereas nearly 85 of csrs employees and retirees said they would or did conserve as much sick leave as possible more than 75 of fers employees and retirees said they planned to use as much sick leave as possible during their last year before retirement one re spondent said that there is huge incentive for csrs and offset employees to conserve sick leave and very large disincentivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs9 22 csrs offset retirement generally applies to employees who had break in service that exceeded one year and ended after 1983 and had five years of creditable civilian service on january 1 1987 when these employees become eligible for social security benefits their annuities w ill be offset by the value of the social security benefit earned during csrs offset service 23 scott d camp and eric g lambert the influence of organizational incentives on absenteeism sick leave use among correctional workers criminal justice policy review vol 17 2 june 2006 pp 144172 24 ibid p 168 25 the gs and wg pay systems are the major whitecollar and bluecollar pay systems respectively in the federal governmentfor fers employees to do the same22 another respondent said that this incentive structure causes lot of productivity to go down the drain however other respondents said that this incentive structur notwithstanding the use of sick leave when not sick was morally the wrong thing to do more scientific study of sick leave use within the bureau of prisons from 1994 through 2003 indicated that fers employees in the agency were in fact using more sick leave than those in csrs even when controlling other possible factors eg race gender education age an d sick leave balan ces of employees23 the authors concluded that the studys findi ngs strongly suggest that the apparent difference between the incentive systems in the csrs and fers systems regarding the use of sick leave is translated into actual differences in behaviors of csrs and fers employees24 fers employees use more sick leave than their csrs counterparts although opms central personnel data file does not contain data on sick leave usage rates by employees in different retirement systems those data are available from each federal agency or more centrally through organizations that administer payroll functions for multiple federal agencies for example the defense finance and accounting service dfas administers payroll functions for nearly 700000 civilian employees in the department of defense and the executive office of the president in 2004 crs requested data from dfas on sick leave usage rates and sick leave balances for employees and retirees in the agencies they service we focused on fulltime permanent employees in general schedule gs and wage grade wg or equivalent pay systems which in cluded more than 500000 employees in csrs and fers about onethird of the full time permanent workforce outside of the postal service intelligence agencies and law enforcement25 our data request was essentially in two parts first for em ployees who did not retire during the oneyear period from june 1 2003 through may 29 2004 we requested the average number of sick leave days used during that period and average sick leave balances as of the end of that period for the following categorieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs10 26 although the minimum retirement age increases slightly for employees born after 1947 in this study crs used age 55 consistently because the differen ces in eligibility were minimal 27 according to its website httpwwwdmdcosdmilabouthtml the defense manpower data center supports the information requireme nts of the office of the under secretary of defense for personnel readiness and other members of the departments manpower personnel and training communities employees in csrs and separately employees in fers who were eligible to retire wit hout penalty as of june 1 2003 ie at least 55 years of age and with at least 30 years of service or at least 60 years of age and 20 years of service or 62 years of age and 10 years of service26 employees in csrs and separately employees in fers who were eligible to retire and almost eligible to retire defined as being within two years of retirement eligibility in terms of any combination of age or service eg an employee who is 53 with 30 years of service or 55 with 28 years of service or an employee who is 58 with 20 years of service or 60 with 18 years of service employees in csrs and separately employees in fers who were eligible to retire and nearing eligibility to retire defined as being within five years of retirement eligibility in terms of any combination of age or service eg an employee who is 50 with 30 years of service or 55 with 25 years of service or an employee who is 55 with 20 years of service or 60 with 15 years of service second for employees who retired dur ing the june 1 2003 through may 29 2004 period we asked for the average number of sick leave days used per pay period when they were working and their average sick l eave balance as of their date of retirement differences in sick leav usage and balances the defense manpower data center acted as dfass agent to generate the sick leave information that we requested27 as table 1 shows the data indicated that fers employees in the agenci that dfas supports who were eligible to retire or approaching eligibility generally used more sick leave th an their csrs counterparts during the oneyear period ending may 29 2004 the differences between the two groups were greatest for gs employees as they approach ed or achieved retirement eligibility for example whereas fers employees in the gs pay system who were either eligible to retire or were within five years of retirement eligibility used only slightly more sick leave during the year than comparable csrs employees 89 hours versus 85 hours respectively fers employees who were eligible to retire or within two years of eligibility used 25 more sick leave than their cs rs counterparts 105 hours versus 84 hours respectively fers employees who were eligible to retire used nearly 35 more sick leave than comparable csrs employees 119 hours versus 89 hours respectively fers employees in the wg pay system who were eligible to retire or were within two years of eligibility also used somewhat more sickhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs11 28 the number of wg employees in each of these categories was also significantly smaller than the number of gs employees for example there were more than 33000 csrs employees in the gs system who were elig ible to retire compared to about 5500 wg employees in that category leave than their csrs c ounterparts eg 139 hours vers us 127 hours in

policies in state governments in one of the most comprehensive asse ssments of employee benefits in state governments workplace economics inc reported that as of january 1 2004 most states provided

dayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs15 37 the five states that generally provided compensation for unused sick leave were alaska indiana maine oregon and vermont in vermont though limited number of employees are covered by retirement plan in which 50 of unused sick leave is added to an employees average final compensation 38 after accruing 90 days of sick leave neva da state employees could carry over 50 of unused sick leave each year in special account to be used for longterm illnessesthe study also indicated that 45 states provided some form of compensation for unused sick leave at retirement37 these states compensation plans generally fell into three categories states that provided employees w ith cash payment for some portion of their unused sick leave states that provided service credit for the leave in the computation of retirement annuity or states that used the unused sick l eave to fund some type of health or life insurance for retirees the type and amount of compensation provi ded varied substantially within these three categories and in some cases the st ates provided employees with options across the categories eg allowing employees to choose either service credit for annuities or health insurance payments or provided more than one form of compensation for example in nevada employees were paid for unused sick leave over 30 days to maximum of 8000 in addition neva da state employ ees could receive compensation for 50 of the hours in speci sick leave account as either lump sum payment advanced payment of an insu rance premium or to purchase additional service credit38 cash payment plans in 28 states retirees were provided cash payment for portion of their unused sick leave in each of these states the size of the payment was limited in some way for example paying employees for percentage of their final sick leave balance most commonly 25 or 50 capping the number of days or hours of sick leave payable or th size of the payment itself or calculating the size of the payment based on formula in many cases the states used combination of these or other factors in determining the amount payable for example in virginia state employees were paid for 25 of their unused sick leave with the amount of the payment capped at 5000 in new hampshire employees we re paid for 33 of their unused sick leave up to 40 days arkansas used combination of formula and cap on the size of the payment employees with less than 50 days of unused sick leave on the date at retirement received payment employees with 50 to 59 days were paid for 50 of their sick days at 50 of their salaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs16 with the scale gradually rising to where employees with 80 to 120 days of unused sick leave received payment for 80 of their sick days at 80 of their salary the maximum payment for unused sick leave was 7500 in some states other limits were pl aced on whether and if so how much compensation would be provided to their employees for unused sick leave for example in illinois unused sick leave earned by state employees from january 1 1984 through december 31 1997 wa s paid at 50 of its value at separation in michigan only retiring employees hired before october 1 1980 were compensated they received payment for 50 of their unused sick leave based on their last rate of pay service credit plans in 14 states employees received service credit for unused sick leave in computing retirement benefits as is currently done for csrs employees in the federal government but several states placed conditions or limits on the use of sick leave in this manner for example in georgi unused sick leave could be used to compute retirement benef its only if the combined balance of sick and annual leave at retirem ent totaled 120 hours in ok lahoma maximum of one year service credit was allowed but any cred ited service of six months or more was rounded up to full year in south carolin employees could convert up to 90 days of sick leave to retirement service credits thereby adding up to 45 months of service time in calculating the size of their annuity insurance plans in seven states the value of some portion of unused sick leave could be credited toward retiree health or life insurance premiums for example in utah retirees c ould use unused sick leave to purchase health insurance with eight hours of sick leave equal to one month of individual coverage as in the previous categories of compensation stat often placed limits on the use of sick leave in this manner for example in idaho half of the monetary value of unused sick leave earned since july 1 1976 or 600 hours whichever is smaller could be used to pay the retirees premiu ms for group health programs policy options the data presented in this report indicat that fers employees have been using more sick leave than thei r csrs counterparts partic ularly as they approached retirement although higher sick leav balances for csrs retirees retirement eligibles and near eligibles may be partially function of longevity the differences in average usage rates between employees in the two retirement systems lends credence to longstanding hypothesis th at fers employees who get value for their unused sick leave will us that leave rather than simply forfeiting it back to the government at retirement various policy options are available to reduce fers employees sick leave use with some desi gned to entice the employees to conserve their leave balances ie carrot approach and some designed to more strictly enforce the conditions under which federal em ployees are allowed to use sick leave ie stick approach httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs17 39 see for example bob gils on preventing sick leave problems steps an agency can take to reduce problems fedsmith january 3 2007 available at httpwwwfedsmithcomarticlesarticlesshowarticledbphpintarticleid1121 more stringent enforcemen t of sick leave policies as noted previously federal agencies may grant sick leave only when supported by evidence that they consider administratively acceptable eg medical certificate therefore if policy makers decide to address this issue one approach to the apparent greater use of sick leave by fers employees as they approach retirement would be to enforce existing regulations more stringently requiring some type of evidence to support the use of sick leave for more than certain number of days within particular period of time alternatively or additionally agencies could use training and ot her management practices to reduce sick leave use39 the advantage of this overall approach is that it could reduce sick leave productivity losses without incurring other costs however the ccess of this approach in encouraging the use of sick leave only wh needed would depend on how rigorously it was implemented by the agencies also if employees are able to produce the required documentation easily eg convi ncing their doctors to provide some evidence of medical treatment or condition its success in reducing sick leave use may be limited providing an incentive to conserve sick leave the other general approach is to pr ovide fers employees an incentive to conserve their sick leave the previous discussion about sick leave policies in state governments suggests that wide variety of options are available within this approach one such option would be to allow fers employees to use unused sick leave in the computation of their annuity the experience of csrs employees when they were offered service credit suggests that doing so would have the desired effect however fers annuities are generally much smaller than thei r csrs counterparts because they are only one part of the fe rs retirement package and each additional year of service has less value in fers than in csrs 1 instead of 2 also this alternative could prove to be much more expensive than other options over the long term as larger annuities are payable for as long as the retiree receives pension one way to lessen this expense would be to pr ovide partial service credit for example if an employee had year 2087 hours of unused sick leave the employee could be provided six months of service credit ther eby increasing his or her annuity by one half of one percent it is unclear however whether this relatively small increase in their annuities would be enough to encourag fers employees to retain their unused sick leave until retirement for example fers employee with high three salary of 80000 per year would under this scenari increase his or her pretax annuity by about 400 per year another option would be to provide em ployees with cash payment for their unused sick leave the expe rience of the states suggests that this payment be limited in some way for example paying empl oyees for 25 or 50 of their final sick leave balance capping the number of days or hours of sick leave payable or the size of the payment itself or calculating the si ze of the payment based on some type ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs18 40 the ferscsrs difference for gs and equi valent workers was 30 hours per year and the difference for wg and equivalent work ers was 12 hours b ecause there were bout seven times as many gs workers as wg workers in 2004 the weighted average fers csrs difference is 28 hoursformula from the employees standpoint cash payments are likely to have the added appeal of immediacy when compared to the annuitybased incentive allowing employees to see relatively fast tangible benefit to reserving their sick leave formulabased systems can be complicated but can have the advantage of building in additional incentives to save sick leave for example system that pays for 50 of sick leave over certain level eg 500 hours avoids minimus payments while encouraging employees to maintain roughly threemonth cushion of sick leave for longerterm disabilities on the other hand employees with smaller sick leave balances may see little or benefit as result of this policy and may continue to use sick leave at relatively rapid rate finally the experiences of the states suggest that federal policymakers could permit fers employees to use their unused si ck leave to help pay for health life or other insurance in retirement again th amount of the payment could be capped either in terms of the proportion of sick leav convertible to this purpose or by fixed dollar amount this option was least comm on in state governments and may have the least appeal to retiring employees who could use cash payment to pay for insurance or any other purpose comparison of costs any of these options to provide valu for unused sick leave would likely be viewed by fers employees as more dvantageous than the current policy of providing value for unused sick leave less clear though is whether the amount of the perceived advantage would be sufficient to prevent the additional sick leave use should congress decide to adopt one of these approaches the federal employees retirement system act require s that fers benef its be prefunded according to their full actuarial costs therefore some increase would likely be needed in the employees contributi on to fers the federal governments contribution or both with the size of the increase dependent upon the approach taken given the hidden lost productivity costs associated with the current policy though it appears that change in federa l sick leave policy could depending on how it is constructed pr ovide net benefit to the government for example the data crs obtained from dfas indicated that fers employees in the gs and wg pay systems who were ligible to retire used an average of about 28 more hours of sick leave in the oney ear period ending in may 2004 than their csrs counterparts40 opm data for 2004 indicate that fulltime permanent federal employees who were ages 55 to 59 and d 30 to 34 years of service indicative of those eligible to retire were paid an average of nearly 80000 per year or about 38 per hour therefore the 28 additiona l hours of sick leave used by fers retirement eligibles may have cost the federal government about 1064 per employeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs19 41 these costs are presented as productivity losses because agencies pay their employees the same amount whether they are on sick leave or in regular duty status 42 this 1050 hour estimated sick leave balance is higher than the actual average balance of fers retirees in 2004 because crs assumed that the incentive will encourage employees to retain their sick leave 43 in this example csrs retirees with highthree salary of 80000 and with leave balance of 1050 hours would receive an additional 800 per year in additional pension therefore over the course of 20year retir ement before any inflation adjustments the sick leave would be worth an additional 16000in lost productivity 28 hours times 38 per hour41 opm data indicate that there were 51255 fers retirement ligibles as of september 2004 assuming that the sick leave patterns revealed in the dfas data can be extrapolated to the rest of the government the total lostproductivity cost in that year of the additional sick leave for all fers eligibles would ther efore be about 55 million 1064 times 51255 employees greater sick leave use by other fers employees particularly those nearing retirement eligibility would push th is lostproductivity cost even higher these costs occur year after year and are likely to grow larger given the increasing number of fers employees in the governme nt as whole and particularly those nearing retirement conceivably the cost to the federal g overnment of providing fers retirees with some type of value for their unused sick leave could be substantially less than the cost of the current policy even if the full cost were paid by the federal government for example in 2004 there were about 42000 voluntary retirements governmentwide if we assu that 10000 of these retirees were in fers that they had an average high three salary of 80000 and that they had an average leave balance of 1050 hours42 giving these fers retirees full service credit at 1 per year for six months would increase their annual annuitie s by about 400 80000 times 001 times 05 over 20year retiremen t the value of this annuity increase before any inflation adjustments w ould be about 8000 however if the employees were given 25 of that value as lumpsum payment at the time of retirement each retiree in this example would get 2000 therefore the total cost of this incentive would be about 20 million 2000 times 10000 fers retirees while not as generous as the csrs incentive43 this lump sum payment could be enough to encourage reduced sick leave us by fers employees and if successful would be substantially less than th estimated lost productivity costs opms 2006 study of sick leave usage in may 2006 crs contacted dfas in an attempt to obtain more recent data on federal

agency to conduct such study in 1986 in october 2006 opm reported to the member of congress on the results of the study and the members office shared those results with crs the overall design of the study was similar to the desi gn that crs used in its 2004 study but thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs20 data covered more employees specifica lly opm obtained sick leave use data on fulltime permanent nonpostal service employees from the four major federal payroll providers dfas the organizati on providing data to crs in 2004 the department of the interiors nationa l business center the

also examined sick leave use by fers and csrs employees who had retired during this period some of the opm studys results appear similar to the results of the earlier crs study as table 4 below shows the opm study indi cated that fers employees who were eligible to retire used an average of 202 more hours of sick leave per year from april 2005 through march 2006 than their cs rs counterparts as described in table 1 above the crs study indicated that whitecollar fers employees who were eligible to retire used 30 hours more sick leave per year in 2003 and 2004 than their csrs counterparts blueco llar fers employees who were retirement eligible used about 12 hours more sick leave per year than similar bluecollar csrs employees among employees who were within two years of retirement eligibility opm reported that fers employees used an av erage of 135 more hours of sick leave per year than csrs employees in the crs study the ferscsrs difference for employees eligible and nearly

first few months of this oneyear period 45 crs raised these and other issues with fficials in both the opm pay group that did the study and opms office of congressional relati ons in october 2006 crs

from opm 46 scott d camp and eric g lambert t he influence of organizational incentives on continuedperiod for fers compared with 261 hours per pay period for csrs44 in contrast the crs study indicated that whitecolla r employees in fers who retired in 2003 and 2004 used 25 more hours of sick leave per pay period than their csrs counterparts for bluecollar workers the ferscsrs difference was 02 hours more per pay period opm said it did not believe that the higher rate of sick leave use by fers employees who were eligible and nearly eligible to retire was solely attributable to the fact that they do not r eceive retirement credit for unused sick leave the agency said other possible explanations in cluded demographic differences between employees in the two retirement systems and the increased number of ways that sick leave can be used nevertheless usin g what it characterized as the unproven assumption that the entire difference in sick l eave usage is solely attributable to the fact that fers employees do not receive retirement credit for unused sick leave opm estimated that the lost productivity cau sed by increased use of sick leave by fers employees who were eligible or nearly eligible to retire cost the federal government 68 million during the apr il 2005 through march 2006 period opm estimated that providing fers employees w ith service credit for unused sick leave would increase costs to the retiremen t fund by about 180 million annually and would increase the retirement fund liab ility by about 2 billion amortization of which would require annual payments of about 137 million over 40 years in total opm said to pay for future costs and to amortize the cost of benefits based upon past service would have an annual cost of about 317 million therefore opm concluded that to make si ck leave creditable under fers would cost several times more than the potential savings analysis of the opm study several elements of the opm study c ould have affected opms conclusions45 first the reasons that opm suggested as alternative explanations to why fers employees are using more sick leave than csrs employees can be questioned opm said one such reason could be the differe nces in the demographic characteristics of employees in the two retirement systems eg age differences between fers and csrs employees however these hypothesized effects can be tested statistically and the results of such tests in one fe deral organization do not appear to support opms conclusions as noted earlier in this report 2005 study of employees at the federal bureau of prisons concluded that demographi c differences between fers and csrs employees could not explain differences in sick leave use rates between employees in the two retirement systems46 instead the authors concluded thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs22 46 continued absenteeism sick leave use among correctional workersdifferences in sick leave us were directly attributable to differences in how unused sick leave is treated in the two retirement systems another reason that opm said could cause the ferscsrs difference in sick leave use was the increased number of ways that sick leave can be used eg for adoption of child or to care for sick family member up to specified limits however this seems an unlikely explanation for ferscsrs differences in leave usage within the sa time period particularly since both fers and csrs employees could use their sick leave for all of these purposes second at least some of the data that opm used in the study appear to be of questionable validity for example opm sa id that csrs employees who had retired between april 2005 and march 2006 used 261 hours of sick leave per pay period while fers employees who retired dur ing this period used 228 hours per pay period because each federal pay period is 80 hours opm s data suggest that csrs retirees were on sick leave nearly onethird of the time that they worked during their last year of service and fers retirees were on sick leave nearly as much while these levels of sick leave us are possible the levels s eem unusually high ie nearly 600 to 700 hours per year on an annual basis and are about three times higher than the dfas data that were provided to crs just two years earlier also the opm data indicated that csrs employees who receive significant value for their unused sick leave used more sick leave per pay period than fers employees who receive nothing for unused sick leave again count er to what the dfas data indicated in the crs study and counter to what one would expect given the current incentive structure also opm did not explain in any detail how it arrived at its estimates of the cost of lost productivity or its estimate of the cost of providing fers employees with service credit for their unused sick leave balances for the lost productivity estimate opm said that it was function of the number of fers employees eligible or nearly eligible to retire times the employees average salary times the difference in the number of hours of sick leave use d opm identified the number of employees in each retirement system who were eligible or nearly eligible to retire as well as the average differences in si ck leave use for each group but did not indicate what values it used for the average salary of these employees based on its 68 million productivity cost estimate and knowing the other variables though it appears opm assumed an average salary of near ly 54 per hour or about 112000 per year however opm data on the federal workfo rce as whole in march 2006 indicate that the average salary for fulltime perman ent employees was less than 66000 per year or less than 32 per hour for such employees who were ages 50 to 54 with 25 to 29 years of service ie those close to retirement eligibility the average salary was less than 77000 per year or less than 37 pe r hour therefore assuming all other factors in the equation stayed the same number of fers employees eligible and nearly eligible to retire and leave us age patterns for employees in those groups opms estimate of the annua l cost of lost productivity for these fers employees may be accuratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32596crs23 47 reg jones study compares use of sick leave under csrs fers federal times february 21 2005 48 treasury inspector general for tax

available at http wwwtreasgov tigtaauditreports2008reports200830093frhtml finally and most notably the only po licy option that opm appears to have considered in its study was to give fe rs employees full service credit for unused sick leave an option that was characteriz ed by one retirement expert as the most obvious and most expensive option47 however as the discussion of nonfederal sick leave policies earlier in this report makes clear number of other less expensive policy options are potentially available to encourage fers employees to save their sick leave including partial service credit lump sum payments for portion of unused sick leave based on either the cash value of the sick leave or the value of the service credit or applying ll or portion of the value of an employees sick leave balance to the cost of the employees retirement health care premium had opm considered these other options its conclusions regarding the economic feasibility of providing value for unused sick leave may have been different different approaches and fo rmulas might be tested w ith focus groups of federal employees to determine which method yields the greatest incentive at the least cost to the government on the other hand and as suggested earlier completely different way to reduce sick leave use by fers and csrs employees is to impose more stringent management policies and controls on the use of sick leave or perhaps some combination of carrot and stick approaches could be tried the first step though may be to have opm or some other entity conduct comprehensive transparent and

sick leave used by fers employees and recomme nded that the irs chief human capital officer ensure that all irs managers receive training on leave policies to increase awareness of sick leave abuse
