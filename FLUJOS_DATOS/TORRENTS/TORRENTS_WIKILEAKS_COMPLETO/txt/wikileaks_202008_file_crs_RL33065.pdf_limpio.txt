grievances8 for the past 40 years observers have noted steady increase in the number of organized interest groups including ssociations public interest groups and professional organizations additionally these observers note change in the types of activities in which these organizations engage to advance their interests9 i n addition to longstanding lobbying techni ques of establishing personal ties with members of congress their staff and executive branch officials and testifying at congressional and adminis trative hearings interest groups are also using direct mail public relations newspaper advertisement and other marketing techniques to generate public interest in public policies and programs these activities can include engaging citizens to lobby on their behalf to persuade government official regarding legislation or executive agency action some of these organized efforts which are not currently subject to disclosure under lda are also accompan ied by sophisticated media campaigns to advance the causes of group10 widespread lobbying campaigns may be targeted to citizens journalists lawmakers executive agency personnel and other groups w ith interests similar to t hose of the organization on whose behalf the campaign is mounted11 this practice is sometimes referred to as grassroots advocacy to identify its appeal to the general public some observers noting the use of marketing techniques and lleging that connection to the general public is lacking sometimes refer to such efforts as astroturf

observers have noted that many lobbyin g campaigns involve increased reliance by interest groups on anonymous or st ealth campaigns in which the lobbying activities directed to the public or policy ma kers are organized through coalitions and associations some of these coalitions and associations form alliances with other groups or serve as groups which exist sole ly to advance campaign for or against specific policy action13 political scientists darrell west and burdett loomis assert that anonymous campaigns are carried out in voter education effo rts and electoral legislative and rulemaking ttings and that the key in each of these efforts is that the actual sponsor is masked by front orga nizations that make it difficult for the public to see who really is funding the activity stealth campaigns are consciously designed to fly under the radar of press and public oversight14 anonymous campaigns to sway public opinion and affect public policy are not new writing series of articles that became known generally as the federalist papers alexander hamilton ja mes madison and john jay15 sought to sway the general public in the 13 united states and ne w york residents in particular to press their leaders for ratification of the u s constitution in 1787 and 1788 85 articles authored by the trio appeared in ne wspapers throughout the country under the pseudonym publius as part of what has been described as the most significant publicrelations campaign in history16 in the articles the three authors made mention of their close association with the constitutional convention that drafted and approved the document presently however concern has been expressed that entities that use anonymous lobbying activities and public relations campaigns might circumvent the process of public consideration of lawmaking and regulatory activities observers suggest that current lobbying disclosure ws described below allow interested entities to shield their lobbying activities through the use of ostensibly separate independent coa litions and associations17 proposals to require more detailed disclosure of lobbying clients the government officials who have been lobbied and expenditures dedicated to lobbying have followed those supporting mo re detailed disclosu re might argue that such efforts could afford greater transp arency and broader understanding of the effects of private interests in the public policy making process from their perspective such change might also instill greater accountability those opposing changes to current lobbying disclosure practices might maintain that expanding disclosure could have potential adverse impact on constitutionally protected rightshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33065crs4 18 if the total income for matters related
