amt for individuals was originally enacted to ensure that all taxpayers especially highincome taxpayers paid at least minimum amount of federal taxes1 however absent legislative action there will be significant increase in the number of middle to uppermiddleincome taxpayers affected by the amt in the near future in 2005 about 36 million taxpayers were subject to the amt but by 2007 up to 23 million taxpayers could be subject to the amthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22100crs2 2 for more detailed information on the amt see crs report rl30149 the alternative minimum tax fo r individuals by gregg esenweinthere are two main reasons for the increase in the number of taxpayers affected by the amt first the regular income tax is indexed for inflation but the amt is not over time this has produced reduction in the differences between regular income tax liabilities and amt liab ilities at any given nominal income level differences that will continue to shrink in the absence of amt indexation the second reason is that the 2001 and 2003 reductions in the regular income tax have further narrowed the differences between regular and amt tax liabilities the combination of these two factors means that absent legislative changes there will be significant growth in the number of taxpayers affected by the amt2 the effects of the amt have been temporarily mitigated through an increase in the basic exemption for the amt and temporary provisions allowing certain personal tax credits to offset amt liability for 2006 the amt exemption is 62550 for joint returns and 42500 for unmarried taxpayers abse nt legislation in 2007 the basic amt exemption is scheduled to decrease to 45000 for joint returns and 35750 for unmarried taxpayers in addition starting in 2007 seve ral personal tax credits will not be allowed against the amt revenue effects of modifying the amt the fact that the amt is poised to affect so many taxpayers in the near future has prompted calls to remedy the situation absent legislative action the amt will take back much of the recently enacted reductions in the regular income tax for millions of taxpayers because personal exemptions ar not allowed against the amt large families will be particularly susceptible to the amt in addition since deductions for statelocal taxes are not allowed against the amt taxpayers who itemize and deduct these taxes on their regular income tax returns are also likely to be adversely affected by the amt however modifications to the amt will prove costly in terms of forgone revenue when discussing the longrun beyond 2010 revenue implications of modifying the amt it is critical to specify whether it is assumed that the 20012003 tax cuts are allowed to expire after 2010 as scheduled or whether it is assumed that the tax cuts are extended beyond 2010 allowing the 2001 tax cuts to expire as scheduled will reduce the costs of modifying the amt if the tax cuts are extended beyond 2010 then the costs of modifying the amt will increase dramatica lly indeed if th 2001 2003 tax cuts are extended then as rough estimate the cost of most options for modifying the amt will almost double the revenue effects of seve ral modifications to the amt are shown in table 1 to keep the amt from affecting more taxp ayers in the out years than it will in 2006 would at the least require maintaining high er exemption levels and indexing the amt for inflation according to the congressiona l budget office cbo this option which assumes using basic exemption levels of 5800040250 and indexing these amounts for inflation after 2005 will cost 282 b illion over the period fy2007 through fy2011 it will cost 544 billion over the fy2007 through fy2016 peri od if th 2001 2003 reductions in the regular inco tax are allowed to expire as scheduled if the 20012003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22100crs3 tax cuts are extended beyond 2010 then th is option would reduce revenues by 865 billion over the same time period table 1 revenue

do not include the additional co st that would arise th rough debt financing of these policy options these additional costs woul d be substantial for instance cbo estimates that the cost of the debt service associated with maintaining the high er amt exemption levels and indexation of the amt would be 132 billion over 10year period 4 effective in 2007 certain personal tax credits for example the dependent care credit the hope scholarship and lifetime learning credit and the dc homebuyers credit cannot be used to reduce taxpayers regular in come tax below their amt liability extended then repealing the amt would reduce federal revenues by over trillion dollars between fy2006 and fy20153 in fact the treasury department has estimated that by 2013 it would be less expensive to repeal th regular income tax than it would be to repeal the amt legislative initiatives in the 109th congress on march 17 2005 the house approved its fy2006 budget resolution h res 95 the house resolution

provided partial amt relief through oneyear exte nsion of the treatme nt of nonr efundable personal tax credits under the amt this b ill however did not include an extension of the higher amt
