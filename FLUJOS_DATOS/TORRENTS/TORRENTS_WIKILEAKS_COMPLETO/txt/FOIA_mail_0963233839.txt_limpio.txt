from raymond s bradley rbradleygeoumassedu to frank oldfield frankoldfieldpagesunibech subject re the ghost of futures past date mon 10 jul 2000 085719 0400 cc alversonpagesunibech jtouarizonaedu kbriffaueaacuk mhughesltrrarizonaedu pederseneosubcca whitlockoregonuoregonedu mannmultiproxyevscvirginiaedu xflowedsorry this kept you awakebut i have also found it rather alarming graph first disclaimerexplanation the graph patches together 3 things mann et nh mean annual temps 2 sigma standard error for ad10001980 instrumental data for 19811998 ipcc do not quote do not cite projections for global temperature for the next 100 years relative to 1998 the range of shading represents several models of projected emissions scenarios as input to gcms but the gcm mean global temperature output as i understand it was then reproduced by sarah rapers energy balance model and it is those values that are plotted keith pointed this out to i need to go back read the ipcc tar to understand why they did that but it makes difference to the first order resultneither does it matter that the projection is global rather than nhthe important point is that the range of estimates far exceeds the range estimated by mann et in their reconstruction keith also said that the hadley center gcm runs are being archived at cru so it ought to be possible to get that data and simply compute the nh variability for the projected period add that to the figure but it will not add much real information however getting such data would allow us to extract say summer regional series for the arctic and to then plot it versus the holocene melt record from agassiz ice caporwell you can see other possiblities at this point keith alverson throws up his hands in despair at the ignorance of nonmodel amateurs but there are real questions to be asked of the paleo reconstruction first i should point out that we calibrated versus 19021980 then verified the approach using an independent data set for 18541901 the results were good giving confidence that if we had comparable proxy data set for post1980 we dont our proxybased reconstruction would capture that period well unfortunately the proxy network we used has not been updated and furthermore there are manysome tree ring sites where there has been decoupling between the longterm relationship between climate and tree growth so that things fall apart in recent decadesthis makes it very difficult to demonstrate what i just claimed we can only call on evidence from many other proxies for unprecedented states in recent years eg glaciers isotopes in tropical ice etc but there are at least two other problems keith briffa points out that the very strong trend in the 20th century calibration period accounts for much of the success of our calibration and makes it unlikely that we would be able be able to reconstruct such an extraordinary period as the 1990s with much success i may be misquoting him somewhat but that is the general thrust of his criticism indeed in the verification period the biggest miss was an apparently very warm year in the late 19th century that we did not get right at all this makes criticisms of the antis difficult to respond to they have not yet risen to this level of sophistication but they are on the scent furthermore it may be that mann et simply dont have the longterm trend right due to underestimation of low frequency info in the very few proxies that we used we tried to demonstrate that this was not problem of the tree ring data we used by rerunning the reconstruction with without tree rings and indeed the two efforts were very similar but we could only do this back to about 1700 whether we have the 1000 year trend right is far less certain one reason why i hedge my bets on whether there were any periods in medieval times that might have been warm to the irritation of my coauthors so possibly if you crank up the trend over 1000 years you find that the envelope of uncertainty is comparable with at least some of the future scenarios which of course begs the question as to what the likely forcing was 1000 years ago my money is firmly on an increase in solar irradiance based on the 10be data another issue is whether we have estimated the totality of uncertainty in the longterm data set used maybe the envelope is really much larger due to inherent characteristics of the proxy data themselvesagain this would cause the past and future envelopes to overlap in ch 7 we will try to discuss some of these issues in the limited space available perhaps the best thing at this stage is to simply point out the inherent uncertainties and point the way towards how these uncertainties can be reduced malcolm i are working with mike mann to do just that i would welcome other thoughts and comments on any of this ray at 0134 pm 71000 0200 you wrote salut mes amis ive lost sleep fussing about the figure coupling mann et or any alternative climatehistory time series to the ipcc scenarios it seems to to encapsulate the whole pastfuture philosophical dilemma that bugs on and off ray dont stop reading just yet to provide potentially the most powerful peg to hang much of pages future on at least in the eyes of funding agents and by the same token to offer more hostages to fortune for the politically motivated and malicious it also links closely to the concept of being inside or outside the envelope which begs all kinds of notions of definition given what i see as its its prime importance i therefore feel the need to understand the whole thing better i dont know how to help move things forward and my ideas if they have any effect at all will probably do the reverse at least i might get more sleep having unloaded them so here goes the questions in my mind centre round the following issues if ive got any one of them wrong what follows in each section can be disregarded or more kindly set straight for my benefit 1 how can we justify bridging proxybased reconstruction via the last bit of instrumental time series to future modelbased scenarios 2 how can the incompatibilities and logical inconsistencies inherent in the pastfuture comparisons be reduced 3 more specifically what forms of translation between what we know about the past and the scenarios developed for the future deal adequately with uncertainty and variability on either side of the contemporary hinge in way that improves comparability across the hinge 4 which if any scenarios place our future in or out of the envelope in terms of experienced climate as distinct from calculated forcing this idea of an envelope is an engaging concept easy to state in quick and sexy way therefore both attractive and dangerous the future could leave us hoisted by our own petard unless it is given lot more thought 1 i am more or less assuming that this can already be addressed from data available and calculations completed by pointing to robust calibration over the chosen time interval and perhaps looking separately at variability pre 1970 if the last 3 decades really do seem to have distorted the response signatures for whatever reasons i imagine developing this line of argument could feed into the detection theme in significant ways 2 3 this is where life gets complicated for the past we have biases error bars that combine sources of uncertainty and temporal variability for the future we have variability simply smooth mean monotonic trend to target equilibrium date bandwidths of uncertainty reflect model construction and behaviour so we are comparing apples and oranges when we make any statement about the significance of the past record for the future on the basis of the graph are there ways of partially overcoming this by developing different interactions between past data and future models my own thinking runs as follows take variability do we need to wait for models to capture this before building it into future scenarios this seems unnecessary to especially since past variability will be the validation target for the models is there really way of building past variability into the future projections one approach would be to first smooth the past record on the same timespan as the future scenarios this would get us to first base in terms of comparability but very dull and pretty useless first base in and of itself it would however allow all kinds of calculations of interannual variability relative to mean time line of the right length this in turn could be used in several ways for example build the total range of past variability into the uncertainty bands of each future scenario take the 3050 or 100 year period depending on the scenario for comparison during which there was the greatest net variability or the greatest net fall in temperature or the greatest net increase in t and superimposeadd this databased variability on the mean trends take the ngreatest positive anomalies relative to the trend and use them to define an upper limit of natural variability to compare with the to my mind more realistic future scenarios these and cleverer variants i cannot begin to think up seem to to hold out the possibility of linking future projections of ghg forcing with what we know about natrual variability in reasonably realistic ways and perhaps even of redefining the past datafuture scenario relationship in ways that benefit both the paleocommunity and the quality of future projections 4 i also think the above kinds of exercise might eventually lead us towards better definition of the envelope and more confidence in deciding what is outside and what is not the same sort of approach can be taken towards projections of pe i imagine and more particularly at regional rather than global or hemispheric level sorry if all this sounds stupid or obvious i got afflicted with the need to share bug frank ____________________________________________ frank oldfield executive director pages
