belaruss modest progress towa rd democracy and free market economy and created an authoritarian sovietstyle regime the bush administration has called him europes last dictator the 2002 state department human rights report said that belaruss human rights record is very poor lukash enko has extended his term in office by illegitimate means drastically reduced the power of the legislature and judiciary harassed arre sted and beaten opposition figu res perhaps having four of them killed in 1999 forced the closur of independent media and restricted freedom of religion in november 2002 the united states joined 14 european union countries in imposing visa ban agai nst lukashenko and other top belarusian officials due to belaruss closure of an osce human rights monitoring mission in the country the visa ban was lifted in april 2003 after the osce office was reopened belarus allegedly has ties with rogue regimes before the war in iraq lukashenko made statements opposing u s military action nd supporting saddam hussein in april 2003 deputy assistant secr etary of state stephen pifer said that there have been repeated reports from va riety of credible sources that belarus ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31986crs3 3 associated press wire dispatch april 16 2003involved in arms transfers to states or groups that support terrorism and in the military training of individuals associated with these states he said those states included iran and iraq under saddam hussein3 congressional concerns about belarus are reflected in the house version of hr 1950 title xvi section 1601 authorizes us aid to assist belarusian democracy section 1602 authorizes appropriations for increased broadcasting to belarus by voice of america and radio free europe radio liberty rferl section 1603 expresses the sense of the congress that sanctions be imposed on belarus until conditions are met that require belaru ss democratizati on and section 1604 expresses the sense of the congress that the president should coordinate with european countries to take measures s imilar to those in th is title secti on 1605 requires the president to report within 90 days and every year thereafter on the sale of weapons or weaponsrelate d assistance to regimes supporting terrorism and on the personal wealth of luka shenko and other senior belarusian leaders this title could be viewed as noncont roversial in that it does not formally require the administration to take ac tion except to submit regular report on belaruss military ties with regimes supporting terrorism the titles authorization for aid for belarus democratization and voa and rferl broadcasts is also unlikely to be controversial section 1603 wh ich expresses support for but does not mandate sanctions against be larus could conceivably cause some disquiet among some us allies in europe if it were perceived to be part of us effort to completely isolate lukashenko while sh aring us distaste for the belarusian leader some european countries may worry that isolation could provoke the regime into unpredictable actions or contribute to instability in country that will border on the european union in 2004 policymakers who support title xvi argue that lukashenkos regime is source of instab ility and that the sooner it is deposed and democracy is restored the more stable the region will be mix of sanctions and support for prodemocracy groups would be th best way to achieve this aim they believe neither the previous senate version of the bill s 925 nor the current one s 2144 contain similar provisions crs

section 1201 as proposed also formally designates the secretary of commerce and the attorney general to be part of the review and certification process whereas current law stipulates roles only for the secretary of state and the secretary of defense the formal inclusion of the secretary of commerce and the attorney general in this requirement will likely be viewed in favorable terms as both are involved in variety of missile nonprolif eration capacities the reporting on overlaps and omissions in terms of the itar nd ear in the proposed annual certification might help congress identify areas wher both regulations can be improved by legislative action the proposal of the annual certification pr oposed in section1201 may generate oppos ition particularly in the executive branch the question

prevents groups from using aliases to evade the law it is intended to improve us ability to keep track of and sanction these groups httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31986crs31 32 prepared by audrey kurth cronin specialist in terrorism foreign affairs defense and trade divisionsection 501a removes the current requirement set fo rth in section 219 of the immigration and nationality act 8 usc 1189 that the designation of an organization as foreign terrorist organization fto automatically lapse after two years unless the secretary of state renews it instead it places the onus on the fto to petition to ask to be removed if the fto does not petition to be removed within fouryear period however then the secret ary must take the initiative and review the designation to determine whether or not it should continue as amended neither the results of the fouryear evaluation nor the procedures established to make such an evaluation are subject to judicial review thus there is much more procedural protection if the fto chooses to challe nge the designation before the fouryear review the ability to revoke the ftos desi gnation by act of congress also stays in place an interesting implication of these changes is that in placing the burden on the foreign terrorist organization to come forw ard the process could be useful to the us government in gathering counter rrorist intelligence terrorist group must reveal its identity and membership at least to some extent in order to petition to be removed from the list since designation as terrorist organi zation carries numerous legal implications including the possible freezing of us assets and barring of members entry into the united states this provision increases the leverage that the executive branch has in both identifying and potentially controlling terrorist groups assuming that foreign terrorist organizations are appropriately labeled in the first place section 501b gives the secretary the fl exibility to amend an ftos designation to take into account new or different names that terrorist group might use this is an effort to keep the law from being evaded by groups that evolve or change their names but continue to be ssentially

assistance which is being used to support the interdiction of aerial trafficking of illicit narcotics to be used to support the interdiction of illicit arms in connec tion with illicit drug

worlds largest international source of funding for family planning and repr oductive health programs providing nearly 6 billion in assistance to over 140 countri since 1969 the united states which had been one of the organizations larg est donors suspended support for unfpa in 1985 because of concerns over practices of forced abortions and involuntary sterilizations in china where unfpa maintained programs congress passed the so called kempkasten amendment in that year and in each subsequent year as part of the annual foreign operations appropriations the amendm ent bars us funding to any

withhold funds to unfpa and to recommend that they be re directed to other international family planning and repr oductive health activ ities the state department said that even t hough unfpa did not

provision allocating 34 million to unfpa so long as several conditions were met the most significant requirement is that the president must certify that unfpa is longer involved in the management of coercive family planning program the president did not make the required determination howev er and resources for the organization have been reprogrammed for other purposes for years in which the united states did not contribute to unfpa critics have argued that us policy was undermining the most important international family planning organization and limiting repr oductive health programs in over 140 countries in which unfpa operates because of coercive practices in one nation supporters of cutting off support for unfpa contend that by withdrawing from china unfpa could immediately restore its eligibility for us funding and remove itself from involvement with national prog ram that includes practices contrary to unfpas own noncoercive policies during markup on hr 1950 the hous international relations committee approved crowley amendment that woul d have authorized 50 million for us contribution to unfpa for each of fy 2004 and fy2005 the crowley amendment further would have

colombia and andean region assistance abovecritics of the mexico city require ments oppose it on several grounds they argue that family planning organizations ma cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of the rest rictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for usaid funding opponents also believe the conditions undermine relations between the us government and foreign ngos and multilateral groups creating situation in which the united states challenges their sovereignty on how to spend their own money and impose socalled gag order on their ability to promote changes to abortion laws and regula tions in developing nations the latter restriction these critics note would be unconstitutional if applied to american groups working in the united states supporters of the policy argue that ev though permanent law bans usaid funds from being used to perform or pr omote abortions money is fungible that organizations receiving americantaxpayer f unding can simply use usaid resources for legal activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws and regulations the policy they contend stops the fungibility loophole during debate on s 925 the senate pproved on july 9 an amendment offered by senator boxer that would effectively overturn the presidents mexico city policy the senate failed to table the amendment 4353 specifically the boxer language states that foreign ngos shall not be inelig ible for us funds solely on the basis of health or medical services they provide including counseling and referral services with nonus government funds this exemption would apply so long as the services do not violate the ws of the country in which they are performed and that they would not violate us laws if provi ded in the united states the amendment further provides that nonus government funds used by foreign ngos for advocacy and lobbying activities shall be subject to conditions that also apply to us ngos since it is largely held that american ngos would not be subject to these restrictions under the constitutional protection of free speech it is possible that this latter
