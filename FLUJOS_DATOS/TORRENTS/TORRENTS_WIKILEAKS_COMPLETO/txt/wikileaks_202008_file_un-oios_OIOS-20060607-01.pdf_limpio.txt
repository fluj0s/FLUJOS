of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 9 for the three partners reviewed reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements however oios assessed that internal c ontrols of all partners could be improved 10 the final audit certificates covering the 2004 subprojects were not available at the time of the review draft audit reports were availa ble with unqualified audit opinions expressed caritas 11 caritas commingled unhcr funds with other donors funds even though it had not been agreed in the relevant subproject agreements that funds could be deposited in pooled account in addition significant number of loan s were made between unhcr subprojects and caritas own funds complicated system had be established for recording these transactions which did not facilitate the tracking and subsequent repayment of loans oios was pleased to note that the practice of loans to and f rom unhcr subprojects was discontinued in september 2005 following the preaudit recommendat ions nonetheless oios was concerned that caritas calculations of the final loan balanc due to unhcr was incorrect as various errors were noted in the recording of the loans ma king the records not reliable oios recommended that unhcr ensure that all loans made t and from unhcr subprojects are properly recorded and corrected the regional representation carried out financial r eview of caritas s activities and confirmed oios findings corrective measures were taken on the basis of conclusive supporting documentation it wa s reconfirmed that the practice of loans to and from unhcr subprojects has been discontinued nd that appropriate refunding took place 3 12 caritas microcredit activities had very low success rate from loans totalling some us 77000 only us 14000 was repaid and ver few projects were actually implemented by the beneficiaries of the loans cons equently given the poor performance observed this activity was discontinued in 2004 at the time of our review however cash balance of some us 21500 was still kept in carita s bank account for income generation activities the regional representation explained that this iss ue had been discussed at length with the senior regional finance officer and that it was common and wellknown problem in unhcr for which clear solution existed 13 oios takes note of the explanation but do not agree with the adviceinformation provided to the regional representative these fun ds were provided to caritas for income generating activities and as these funds we re not disbursed they should be refunded to unhcr the only issueproblem encountered in the pa st was with funds related to country operations that had revolving fund managed direct ly by unhcr oios recommends that caritas refund to unhcr some us 21500 without an further delay the regional representation subsequently explained that steps we re taken to request caritas to refund the unused balance and that the partner has indica ted its willingness to do so and that the actual refunding would be made within weeks recommendation head2right the unhcr regional representation in benin should nsure that caritas refund to unhcr us 21500 representing th unused balance of income generation funds under local sett lement sub projects rec 01 14 internal controls over warehousing needed to be strengthened the issuance of non food items nfi was initiatedauthorized by carita s using official blank unhcr forms which were not even prenumbered for control purpos instead the form was photocopied and used by caritas storekeeper as and when needed this practice should be discontinued and proper inventory movement control established caritas also needed to introduce the use of contracts for the transportati on of nfis the observed practice was not satisfactory as it was solely based on oral agreeme nts with the transporters the relevant invoices were paid in cash but there was eviden ce of service delivery oios made number of recommendations to address the weaknesses noted the regional representation requested that caritas immediately implement oios recommendations and pointed out that an interim logistician has been hired to follo w up on all warehousing matters for the future contractual documents would be required to transport nfis to ensure that unhcrs interests are protected b organisation charit√© pour d√©veloppem ent int√©gral 15 ocdi made salary loans to its staff on r ecurrent basis using unhcr project funds each of the loans reviewed represented about six mes the monthly gross salary of the beneficiaries with repayment over 12month perio d consequently monthly repayments often represented more than 50 per cent of the staf fs monthly income the next advance was given immediately after full repayment of the prece ding loan this practice was found to be widespread and had been used consistently throughou t 2004 and 2005 further the loans had 4 not been tracked in ocdis accounting system thus l eaving audit trail except for the payslips showing the deduction from the salary th ere was neither an advance ledger sub account nor any other document showing the total mount loaned to staff repayments to date or outstanding loans 16 ocdi did not comply with the social securi ty tax law which required that an amount representing 205 per cent be deducted and paid to the local social security authority oios found that ocdi had instead increased its staff sal aries by an amount equal to the applicable salary tax amount giving staff gross salaries at t he expense of unhcr ocdi explained that the tax was given to those employees who claimed th at they were paying insurance premiums directly to an insurance company oios did not obt ain any evidence of this and pointed out that such an option might not be available given t hat businesses were generally required to directly deduct socialtax contributions and to ma ke the relevant submissions to the local tax authorities the noncompliance with this requireme nt might expose ocdi to heavy penalties oios recommended that this practice be discontinued the partner should be made fully aware that unhcr is not responsible for and w ill not pay any penalties related to non compliance with the local tax law 17 the regional representation explained that letter has been sent to ocdi requesting clarification on the measures taken to address the shortcomings highlighted by oios the regional office subsequently pointed out that it s been informed that actions were taken and that by the end of june 2006 it would physicall verify whether the practice of personal loan was discontinued and outstanding loans accoun ted for b other programme issues 18 oios assessed that the activities of the mergency operation had been successfully managed with an interagency contingency plan prep ared by the regional representation on the basis of early political developments in tog leading role was assigned to each agency in benin in their respective fields of compe tence with unhcr acting as the coordinating agency camps with latrines and bore holes and other essential facilities were established well before the arrival of the first ca seload of refugees in addition with the assistance of local authorities and some implementi ng partners procedures were put in place for registration upon the refugees arrival accord ing to mission report by the chief of ess the overall emergency response of unhcr in benin wa s well managed thanks to an active contingency planning process that resulted in good coordination and proactive management the only shortfall noted pertained to financial obl igations that were not met in the health sector which was under the responsibility the worl d health organization s tarting in 2006 this sector has been assigned to m√©decins sans fron ti√®res msf c supply management procurement 19 in 2004 and 2005 procurement totalled us 450000 oios assessed that the regional representation generally complied with unh cr procurement procedures albeit some improvement was required in the areas of the p rocurement of services for example for the years 2004 and 2005 over us 170000 was paid to travel agent with evidence that the supplier was selected competitively and with w hom contract was signed the 5 regional representation explained that three quotat ions were obtained from travel agents prior to each travel in oios view considering the financial volume i nvolved it would be more cost effective and less cumbersome to select travel company and issue an annual contract than requesting quotations for each travel 20 similarly tenders should have been issued for clearing agent and fuel supplier both of whom had not been competitively selected the current clearing agent was introduced to unhcr by former staff member and has been sup plying services since at least 2003 the fuel supplier had been selected mainly because it was able to provide prepaid fuel coupons and according to the regional representati on had the largest network of fuel outlets in the country there was evidence of any tende r or requests for quotations and the basis of the selection of the fuel supplier was not docum ented in the files 21 the regional representation stated that competiti ve bidding exercise for travel agent and clearing agent has now been conducted with regard to fuel the system has after an internal evaluation exercise signed an ag reement with fuel supplier total on behalf of all agencies present in the country b asset management 22 despite the fact that physical inventory was recently carried out the assettrak system was not uptodate oios found that assettra k data did not take into account significant number of assets in the custody of part ners in benin and in other countries under the responsibility of the regional representation burkina faso and togo for example the system did not include vehicles computers refrige rators and photocopying machines further for those recorded assets the required data entry form was either not always filled out or did not have proper documentation attached to it more over oios noted some data anomalies in the assettrak data such as the assets net book va lue being higher than the acquisition value or of equal value though acquired years back this meant that the depreciation had not been calculated or the value of assets was incorrec tly recorded the regional representation took note of the findings and indicated that updat ing and correctly calculating net book value amounts should be finalized by the end of jul 2006 recommendation head2right the unhcr regional representation in benin should u pdate assettrak to fully reflect those assets in countrie s under its responsibility and ensure that the net book value of assets is correctly calculated rec02 d security and safety 23 in recent security compliance report da ted 24

cycle for the p erformance appraisal reports pars had not been initiated nor had the objectives been est ablished andor discussed with the staff according to the regional representation the main reason for the noncompliance was the emergency situation in togo given the key role th at performance records can play in ensuring fair and transparent comparative reviews nd posting exercises oios recommended that the regional representation immediately agree with staff on work objectives and prepare the midyear reviews the regional representation indicated that the post emergency phase has now allowed it to finalize the pars and that all cases but one have been completed 27 oios noted that expenditure was often cert ified by an administrative assistant with signing authority rather than by the designated certifying officer oios observed this for mip claims unhcr high risk area and for many t ravel authorizations pt8s oios recommended that the regional representation comply with the established delegation of authority chart and ensure that expenditures are c ertified by an officer with delegated authority the regional representation stated that it has take n note of the findings
